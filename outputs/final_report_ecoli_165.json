CNNs are suitable for capturing local patterns within sequences, which is critical for identifying regulatory elements. Specifically, initial layers consist of 1D convolutions with kernel sizes of 5 and 11, stride 1, and ReLU activation to emphasize local feature extraction. Following this, a Transformer encoder with 6 layers, 8 attention heads, and a model dimension of 512 is employed to capture global dependencies and sequence context, leveraging attention mechanisms to focus on relevant regions of the sequence. This hybrid design is chosen based on literature indicating improved performance in biological sequence modeling tasks.",
        "layer_by_layer_design": "The model begins with two convolutional layers: the first with 64 filters of size 5, followed by a second with 128 filters of size 11, both using padding 'same' to maintain input dimensions and ReLU activations. Batch normalization layers are included to stabilize learning. These are followed by a max-pooling layer (pool size 2) to downsample the feature maps. Subsequently, a Transformer encoder processes the pooled features, configured with 6 layers, each having 8 heads and model dimension 512, utilizing multi-head self-attention and feed-forward neural networks with GELU activation. Finally, a global average pooling layer reduces the feature maps to a fixed-size vector, leading to a dense output layer with softmax activation for classification.",
        "parameter_count_estimation": "The total parameter count is approximately 2.5 million, calculated based on the number of filters, kernel sizes, and dense connections in both the convolutional and Transformer components. This estimation balances model capacity and computational efficiency, ensuring sufficient complexity to capture intricate sequence patterns without overfitting.",

Metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R^2) are standard choices for assessing prediction accuracy. Additionally, area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) and Precision-Recall curves can provide insights into the model's ability to distinguish between true regulatory elements and non-elements. Integrating metrics that consider the biological context, such as motif conservation and evolutionary evidence, as referenced by Romanov et al., enhances the evaluation framework by ensuring predictions align with known biological principles.",
        "statistical_testing_design": "The statistical testing design should incorporate both parametric and non-parametric tests to assess model performance. Parametric tests like t-tests can be employed if the data meets normality assumptions, while non-parametric tests like the Wilcoxon signed-rank test offer robustness against violations of these assumptions. Power analysis is essential to determine the sample size needed to detect meaningful differences in performance metrics, thereby minimizing Type II errors. The design should include corrections for multiple comparisons, such as the Bonferroni correction, to control the family-wise error rate.",
        "validation_strategy": "A robust validation strategy is critical for assessing the generalizability of prediction models. Employing a train/validation/test split, where 70% of the data is used for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing, provides a balanced approach. Cross-validation, particularly k-fold cross-validation with k=5 or 10, offers a more comprehensive evaluation by reducing variance associated with data partitioning. External validation, using an independent dataset, is crucial for verifying model performance in real-world scenarios. This approach aligns with the need for robust external validation discussed in the literature on synthetic regulatory element assessment.",
