Set the next_action field to one of the following:\n- \"request_info\": Need more task information from user\n- \"analyze\": Need to call expert agents for initial design\n- \"discuss\": Need to facilitate discussion among expert agents to refine designs\n- \"iterate\": Need more information or iterative optimization (USE THIS if scores < requirements)\n- \"report\": Can generate a final report (ONLY if scores meet strict requirements above)\n- \"end\": Work completed\n\nAdditionally, when you decide to call expert agents for design (next_action = \"analyze\" or \"discuss\" or \"iterate\"), you SHOULD provide a structured task plan for each expert agent.\nReturn it as a JSON object under the key \"agent_task_plans\", with the following structure:\n{\n  \"data_management\": {\n    \"title\": \"...\",\n    \"description\": \"...\",\n    \"task_prompt\": \"A detailed, specific task prompt for the data management expert, explaining exactly what they need to do, what data to focus on, what parameter specifications to design, etc. This should be comprehensive and tailored to the specific task.\",\n  },\n  \"methodology\": {\n    \"title\": \"...\",\n    \"description\": \"...\",\n    \"task_prompt\": \"A detailed, specific task prompt for the methodology expert, explaining exactly what training methodology to design, what loss functions to consider, what optimization strategies to use, etc.\",\n    ...\n  },\n  \"model_architect\": {\n    \"title\": \"...\",\n    \"description\": \"...\",\n    \"task_prompt\": \"A detailed, specific task prompt for the model architect, explaining exactly what architecture to design, what layers to include, what parameters to estimate, etc.\",\n    ...\n  },\n  \"result_analyst\": {\n    \"title\": \"...\",\n    \"description\": \"...\",\n    \"task_prompt\": \"A detailed, specific task prompt for the result analyst, explaining exactly what evaluation metrics to use, what statistical tests to design, what validation strategy to implement, etc.\",\n    ...\n  }\n}\n\nIMPORTANT: The \"task_prompt\" field for each agent should be:\n- Detailed and specific to that agent's role\n- Include concrete requirements and expectations\n- Specify what parameter specifications need to be designed\n- Reference the specific task context and dataset\n- Be tailored to the current iteration and refinement needs\n\nPlease return the decision in JSON format (you can include optional fields as needed):\n{\n    \"reasoning\": \"Your reasoning process\",\n    \"next_action\": \"request_info/analyze/discuss/iterate/report/end\",\n    \"tool_calls\": [\"List of tools to call\"],\n    \"agent_task_plans\": {\n        \"data_management\": { ... },\n        \"methodology\": { ... },\n        \"model_architect\": { ... },\n        \"result_analyst\": { ... }\n    }\n}\n"
