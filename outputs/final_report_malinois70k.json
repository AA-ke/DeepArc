    "Confirm assay strand/orientation invariance before using RC augmentation or RC-consistency loss. If the MPRA library is orientation-fixed (common), disable RC augmentation and instead rely on standard regularization; if orientation-randomized or bidirectional by design, enable RC augmentation at p=0.5 and consider test-time RC ensembling.",
    "Prefer uncertainty-aware learning over hard drops when lfcSE is available: implement inverse-variance sample weights w=1/(lfcSE^2+ε) with caps (e.g., w_max=25) and/or robust loss (Huber). Use filtering only for extreme outliers (e.g., lfcSE > 0.8–1.0) after inspecting retention rates. This aligns with MPRA QC emphasis on standardized metrics and systematic monitoring (as in esMPRA) rather than ad hoc removal.",
    "Run the proposed QC ablations and log outcomes: (A) strict drop if any-task lfcSE>t vs (B) drop only for the labeled target_cell’s lfcSE>t vs (C) no-drop + weighting. Choose the policy that improves held-out performance without collapsing label range or removing >30% of rows.",
    "RC augmentation gatekeeping: treat RC as an experimental factor. Run an explicit ablation (no-RC vs RC) and only keep RC + RC-consistency if it improves validation metrics and does not worsen strand-specific residual structure. If assay orientation is known to be directional, disable RC entirely (or restrict to palindromic/strand-invariant subsets).",
    "Prefer SE-aware loss weighting over aggressive filtering when retention would otherwise drop too much: implement clipped inverse-variance weights w=1/(SE^2+eps), then cap (e.g., w<=25) and optionally warm-start with uniform weights for 1–3 epochs before enabling SE weights. This matches the Data Management expert’s suggestion and reduces data loss.",
    "Multi-task balancing: start with per-task target z-scoring on training split; then either (a) keep equal task weights, or (b) use a stable balancing method (e.g., learned homoscedastic task uncertainty or GradNorm) with caps on weight ratios to avoid one task dominating.",
    "Adopt uncertainty-aware training using provided lfcSE: either (a) SE-weighted Huber/MSE with capped weights w=1/(SE^2+eps), w_max≈25, or (b) learned per-task log-variance weighting; start with a warm-up phase using equal weights to avoid early instability.",
    "Treat RC augmentation as conditional: enable only after confirming strand invariance for this MPRA setup. If enabled, also add RC-consistency regularization (RCCR) to reduce fwd/RC prediction divergence, consistent with published RCCR objectives (rag_search source: “Reverse-Complement Consistency for DNA Language Models”, arXiv 2025).",
    "Add a lightweight global-context module after the convolutional backbone: e.g., 2-layer efficient attention or a short transformer/“macaron” style block to stabilize regression heads and improve long-range aggregation; this aligns with reports that specialized heads/sequence handling can improve expression-value prediction (rag_search source: Proformer, 2024). Keep this module small (e.g., d_model 128, 2 heads) to stay within the target parameter budget.",
    "Resolve MinGap formally and lock the evaluation definition to the dataset’s exact rule. If MinGap is pair-specific, compute pred_gap with the same pair mapping; if it is best-vs-rest, compute predicted margin accordingly, then rerun both gap-correlation and stratified analyses."

    "background": "Goal: Construct a deep learning model to simultaneously predict the cell-type-specific activity of 200bp cis-regulatory elements (CREs) across three human cell lines: K562, HepG2, and SK-N-SH.\nRequirements: The model should be a deep learning model with a shared convolutional backbone (using weight normalization) and a multi-task branched output. Input sequence length is 200bp, converted to 4-channel One-hot. The backbone should consist of multiple Conv1d layers with Weight Norm to identify DNA motifs. The final output must be a 3-dimensional vector (one for each cell line) predicted via independent branched linear layers to capture cell-type-specific regulatory logic.",

  },
  "experimental_design": {
    "1_data_usage_plan": {
      "design_recommendations": "1) Dataset profiling and type confirmation: Using the provided columns ['sequence','target_cell','K562_l2fc','HepG2_l2fc','SKNSH_l2fc','MinGap','K562_lfcSE','HepG2_lfcSE','SKNSH_lfcSE'] and 77,157 rows, this is best characterized as an MPRA-derived multi-output regression dataset where each row is a synthetic/natural 200 bp regulatory sequence with measured activity in three cell lines, reported as log2 fold change (l2fc) with associated standard errors (lfcSE). This implies label noise is heteroskedastic and should be addressed by uncertainty-aware filtering and/or loss weighting; for data management, we prioritize filtering rules that are explicit and reproducible. Sequence length should be validated by computing length for every row and summarizing mean/median/min/max and outlier counts (e.g., count of length != 200). The expected distribution is a delta at 200 bp; if not, the plan defines strict handling: (a) preferred: drop sequences with length != 200 if they are rare (<0.5% of rows), (b) otherwise: trim longer sequences to the central 200 bp and pad shorter sequences with 'N' to 200 and mark them with a QC flag for downstream sensitivity analyses. Because the dataset is large, we also recommend computing duplication rate (exact identical sequences), GC-content distribution (mean/SD and tails), and per-target summary statistics (l2fc mean/SD, percentiles) as part of profiling to guide outlier policies. These recommendations align with community emphasis on robust MPRA QC and variability control (e.g., standardized QC frameworks and outlier identification described in MPRA QC pipelines such as esMPRA and uniform processing standards such as MPRAsnakeflow/MPRAlib from IGVF efforts).\n\n2) QC / cleaning with explicit lfcSE filtering rule: Implement a deterministic filter based on measurement uncertainty using the three standard error columns K562_lfcSE, HepG2_lfcSE, SKNSH_lfcSE with the threshold lfcSE > 0.5. Because ambiguity exists (filter per cell line vs. only the target_cell’s SE), define and document two exact, mutually exclusive rules: Rule A (strict multi-task reliability): DROP a row if ANY of the three SE values exceeds 0.5, i.e., drop if max(K562_lfcSE, HepG2_lfcSE, SKNSH_lfcSE) > 0.5; this ensures all three regression labels for a retained sequence are relatively reliable. Rule B (target-cell-only reliability): DROP a row only if the SE corresponding to target_cell exceeds 0.5; concretely, map target_cell in {K562,HepG2,SKNSH} to the matching *_lfcSE column and drop if that single SE > 0.5, allowing retention if non-target tasks are noisy. Recommendation: prefer Rule A for multi-task training where the model jointly predicts all three activities, because noisy targets in any head can destabilize optimization and bias shared feature learning; Rule B is acceptable if target_cell is used as the primary supervision and other heads are auxiliary/weak. In addition, record the number of rows removed under each rule and the post-filter distributions of l2fc to ensure filtering does not collapse dynamic range; if Rule A removes >30% of data, consider raising threshold to 0.6 or switching to Rule B plus per-task loss weighting by 1/(lfcSE^2 + 1e-6). This approach is consistent with MPRA best-practice emphasis on identifying technical variability sources and filtering out unreliable measurements (as highlighted in MPRA QC/standardization efforts like esMPRA and IGVF MPRA processing standards).\n\n3) Missing/invalid values, sequence sanitization, and N handling: Define invalid sequences as any containing characters outside {A,C,G,T,N} (case-insensitive); immediately drop rows with other IUPAC codes (e.g., R,Y,S,W,K,M) unless you explicitly implement probabilistic mapping for them. For Ns, implement a two-tier policy: if N_fraction = count('N')/length(sequence) > 0.0 (strict) then drop, OR if you want a less aggressive option, drop only if N_fraction > 0.01 (i.e., >2 Ns in 200 bp) and otherwise keep. Recommendation for this large dataset: use N_fraction > 0.0 (drop any N) as the default because you have ample data volume (77k) and Ns introduce ambiguous k-mers that can degrade motif learning; keep the relaxed threshold (1%) as a fallback if too many sequences are removed. If sequences with small N_fraction are kept, encode N as a uniform distribution [0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25] at that position (float32), which preserves expected base frequency without injecting a specific nucleotide. Also drop rows with missing numeric targets/SEs (NaN/Inf) and define explicit range checks: lfcSE must be >0 and <5 (hard sanity bounds), and l2fc should be finite with optional winsorization at the 0.1 and 99.9 percentiles per cell line if extreme outliers are present. Maintain a QC report that logs counts removed by each rule (invalid chars, length mismatch, N filter, lfcSE filter, NaNs) to support reproducibility and auditability.\n\n4) Encoding specification (exact tensor layout and dtype): Use a channel-first one-hot encoding with float32 output tensor shape (B, 4, 200), where B is batch size. Define base-to-channel mapping exactly as: A->[1,0,0,0], C->[0,1,0,0], G->[0,0,1,0], T->[0,0,0,1]; for N (if allowed under the relaxed N policy) use [0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25]. Enforce uppercase transformation and verify post-encoding that each position sums to 1.0 (within float tolerance) for A/C/G/T/N; for dropped invalid bases this check is not needed because they are excluded upstream. Keep a deterministic sequence order (5’->3’) and only apply reverse-complement augmentation explicitly as described later; do not implicitly canonicalize sequences because strand information can matter in some MPRA designs. Store encoded arrays in a memory-efficient format for 77k sequences: either on-the-fly encoding in the DataLoader (CPU) or pre-encode and save as an mmap/NPY/Zarr array; with 77,157*4*200 float32 ≈ 246 MB, pre-encoding is feasible and can improve training throughput. If pre-encoding, also store an index mapping from row_id to original CSV row for traceability.\n\n5) Target construction and normalization (train-only scalers): Treat targets as a 3D regression vector y = [K562_l2fc, HepG2_l2fc, SKNSH_l2fc] per row, regardless of target_cell; use target_cell as auxiliary metadata (see splitting/bias checks) rather than the label. Normalize each target dimension separately using only the training split statistics: for cell line c in {K562,HepG2,SKNSH}, compute mean μ_c and std σ_c on train rows, then transform y_c_norm = (y_c - μ_c) / (σ_c + 1e-8). Save μ and σ in a versioned artifact (e.g., JSON) and apply the same scalers to validation and test; at evaluation time, compute metrics in both normalized space (for stable training curves) and original l2fc space (for interpretability). If you adopt SE-aware weighting instead of hard filtering, define per-target weight w_c = 1/(lfcSE_c^2 + 1e-6) and optionally cap weights at w_max=25 to prevent single observations dominating; this is complementary to normalization and is especially useful if you choose the less strict Rule B. Also check for systematic shifts in l2fc distributions across target_cell values; if strong, consider including target_cell as a categorical covariate input (one-hot of size 3 concatenated to model head) but keep it out of the leakage-safe grouping keys.\n\n6) Data splitting strategy (leakage-safe, deterministic, and stratified where possible): Primary risk is sequence leakage due to duplicate (identical) sequences appearing multiple times; therefore split by groups defined as the exact 'sequence' string after canonical cleaning (uppercase, validated length, no Ns if dropped). Algorithm: (i) create cleaned_sequence, (ii) group rows by cleaned_sequence and assign each group an integer group_id, (iii) shuffle group_ids with a fixed seed (seed=2025), (iv) allocate groups to train/val/test by cumulative group size to achieve 80/10/10 of total rows as closely as possible while keeping groups intact. After the group split, verify that there are zero identical sequences shared across splits (assert disjointness) and report group counts and row counts per split. If you want additional robustness against near-duplicates (1–2 mismatches), optionally cluster sequences by MinHash/LSH or by Hamming distance <=2 within 200 bp, but this is computationally heavier; as a practical default, exact-dedup group splitting is required and sufficient for many MPRA tables. Because 'target_cell' may be imbalanced, add a secondary constraint: during group allocation, approximate stratification by target_cell by tracking per-split target_cell proportions and using a greedy assignment that minimizes deviation from the overall distribution (tolerance ±2%). Keep 'MinGap' out of grouping keys but use it for post-split diagnostics; if MinGap correlates with measurement quality, ensure its distribution is similar across splits.\n\n7) Augmentation policy (lightweight due to large N, optional RC): Since the dataset is large (>10K), prioritize QC and do not use heavy synthetic augmentation that could distort measured activity. Optional reverse-complement (RC) augmentation can be applied with probability p=0.5 during training only: for each sequence in a batch, with Bernoulli(p) replace it with its reverse complement; labels (all three l2fc) remain unchanged because MPRA reporter constructs typically measure sequence function independent of strand orientation in many setups, but you must confirm assay design—therefore treat RC augmentation as optional and evaluate with/without it. If you suspect strand-specific effects (e.g., promoter-directional constructs), set p=0.0 and do not RC augment. If you enable RC, implement it at the one-hot tensor level: reverse the length dimension and swap channels A<->T and C<->G; this is deterministic and avoids string operations. Do not use random base mutations for MPRA regression because it changes the underlying biological function and breaks label validity; similarly, do not use random shuffling except as a negative control dataset for sanity checks.\n\n8) Data loader and throughput specifications: For 4x200 float32 tensors, a batch size of 256 is a strong default on a single modern GPU (e.g., 16–24 GB VRAM); provide candidates {128, 256, 512} and choose the largest that maintains >90% GPU utilization without OOM. Use num_workers=4–8 (Linux) depending on CPU cores, pin_memory=True for CUDA training, persistent_workers=True, and prefetch_factor=2 to reduce input stalls; if pre-encoding to mmap/Zarr, you can reduce CPU overhead and increase batch size. Shuffle training data each epoch (shuffle=True) but keep validation/test deterministic (shuffle=False). For reproducibility, set global seeds (Python, NumPy, PyTorch) to 2025 and enforce deterministic ops where feasible; still record that CuDNN determinism may reduce speed. Finally, maintain a data manifest per split containing row indices, cleaned_sequence hash (e.g., SHA1), and QC flags so that any model run can be traced back exactly.\n\n9) Step-by-step preprocessing pipeline (pseudocode-level clarity with exact parameters): Step 0 Load CSV and assert required columns exist; Step 1 Standardize sequence strings: seq = upper(seq), strip whitespace; Step 2 Validate alphabet: drop if regex '[^ACGTN]'; Step 3 Compute len(seq) and profile distribution; apply length policy: if len!=200 then drop (default) unless outlier_fraction>0.5% then trim/pad to 200 with 'N' and flag; Step 4 Handle Ns: compute N_fraction; default drop if N_fraction>0.0 (alternative drop if >0.01 and map remaining N to uniform encoding); Step 5 Validate numeric columns: drop rows with NaN/Inf in any l2fc or lfcSE; enforce lfcSE in (0,5); Step 6 Apply lfcSE filter with threshold 0.5 using Rule A (default) or Rule B (alternative) and log removals; Step 7 Deduplicate/group: group_id = hash(cleaned_sequence), create group table; Step 8 Group split with seed=2025 into train/val/test 0.8/0.1/0.1 by groups; Step 9 Compute train-only μ_c, σ_c and normalize targets; Step 10 Encode sequences to one-hot float32 (B,4,200); Step 11 Save artifacts: split manifests, scaler JSON, QC report, and optional pre-encoded arrays; Step 12 Train with optional RC augmentation p=0.5 on train only. This pipeline follows the general principle from MPRA community tooling that robust QC, outlier handling, and standardized processing are essential for reproducibility (as emphasized by MPRA QC pipelines like esMPRA and uniform processing/standard formats like MPRAsnakeflow/MPRAlib)."

    "2_method_design": {
      "design_recommendations": "1) Dataset characterization & preprocessing: Assume the dataset is an MPRA-style sequence-to-activity regression dataset because the targets are per-cell-type l2fc (K562/HepG2/SKNSH), which are commonly derived from reporter assays; this implies labels are noisy with occasional outliers and can be heteroscedastic across cell types. If sequence length is fixed (common in MPRA libraries), set input_len=200 bp (adjust to actual; if variable, pad/truncate to 200 with center-crop for longer sequences and N-padding for shorter) and record length distribution; if >95% are identical length, disable variable-length masking for simplicity. Treat dataset size as medium-to-large (>10k is common for MPRA), so prioritize strict QC: remove sequences with >5% ambiguous bases (N), remove duplicated sequences keeping the median label per cell type, and winsorize extreme l2fc values at the 0.5th/99.5th percentiles per task to reduce leverage points while keeping ranking. Standardize labels per task using training-set mean/std (z-score) so multi-task losses are on comparable scale; at inference, invert standardization to report l2fc. Use a leakage-safe split: sequence-level unique split (no exact duplicates across train/val/test), optionally family-aware split by k-mer MinHash clustering to reduce near-duplicate leakage; keep val=10%, test=10%. Implement batch sampling uniformly over sequences; do not stratify by label unless label distribution is extremely skewed.\n\n2) Model architecture (shared backbone + 3 heads): Use one-hot DNA encoding (A,C,G,T plus optional N channel) with shape [B, L, 4] (or 5), and a CNN-residual backbone for strong inductive bias on motifs and motif syntax. Backbone example (exact): Conv1D(4->256, kernel=15, stride=1, padding=same) + BatchNorm(momentum=0.9, eps=1e-5) + GELU + Dropout(p=0.10); then 6 residual blocks each: Conv1D(256->256, k=7) + BN + GELU + Dropout(0.10) + Conv1D(256->256, k=7) + BN + GELU with residual connection; after blocks, DilatedConv stack: 3 layers Conv1D(256->256, k=3, dilation=2/4/8) each with BN+GELU+Dropout(0.10) to extend receptive field without huge depth. Pooling: attention pooling or global average pooling; to keep it simple and stable, use GlobalAveragePooling over length producing 256-d vector. Heads: three independent MLP heads: Linear(256->128) + GELU + Dropout(0.20) + Linear(128->1) for each task; initialize with Xavier uniform (gain=1.0) and zero bias. Apply weight normalization (as required) to all Conv1D and Linear layers; in PyTorch, use torch.nn.utils.weight_norm at module construction and optionally remove at inference. This design matches the “shared trunk + multiple expression heads” pattern seen in sequence-to-expression models (e.g., Proformer uses multiple heads and strand embedding ideas), while retaining CNN interpretability and stable training.\n\n3) Loss function (exact choice + weighting + masking): Use Huber loss (a robust alternative to MSE) because MPRA l2fc labels often contain outliers and heavy-tailed noise; set delta=1.0 in standardized label units. Reduction: compute per-sample per-task Huber, then reduce by mean over batch and tasks after weighting (i.e., ‘none’ then manual reduction). Per-task weights: start equal weights w=[1.0,1.0,1.0] for the first 5 epochs to avoid early collapse; then switch to inverse-variance weights estimated from training residual EMA to balance tasks (w_t = 1/(sigma_t^2 + 1e-4), normalized so sum(w)=3.0). Missing-task masking: assume all present, but implement a mask tensor m in {0,1}^3 per sample; final loss = sum_t w_t * m_t * huber(yhat_t,y_t) / (sum_t w_t*m_t + 1e-8) so training remains correct if any labels are absent in future data. Add RC-consistency regularization term (see augmentation/regularization): L_total = L_regression + lambda_rccr * mean_t |yhat_fwd_t - yhat_rc_t| with lambda_rccr=0.05 (after standardization), motivated by the RCCR idea that explicitly penalizing RC prediction divergence improves reliability on genomic tasks (Reverse-Complement Consistency for DNA Language Models, arXiv 2025). If you later detect strong heteroscedasticity per-task (e.g., HepG2 variance far higher), a Gaussian NLL head can be ablated, but Huber is the default for stability and simplicity.\n\n4) Optimization + LR schedule (exact hyperparameters): Use AdamW (not SGD) for faster convergence on sequence models with BatchNorm/weight norm and for robustness to gradient scale; set lr=3e-4, betas=(0.9,0.98), eps=1e-8, weight_decay=0.05. Apply weight decay to all weights except biases, BatchNorm parameters, and weight-norm “g” scalars (exclude via parameter groups). Gradient clipping: clip global norm at 1.0 (gradient_clip_norm=1.0) to prevent rare batch spikes from destabilizing training (common with noisy l2fc). LR schedule: cosine decay with linear warmup; warmup_epochs=5 (or warmup_steps = 5 * steps_per_epoch), start_lr=3e-6, peak_lr=3e-4, min_lr=3e-6, then cosine down to min_lr by the final epoch. Use batch_size=256 if GPU memory permits for stable BatchNorm; if constrained, use batch_size=128 and set BN to sync-bn or switch to GroupNorm(32 groups). Use mixed precision (fp16/bf16) with dynamic loss scaling; keep gradient clip after unscale.\n\n5) Regularization (dropout, input dropout, weight norm, mixup rationale): Backbone dropout p=0.10 in conv/residual layers; head dropout p=0.20 because heads overfit more easily than shared features. Input dropout (random base masking): with probability p_mask=0.02 per position, replace the one-hot base with all-zeros (or an explicit N channel if used); this simulates sequencing/library noise and discourages reliance on single nucleotide positions. Do not use label smoothing because this is regression and smoothing would bias continuous targets; instead, rely on Huber and winsorization/standardization for robustness. Weight norm: apply to every Conv1D and Linear (excluding BN) to stabilize training dynamics; monitor for training slowdowns and consider removing weight norm after convergence if needed. Mixup: do not apply raw-sequence mixup at one-hot level because convex combinations of bases are not biologically valid sequences; if needed as an ablation, restrict mixup to the pooled embedding vector (post-backbone) with alpha=0.2 and mix only within-batch while also mixing labels, but treat as optional because it can blur motif syntax. Add L2 on outputs is not needed; instead, use early stopping and RC regularization.\n\n6) Data augmentation + biological prior integration (motifs/PWMs and RC): Reverse-complement augmentation: with probability 0.5, replace input with its RC during training; at evaluation, optionally average predictions of forward and RC for robustness (test-time augmentation). Add explicit RC-consistency regularization (lambda_rccr=0.05) by computing predictions on both forward and RC in the same batch and penalizing their absolute difference; this is directly inspired by RCCR which targets inconsistent forward/RC predictions in DNA models (arXiv 2025). Small random shift augmentation: if sequences represent a window around a central element, allow shift in [-3,+3] bp with circular padding disabled (pad with N) to reflect uncertainty in exact motif alignment; set shift_prob=0.5. Motif prior: compute PWM scan features (e.g., max log-odds score per TF motif from a curated motif set relevant to K562/HepG2/SKNSH, such as ETS/GATA for hematopoietic contexts, HNF4A/CEBPA for HepG2 liver-like, and neural TFs for SKNSH) using a fixed library; concatenate a low-dim motif feature vector (e.g., 64 motifs) to the pooled 256-d backbone embedding, giving 320-d to each head. Regularize motif branch by Dropout(0.30) on motif features to prevent the model from ignoring sequence and overfitting motif counts. This “feature fusion” keeps the model biologically grounded and improves interpretability; it is also compatible with multi-task learning as in multi-head designs (e.g., Proformer highlights multi-head strategies and strand handling).\n\n7) Training length, early stopping, validation metrics (including specificity/MinGap): Train for max_epochs=80 with early stopping on a single scalar: mean Pearson correlation across the three tasks on the validation set (computed on de-standardized predictions), because Pearson aligns with ranking/relative effect accuracy often desired in regulatory activity prediction. Early stopping parameters: patience=12 epochs, min_delta=0.002 (absolute improvement in mean Pearson), and require at least min_epochs=20 before stopping to avoid premature termination during warmup/cosine transition. Track additional metrics: per-task Pearson, Spearman, RMSE, and calibration of residuals; log each epoch. Specificity validation: compute “MinGap” per sample as gap between top predicted cell-type l2fc and second-best (or between target and mean of others if target label known); then report mean MinGap and fraction of samples with correct top-cell-type (if you have a designated “intended” cell type for each sequence). Use MinGap only for monitoring/model selection tie-breaker: if mean Pearson is within 0.001 of best, select the checkpoint with higher mean MinGap to favor specificity. For robustness, also compute Pearson on RC-averaged predictions (fwd/rc mean) and ensure the drop from fwd-only is <0.01; large gaps indicate strand inconsistency issues.\n\n8) Multi-task handling, balancing, and runnable-like configuration: Optimize weighted-sum loss (not average of independent optimizers) using the dynamic inverse-variance weighting after epoch 5; additionally cap any task weight to at most 2.0x the mean weight to prevent one task from dominating (w_t = min(w_t, 2.0 * mean(w))). If one task’s gradients dominate (detect via per-task gradient norms on the last shared layer), enable GradNorm-style balancing as an optional ablation: update weights every 50 steps to equalize relative training rates, but default to inverse-variance because it is simple and usually effective. Reproducibility: set seeds for Python/NumPy/PyTorch to 1337, enable deterministic flags (torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic=True, benchmark=False), and log git commit + dataset hash + exact config. Ablation plan: (A1) backbone depth {4,6,8 residual blocks} with fixed kernels; (A2) kernel sizes: first conv k in {11,15,21} and residual k in {5,7}; (A3) remove dilated conv stack; (A4) RC augmentation off vs on; (A5) RC augmentation on but RCCR lambda_rccr in {0.0,0.02,0.05,0.1}; (A6) motif feature fusion off vs on; evaluate all by mean Pearson and mean MinGap.

      "design_recommendations": "Dataset and task characterization: With N=77,157 labeled sequences of fixed length 200 bp and one-hot encoding (4 channels), this is a large dataset (>10K) suitable for a moderate CNN with residual/dilated blocks and multi-task heads, targeting ~0.5–5M parameters to balance expressiveness and generalization. The dataset type is not explicitly stated, but the setup (200 bp one-hot, 3 outputs) is consistent with MPRA-like regression, STARR-seq activity prediction, or multi-task epigenomic signal prediction; therefore, preprocessing should include strict deduplication, train/val/test splitting by genomic region (or chromosome holdout) to avoid leakage, and label normalization (z-score per task for regression, or log1p transform if count-like). Because length is fixed at 200, no padding/truncation is needed; however, quality control should remove sequences with ambiguous bases (N) or map them to uniform probabilities (recommended: drop if >1% ambiguous, else replace with all-zero and track a mask). For large datasets, favor cleaning/filtering over heavy augmentation; use light augmentation only if biologically plausible (reverse-complement augmentation with probability 0.5, and random 0–5 bp shift if the assay is shift-invariant, implemented by circular or padded shift). Model selection rationale: choose a shared WeightNorm CNN backbone because it is efficient on 200 bp inputs, naturally learns motif detectors, and supports multi-task learning; multi-scale first-layer kernels (7/11/15) act as motif scanners at different widths while downstream dilated residual blocks capture spacing/interactions. The retrieved literature emphasizes interpretability through convolutional filters and in silico mutagenesis (“un-box” models using convolutional filters, attention maps, and in silico mutagenesis; Valeri et al., 2020, PMC), motivating explicit interpretability hooks in the experimental plan.\n\nExact architecture (layer-by-layer, with dimensions): Input X is (B,4,200). Stage A (multi-scale motif stem, parallel branches; all Conv1d use torch.nn.utils.weight_norm): Branch A1: WN-Conv1d(4->64, k=7, s=1, p=3), LeakyReLU(negative_slope=0.1), Dropout(p=0.10). Branch A2: WN-Conv1d(4->64, k=11, s=1, p=5), LeakyReLU(0.1), Dropout(0.10). Branch A3: WN-Conv1d(4->64, k=15, s=1, p=7), LeakyReLU(0.1), Dropout(0.10). Concatenate along channels: (B,192,200). Fuse + downsample: WN-Conv1d(192->256, k=1, s=1, p=0), LeakyReLU(0.1), then MaxPool1d(kernel=2, stride=2) giving (B,256,100). Stage B (residual blocks, same-length within block): Block B1 (no dilation): Main path: WN-Conv1d(256->256, k=3, s=1, p=1), LeakyReLU(0.1), Dropout(0.15), then WN-Conv1d(256->256, k=3, s=1, p=1); Residual add (identity) then LeakyReLU(0.1) output (B,256,100). Block B2 (dilation=2): WN-Conv1d(256->256, k=3, s=1, p=2, dilation=2), LeakyReLU(0.1), Dropout(0.15), WN-Conv1d(256->256, k=3, s=1, p=2, dilation=2), residual add, LeakyReLU -> (B,256,100). Block B3 (dilation=4): WN-Conv1d(256->256, k=3, s=1, p=4, dilation=4), LeakyReLU(0.1), Dropout(0.15), WN-Conv1d(256->256, k=3, s=1, p=4, dilation=4), residual add, LeakyReLU -> (B,256,100). Stage C (channel expansion + second downsample): WN-Conv1d(256->384, k=3, s=1, p=1), LeakyReLU(0.1), then MaxPool1d(k=2,s=2) -> (B,384,50). Stage D (residual blocks at 50 positions): Block D1 (no dilation): WN-Conv1d(384->384, k=3, s=1, p=1), LeakyReLU(0.1), Dropout(0.20), WN-Conv1d(384->384, k=3, s=1, p=1), residual add, LeakyReLU -> (B,384,50). Block D2 (dilation=2): WN-Conv1d(384->384, k=3, s=1, p=2, dilation=2), LeakyReLU(0.1), Dropout(0.20), WN-Conv1d(384->384, k=3, s=1, p=2, dilation=2), residual add, LeakyReLU -> (B,384,50). Backbone output pooling: compute GlobalAvgPool1d over length (50) -> (B,384) and GlobalMaxPool1d over length (50) -> (B,384), then concatenate -> backbone feature vector h of size (B,768). This pooling choice preserves both “presence” (max) and “overall activity” (avg), and yields a fixed 768-dim representation for all tasks.\n\nMulti-scale motif capture specifics (required): The explicit parallel conv stem uses kernels 7/11/15 to learn motif detectors of different effective lengths; because padding is (k-1)/2, each branch preserves length 200, enabling clean concatenation. After concatenation, a 1x1 convolution fuses across scales into 256 channels, letting the model learn weighted combinations of motif detectors and reduce dimensionality before deeper processing. Long-range dependencies are modeled by the dilated residual blocks (dilation 2 and 4 at length 100, then dilation 2 at length 50), increasing receptive field without excessive pooling; for example, at length 100, two stacked k=3 dilated convs with dilation=4 expand the receptive field substantially while preserving resolution. Residual connections ensure stable gradient flow for a deeper backbone and mitigate performance degradation as depth increases. If an ablation is desired, swap the parallel branches for a sequential dilated stack (dilations 1/2/4/8) while keeping parameter count similar; however, the parallel design typically improves motif-width coverage on short sequences. This design choice is consistent with common regulatory CNN motif-learning patterns and supports downstream interpretability by aligning first-layer filters with motif-like patterns (a practice commonly paired with in silico mutagenesis in interpretability workflows, as described in the retrieved “un-boxing” literature).\n\nHeads (three independent outputs) and exact dimensions: Shared feature h is (B,768). Head1 MLP: Linear(768->256), LeakyReLU(0.1), Dropout(p=0.30), Linear(256->64), LeakyReLU(0.1), Dropout(p=0.20), Linear(64->1). Head2 is identical but with independent parameters, producing y2 (B,1). Head3 is identical, producing y3 (B,1). Final output is torch.cat([y1,y2,y3], dim=1) -> (B,3) or return a tuple of three scalars depending on training loop preference. If tasks have different scales/noise, optionally add per-head LayerNorm(768) before the first Linear to stabilize, but keep it off by default to minimize moving parts alongside WeightNorm. For classification tasks (if applicable), apply per-head Sigmoid for binary or softmax for multi-class; for regression, output is linear and use MSE/Huber. To encourage shared representation but avoid negative transfer, the heads are moderately deep yet small; dropout is higher in heads (0.30) than backbone (0.10–0.20) to regularize task-specific fitting.\n\nInitialization, normalization, and training hyperparameters: All Conv1d and Linear layers use Kaiming/He initialization suited for LeakyReLU: torch.nn.init.kaiming_normal_(weight, a=0.1, mode='fan_out', nonlinearity='leaky_relu'); biases initialized to 0.0. WeightNorm is applied as torch.nn.utils.weight_norm(conv_layer) (and optionally on Linear layers in heads if desired, but keep Linear without WN initially for simplicity); when using WeightNorm, still initialize the underlying weight_v with Kaiming. BatchNorm is optional; if included, use BatchNorm1d with momentum=0.1 and eps=1e-5 after conv and before activation, but given explicit WeightNorm, the default recommendation is to omit BN to reduce interaction effects and keep inference simple. Optimizer: AdamW with lr=1e-3, betas=(0.9,0.999), weight_decay=1e-4; gradient clipping at 1.0 to stabilize multi-task training. Training schedule: cosine decay with 5% warmup steps (e.g., warmup for first 1–2 epochs), total 30–50 epochs with early stopping patience=6 on mean validation metric across tasks. Batch size suggestion: 256 if GPU memory allows (input is small), else 128; mixed precision (AMP) recommended for speed. Loss: if regression, per-task Huber(delta=1.0) or MSE; combine as weighted sum with weights inversely proportional to task variance (or use uncertainty weighting), and track Pearson/Spearman per task.\n\nParameter count estimate, target rationale, and compute efficiency: The design targets ~1.8–2.2M parameters (within the requested 0.5–5M). Rough breakdown: multi-scale stem convs (4->64 with k=7/11/15) contribute ~1.8k+2.8k+3.9k weights; fuse 1x1 (192->256) adds ~49k; residual stacks dominate (multiple 256->256 k=3 and 384->384 k=3 convs) contributing on the order of ~1.6–1.9M total; heads add ~0.66M (each head ~0.22M for 768->256->64->1). This parameter budget is appropriate for 77k samples because it provides sufficient capacity to learn motif combinations and task-shared features while remaining small enough to train quickly and limit overfitting risk compared with very large transformers. Computationally, all operations are 1D convolutions over max length 200 (then 100/50), making FLOPs modest; pooling reduces length early, and dilation increases receptive field without increasing length or parameters. WeightNorm adds negligible overhead and often improves optimization stability for CNNs, particularly when BN is omitted. For deployment, the model is a single backbone pass plus three small MLP heads; latency is low, and batch inference is efficient.\n\nInterpretability hooks and exact procedures (saliency, IG, in-silico mutagenesis, motif extraction): For gradient saliency, enable requires_grad on input one-hot tensor X, run forward to get y_task (choose one head or a weighted sum), then compute grads = torch.autograd.grad(y_task.sum(), X)[0], producing (B,4,200) attributions; aggregate to per-position importance via abs(grads).sum(dim=1) or grads*X (gradient×input) summed over channels. For Integrated Gradients, use baseline X0 = all-zeros (or GC-matched random baseline), choose steps m=64, compute IG = (X-X0) * (1/m) * sum_{i=1..m} grad(f(X0 + i/m*(X-X0))) across steps; return (B,4,200) attribution maps per task. For in-silico mutagenesis, for each position p, mutate within a window size W=11 (centered at p; clamp at edges) by flipping the one-hot base to each alternative base (3 alternatives per position), recompute output delta for each mutation, and store max |delta|; this yields a (200,) sensitivity profile and a 4x200 mutation effect map. Motif extraction: take top-K (e.g., K=5000) highest-saliency windows of length 15 from correctly predicted/high-confidence sequences, align them by peak position, and compute PWM by averaging one-hot in aligned windows; optionally also inspect first-layer convolutional filters by converting weight tensors to sequence logos. Provide hooks in code by exposing (a) the stem branch conv outputs (before pooling) and (b) the input gradients; register_forward_hook on stem convs and register_full_backward_hook for gradient capture. This aligns with the retrieved interpretability emphasis on “un-boxing” models via convolutional filters and in silico mutagenesis (Valeri et al., 2020, PMC) and complements regulatory genomics practice where motif-like patterns are derived from first-layer filters plus attribution maps.\n\nRequired architecture table and PyTorch skeleton (unambiguous, minimal but precise): The architecture table should list each layer with input/output shapes: (1) Input (B,4,200). (2) Branch7: WN-Conv1d(4,64,7,1,3)->(B,64,200), LReLU(0.1), Dropout0.10. (3) Branch11: WN-Conv1d(4,64,11,1,5)->(B,64,200), LReLU, Dropout0.10. (4) Branch15: WN-Conv1d(4,64,15,1,7)->(B,64,200), LReLU, Dropout0.10. (5) Concat ->(B,192,200). (6) Fuse: WN-Conv1d(192,256,1,1,0)->(B,256,200), LReLU. (7) MaxPool1d(2,2)->(B,256,100).

(13) ResBlock384 d=1 ->(B,384,50). (14) ResBlock384 d=2 ->(B,384,50). (15) GAP->(B,384), GMP->(B,384), Concat->(B,768). (16) Head t in {1,2,3}: Linear 768->256, LReLU, Dropout0.30; Linear 256->64, LReLU, Dropout0.20; Linear 64->1. PyTorch skeleton: define class SharedBackbone(nn.Module) with stem convs wrapped by weight_norm, forward returns h (B,768) and optionally intermediates; define class MultiTaskModel(nn.Module) with backbone + three nn.Sequential heads; forward returns torch.cat outputs. Ensure Conv1d layers are created then wrapped: conv = nn.Conv1d(...); conv = torch.nn.utils.weight_norm(conv). Residual block skeleton: two WN-Conv1d layers, dropout between, add identity, final activation; keep channels constant to avoid projection shortcuts in this baseline (add 1x1 projection only if channels change)."

    "4_result_summary": {
      "design_recommendations": "1) Dataset characteristics and evaluation unit definition: Treat each sequence/regulatory element as the sampling unit, with a vector of continuous targets across K cell lines (multi-output regression), and ensure that all metrics and bootstrap resamples operate at the element level to preserve within-element cross-cell correlation structure. Before any metric computation, summarize target distributions per cell line (mean, SD, skew, % near-zero), and summarize lfcSE (if present) per cell line (median, IQR) to anticipate heteroscedastic errors; use these summaries to justify stratified diagnostics (error vs lfcSE bins). If the dataset includes replicated measurements per element, aggregate replicates into a single target per cell line using inverse-variance weighting w=1/(lfcSE^2) when lfcSE is available; otherwise use the arithmetic mean, and carry forward an aggregated uncertainty estimate (e.g., sqrt(1/sum(w))). Define the held-out test set at the element level with no overlap in sequence identity between splits; if sequences are highly similar (e.g., tiled variants), split by group/cluster to avoid leakage, consistent with evaluation cautions in CRM assessment literature (Su et al., 2010, PMC). If there are distinct assay types or libraries, treat them as strata and enforce stratified splitting to maintain comparable distributions across train/val/test, reflecting that prediction accuracy varies systematically by technique (Nowling et al., 2023, PMC). 2) Primary metric suite and exact computation specs: Primary endpoint is Pearson correlation r computed separately for each cell line c on the held-out test set of N elements: r_c = cov(y_c, yhat_c) / (sd(y_c)*sd(yhat_c)), where y_c and yhat_c are length-N vectors of de-standardized true and predicted values for that cell line. De-standardization rule (if training used z-scoring per cell line): yhat_c,orig = yhat_c,std * sigma_c,train + mu_c,train and y_c,orig = y_c,std * sigma_c,train + mu_c,train, using mu/sigma computed on training targets only to avoid leakage; Pearson is computed on orig scale, and ties to reporting in many sequence-to-function regression tasks where correlation is favored for scale-invariant performance (Nowling et al., 2023, PMC). Also report Spearman rho per cell line (rank correlation, computed on orig scale, with average ranks for ties), plus MSE_c = mean((y_c,orig - yhat_c,orig)^2) and MAE_c = mean(|y_c,orig - yhat_c,orig|). Report macro-averaged mean Pearson across tasks: r_mean = (1/K) * sum_c r_c; additionally report a sample-size-weighted mean Pearson r_wt = sum_c (N_c * r_c)/sum_c N_c if missingness differs by cell line. For completeness, report a “micro-Pearson” computed by concatenating all cell line targets/predictions into a single vector (after de-standardization) only as a secondary summary, because it can be dominated by high-variance cell lines; macro-averaging is the default selection criterion. Thresholds for contextual interpretation: r_c > 0.60 is labeled “good”, 0.40–0.60 “moderate”, 0.20–0.40 “weak”, and <0.20 “poor”, with the caveat that achievable r depends on assay noise and technique (Nowling et al., 2023, PMC). 3) Bootstrap confidence intervals (per task) with parameterization: For each cell line c, compute 95% CIs for Pearson, Spearman, MSE, and MAE using nonparametric bootstrap with B=1000 resamples of the test elements. Resampling procedure: sample N indices with replacement from {1..N}; for each b, compute metric m_c^(b) on the resampled pairs (y_c,orig[i_b], yhat_c,orig[i_b]); then CI is the percentile interval [q_0.025, q_0.975] of {m_c^(b)}. Use the same bootstrap indices across models when comparing ablations (paired bootstrap) to reduce variance and enforce pairing, and use a fixed random seed (e.g., seed=2025) for reproducibility in reporting. For Pearson specifically, if bootstrap distribution is highly skewed or near ±1, optionally compute CI on Fisher z space: z = atanh(r), bootstrap z, then transform back with tanh; report which method is used, defaulting to percentile on r for simplicity and Fisher-z for edge cases. Also compute CI for r_mean via bootstrap by computing r_c^(b) for all c on the same resample and then averaging to r_mean^(b); CI is percentiles of {r_mean^(b)}. Report bootstrap failure rates (e.g., sd(yhat)=0 in a resample) and handle by skipping those draws; if >1% draws fail for a task, flag it as an instability diagnostic. 4) MinGap-based specificity validation (exact use of MinGap column): Interpret MinGap_i as a label-derived specificity proxy per element i (larger MinGap indicates stronger separation between a “preferred” and “non-preferred” cell context, or generally higher specificity). First define predicted specificity per element using predicted cell-type contrasts: for element i with predictions across K cell lines, let pred_gap_i = max_c(yhat_i,c,orig) - secondmax_c(yhat_i,c,orig) (top-1 minus top-2 predicted activity); optionally also compute pred_range_i = max_c(yhat_i,c,orig) - min_c(yhat_i,c,orig) as a broader contrast. Correlation analysis: compute Spearman correlation between MinGap and pred_gap across test elements: rho_gap = Spearman(MinGap, pred_gap); bootstrap CI with B=1000 resamples of elements, reporting 95% CI and p-value via bootstrap percentile or permutation (10,000 permutations recommended if feasible) for robustness. Stratified performance: split test elements into Q=5 quantiles (quintiles) by MinGap (Q1 lowest specificity to Q5 highest) using cutpoints on the test set only; within each quantile q, compute per-cell-line Pearson r_c,q and macro-mean r_mean,q, then test monotonic trend across quantiles using Spearman correlation between quantile index (1..5) and r_mean,q (or use Jonckheere–Terpstra if implementing a formal ordered alternative). Additionally, compute “specificity classification consistency” by checking whether argmax_c(yhat_i,c,orig) matches argmax_c(y_i,c,orig) (winner-takes-all cell line) and report accuracy per MinGap quantile; expectation is higher accuracy in higher MinGap bins if MinGap encodes clearer cell preference. Report effect sizes: delta_r = r_mean,Q5 - r_mean,Q1 and its bootstrap CI to quantify how much specificity strength changes predictability. This aligns with broader regulatory element evaluation themes that emphasize cell-type-specific performance stratification (e.g., motif-based prediction varies across cell contexts in Cornejo-Páramo et al., 2025, PMC). 5) Model selection and early stopping (validation metric and parameters): Select the checkpoint that maximizes mean validation Pearson across cell lines (macro-average) computed on de-standardized values, denoted r_mean,val, evaluated once per epoch. Early stopping rule: patience=10 epochs, min_delta=0.002 in r_mean,val (i.e., require at least +0.002 improvement to reset patience), with a maximum of 200 epochs; store the best checkpoint by r_mean,val and break training after patience is exhausted. If validation set is small or noisy, smooth r_mean,val with an exponential moving average (EMA) with decay=0.6 for early-stopping decisions while still reporting raw values; explicitly state which is used for stopping versus reporting. Tie-breakers: if two checkpoints have r_mean,val within 0.001, choose the one with lower val MSE (macro-averaged) to prefer better absolute calibration. Guard against overfitting to a single cell line by also requiring that at least 70% of cell lines have non-decreasing Pearson relative to the previous best checkpoint (a stability constraint); if violated, flag and optionally use a multi-objective rank (maximize r_mean,val and minimize variance of r_c,val across cell lines). This selection design is consistent with correlation-centric reporting in regulatory element prediction comparisons, where per-context performance can differ materially (Nowling et al., 2023, PMC). 6) Statistical comparisons for ablations (paired tests, Fisher z, multiple testing): For each ablation A vs baseline B, compute paired differences in Pearson per cell line on the same test set: d_c = r_c(B) - r_c(A), and report d_c with 95% paired bootstrap CI using the shared bootstrap indices across models (B=1000). For a global comparison across cell lines, compute d_mean = (1/K) * sum_c d_c and its bootstrap CI; declare significance if the Holm–Bonferroni-adjusted p-value < 0.05. P-values from paired bootstrap: p = 2*min(P(d_mean^(b) <= 0), P(d_mean^(b) >= 0)) using the bootstrap distribution of d_mean^(b) (centered at 0), with the same approach optionally applied per cell line. As an alternative or confirmation for Pearson differences per cell line, apply Fisher z-transform: z = atanh(r), standard error approx se = 1/sqrt(N-3); test statistic t = (z_B - z_A)/sqrt(2*se^2) if correlations are treated as independent; however, because predictions are paired on the same y, prefer paired bootstrap as the primary test and use Fisher-z only as a sensitivity analysis. Correct for multiple ablations and/or multiple cell lines using Holm–Bonferroni (family defined as all hypothesis tests reported in the main table; alpha=0.05). Report both adjusted and unadjusted p-values, and emphasize effect sizes (delta Pearson, delta MSE) over p-values to avoid overinterpretation, consistent with best practice in method comparison studies (Su et al., 2010, PMC). 7) Diagnostics and plots (required panels and parameter settings): Per-cell-type scatter plots: for each cell line, plot y_orig vs yhat_orig on test with an overlaid y=x line; annotate r, rho, MAE, and n, and set axis limits to [p1, p99] percentiles to reduce outlier domination (keep outliers plotted with transparency alpha=0.2). Calibration for regression: bin predictions into M=10 equal-frequency bins per cell line, compute mean(yhat) and mean(y) per bin, plot mean(y) vs mean(yhat) with error bars (±1 SE via bootstrap within-bin) and report calibration slope/intercept from a linear fit y = a + b*yhat; “good” calibration is b in [0.9, 1.1] and |a| < 0.1*sd(y). Residual analysis: compute residual e_i,c = y_i,c,orig - yhat_i,c,orig; plot residual histograms (50 bins), Q–Q plots, and residual vs prediction to inspect heteroscedasticity; flag if Breusch–Pagan p<0.01 (optional) or if residual variance increases >2x from lowest to highest prediction decile. Error vs lfcSE bins: within each cell line, bin elements by lfcSE into 5 quantiles and compute MAE and Pearson per bin; expectation is worse error at higher lfcSE, and deviations (e.g., flat or inverted trend) can indicate model mis-specification or label noise handling issues. Also include “influence/outlier” diagnostics: report the top 1% absolute residual elements and whether they cluster by sequence family or extreme MinGap, to guide biological follow-up. These plots support interpretation of why correlations differ across contexts and are commonly used in sequence-to-function model evaluation beyond single summary metrics (Nowling et al., 2023, PMC). 8) Reporting template (tables, figures, and acceptance thresholds): Main Table 1 (Test performance per cell line): columns = cell_line, N_test, Pearson r (95% CI), Spearman rho (95% CI), MSE (95% CI), MAE (95% CI); add a final row with macro-mean across cell lines with bootstrap CI. Main Table 2 (Ablation deltas): for each ablation, report delta r_mean (95% CI), adjusted p-value (Holm), and per-cell-line delta r_c (optionally in supplement). Table 3 (MinGap specificity): report rho(MinGap, pred_gap) with CI, r_mean per MinGap quintile with CI, and delta_r (Q5-Q1) with CI; include winner-cell accuracy per quintile if applicable. Figure set: Fig 1 per-cell-type scatter grid (K panels), Fig 2 calibration curves (K panels or representative), Fig 3 residual diagnostics (aggregate + per cell line), Fig 4 MinGap stratification curves and pred_gap vs MinGap scatter with smooth (LOESS span=0.75). Predefine “good performance” as: (i) r_mean,test >= 0.60 with lower CI bound >= 0.50, (ii) at least 70% of cell lines have r_c >= 0.50, and (iii) positive specificity association rho_gap >= 0.30 with CI excluding 0; these are contextual thresholds and should be interpreted relative to assay noise and baseline models. Provide a concise model card appendix listing data split IDs, target scaling parameters (mu/sigma), bootstrap seed, and exact metric definitions to ensure reproducibility, reflecting reproducibility emphasis in method assessments (Su et al., 2010, PMC)."

      "design_summary": "This dataset is an MPRA-style cis-regulatory element (CRE) activity dataset structured for 3-task regression (K562/HepG2/SKNSH log2 fold-change outcomes) with per-row uncertainty estimates (lfcSE) and metadata columns (target_cell, MinGap). With 77,157 rows, it is a large dataset (>10K), so the plan prioritizes aggressive QC/cleaning, uncertainty-based filtering, deduplication, and leakage-safe splits rather than heavy augmentation. The primary input is a fixed-length DNA sequence expected to be 200 bp; the plan specifies explicit checks for length distribution and deterministic handling of any deviations (trim/pad policy or exclusion). Targets are treated as continuous regression labels per cell line, with normalization (z-scoring) computed only on the training split and stored for reproducibility. Splitting is designed to avoid sequence leakage by grouping identical sequences and then splitting groups into train/val/test with fixed seed, while retaining representative distributions of target_cell and l2fc. Optional reverse-complement augmentation is included with a controlled probability to improve invariance without materially changing dataset statistics, and data loader parameters are provided for efficient throughput on this scale.",
      "implementation_plan": {
        "design_recommendations": "1) Dataset profiling and type confirmation: Using the provided columns ['sequence','target_cell','K562_l2fc','HepG2_l2fc','SKNSH_l2fc','MinGap','K562_lfcSE','HepG2_lfcSE','SKNSH_lfcSE'] and 77,157 rows, this is best characterized as an MPRA-derived multi-output regression dataset where each row is a synthetic/natural 200 bp regulatory sequence with measured activity in three cell lines, reported as log2 fold change (l2fc) with associated standard errors (lfcSE). This implies label noise is heteroskedastic and should be addressed by uncertainty-aware filtering and/or loss weighting; for data management, we prioritize filtering rules that are explicit and reproducible. Sequence length should be validated by computing length for every row and summarizing mean/median/min/max and outlier counts (e.g., count of length != 200). The expected distribution is a delta at 200 bp; if not, the plan defines strict handling: (a) preferred: drop sequences with length != 200 if they are rare (<0.5% of rows), (b) otherwise: trim longer sequences to the central 200 bp and pad shorter sequences with 'N' to 200 and mark them with a QC flag for downstream sensitivity analyses. Because the dataset is large, we also recommend computing duplication rate (exact identical sequences), GC-content distribution (mean/SD and tails), and per-target summary statistics (l2fc mean/SD, percentiles) as part of profiling to guide outlier policies. These recommendations align with community emphasis on robust MPRA QC and variability control (e.g., standardized QC frameworks and outlier identification described in MPRA QC pipelines such as esMPRA and uniform processing standards such as MPRAsnakeflow/MPRAlib from IGVF efforts).\n\n2) QC / cleaning with explicit lfcSE filtering rule: Implement a deterministic filter based on measurement uncertainty using the three standard error columns K562_lfcSE, HepG2_lfcSE, SKNSH_lfcSE with the threshold lfcSE > 0.5. Because ambiguity exists (filter per cell line vs. only the target_cell’s SE), define and document two exact, mutually exclusive rules: Rule A (strict multi-task reliability): DROP a row if ANY of the three SE values exceeds 0.5, i.e., drop if max(K562_lfcSE, HepG2_lfcSE, SKNSH_lfcSE) > 0.5; this ensures all three regression labels for a retained sequence are relatively reliable. Rule B (target-cell-only reliability): DROP a row only if the SE corresponding to target_cell exceeds 0.5; concretely, map target_cell in {K562,HepG2,SKNSH} to the matching *_lfcSE column and drop if that single SE > 0.5, allowing retention if non-target tasks are noisy. Recommendation: prefer Rule A for multi-task training where the model jointly predicts all three activities, because noisy targets in any head can destabilize optimization and bias shared feature learning; Rule B is acceptable if target_cell is used as the primary supervision and other heads are auxiliary/weak. In addition, record the number of rows removed under each rule and the post-filter distributions of l2fc to ensure filtering does not collapse dynamic range; if Rule A removes >30% of data, consider raising threshold to 0.6 or switching to Rule B plus per-task loss weighting by 1/(lfcSE^2 + 1e-6). This approach is consistent with MPRA best-practice emphasis on identifying technical variability sources and filtering out unreliable measurements (as highlighted in MPRA QC/standardization efforts like esMPRA and IGVF MPRA processing standards).\n\n3) Missing/invalid values, sequence sanitization, and N handling: Define invalid sequences as any containing characters outside {A,C,G,T,N} (case-insensitive); immediately drop rows with other IUPAC codes (e.g., R,Y,S,W,K,M) unless you explicitly implement probabilistic mapping for them. For Ns, implement a two-tier policy: if N_fraction = count('N')/length(sequence) > 0.0 (strict) then drop, OR if you want a less aggressive option, drop only if N_fraction > 0.01 (i.e., >2 Ns in 200 bp) and otherwise keep. Recommendation for this large dataset: use N_fraction > 0.0 (drop any N) as the default because you have ample data volume (77k) and Ns introduce ambiguous k-mers that can degrade motif learning; keep the relaxed threshold (1%) as a fallback if too many sequences are removed. If sequences with small N_fraction are kept, encode N as a uniform distribution [0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25] at that position (float32), which preserves expected base frequency without injecting a specific nucleotide. Also drop rows with missing numeric targets/SEs (NaN/Inf) and define explicit range checks: lfcSE must be >0 and <5 (hard sanity bounds), and l2fc should be finite with optional winsorization at the 0.1 and 99.9 percentiles per cell line if extreme outliers are present. Maintain a QC report that logs counts removed by each rule (invalid chars, length mismatch, N filter, lfcSE filter, NaNs) to support reproducibility and auditability.\n\n4) Encoding specification (exact tensor layout and dtype): Use a channel-first one-hot encoding with float32 output tensor shape (B, 4, 200), where B is batch size. Define base-to-channel mapping exactly as: A->[1,0,0,0], C->[0,1,0,0], G->[0,0,1,0], T->[0,0,0,1]; for N (if allowed under the relaxed N policy) use [0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25]. Enforce uppercase transformation and verify post-encoding that each position sums to 1.0 (within float tolerance) for A/C/G/T/N; for dropped invalid bases this check is not needed because they are excluded upstream. Keep a deterministic sequence order (5’->3’) and only apply reverse-complement augmentation explicitly as described later; do not implicitly canonicalize sequences because strand information can matter in some MPRA designs. Store encoded arrays in a memory-efficient format for 77k sequences: either on-the-fly encoding in the DataLoader (CPU) or pre-encode and save as an mmap/NPY/Zarr array; with 77,157*4*200 float32 ≈ 246 MB, pre-encoding is feasible and can improve training throughput. If pre-encoding, also store an index mapping from row_id to original CSV row for traceability.\n\n5) Target construction and normalization (train-only scalers): Treat targets as a 3D regression vector y = [K562_l2fc, HepG2_l2fc, SKNSH_l2fc] per row, regardless of target_cell; use target_cell as auxiliary metadata (see splitting/bias checks) rather than the label. Normalize each target dimension separately using only the training split statistics: for cell line c in {K562,HepG2,SKNSH}, compute mean μ_c and std σ_c on train rows, then transform y_c_norm = (y_c - μ_c) / (σ_c + 1e-8). Save μ and σ in a versioned artifact (e.g., JSON) and apply the same scalers to validation and test; at evaluation time, compute metrics in both normalized space (for stable training curves) and original l2fc space (for interpretability). If you adopt SE-aware weighting instead of hard filtering, define per-target weight w_c = 1/(lfcSE_c^2 + 1e-6) and optionally cap weights at w_max=25 to prevent single observations dominating; this is complementary to normalization and is especially useful if you choose the less strict Rule B. Also check for systematic shifts in l2fc distributions across target_cell values; if strong, consider including target_cell as a categorical covariate input (one-hot of size 3 concatenated to model head) but keep it out of the leakage-safe grouping keys.\n\n6) Data splitting strategy (leakage-safe, deterministic, and stratified where possible): Primary risk is sequence leakage due to duplicate (identical) sequences appearing multiple times; therefore split by groups defined as the exact 'sequence' string after canonical cleaning (uppercase, validated length, no Ns if dropped). Algorithm: (i) create cleaned_sequence, (ii) group rows by cleaned_sequence and assign each group an integer group_id, (iii) shuffle group_ids with a fixed seed (seed=2025), (iv) allocate groups to train/val/test by cumulative group size to achieve 80/10/10 of total rows as closely as possible while keeping groups intact. After the group split, verify that there are zero identical sequences shared across splits (assert disjointness) and report group counts and row counts per split. If you want additional robustness against near-duplicates (1–2 mismatches), optionally cluster sequences by MinHash/LSH or by Hamming distance <=2 within 200 bp, but this is computationally heavier; as a practical default, exact-dedup group splitting is required and sufficient for many MPRA tables. Because 'target_cell' may be imbalanced, add a secondary constraint: during group allocation, approximate stratification by target_cell by tracking per-split target_cell proportions and using a greedy assignment that minimizes deviation from the overall distribution (tolerance ±2%). Keep 'MinGap' out of grouping keys but use it for post-split diagnostics; if MinGap correlates with measurement quality, ensure its distribution is similar across splits.\n\n7) Augmentation policy (lightweight due to large N, optional RC): Since the dataset is large (>10K), prioritize QC and do not use heavy synthetic augmentation that could distort measured activity. Optional reverse-complement (RC) augmentation can be applied with probability p=0.5 during training only: for each sequence in a batch, with Bernoulli(p) replace it with its reverse complement; labels (all three l2fc) remain unchanged because MPRA reporter constructs typically measure sequence function independent of strand orientation in many setups, but you must confirm assay design—therefore treat RC augmentation as optional and evaluate with/without it. If you suspect strand-specific effects (e.g., promoter-directional constructs), set p=0.0 and do not RC augment. If you enable RC, implement it at the one-hot tensor level: reverse the length dimension and swap channels A<->T and C<->G; this is deterministic and avoids string operations. Do not use random base mutations for MPRA regression because it changes the underlying biological function and breaks label validity; similarly, do not use random shuffling except as a negative control dataset for sanity checks.\n\n8) Data loader and throughput specifications: For 4x200 float32 tensors, a batch size of 256 is a strong default on a single modern GPU (e.g., 16–24 GB VRAM); provide candidates {128, 256, 512} and choose the largest that maintains >90% GPU utilization without OOM. Use num_workers=4–8 (Linux) depending on CPU cores, pin_memory=True for CUDA training, persistent_workers=True, and prefetch_factor=2 to reduce input stalls; if pre-encoding to mmap/Zarr, you can reduce CPU overhead and increase batch size. Shuffle training data each epoch (shuffle=True) but keep validation/test deterministic (shuffle=False). For reproducibility, set global seeds (Python, NumPy, PyTorch) to 2025 and enforce deterministic ops where feasible; still record that CuDNN determinism may reduce speed. Finally, maintain a data manifest per split containing row indices, cleaned_sequence hash (e.g., SHA1), and QC flags so that any model run can be traced back exactly.\n\n9) Step-by-step preprocessing pipeline (pseudocode-level clarity with exact parameters): Step 0 Load CSV and assert required columns exist; Step 1 Standardize sequence strings: seq = upper(seq), strip whitespace; Step 2 Validate alphabet: drop if regex '[^ACGTN]'; Step 3 Compute len(seq) and profile distribution; apply length policy: if len!=200 then drop (default) unless outlier_fraction>0.5% then trim/pad to 200 with 'N' and flag; Step 4 Handle Ns: compute N_fraction; default drop if N_fraction>0.0 (alternative drop if >0.01 and map remaining N to uniform encoding); Step 5 Validate numeric columns: drop rows with NaN/Inf in any l2fc or lfcSE; enforce lfcSE in (0,5); Step 6 Apply lfcSE filter with threshold 0.5 using Rule A (default) or Rule B (alternative) and log removals; Step 7 Deduplicate/group: group_id = hash(cleaned_sequence), create group table; Step 8 Group split with seed=2025 into train/val/test 0.8/0.1/0.1 by groups; Step 9 Compute train-only μ_c, σ_c and normalize targets; Step 10 Encode sequences to one-hot float32 (B,4,200); Step 11 Save artifacts: split manifests, scaler JSON, QC report, and optional pre-encoded arrays; Step 12 Train with optional RC augmentation p=0.5 on train only. This pipeline follows the general principle from MPRA community tooling that robust QC, outlier handling, and standardized processing are essential for reproducibility (as emphasized by MPRA QC pipelines like esMPRA and uniform processing/standard formats like MPRAsnakeflow/MPRAlib)."

        "design_summary": "This dataset is an MPRA-style cis-regulatory element (CRE) activity dataset structured for 3-task regression (K562/HepG2/SKNSH log2 fold-change outcomes) with per-row uncertainty estimates (lfcSE) and metadata columns (target_cell, MinGap). With 77,157 rows, it is a large dataset (>10K), so the plan prioritizes aggressive QC/cleaning, uncertainty-based filtering, deduplication, and leakage-safe splits rather than heavy augmentation. The primary input is a fixed-length DNA sequence expected to be 200 bp; the plan specifies explicit checks for length distribution and deterministic handling of any deviations (trim/pad policy or exclusion). Targets are treated as continuous regression labels per cell line, with normalization (z-scoring) computed only on the training split and stored for reproducibility. Splitting is designed to avoid sequence leakage by grouping identical sequences and then splitting groups into train/val/test with fixed seed, while retaining representative distributions of target_cell and l2fc. Optional reverse-complement augmentation is included with a controlled probability to improve invariance without materially changing dataset statistics, and data loader parameters are provided for efficient throughput on this scale.",
        "detailed_design": {
          "design_recommendations": "1) Dataset profiling and type confirmation: Using the provided columns ['sequence','target_cell','K562_l2fc','HepG2_l2fc','SKNSH_l2fc','MinGap','K562_lfcSE','HepG2_lfcSE','SKNSH_lfcSE'] and 77,157 rows, this is best characterized as an MPRA-derived multi-output regression dataset where each row is a synthetic/natural 200 bp regulatory sequence with measured activity in three cell lines, reported as log2 fold change (l2fc) with associated standard errors (lfcSE). This implies label noise is heteroskedastic and should be addressed by uncertainty-aware filtering and/or loss weighting; for data management, we prioritize filtering rules that are explicit and reproducible. Sequence length should be validated by computing length for every row and summarizing mean/median/min/max and outlier counts (e.g., count of length != 200). The expected distribution is a delta at 200 bp; if not, the plan defines strict handling: (a) preferred: drop sequences with length != 200 if they are rare (<0.5% of rows), (b) otherwise: trim longer sequences to the central 200 bp and pad shorter sequences with 'N' to 200 and mark them with a QC flag for downstream sensitivity analyses. Because the dataset is large, we also recommend computing duplication rate (exact identical sequences), GC-content distribution (mean/SD and tails), and per-target summary statistics (l2fc mean/SD, percentiles) as part of profiling to guide outlier policies. These recommendations align with community emphasis on robust MPRA QC and variability control (e.g., standardized QC frameworks and outlier identification described in MPRA QC pipelines such as esMPRA and uniform processing standards such as MPRAsnakeflow/MPRAlib from IGVF efforts).\n\n2) QC / cleaning with explicit lfcSE filtering rule: Implement a deterministic filter based on measurement uncertainty using the three standard error columns K562_lfcSE, HepG2_lfcSE, SKNSH_lfcSE with the threshold lfcSE > 0.5. Because ambiguity exists (filter per cell line vs. only the target_cell’s SE), define and document two exact, mutually exclusive rules: Rule A (strict multi-task reliability): DROP a row if ANY of the three SE values exceeds 0.5, i.e., drop if max(K562_lfcSE, HepG2_lfcSE, SKNSH_lfcSE) > 0.5; this ensures all three regression labels for a retained sequence are relatively reliable. Rule B (target-cell-only reliability): DROP a row only if the SE corresponding to target_cell exceeds 0.5; concretely, map target_cell in {K562,HepG2,SKNSH} to the matching *_lfcSE column and drop if that single SE > 0.5, allowing retention if non-target tasks are noisy. Recommendation: prefer Rule A for multi-task training where the model jointly predicts all three activities, because noisy targets in any head can destabilize optimization and bias shared feature learning; Rule B is acceptable if target_cell is used as the primary supervision and other heads are auxiliary/weak. In addition, record the number of rows removed under each rule and the post-filter distributions of l2fc to ensure filtering does not collapse dynamic range; if Rule A removes >30% of data, consider raising threshold to 0.6 or switching to Rule B plus per-task loss weighting by 1/(lfcSE^2 + 1e-6). This approach is consistent with MPRA best-practice emphasis on identifying technical variability sources and filtering out unreliable measurements (as highlighted in MPRA QC/standardization efforts like esMPRA and IGVF MPRA processing standards).\n\n3) Missing/invalid values, sequence sanitization, and N handling: Define invalid sequences as any containing characters outside {A,C,G,T,N} (case-insensitive); immediately drop rows with other IUPAC codes (e.g., R,Y,S,W,K,M) unless you explicitly implement probabilistic mapping for them. For Ns, implement a two-tier policy: if N_fraction = count('N')/length(sequence) > 0.0 (strict) then drop, OR if you want a less aggressive option, drop only if N_fraction > 0.01 (i.e., >2 Ns in 200 bp) and otherwise keep. Recommendation for this large dataset: use N_fraction > 0.0 (drop any N) as the default because you have ample data volume (77k) and Ns introduce ambiguous k-mers that can degrade motif learning; keep the relaxed threshold (1%) as a fallback if too many sequences are removed. If sequences with small N_fraction are kept, encode N as a uniform distribution [0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25] at that position (float32), which preserves expected base frequency without injecting a specific nucleotide. Also drop rows with missing numeric targets/SEs (NaN/Inf) and define explicit range checks: lfcSE must be >0 and <5 (hard sanity bounds), and l2fc should be finite with optional winsorization at the 0.1 and 99.9 percentiles per cell line if extreme outliers are present. Maintain a QC report that logs counts removed by each rule (invalid chars, length mismatch, N filter, lfcSE filter, NaNs) to support reproducibility and auditability.\n\n4) Encoding specification (exact tensor layout and dtype): Use a channel-first one-hot encoding with float32 output tensor shape (B, 4, 200), where B is batch size. Define base-to-channel mapping exactly as: A->[1,0,0,0], C->[0,1,0,0], G->[0,0,1,0], T->[0,0,0,1]; for N (if allowed under the relaxed N policy) use [0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25]. Enforce uppercase transformation and verify post-encoding that each position sums to 1.0 (within float tolerance) for A/C/G/T/N; for dropped invalid bases this check is not needed because they are excluded upstream. Keep a deterministic sequence order (5’->3’) and only apply reverse-complement augmentation explicitly as described later; do not implicitly canonicalize sequences because strand information can matter in some MPRA designs. Store encoded arrays in a memory-efficient format for 77k sequences: either on-the-fly encoding in the DataLoader (CPU) or pre-encode and save as an mmap/NPY/Zarr array; with 77,157*4*200 float32 ≈ 246 MB, pre-encoding is feasible and can improve training throughput. If pre-encoding, also store an index mapping from row_id to original CSV row for traceability.\n\n5) Target construction and normalization (train-only scalers): Treat targets as a 3D regression vector y = [K562_l2fc, HepG2_l2fc, SKNSH_l2fc] per row, regardless of target_cell; use target_cell as auxiliary metadata (see splitting/bias checks) rather than the label. Normalize each target dimension separately using only the training split statistics: for cell line c in {K562,HepG2,SKNSH}, compute mean μ_c and std σ_c on train rows, then transform y_c_norm = (y_c - μ_c) / (σ_c + 1e-8). Save μ and σ in a versioned artifact (e.g., JSON) and apply the same scalers to validation and test; at evaluation time, compute metrics in both normalized space (for stable training curves) and original l2fc space (for interpretability). If you adopt SE-aware weighting instead of hard filtering, define per-target weight w_c = 1/(lfcSE_c^2 + 1e-6) and optionally cap weights at w_max=25 to prevent single observations dominating; this is complementary to normalization and is especially useful if you choose the less strict Rule B. Also check for systematic shifts in l2fc distributions across target_cell values; if strong, consider including target_cell as a categorical covariate input (one-hot of size 3 concatenated to model head) but keep it out of the leakage-safe grouping keys.\n\n6) Data splitting strategy (leakage-safe, deterministic, and stratified where possible): Primary risk is sequence leakage due to duplicate (identical) sequences appearing multiple times; therefore split by groups defined as the exact 'sequence' string after canonical cleaning (uppercase, validated length, no Ns if dropped). Algorithm: (i) create cleaned_sequence, (ii) group rows by cleaned_sequence and assign each group an integer group_id, (iii) shuffle group_ids with a fixed seed (seed=2025), (iv) allocate groups to train/val/test by cumulative group size to achieve 80/10/10 of total rows as closely as possible while keeping groups intact. After the group split, verify that there are zero identical sequences shared across splits (assert disjointness) and report group counts and row counts per split. If you want additional robustness against near-duplicates (1–2 mismatches), optionally cluster sequences by MinHash/LSH or by Hamming distance <=2 within 200 bp, but this is computationally heavier; as a practical default, exact-dedup group splitting is required and sufficient for many MPRA tables. Because 'target_cell' may be imbalanced, add a secondary constraint: during group allocation, approximate stratification by target_cell by tracking per-split target_cell proportions and using a greedy assignment that minimizes deviation from the overall distribution (tolerance ±2%). Keep 'MinGap' out of grouping keys but use it for post-split diagnostics; if MinGap correlates with measurement quality, ensure its distribution is similar across splits.\n\n7) Augmentation policy (lightweight due to large N, optional RC): Since the dataset is large (>10K), prioritize QC and do not use heavy synthetic augmentation that could distort measured activity. Optional reverse-complement (RC) augmentation can be applied with probability p=0.5 during training only: for each sequence in a batch, with Bernoulli(p) replace it with its reverse complement; labels (all three l2fc) remain unchanged because MPRA reporter constructs typically measure sequence function independent of strand orientation in many setups, but you must confirm assay design—therefore treat RC augmentation as optional and evaluate with/without it. If you suspect strand-specific effects (e.g., promoter-directional constructs), set p=0.0 and do not RC augment. If you enable RC, implement it at the one-hot tensor level: reverse the length dimension and swap channels A<->T and C<->G; this is deterministic and avoids string operations. Do not use random base mutations for MPRA regression because it changes the underlying biological function and breaks label validity; similarly, do not use random shuffling except as a negative control dataset for sanity checks.\n\n8) Data loader and throughput specifications: For 4x200 float32 tensors, a batch size of 256 is a strong default on a single modern GPU (e.g., 16–24 GB VRAM); provide candidates {128, 256, 512} and choose the largest that maintains >90% GPU utilization without OOM. Use num_workers=4–8 (Linux) depending on CPU cores, pin_memory=True for CUDA training, persistent_workers=True, and prefetch_factor=2 to reduce input stalls; if pre-encoding to mmap/Zarr, you can reduce CPU overhead and increase batch size. Shuffle training data each epoch (shuffle=True) but keep validation/test deterministic (shuffle=False). For reproducibility, set global seeds (Python, NumPy, PyTorch) to 2025 and enforce deterministic ops where feasible; still record that CuDNN determinism may reduce speed. Finally, maintain a data manifest per split containing row indices, cleaned_sequence hash (e.g., SHA1), and QC flags so that any model run can be traced back exactly.\n\n9) Step-by-step preprocessing pipeline (pseudocode-level clarity with exact parameters): Step 0 Load CSV and assert required columns exist; Step 1 Standardize sequence strings: seq = upper(seq), strip whitespace; Step 2 Validate alphabet: drop if regex '[^ACGTN]'; Step 3 Compute len(seq) and profile distribution; apply length policy: if len!=200 then drop (default) unless outlier_fraction>0.5% then trim/pad to 200 with 'N' and flag; Step 4 Handle Ns: compute N_fraction; default drop if N_fraction>0.0 (alternative drop if >0.01 and map remaining N to uniform encoding); Step 5 Validate numeric columns: drop rows with NaN/Inf in any l2fc or lfcSE; enforce lfcSE in (0,5); Step 6 Apply lfcSE filter with threshold 0.5 using Rule A (default) or Rule B (alternative) and log removals; Step 7 Deduplicate/group: group_id = hash(cleaned_sequence), create group table; Step 8 Group split with seed=2025 into train/val/test 0.8/0.1/0.1 by groups; Step 9 Compute train-only μ_c, σ_c and normalize targets; Step 10 Encode sequences to one-hot float32 (B,4,200); Step 11 Save artifacts: split manifests, scaler JSON, QC report, and optional pre-encoded arrays; Step 12 Train with optional RC augmentation p=0.5 on train only. This pipeline follows the general principle from MPRA community tooling that robust QC, outlier handling, and standardized processing are essential for reproducibility (as emphasized by MPRA QC pipelines like esMPRA and uniform processing/standard formats like MPRAsnakeflow/MPRAlib)."

        "discussion_notes": "Overall the other experts’ opinions are largely consistent with the data-management plan: the dataset is big enough that leakage-safe splitting, deduplication, and rigorous QC matter more than heavy augmentation. I agree with the Result Analyst’s emphasis on robust/weighted metrics and group bootstrap when dependence exists. I partially agree with the Methodology Expert on RC augmentation/RC-consistency, but only after experimentally confirming strand invariance; otherwise it can introduce systematic label noise. I agree with the Model Architect’s leakage concerns, but chromosome holdout should be conditional on coordinate availability; otherwise sequence-hash grouping (and optional scalable near-duplicate detection) is the practical alternative. Supporting knowledge: MPRA QC is commonly treated as a stepwise framework with standardized metrics and monitoring (e.g., esMPRA, 2025), and MPRA analyses can be biased by library/process effects, motivating careful QC and robust statistical handling rather than simplistic filtering (e.g., Qiao et al., 2020).",

      "design_summary": "This methodology targets 3-output regression of MPRA-like activity (l2fc) in K562, HepG2, and SKNSH using a shared sequence backbone with three task-specific heads. The training objective uses a robust regression loss (Huber) to handle heavy-tailed experimental noise typical for fold-change assays while maintaining stable gradients. Optimization is performed with AdamW and a cosine decay schedule with warmup, which is a strong default for deep sequence models and supports rapid early learning without destabilizing later convergence. Regularization combines dropout in the backbone, input base-masking (input dropout) to reduce reliance on single k-mers, and reverse-complement (RC) augmentation plus an explicit RC-consistency regularizer to enforce strand-symmetry (motivated by RCCR). Biological priors are integrated through an auxiliary motif-scoring branch (PWM scanning features) and optional motif-preserving augmentations, ensuring learned representations remain consistent with known TF-binding logic. Validation emphasizes not only mean Pearson across tasks but also specificity metrics (MinGap between top vs. non-target cell types) to ensure designs are cell-type-discriminative rather than globally strong. A structured ablation plan tests backbone depth, kernel sizes, and RC augmentation/consistency to quantify which components most impact accuracy and specificity.",
      "implementation_plan": {
        "design_recommendations": "1) Dataset characterization & preprocessing: Assume the dataset is an MPRA-style sequence-to-activity regression dataset because the targets are per-cell-type l2fc (K562/HepG2/SKNSH), which are commonly derived from reporter assays; this implies labels are noisy with occasional outliers and can be heteroscedastic across cell types. If sequence length is fixed (common in MPRA libraries), set input_len=200 bp (adjust to actual; if variable, pad/truncate to 200 with center-crop for longer sequences and N-padding for shorter) and record length distribution; if >95% are identical length, disable variable-length masking for simplicity. Treat dataset size as medium-to-large (>10k is common for MPRA), so prioritize strict QC: remove sequences with >5% ambiguous bases (N), remove duplicated sequences keeping the median label per cell type, and winsorize extreme l2fc values at the 0.5th/99.5th percentiles per task to reduce leverage points while keeping ranking. Standardize labels per task using training-set mean/std (z-score) so multi-task losses are on comparable scale; at inference, invert standardization to report l2fc. Use a leakage-safe split: sequence-level unique split (no exact duplicates across train/val/test), optionally family-aware split by k-mer MinHash clustering to reduce near-duplicate leakage; keep val=10%, test=10%. Implement batch sampling uniformly over sequences; do not stratify by label unless label distribution is extremely skewed.\n\n2) Model architecture (shared backbone + 3 heads): Use one-hot DNA encoding (A,C,G,T plus optional N channel) with shape [B, L, 4] (or 5), and a CNN-residual backbone for strong inductive bias on motifs and motif syntax. Backbone example (exact): Conv1D(4->256, kernel=15, stride=1, padding=same) + BatchNorm(momentum=0.9, eps=1e-5) + GELU + Dropout(p=0.10); then 6 residual blocks each: Conv1D(256->256, k=7) + BN + GELU + Dropout(0.10) + Conv1D(256->256, k=7) + BN + GELU with residual connection; after blocks, DilatedConv stack: 3 layers Conv1D(256->256, k=3, dilation=2/4/8) each with BN+GELU+Dropout(0.10) to extend receptive field without huge depth. Pooling: attention pooling or global average pooling; to keep it simple and stable, use GlobalAveragePooling over length producing 256-d vector. Heads: three independent MLP heads: Linear(256->128) + GELU + Dropout(0.20) + Linear(128->1) for each task; initialize with Xavier uniform (gain=1.0) and zero bias. Apply weight normalization (as required) to all Conv1D and Linear layers; in PyTorch, use torch.nn.utils.weight_norm at module construction and optionally remove at inference. This design matches the “shared trunk + multiple expression heads” pattern seen in sequence-to-expression models (e.g., Proformer uses multiple heads and strand embedding ideas), while retaining CNN interpretability and stable training.\n\n3) Loss function (exact choice + weighting + masking): Use Huber loss (a robust alternative to MSE) because MPRA l2fc labels often contain outliers and heavy-tailed noise; set delta=1.0 in standardized label units. Reduction: compute per-sample per-task Huber, then reduce by mean over batch and tasks after weighting (i.e., ‘none’ then manual reduction). Per-task weights: start equal weights w=[1.0,1.0,1.0] for the first 5 epochs to avoid early collapse; then switch to inverse-variance weights estimated from training residual EMA to balance tasks (w_t = 1/(sigma_t^2 + 1e-4), normalized so sum(w)=3.0). Missing-task masking: assume all present, but implement a mask tensor m in {0,1}^3 per sample; final loss = sum_t w_t * m_t * huber(yhat_t,y_t) / (sum_t w_t*m_t + 1e-8) so training remains correct if any labels are absent in future data. Add RC-consistency regularization term (see augmentation/regularization): L_total = L_regression + lambda_rccr * mean_t |yhat_fwd_t - yhat_rc_t| with lambda_rccr=0.05 (after standardization), motivated by the RCCR idea that explicitly penalizing RC prediction divergence improves reliability on genomic tasks (Reverse-Complement Consistency for DNA Language Models, arXiv 2025). If you later detect strong heteroscedasticity per-task (e.g., HepG2 variance far higher), a Gaussian NLL head can be ablated, but Huber is the default for stability and simplicity.\n\n4) Optimization + LR schedule (exact hyperparameters): Use AdamW (not SGD) for faster convergence on sequence models with BatchNorm/weight norm and for robustness to gradient scale; set lr=3e-4, betas=(0.9,0.98), eps=1e-8, weight_decay=0.05. Apply weight decay to all weights except biases, BatchNorm parameters, and weight-norm “g” scalars (exclude via parameter groups). Gradient clipping: clip global norm at 1.0 (gradient_clip_norm=1.0) to prevent rare batch spikes from destabilizing training (common with noisy l2fc). LR schedule: cosine decay with linear warmup; warmup_epochs=5 (or warmup_steps = 5 * steps_per_epoch), start_lr=3e-6, peak_lr=3e-4, min_lr=3e-6, then cosine down to min_lr by the final epoch. Use batch_size=256 if GPU memory permits for stable BatchNorm; if constrained, use batch_size=128 and set BN to sync-bn or switch to GroupNorm(32 groups). Use mixed precision (fp16/bf16) with dynamic loss scaling; keep gradient clip after unscale.\n\n5) Regularization (dropout, input dropout, weight norm, mixup rationale): Backbone dropout p=0.10 in conv/residual layers; head dropout p=0.20 because heads overfit more easily than shared features. Input dropout (random base masking): with probability p_mask=0.02 per position, replace the one-hot base with all-zeros (or an explicit N channel if used); this simulates sequencing/library noise and discourages reliance on single nucleotide positions. Do not use label smoothing because this is regression and smoothing would bias continuous targets; instead, rely on Huber and winsorization/standardization for robustness. Weight norm: apply to every Conv1D and Linear (excluding BN) to stabilize training dynamics; monitor for training slowdowns and consider removing weight norm after convergence if needed. Mixup: do not apply raw-sequence mixup at one-hot level because convex combinations of bases are not biologically valid sequences; if needed as an ablation, restrict mixup to the pooled embedding vector (post-backbone) with alpha=0.2 and mix only within-batch while also mixing labels, but treat as optional because it can blur motif syntax. Add L2 on outputs is not needed; instead, use early stopping and RC regularization.\n\n6) Data augmentation + biological prior integration (motifs/PWMs and RC): Reverse-complement augmentation: with probability 0.5, replace input with its RC during training; at evaluation, optionally average predictions of forward and RC for robustness (test-time augmentation). Add explicit RC-consistency regularization (lambda_rccr=0.05) by computing predictions on both forward and RC in the same batch and penalizing their absolute difference; this is directly inspired by RCCR which targets inconsistent forward/RC predictions in DNA models (arXiv 2025). Small random shift augmentation: if sequences represent a window around a central element, allow shift in [-3,+3] bp with circular padding disabled (pad with N) to reflect uncertainty in exact motif alignment; set shift_prob=0.5. Motif prior: compute PWM scan features (e.g., max log-odds score per TF motif from a curated motif set relevant to K562/HepG2/SKNSH, such as ETS/GATA for hematopoietic contexts, HNF4A/CEBPA for HepG2 liver-like, and neural TFs for SKNSH) using a fixed library; concatenate a low-dim motif feature vector (e.g., 64 motifs) to the pooled 256-d backbone embedding, giving 320-d to each head. Regularize motif branch by Dropout(0.30) on motif features to prevent the model from ignoring sequence and overfitting motif counts. This “feature fusion” keeps the model biologically grounded and improves interpretability; it is also compatible with multi-task learning as in multi-head designs (e.g., Proformer highlights multi-head strategies and strand handling).\n\n7) Training length, early stopping, validation metrics (including specificity/MinGap): Train for max_epochs=80 with early stopping on a single scalar: mean Pearson correlation across the three tasks on the validation set (computed on de-standardized predictions), because Pearson aligns with ranking/relative effect accuracy often desired in regulatory activity prediction. Early stopping parameters: patience=12 epochs, min_delta=0.002 (absolute improvement in mean Pearson), and require at least min_epochs=20 before stopping to avoid premature termination during warmup/cosine transition. Track additional metrics: per-task Pearson, Spearman, RMSE, and calibration of residuals; log each epoch. Specificity validation: compute “MinGap” per sample as gap between top predicted cell-type l2fc and second-best (or between target and mean of others if target label known); then report mean MinGap and fraction of samples with correct top-cell-type (if you have a designated “intended” cell type for each sequence). Use MinGap only for monitoring/model selection tie-breaker: if mean Pearson is within 0.001 of best, select the checkpoint with higher mean MinGap to favor specificity. For robustness, also compute Pearson on RC-averaged predictions (fwd/rc mean) and ensure the drop from fwd-only is <0.01; large gaps indicate strand inconsistency issues.\n\n8) Multi-task handling, balancing, and runnable-like configuration: Optimize weighted-sum loss (not average of independent optimizers) using the dynamic inverse-variance weighting after epoch 5; additionally cap any task weight to at most 2.0x the mean weight to prevent one task from dominating (w_t = min(w_t, 2.0 * mean(w))). If one task’s gradients dominate (detect via per-task gradient norms on the last shared layer), enable GradNorm-style balancing as an optional ablation: update weights every 50 steps to equalize relative training rates, but default to inverse-variance because it is simple and usually effective. Reproducibility: set seeds for Python/NumPy/PyTorch to 1337, enable deterministic flags (torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic=True, benchmark=False), and log git commit + dataset hash + exact config. Ablation plan: (A1) backbone depth {4,6,8 residual blocks} with fixed kernels; (A2) kernel sizes: first conv k in {11,15,21} and residual k in {5,7}; (A3) remove dilated conv stack; (A4) RC augmentation off vs on; (A5) RC augmentation on but RCCR lambda_rccr in {0.0,0.02,0.05,0.1}; (A6) motif feature fusion off vs on; evaluate all by mean Pearson and mean MinGap.

Run an explicit ablation (no-RC vs RC) and only keep RC + RC-consistency if it improves validation metrics and does not worsen strand-specific residual structure. If assay orientation is known to be directional, disable RC entirely (or restrict to palindromic/strand-invariant subsets).",
        "Prefer SE-aware loss weighting over aggressive filtering when retention would otherwise drop too much: implement clipped inverse-variance weights w=1/(SE^2+eps), then cap (e.g., w<=25) and optionally warm-start with uniform weights for 1–3 epochs before enabling SE weights. This matches the Data Management expert’s suggestion and reduces data loss.",
        "Multi-task balancing: start with per-task target z-scoring on training split; then either (a) keep equal task weights, or (b) use a stable balancing method (e.g., learned homoscedastic task uncertainty or GradNorm) with caps on weight ratios to avoid one task dominating.",
        "Motif prior integration: make motif/PWM use auxiliary or optional. Safer default is an auxiliary head that predicts motif presence/occupancy (multi-label) from intermediate features, rather than hard feature concatenation; keep motif dropout high and always report an ablation (motif-off baseline).",

        "design_summary": "This methodology targets 3-output regression of MPRA-like activity (l2fc) in K562, HepG2, and SKNSH using a shared sequence backbone with three task-specific heads. The training objective uses a robust regression loss (Huber) to handle heavy-tailed experimental noise typical for fold-change assays while maintaining stable gradients. Optimization is performed with AdamW and a cosine decay schedule with warmup, which is a strong default for deep sequence models and supports rapid early learning without destabilizing later convergence. Regularization combines dropout in the backbone, input base-masking (input dropout) to reduce reliance on single k-mers, and reverse-complement (RC) augmentation plus an explicit RC-consistency regularizer to enforce strand-symmetry (motivated by RCCR). Biological priors are integrated through an auxiliary motif-scoring branch (PWM scanning features) and optional motif-preserving augmentations, ensuring learned representations remain consistent with known TF-binding logic. Validation emphasizes not only mean Pearson across tasks but also specificity metrics (MinGap between top vs. non-target cell types) to ensure designs are cell-type-discriminative rather than globally strong. A structured ablation plan tests backbone depth, kernel sizes, and RC augmentation/consistency to quantify which components most impact accuracy and specificity.",
        "detailed_design": {
          "design_recommendations": "1) Dataset characterization & preprocessing: Assume the dataset is an MPRA-style sequence-to-activity regression dataset because the targets are per-cell-type l2fc (K562/HepG2/SKNSH), which are commonly derived from reporter assays; this implies labels are noisy with occasional outliers and can be heteroscedastic across cell types. If sequence length is fixed (common in MPRA libraries), set input_len=200 bp (adjust to actual; if variable, pad/truncate to 200 with center-crop for longer sequences and N-padding for shorter) and record length distribution; if >95% are identical length, disable variable-length masking for simplicity. Treat dataset size as medium-to-large (>10k is common for MPRA), so prioritize strict QC: remove sequences with >5% ambiguous bases (N), remove duplicated sequences keeping the median label per cell type, and winsorize extreme l2fc values at the 0.5th/99.5th percentiles per task to reduce leverage points while keeping ranking. Standardize labels per task using training-set mean/std (z-score) so multi-task losses are on comparable scale; at inference, invert standardization to report l2fc. Use a leakage-safe split: sequence-level unique split (no exact duplicates across train/val/test), optionally family-aware split by k-mer MinHash clustering to reduce near-duplicate leakage; keep val=10%, test=10%. Implement batch sampling uniformly over sequences; do not stratify by label unless label distribution is extremely skewed.\n\n2) Model architecture (shared backbone + 3 heads): Use one-hot DNA encoding (A,C,G,T plus optional N channel) with shape [B, L, 4] (or 5), and a CNN-residual backbone for strong inductive bias on motifs and motif syntax. Backbone example (exact): Conv1D(4->256, kernel=15, stride=1, padding=same) + BatchNorm(momentum=0.9, eps=1e-5) + GELU + Dropout(p=0.10); then 6 residual blocks each: Conv1D(256->256, k=7) + BN + GELU + Dropout(0.10) + Conv1D(256->256, k=7) + BN + GELU with residual connection; after blocks, DilatedConv stack: 3 layers Conv1D(256->256, k=3, dilation=2/4/8) each with BN+GELU+Dropout(0.10) to extend receptive field without huge depth. Pooling: attention pooling or global average pooling; to keep it simple and stable, use GlobalAveragePooling over length producing 256-d vector. Heads: three independent MLP heads: Linear(256->128) + GELU + Dropout(0.20) + Linear(128->1) for each task; initialize with Xavier uniform (gain=1.0) and zero bias. Apply weight normalization (as required) to all Conv1D and Linear layers; in PyTorch, use torch.nn.utils.weight_norm at module construction and optionally remove at inference. This design matches the “shared trunk + multiple expression heads” pattern seen in sequence-to-expression models (e.g., Proformer uses multiple heads and strand embedding ideas), while retaining CNN interpretability and stable training.\n\n3) Loss function (exact choice + weighting + masking): Use Huber loss (a robust alternative to MSE) because MPRA l2fc labels often contain outliers and heavy-tailed noise; set delta=1.0 in standardized label units. Reduction: compute per-sample per-task Huber, then reduce by mean over batch and tasks after weighting (i.e., ‘none’ then manual reduction). Per-task weights: start equal weights w=[1.0,1.0,1.0] for the first 5 epochs to avoid early collapse; then switch to inverse-variance weights estimated from training residual EMA to balance tasks (w_t = 1/(sigma_t^2 + 1e-4), normalized so sum(w)=3.0). Missing-task masking: assume all present, but implement a mask tensor m in {0,1}^3 per sample; final loss = sum_t w_t * m_t * huber(yhat_t,y_t) / (sum_t w_t*m_t + 1e-8) so training remains correct if any labels are absent in future data. Add RC-consistency regularization term (see augmentation/regularization): L_total = L_regression + lambda_rccr * mean_t |yhat_fwd_t - yhat_rc_t| with lambda_rccr=0.05 (after standardization), motivated by the RCCR idea that explicitly penalizing RC prediction divergence improves reliability on genomic tasks (Reverse-Complement Consistency for DNA Language Models, arXiv 2025). If you later detect strong heteroscedasticity per-task (e.g., HepG2 variance far higher), a Gaussian NLL head can be ablated, but Huber is the default for stability and simplicity.\n\n4) Optimization + LR schedule (exact hyperparameters): Use AdamW (not SGD) for faster convergence on sequence models with BatchNorm/weight norm and for robustness to gradient scale; set lr=3e-4, betas=(0.9,0.98), eps=1e-8, weight_decay=0.05. Apply weight decay to all weights except biases, BatchNorm parameters, and weight-norm “g” scalars (exclude via parameter groups). Gradient clipping: clip global norm at 1.0 (gradient_clip_norm=1.0) to prevent rare batch spikes from destabilizing training (common with noisy l2fc). LR schedule: cosine decay with linear warmup; warmup_epochs=5 (or warmup_steps = 5 * steps_per_epoch), start_lr=3e-6, peak_lr=3e-4, min_lr=3e-6, then cosine down to min_lr by the final epoch. Use batch_size=256 if GPU memory permits for stable BatchNorm; if constrained, use batch_size=128 and set BN to sync-bn or switch to GroupNorm(32 groups). Use mixed precision (fp16/bf16) with dynamic loss scaling; keep gradient clip after unscale.\n\n5) Regularization (dropout, input dropout, weight norm, mixup rationale): Backbone dropout p=0.10 in conv/residual layers; head dropout p=0.20 because heads overfit more easily than shared features. Input dropout (random base masking): with probability p_mask=0.02 per position, replace the one-hot base with all-zeros (or an explicit N channel if used); this simulates sequencing/library noise and discourages reliance on single nucleotide positions. Do not use label smoothing because this is regression and smoothing would bias continuous targets; instead, rely on Huber and winsorization/standardization for robustness. Weight norm: apply to every Conv1D and Linear (excluding BN) to stabilize training dynamics; monitor for training slowdowns and consider removing weight norm after convergence if needed. Mixup: do not apply raw-sequence mixup at one-hot level because convex combinations of bases are not biologically valid sequences; if needed as an ablation, restrict mixup to the pooled embedding vector (post-backbone) with alpha=0.2 and mix only within-batch while also mixing labels, but treat as optional because it can blur motif syntax. Add L2 on outputs is not needed; instead, use early stopping and RC regularization.\n\n6) Data augmentation + biological prior integration (motifs/PWMs and RC): Reverse-complement augmentation: with probability 0.5, replace input with its RC during training; at evaluation, optionally average predictions of forward and RC for robustness (test-time augmentation). Add explicit RC-consistency regularization (lambda_rccr=0.05) by computing predictions on both forward and RC in the same batch and penalizing their absolute difference; this is directly inspired by RCCR which targets inconsistent forward/RC predictions in DNA models (arXiv 2025). Small random shift augmentation: if sequences represent a window around a central element, allow shift in [-3,+3] bp with circular padding disabled (pad with N) to reflect uncertainty in exact motif alignment; set shift_prob=0.5. Motif prior: compute PWM scan features (e.g., max log-odds score per TF motif from a curated motif set relevant to K562/HepG2/SKNSH, such as ETS/GATA for hematopoietic contexts, HNF4A/CEBPA for HepG2 liver-like, and neural TFs for SKNSH) using a fixed library; concatenate a low-dim motif feature vector (e.g., 64 motifs) to the pooled 256-d backbone embedding, giving 320-d to each head. Regularize motif branch by Dropout(0.30) on motif features to prevent the model from ignoring sequence and overfitting motif counts. This “feature fusion” keeps the model biologically grounded and improves interpretability; it is also compatible with multi-task learning as in multi-head designs (e.g., Proformer highlights multi-head strategies and strand handling).\n\n7) Training length, early stopping, validation metrics (including specificity/MinGap): Train for max_epochs=80 with early stopping on a single scalar: mean Pearson correlation across the three tasks on the validation set (computed on de-standardized predictions), because Pearson aligns with ranking/relative effect accuracy often desired in regulatory activity prediction. Early stopping parameters: patience=12 epochs, min_delta=0.002 (absolute improvement in mean Pearson), and require at least min_epochs=20 before stopping to avoid premature termination during warmup/cosine transition. Track additional metrics: per-task Pearson, Spearman, RMSE, and calibration of residuals; log each epoch. Specificity validation: compute “MinGap” per sample as gap between top predicted cell-type l2fc and second-best (or between target and mean of others if target label known); then report mean MinGap and fraction of samples with correct top-cell-type (if you have a designated “intended” cell type for each sequence). Use MinGap only for monitoring/model selection tie-breaker: if mean Pearson is within 0.001 of best, select the checkpoint with higher mean MinGap to favor specificity. For robustness, also compute Pearson on RC-averaged predictions (fwd/rc mean) and ensure the drop from fwd-only is <0.01; large gaps indicate strand inconsistency issues.\n\n8) Multi-task handling, balancing, and runnable-like configuration: Optimize weighted-sum loss (not average of independent optimizers) using the dynamic inverse-variance weighting after epoch 5; additionally cap any task weight to at most 2.0x the mean weight to prevent one task from dominating (w_t = min(w_t, 2.0 * mean(w))). If one task’s gradients dominate (detect via per-task gradient norms on the last shared layer), enable GradNorm-style balancing as an optional ablation: update weights every 50 steps to equalize relative training rates, but default to inverse-variance because it is simple and usually effective. Reproducibility: set seeds for Python/NumPy/PyTorch to 1337, enable deterministic flags (torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic=True, benchmark=False), and log git commit + dataset hash + exact config. Ablation plan: (A1) backbone depth {4,6,8 residual blocks} with fixed kernels; (A2) kernel sizes: first conv k in {11,15,21} and residual k in {5,7}; (A3) remove dilated conv stack; (A4) RC augmentation off vs on; (A5) RC augmentation on but RCCR lambda_rccr in {0.0,0.02,0.05,0.1}; (A6) motif feature fusion off vs on; evaluate all by mean Pearson and mean MinGap.

        "discussion_notes": "Overall, the other experts’ opinions are consistent with the methodology analysis: everyone converges on robust multi-task regression, leakage-safe splitting, and careful uncertainty handling. The main correction is to treat RC augmentation/RC-consistency as conditional on assay strand invariance, not a default. I agree with the Data Management expert that aggressive SE filtering can be replaced (or complemented) by capped SE-aware loss weighting to preserve sample size. I also agree with the Model Architect and Methodology experts that task balancing needs explicit attention (either normalization + equal weights, or controlled dynamic balancing such as GradNorm/uncertainty weighting with caps). For motif priors, I agree with the caution: motif fusion should be ablated and ideally implemented as an auxiliary regularizer to avoid over-anchoring to incomplete motif sets. Supporting evidence from the knowledge base: meta-analysis indicates cross-context MPRA prediction is feasible but limited by cell-type-specific features (Kreimer et al., 2019), and deep learning has been used to characterize MPRA signals genome-wide (Lu et al., 2022), reinforcing the chosen modeling/optimization direction.",

      "design_summary": "This plan targets gene regulatory element prediction from 200 bp one-hot DNA (B,4,200) with ~77,157 samples, which supports a moderate-capacity 1D CNN (≈1–3M parameters) without being overly prone to overfitting. The model uses a shared Conv1d backbone with explicit Weight Normalization on every Conv1d layer to stabilize optimization and decouple weight magnitude/direction while keeping the architecture computationally efficient. To capture motifs at multiple lengths, the first stage performs parallel multi-scale convolutions with kernel sizes 7/11/15 (all stride 1 with same padding), concatenates branch outputs channel-wise, and then uses a sequence of residual Conv1d blocks (including a dilated block stack) to model motif interactions and longer-range dependencies across the 200 bp window. The backbone ends with a combined global average pooling and global max pooling to preserve both presence and distributional information, producing a fixed-dimensional feature vector regardless of sequence length. Three independent heads (one per task) are implemented as separate small MLPs, each mapping the shared feature vector to one scalar output, collectively yielding a 3D output vector. Interpretability is built in through gradient-based saliency (dY/dX), Integrated Gradients baselines, and in-silico mutagenesis with a fixed window size to extract motif-like sensitivity patterns, aligning with common regulatory genomics interpretation practices (e.g., filter visualization and in silico mutagenesis approaches highlighted in the retrieved literature on “un-boxing” sequence models using convolutional filters and mutagenesis).",

        "design_recommendations": "Dataset and task characterization: With N=77,157 labeled sequences of fixed length 200 bp and one-hot encoding (4 channels), this is a large dataset (>10K) suitable for a moderate CNN with residual/dilated blocks and multi-task heads, targeting ~0.5–5M parameters to balance expressiveness and generalization. The dataset type is not explicitly stated, but the setup (200 bp one-hot, 3 outputs) is consistent with MPRA-like regression, STARR-seq activity prediction, or multi-task epigenomic signal prediction; therefore, preprocessing should include strict deduplication, train/val/test splitting by genomic region (or chromosome holdout) to avoid leakage, and label normalization (z-score per task for regression, or log1p transform if count-like). Because length is fixed at 200, no padding/truncation is needed; however, quality control should remove sequences with ambiguous bases (N) or map them to uniform probabilities (recommended: drop if >1% ambiguous, else replace with all-zero and track a mask). For large datasets, favor cleaning/filtering over heavy augmentation; use light augmentation only if biologically plausible (reverse-complement augmentation with probability 0.5, and random 0–5 bp shift if the assay is shift-invariant, implemented by circular or padded shift). Model selection rationale: choose a shared WeightNorm CNN backbone because it is efficient on 200 bp inputs, naturally learns motif detectors, and supports multi-task learning; multi-scale first-layer kernels (7/11/15) act as motif scanners at different widths while downstream dilated residual blocks capture spacing/interactions. The retrieved literature emphasizes interpretability through convolutional filters and in silico mutagenesis (“un-box” models using convolutional filters, attention maps, and in silico mutagenesis; Valeri et al., 2020, PMC), motivating explicit interpretability hooks in the experimental plan.\n\nExact architecture (layer-by-layer, with dimensions): Input X is (B,4,200). Stage A (multi-scale motif stem, parallel branches; all Conv1d use torch.nn.utils.weight_norm): Branch A1: WN-Conv1d(4->64, k=7, s=1, p=3), LeakyReLU(negative_slope=0.1), Dropout(p=0.10). Branch A2: WN-Conv1d(4->64, k=11, s=1, p=5), LeakyReLU(0.1), Dropout(0.10). Branch A3: WN-Conv1d(4->64, k=15, s=1, p=7), LeakyReLU(0.1), Dropout(0.10). Concatenate along channels: (B,192,200). Fuse + downsample: WN-Conv1d(192->256, k=1, s=1, p=0), LeakyReLU(0.1), then MaxPool1d(kernel=2, stride=2) giving (B,256,100). Stage B (residual blocks, same-length within block): Block B1 (no dilation): Main path: WN-Conv1d(256->256, k=3, s=1, p=1), LeakyReLU(0.1), Dropout(0.15), then WN-Conv1d(256->256, k=3, s=1, p=1); Residual add (identity) then LeakyReLU(0.1) output (B,256,100). Block B2 (dilation=2): WN-Conv1d(256->256, k=3, s=1, p=2, dilation=2), LeakyReLU(0.1), Dropout(0.15), WN-Conv1d(256->256, k=3, s=1, p=2, dilation=2), residual add, LeakyReLU -> (B,256,100). Block B3 (dilation=4): WN-Conv1d(256->256, k=3, s=1, p=4, dilation=4), LeakyReLU(0.1), Dropout(0.15), WN-Conv1d(256->256, k=3, s=1, p=4, dilation=4), residual add, LeakyReLU -> (B,256,100). Stage C (channel expansion + second downsample): WN-Conv1d(256->384, k=3, s=1, p=1), LeakyReLU(0.1), then MaxPool1d(k=2,s=2) -> (B,384,50). Stage D (residual blocks at 50 positions): Block D1 (no dilation): WN-Conv1d(384->384, k=3, s=1, p=1), LeakyReLU(0.1), Dropout(0.20), WN-Conv1d(384->384, k=3, s=1, p=1), residual add, LeakyReLU -> (B,384,50). Block D2 (dilation=2): WN-Conv1d(384->384, k=3, s=1, p=2, dilation=2), LeakyReLU(0.1), Dropout(0.20), WN-Conv1d(384->384, k=3, s=1, p=2, dilation=2), residual add, LeakyReLU -> (B,384,50). Backbone output pooling: compute GlobalAvgPool1d over length (50) -> (B,384) and GlobalMaxPool1d over length (50) -> (B,384), then concatenate -> backbone feature vector h of size (B,768). This pooling choice preserves both “presence” (max) and “overall activity” (avg), and yields a fixed 768-dim representation for all tasks.\n\nMulti-scale motif capture specifics (required): The explicit parallel conv stem uses kernels 7/11/15 to learn motif detectors of different effective lengths; because padding is (k-1)/2, each branch preserves length 200, enabling clean concatenation. After concatenation, a 1x1 convolution fuses across scales into 256 channels, letting the model learn weighted combinations of motif detectors and reduce dimensionality before deeper processing. Long-range dependencies are modeled by the dilated residual blocks (dilation 2 and 4 at length 100, then dilation 2 at length 50), increasing receptive field without excessive pooling; for example, at length 100, two stacked k=3 dilated convs with dilation=4 expand the receptive field substantially while preserving resolution. Residual connections ensure stable gradient flow for a deeper backbone and mitigate performance degradation as depth increases. If an ablation is desired, swap the parallel branches for a sequential dilated stack (dilations 1/2/4/8) while keeping parameter count similar; however, the parallel design typically improves motif-width coverage on short sequences. This design choice is consistent with common regulatory CNN motif-learning patterns and supports downstream interpretability by aligning first-layer filters with motif-like patterns (a practice commonly paired with in silico mutagenesis in interpretability workflows, as described in the retrieved “un-boxing” literature).\n\nHeads (three independent outputs) and exact dimensions: Shared feature h is (B,768). Head1 MLP: Linear(768->256), LeakyReLU(0.1), Dropout(p=0.30), Linear(256->64), LeakyReLU(0.1), Dropout(p=0.20), Linear(64->1). Head2 is identical but with independent parameters, producing y2 (B,1). Head3 is identical, producing y3 (B,1). Final output is torch.cat([y1,y2,y3], dim=1) -> (B,3) or return a tuple of three scalars depending on training loop preference. If tasks have different scales/noise, optionally add per-head LayerNorm(768) before the first Linear to stabilize, but keep it off by default to minimize moving parts alongside WeightNorm. For classification tasks (if applicable), apply per-head Sigmoid for binary or softmax for multi-class; for regression, output is linear and use MSE/Huber. To encourage shared representation but avoid negative transfer, the heads are moderately deep yet small; dropout is higher in heads (0.30) than backbone (0.10–0.20) to regularize task-specific fitting.\n\nInitialization, normalization, and training hyperparameters: All Conv1d and Linear layers use Kaiming/He initialization suited for LeakyReLU: torch.nn.init.kaiming_normal_(weight, a=0.1, mode='fan_out', nonlinearity='leaky_relu'); biases initialized to 0.0. WeightNorm is applied as torch.nn.utils.weight_norm(conv_layer) (and optionally on Linear layers in heads if desired, but keep Linear without WN initially for simplicity); when using WeightNorm, still initialize the underlying weight_v with Kaiming. BatchNorm is optional; if included, use BatchNorm1d with momentum=0.1 and eps=1e-5 after conv and before activation, but given explicit WeightNorm, the default recommendation is to omit BN to reduce interaction effects and keep inference simple. Optimizer: AdamW with lr=1e-3, betas=(0.9,0.999), weight_decay=1e-4; gradient clipping at 1.0 to stabilize multi-task training. Training schedule: cosine decay with 5% warmup steps (e.g., warmup for first 1–2 epochs), total 30–50 epochs with early stopping patience=6 on mean validation metric across tasks. Batch size suggestion: 256 if GPU memory allows (input is small), else 128; mixed precision (AMP) recommended for speed. Loss: if regression, per-task Huber(delta=1.0) or MSE; combine as weighted sum with weights inversely proportional to task variance (or use uncertainty weighting), and track Pearson/Spearman per task.\n\nParameter count estimate, target rationale, and compute efficiency: The design targets ~1.8–2.2M parameters (within the requested 0.5–5M). Rough breakdown: multi-scale stem convs (4->64 with k=7/11/15) contribute ~1.8k+2.8k+3.9k weights; fuse 1x1 (192->256) adds ~49k; residual stacks dominate (multiple 256->256 k=3 and 384->384 k=3 convs) contributing on the order of ~1.6–1.9M total; heads add ~0.66M (each head ~0.22M for 768->256->64->1). This parameter budget is appropriate for 77k samples because it provides sufficient capacity to learn motif combinations and task-shared features while remaining small enough to train quickly and limit overfitting risk compared with very large transformers. Computationally, all operations are 1D convolutions over max length 200 (then 100/50), making FLOPs modest; pooling reduces length early, and dilation increases receptive field without increasing length or parameters. WeightNorm adds negligible overhead and often improves optimization stability for CNNs, particularly when BN is omitted. For deployment, the model is a single backbone pass plus three small MLP heads; latency is low, and batch inference is efficient.\n\nInterpretability hooks and exact procedures (saliency, IG, in-silico mutagenesis, motif extraction): For gradient saliency, enable requires_grad on input one-hot tensor X, run forward to get y_task (choose one head or a weighted sum), then compute grads = torch.autograd.grad(y_task.sum(), X)[0], producing (B,4,200) attributions; aggregate to per-position importance via abs(grads).sum(dim=1) or grads*X (gradient×input) summed over channels. For Integrated Gradients, use baseline X0 = all-zeros (or GC-matched random baseline), choose steps m=64, compute IG = (X-X0) * (1/m) * sum_{i=1..m} grad(f(X0 + i/m*(X-X0))) across steps; return (B,4,200) attribution maps per task. For in-silico mutagenesis, for each position p, mutate within a window size W=11 (centered at p; clamp at edges) by flipping the one-hot base to each alternative base (3 alternatives per position), recompute output delta for each mutation, and store max |delta|; this yields a (200,) sensitivity profile and a 4x200 mutation effect map. Motif extraction: take top-K (e.g., K=5000) highest-saliency windows of length 15 from correctly predicted/high-confidence sequences, align them by peak position, and compute PWM by averaging one-hot in aligned windows; optionally also inspect first-layer convolutional filters by converting weight tensors to sequence logos. Provide hooks in code by exposing (a) the stem branch conv outputs (before pooling) and (b) the input gradients; register_forward_hook on stem convs and register_full_backward_hook for gradient capture. This aligns with the retrieved interpretability emphasis on “un-boxing” models via convolutional filters and in silico mutagenesis (Valeri et al., 2020, PMC) and complements regulatory genomics practice where motif-like patterns are derived from first-layer filters plus attribution maps.\n\nRequired architecture table and PyTorch skeleton (unambiguous, minimal but precise): The architecture table should list each layer with input/output shapes: (1) Input (B,4,200).

        "design_summary": "This plan targets gene regulatory element prediction from 200 bp one-hot DNA (B,4,200) with ~77,157 samples, which supports a moderate-capacity 1D CNN (≈1–3M parameters) without being overly prone to overfitting. The model uses a shared Conv1d backbone with explicit Weight Normalization on every Conv1d layer to stabilize optimization and decouple weight magnitude/direction while keeping the architecture computationally efficient. To capture motifs at multiple lengths, the first stage performs parallel multi-scale convolutions with kernel sizes 7/11/15 (all stride 1 with same padding), concatenates branch outputs channel-wise, and then uses a sequence of residual Conv1d blocks (including a dilated block stack) to model motif interactions and longer-range dependencies across the 200 bp window. The backbone ends with a combined global average pooling and global max pooling to preserve both presence and distributional information, producing a fixed-dimensional feature vector regardless of sequence length. Three independent heads (one per task) are implemented as separate small MLPs, each mapping the shared feature vector to one scalar output, collectively yielding a 3D output vector. Interpretability is built in through gradient-based saliency (dY/dX), Integrated Gradients baselines, and in-silico mutagenesis with a fixed window size to extract motif-like sensitivity patterns, aligning with common regulatory genomics interpretation practices (e.g., filter visualization and in silico mutagenesis approaches highlighted in the retrieved literature on “un-boxing” sequence models using convolutional filters and mutagenesis).",
        "detailed_design": {
          "design_recommendations": "Dataset and task characterization: With N=77,157 labeled sequences of fixed length 200 bp and one-hot encoding (4 channels), this is a large dataset (>10K) suitable for a moderate CNN with residual/dilated blocks and multi-task heads, targeting ~0.5–5M parameters to balance expressiveness and generalization. The dataset type is not explicitly stated, but the setup (200 bp one-hot, 3 outputs) is consistent with MPRA-like regression, STARR-seq activity prediction, or multi-task epigenomic signal prediction; therefore, preprocessing should include strict deduplication, train/val/test splitting by genomic region (or chromosome holdout) to avoid leakage, and label normalization (z-score per task for regression, or log1p transform if count-like). Because length is fixed at 200, no padding/truncation is needed; however, quality control should remove sequences with ambiguous bases (N) or map them to uniform probabilities (recommended: drop if >1% ambiguous, else replace with all-zero and track a mask). For large datasets, favor cleaning/filtering over heavy augmentation; use light augmentation only if biologically plausible (reverse-complement augmentation with probability 0.5, and random 0–5 bp shift if the assay is shift-invariant, implemented by circular or padded shift). Model selection rationale: choose a shared WeightNorm CNN backbone because it is efficient on 200 bp inputs, naturally learns motif detectors, and supports multi-task learning; multi-scale first-layer kernels (7/11/15) act as motif scanners at different widths while downstream dilated residual blocks capture spacing/interactions. The retrieved literature emphasizes interpretability through convolutional filters and in silico mutagenesis (“un-box” models using convolutional filters, attention maps, and in silico mutagenesis; Valeri et al., 2020, PMC), motivating explicit interpretability hooks in the experimental plan.\n\nExact architecture (layer-by-layer, with dimensions): Input X is (B,4,200). Stage A (multi-scale motif stem, parallel branches; all Conv1d use torch.nn.utils.weight_norm): Branch A1: WN-Conv1d(4->64, k=7, s=1, p=3), LeakyReLU(negative_slope=0.1), Dropout(p=0.10). Branch A2: WN-Conv1d(4->64, k=11, s=1, p=5), LeakyReLU(0.1), Dropout(0.10). Branch A3: WN-Conv1d(4->64, k=15, s=1, p=7), LeakyReLU(0.1), Dropout(0.10). Concatenate along channels: (B,192,200). Fuse + downsample: WN-Conv1d(192->256, k=1, s=1, p=0), LeakyReLU(0.1), then MaxPool1d(kernel=2, stride=2) giving (B,256,100). Stage B (residual blocks, same-length within block): Block B1 (no dilation): Main path: WN-Conv1d(256->256, k=3, s=1, p=1), LeakyReLU(0.1), Dropout(0.15), then WN-Conv1d(256->256, k=3, s=1, p=1); Residual add (identity) then LeakyReLU(0.1) output (B,256,100). Block B2 (dilation=2): WN-Conv1d(256->256, k=3, s=1, p=2, dilation=2), LeakyReLU(0.1), Dropout(0.15), WN-Conv1d(256->256, k=3, s=1, p=2, dilation=2), residual add, LeakyReLU -> (B,256,100). Block B3 (dilation=4): WN-Conv1d(256->256, k=3, s=1, p=4, dilation=4), LeakyReLU(0.1), Dropout(0.15), WN-Conv1d(256->256, k=3, s=1, p=4, dilation=4), residual add, LeakyReLU -> (B,256,100). Stage C (channel expansion + second downsample): WN-Conv1d(256->384, k=3, s=1, p=1), LeakyReLU(0.1), then MaxPool1d(k=2,s=2) -> (B,384,50). Stage D (residual blocks at 50 positions): Block D1 (no dilation): WN-Conv1d(384->384, k=3, s=1, p=1), LeakyReLU(0.1), Dropout(0.20), WN-Conv1d(384->384, k=3, s=1, p=1), residual add, LeakyReLU -> (B,384,50). Block D2 (dilation=2): WN-Conv1d(384->384, k=3, s=1, p=2, dilation=2), LeakyReLU(0.1), Dropout(0.20), WN-Conv1d(384->384, k=3, s=1, p=2, dilation=2), residual add, LeakyReLU -> (B,384,50). Backbone output pooling: compute GlobalAvgPool1d over length (50) -> (B,384) and GlobalMaxPool1d over length (50) -> (B,384), then concatenate -> backbone feature vector h of size (B,768). This pooling choice preserves both “presence” (max) and “overall activity” (avg), and yields a fixed 768-dim representation for all tasks.\n\nMulti-scale motif capture specifics (required): The explicit parallel conv stem uses kernels 7/11/15 to learn motif detectors of different effective lengths; because padding is (k-1)/2, each branch preserves length 200, enabling clean concatenation. After concatenation, a 1x1 convolution fuses across scales into 256 channels, letting the model learn weighted combinations of motif detectors and reduce dimensionality before deeper processing. Long-range dependencies are modeled by the dilated residual blocks (dilation 2 and 4 at length 100, then dilation 2 at length 50), increasing receptive field without excessive pooling; for example, at length 100, two stacked k=3 dilated convs with dilation=4 expand the receptive field substantially while preserving resolution. Residual connections ensure stable gradient flow for a deeper backbone and mitigate performance degradation as depth increases. If an ablation is desired, swap the parallel branches for a sequential dilated stack (dilations 1/2/4/8) while keeping parameter count similar; however, the parallel design typically improves motif-width coverage on short sequences. This design choice is consistent with common regulatory CNN motif-learning patterns and supports downstream interpretability by aligning first-layer filters with motif-like patterns (a practice commonly paired with in silico mutagenesis in interpretability workflows, as described in the retrieved “un-boxing” literature).\n\nHeads (three independent outputs) and exact dimensions: Shared feature h is (B,768). Head1 MLP: Linear(768->256), LeakyReLU(0.1), Dropout(p=0.30), Linear(256->64), LeakyReLU(0.1), Dropout(p=0.20), Linear(64->1). Head2 is identical but with independent parameters, producing y2 (B,1). Head3 is identical, producing y3 (B,1). Final output is torch.cat([y1,y2,y3], dim=1) -> (B,3) or return a tuple of three scalars depending on training loop preference. If tasks have different scales/noise, optionally add per-head LayerNorm(768) before the first Linear to stabilize, but keep it off by default to minimize moving parts alongside WeightNorm. For classification tasks (if applicable), apply per-head Sigmoid for binary or softmax for multi-class; for regression, output is linear and use MSE/Huber. To encourage shared representation but avoid negative transfer, the heads are moderately deep yet small; dropout is higher in heads (0.30) than backbone (0.10–0.20) to regularize task-specific fitting.\n\nInitialization, normalization, and training hyperparameters: All Conv1d and Linear layers use Kaiming/He initialization suited for LeakyReLU: torch.nn.init.kaiming_normal_(weight, a=0.1, mode='fan_out', nonlinearity='leaky_relu'); biases initialized to 0.0. WeightNorm is applied as torch.nn.utils.weight_norm(conv_layer) (and optionally on Linear layers in heads if desired, but keep Linear without WN initially for simplicity); when using WeightNorm, still initialize the underlying weight_v with Kaiming. BatchNorm is optional; if included, use BatchNorm1d with momentum=0.1 and eps=1e-5 after conv and before activation, but given explicit WeightNorm, the default recommendation is to omit BN to reduce interaction effects and keep inference simple. Optimizer: AdamW with lr=1e-3, betas=(0.9,0.999), weight_decay=1e-4; gradient clipping at 1.0 to stabilize multi-task training. Training schedule: cosine decay with 5% warmup steps (e.g., warmup for first 1–2 epochs), total 30–50 epochs with early stopping patience=6 on mean validation metric across tasks. Batch size suggestion: 256 if GPU memory allows (input is small), else 128; mixed precision (AMP) recommended for speed. Loss: if regression, per-task Huber(delta=1.0) or MSE; combine as weighted sum with weights inversely proportional to task variance (or use uncertainty weighting), and track Pearson/Spearman per task.\n\nParameter count estimate, target rationale, and compute efficiency: The design targets ~1.8–2.2M parameters (within the requested 0.5–5M). Rough breakdown: multi-scale stem convs (4->64 with k=7/11/15) contribute ~1.8k+2.8k+3.9k weights; fuse 1x1 (192->256) adds ~49k; residual stacks dominate (multiple 256->256 k=3 and 384->384 k=3 convs) contributing on the order of ~1.6–1.9M total; heads add ~0.66M (each head ~0.22M for 768->256->64->1). This parameter budget is appropriate for 77k samples because it provides sufficient capacity to learn motif combinations and task-shared features while remaining small enough to train quickly and limit overfitting risk compared with very large transformers. Computationally, all operations are 1D convolutions over max length 200 (then 100/50), making FLOPs modest; pooling reduces length early, and dilation increases receptive field without increasing length or parameters. WeightNorm adds negligible overhead and often improves optimization stability for CNNs, particularly when BN is omitted. For deployment, the model is a single backbone pass plus three small MLP heads; latency is low, and batch inference is efficient.\n\nInterpretability hooks and exact procedures (saliency, IG, in-silico mutagenesis, motif extraction): For gradient saliency, enable requires_grad on input one-hot tensor X, run forward to get y_task (choose one head or a weighted sum), then compute grads = torch.autograd.grad(y_task.sum(), X)[0], producing (B,4,200) attributions; aggregate to per-position importance via abs(grads).sum(dim=1) or grads*X (gradient×input) summed over channels. For Integrated Gradients, use baseline X0 = all-zeros (or GC-matched random baseline), choose steps m=64, compute IG = (X-X0) * (1/m) * sum_{i=1..m} grad(f(X0 + i/m*(X-X0))) across steps; return (B,4,200) attribution maps per task. For in-silico mutagenesis, for each position p, mutate within a window size W=11 (centered at p; clamp at edges) by flipping the one-hot base to each alternative base (3 alternatives per position), recompute output delta for each mutation, and store max |delta|; this yields a (200,) sensitivity profile and a 4x200 mutation effect map. Motif extraction: take top-K (e.g., K=5000) highest-saliency windows of length 15 from correctly predicted/high-confidence sequences, align them by peak position, and compute PWM by averaging one-hot in aligned windows; optionally also inspect first-layer convolutional filters by converting weight tensors to sequence logos. Provide hooks in code by exposing (a) the stem branch conv outputs (before pooling) and (b) the input gradients; register_forward_hook on stem convs and register_full_backward_hook for gradient capture. This aligns with the retrieved interpretability emphasis on “un-boxing” models via convolutional filters and in silico mutagenesis (Valeri et al., 2020, PMC) and complements regulatory genomics practice where motif-like patterns are derived from first-layer filters plus attribution maps.\n\nRequired architecture table and PyTorch skeleton (unambiguous, minimal but precise): The architecture table should list each layer with input/output shapes: (1) Input (B,4,200). (2) Branch7: WN-Conv1d(4,64,7,1,3)->(B,64,200), LReLU(0.1), Dropout0.10. (3) Branch11: WN-Conv1d(4,64,11,1,5)->(B,64,200), LReLU, Dropout0.10. (4) Branch15: WN-Conv1d(4,64,15,1,7)->(B,64,200), LReLU, Dropout0.10. (5) Concat ->(B,192,200). (6) Fuse: WN-Conv1d(192,256,1,1,0)->(B,256,200), LReLU. (7) MaxPool1d(2,2)->(B,256,100).

(16) Head t in {1,2,3}: Linear 768->256, LReLU, Dropout0.30; Linear 256->64, LReLU, Dropout0.20; Linear 64->1. PyTorch skeleton: define class SharedBackbone(nn.Module) with stem convs wrapped by weight_norm, forward returns h (B,768) and optionally intermediates; define class MultiTaskModel(nn.Module) with backbone + three nn.Sequential heads; forward returns torch.cat outputs. Ensure Conv1d layers are created then wrapped: conv = nn.Conv1d(...); conv = torch.nn.utils.weight_norm(conv). Residual block skeleton: two WN-Conv1d layers, dropout between, add identity, final activation; keep channels constant to avoid projection shortcuts in this baseline (add 1x1 projection only if channels change)."

        "discussion_notes": "The other experts’ opinions are largely consistent with the architecture direction: large dataset supports a moderate-capacity CNN/residual model; leakage-safe grouping and per-task normalization are essential; robust regression (Huber) is appropriate for MPRA noise. The main correction is to treat reverse-complement augmentation/RC-consistency as conditional because MPRA constructs can be strand/direction dependent. I agree with adopting lfcSE-aware weighting (prefer capped SE weights or learned task uncertainty) and with running targeted ablations (including normalization choices) to validate stability and generalization. I also recommend a small, efficient global-context block if validation suggests CNN+dilations under-captures longer-range dependencies, while keeping parameter count controlled.",

      "design_summary": "This evaluation scheme treats the task as multi-task regression across cell lines (tasks), with Pearson correlation per cell line on a held-out test set as the primary endpoint, complemented by Spearman correlation, MSE/MAE, and a macro-averaged (mean) Pearson across tasks for a single headline number. Targets are evaluated in the original biological scale whenever training used standardization; Pearson is computed on de-standardized predictions/targets to preserve interpretable effect sizes and avoid scale artifacts, while also optionally reporting the “raw standardized-space” Pearson as a diagnostic. Uncertainty is quantified per task via nonparametric bootstrap with 1,000 resamples at the sequence level to produce 95% confidence intervals for Pearson, Spearman, MSE, and MAE. Cell-type specificity is validated using the provided MinGap column by (i) correlating predicted cell-type contrasts with MinGap (a label-derived specificity proxy) and (ii) stratifying elements by MinGap quantiles and computing within-stratum performance, explicitly testing whether higher MinGap corresponds to stronger, more predictable specificity. Model selection is driven by mean validation Pearson across cell lines with early stopping, while comparisons among ablations use paired bootstrap tests and/or Fisher z-transform tests on Pearson differences with Holm–Bonferroni correction at alpha=0.05. Diagnostics include calibration plots for regression, residual distribution/heteroscedasticity checks, per-cell-type scatter plots, and error versus lfcSE bins to assess uncertainty-aware failure modes, aligning with common evaluation practices in regulatory element prediction studies where correlation and stratified analyses are emphasized (e.g., comparative assessments across assay types and cell contexts in Nowling et al., 2023, PMC; and general CRM method assessment principles in Su et al., 2010, PMC).",

        "design_recommendations": "1) Dataset characteristics and evaluation unit definition: Treat each sequence/regulatory element as the sampling unit, with a vector of continuous targets across K cell lines (multi-output regression), and ensure that all metrics and bootstrap resamples operate at the element level to preserve within-element cross-cell correlation structure. Before any metric computation, summarize target distributions per cell line (mean, SD, skew, % near-zero), and summarize lfcSE (if present) per cell line (median, IQR) to anticipate heteroscedastic errors; use these summaries to justify stratified diagnostics (error vs lfcSE bins). If the dataset includes replicated measurements per element, aggregate replicates into a single target per cell line using inverse-variance weighting w=1/(lfcSE^2) when lfcSE is available; otherwise use the arithmetic mean, and carry forward an aggregated uncertainty estimate (e.g., sqrt(1/sum(w))). Define the held-out test set at the element level with no overlap in sequence identity between splits; if sequences are highly similar (e.g., tiled variants), split by group/cluster to avoid leakage, consistent with evaluation cautions in CRM assessment literature (Su et al., 2010, PMC). If there are distinct assay types or libraries, treat them as strata and enforce stratified splitting to maintain comparable distributions across train/val/test, reflecting that prediction accuracy varies systematically by technique (Nowling et al., 2023, PMC). 2) Primary metric suite and exact computation specs: Primary endpoint is Pearson correlation r computed separately for each cell line c on the held-out test set of N elements: r_c = cov(y_c, yhat_c) / (sd(y_c)*sd(yhat_c)), where y_c and yhat_c are length-N vectors of de-standardized true and predicted values for that cell line. De-standardization rule (if training used z-scoring per cell line): yhat_c,orig = yhat_c,std * sigma_c,train + mu_c,train and y_c,orig = y_c,std * sigma_c,train + mu_c,train, using mu/sigma computed on training targets only to avoid leakage; Pearson is computed on orig scale, and ties to reporting in many sequence-to-function regression tasks where correlation is favored for scale-invariant performance (Nowling et al., 2023, PMC). Also report Spearman rho per cell line (rank correlation, computed on orig scale, with average ranks for ties), plus MSE_c = mean((y_c,orig - yhat_c,orig)^2) and MAE_c = mean(|y_c,orig - yhat_c,orig|). Report macro-averaged mean Pearson across tasks: r_mean = (1/K) * sum_c r_c; additionally report a sample-size-weighted mean Pearson r_wt = sum_c (N_c * r_c)/sum_c N_c if missingness differs by cell line. For completeness, report a “micro-Pearson” computed by concatenating all cell line targets/predictions into a single vector (after de-standardization) only as a secondary summary, because it can be dominated by high-variance cell lines; macro-averaging is the default selection criterion. Thresholds for contextual interpretation: r_c > 0.60 is labeled “good”, 0.40–0.60 “moderate”, 0.20–0.40 “weak”, and <0.20 “poor”, with the caveat that achievable r depends on assay noise and technique (Nowling et al., 2023, PMC). 3) Bootstrap confidence intervals (per task) with parameterization: For each cell line c, compute 95% CIs for Pearson, Spearman, MSE, and MAE using nonparametric bootstrap with B=1000 resamples of the test elements. Resampling procedure: sample N indices with replacement from {1..N}; for each b, compute metric m_c^(b) on the resampled pairs (y_c,orig[i_b], yhat_c,orig[i_b]); then CI is the percentile interval [q_0.025, q_0.975] of {m_c^(b)}. Use the same bootstrap indices across models when comparing ablations (paired bootstrap) to reduce variance and enforce pairing, and use a fixed random seed (e.g., seed=2025) for reproducibility in reporting. For Pearson specifically, if bootstrap distribution is highly skewed or near ±1, optionally compute CI on Fisher z space: z = atanh(r), bootstrap z, then transform back with tanh; report which method is used, defaulting to percentile on r for simplicity and Fisher-z for edge cases. Also compute CI for r_mean via bootstrap by computing r_c^(b) for all c on the same resample and then averaging to r_mean^(b); CI is percentiles of {r_mean^(b)}. Report bootstrap failure rates (e.g., sd(yhat)=0 in a resample) and handle by skipping those draws; if >1% draws fail for a task, flag it as an instability diagnostic. 4) MinGap-based specificity validation (exact use of MinGap column): Interpret MinGap_i as a label-derived specificity proxy per element i (larger MinGap indicates stronger separation between a “preferred” and “non-preferred” cell context, or generally higher specificity). First define predicted specificity per element using predicted cell-type contrasts: for element i with predictions across K cell lines, let pred_gap_i = max_c(yhat_i,c,orig) - secondmax_c(yhat_i,c,orig) (top-1 minus top-2 predicted activity); optionally also compute pred_range_i = max_c(yhat_i,c,orig) - min_c(yhat_i,c,orig) as a broader contrast. Correlation analysis: compute Spearman correlation between MinGap and pred_gap across test elements: rho_gap = Spearman(MinGap, pred_gap); bootstrap CI with B=1000 resamples of elements, reporting 95% CI and p-value via bootstrap percentile or permutation (10,000 permutations recommended if feasible) for robustness. Stratified performance: split test elements into Q=5 quantiles (quintiles) by MinGap (Q1 lowest specificity to Q5 highest) using cutpoints on the test set only; within each quantile q, compute per-cell-line Pearson r_c,q and macro-mean r_mean,q, then test monotonic trend across quantiles using Spearman correlation between quantile index (1..5) and r_mean,q (or use Jonckheere–Terpstra if implementing a formal ordered alternative). Additionally, compute “specificity classification consistency” by checking whether argmax_c(yhat_i,c,orig) matches argmax_c(y_i,c,orig) (winner-takes-all cell line) and report accuracy per MinGap quantile; expectation is higher accuracy in higher MinGap bins if MinGap encodes clearer cell preference. Report effect sizes: delta_r = r_mean,Q5 - r_mean,Q1 and its bootstrap CI to quantify how much specificity strength changes predictability. This aligns with broader regulatory element evaluation themes that emphasize cell-type-specific performance stratification (e.g., motif-based prediction varies across cell contexts in Cornejo-Páramo et al., 2025, PMC). 5) Model selection and early stopping (validation metric and parameters): Select the checkpoint that maximizes mean validation Pearson across cell lines (macro-average) computed on de-standardized values, denoted r_mean,val, evaluated once per epoch. Early stopping rule: patience=10 epochs, min_delta=0.002 in r_mean,val (i.e., require at least +0.002 improvement to reset patience), with a maximum of 200 epochs; store the best checkpoint by r_mean,val and break training after patience is exhausted. If validation set is small or noisy, smooth r_mean,val with an exponential moving average (EMA) with decay=0.6 for early-stopping decisions while still reporting raw values; explicitly state which is used for stopping versus reporting. Tie-breakers: if two checkpoints have r_mean,val within 0.001, choose the one with lower val MSE (macro-averaged) to prefer better absolute calibration. Guard against overfitting to a single cell line by also requiring that at least 70% of cell lines have non-decreasing Pearson relative to the previous best checkpoint (a stability constraint); if violated, flag and optionally use a multi-objective rank (maximize r_mean,val and minimize variance of r_c,val across cell lines). This selection design is consistent with correlation-centric reporting in regulatory element prediction comparisons, where per-context performance can differ materially (Nowling et al., 2023, PMC). 6) Statistical comparisons for ablations (paired tests, Fisher z, multiple testing): For each ablation A vs baseline B, compute paired differences in Pearson per cell line on the same test set: d_c = r_c(B) - r_c(A), and report d_c with 95% paired bootstrap CI using the shared bootstrap indices across models (B=1000). For a global comparison across cell lines, compute d_mean = (1/K) * sum_c d_c and its bootstrap CI; declare significance if the Holm–Bonferroni-adjusted p-value < 0.05. P-values from paired bootstrap: p = 2*min(P(d_mean^(b) <= 0), P(d_mean^(b) >= 0)) using the bootstrap distribution of d_mean^(b) (centered at 0), with the same approach optionally applied per cell line. As an alternative or confirmation for Pearson differences per cell line, apply Fisher z-transform: z = atanh(r), standard error approx se = 1/sqrt(N-3); test statistic t = (z_B - z_A)/sqrt(2*se^2) if correlations are treated as independent; however, because predictions are paired on the same y, prefer paired bootstrap as the primary test and use Fisher-z only as a sensitivity analysis. Correct for multiple ablations and/or multiple cell lines using Holm–Bonferroni (family defined as all hypothesis tests reported in the main table; alpha=0.05). Report both adjusted and unadjusted p-values, and emphasize effect sizes (delta Pearson, delta MSE) over p-values to avoid overinterpretation, consistent with best practice in method comparison studies (Su et al., 2010, PMC). 7) Diagnostics and plots (required panels and parameter settings): Per-cell-type scatter plots: for each cell line, plot y_orig vs yhat_orig on test with an overlaid y=x line; annotate r, rho, MAE, and n, and set axis limits to [p1, p99] percentiles to reduce outlier domination (keep outliers plotted with transparency alpha=0.2). Calibration for regression: bin predictions into M=10 equal-frequency bins per cell line, compute mean(yhat) and mean(y) per bin, plot mean(y) vs mean(yhat) with error bars (±1 SE via bootstrap within-bin) and report calibration slope/intercept from a linear fit y = a + b*yhat; “good” calibration is b in [0.9, 1.1] and |a| < 0.1*sd(y). Residual analysis: compute residual e_i,c = y_i,c,orig - yhat_i,c,orig; plot residual histograms (50 bins), Q–Q plots, and residual vs prediction to inspect heteroscedasticity; flag if Breusch–Pagan p<0.01 (optional) or if residual variance increases >2x from lowest to highest prediction decile. Error vs lfcSE bins: within each cell line, bin elements by lfcSE into 5 quantiles and compute MAE and Pearson per bin; expectation is worse error at higher lfcSE, and deviations (e.g., flat or inverted trend) can indicate model mis-specification or label noise handling issues. Also include “influence/outlier” diagnostics: report the top 1% absolute residual elements and whether they cluster by sequence family or extreme MinGap, to guide biological follow-up. These plots support interpretation of why correlations differ across contexts and are commonly used in sequence-to-function model evaluation beyond single summary metrics (Nowling et al., 2023, PMC). 8) Reporting template (tables, figures, and acceptance thresholds): Main Table 1 (Test performance per cell line): columns = cell_line, N_test, Pearson r (95% CI), Spearman rho (95% CI), MSE (95% CI), MAE (95% CI); add a final row with macro-mean across cell lines with bootstrap CI. Main Table 2 (Ablation deltas): for each ablation, report delta r_mean (95% CI), adjusted p-value (Holm), and per-cell-line delta r_c (optionally in supplement). Table 3 (MinGap specificity): report rho(MinGap, pred_gap) with CI, r_mean per MinGap quintile with CI, and delta_r (Q5-Q1) with CI; include winner-cell accuracy per quintile if applicable. Figure set: Fig 1 per-cell-type scatter grid (K panels), Fig 2 calibration curves (K panels or representative), Fig 3 residual diagnostics (aggregate + per cell line), Fig 4 MinGap stratification curves and pred_gap vs MinGap scatter with smooth (LOESS span=0.75). Predefine “good performance” as: (i) r_mean,test >= 0.60 with lower CI bound >= 0.50, (ii) at least 70% of cell lines have r_c >= 0.50, and (iii) positive specificity association rho_gap >= 0.30 with CI excluding 0; these are contextual thresholds and should be interpreted relative to assay noise and baseline models. Provide a concise model card appendix listing data split IDs, target scaling parameters (mu/sigma), bootstrap seed, and exact metric definitions to ensure reproducibility, reflecting reproducibility emphasis in method assessments (Su et al., 2010, PMC)."

        "design_summary": "This evaluation scheme treats the task as multi-task regression across cell lines (tasks), with Pearson correlation per cell line on a held-out test set as the primary endpoint, complemented by Spearman correlation, MSE/MAE, and a macro-averaged (mean) Pearson across tasks for a single headline number. Targets are evaluated in the original biological scale whenever training used standardization; Pearson is computed on de-standardized predictions/targets to preserve interpretable effect sizes and avoid scale artifacts, while also optionally reporting the “raw standardized-space” Pearson as a diagnostic. Uncertainty is quantified per task via nonparametric bootstrap with 1,000 resamples at the sequence level to produce 95% confidence intervals for Pearson, Spearman, MSE, and MAE. Cell-type specificity is validated using the provided MinGap column by (i) correlating predicted cell-type contrasts with MinGap (a label-derived specificity proxy) and (ii) stratifying elements by MinGap quantiles and computing within-stratum performance, explicitly testing whether higher MinGap corresponds to stronger, more predictable specificity. Model selection is driven by mean validation Pearson across cell lines with early stopping, while comparisons among ablations use paired bootstrap tests and/or Fisher z-transform tests on Pearson differences with Holm–Bonferroni correction at alpha=0.05. Diagnostics include calibration plots for regression, residual distribution/heteroscedasticity checks, per-cell-type scatter plots, and error versus lfcSE bins to assess uncertainty-aware failure modes, aligning with common evaluation practices in regulatory element prediction studies where correlation and stratified analyses are emphasized (e.g., comparative assessments across assay types and cell contexts in Nowling et al., 2023, PMC; and general CRM method assessment principles in Su et al., 2010, PMC).",
        "detailed_design": {
          "design_recommendations": "1) Dataset characteristics and evaluation unit definition: Treat each sequence/regulatory element as the sampling unit, with a vector of continuous targets across K cell lines (multi-output regression), and ensure that all metrics and bootstrap resamples operate at the element level to preserve within-element cross-cell correlation structure. Before any metric computation, summarize target distributions per cell line (mean, SD, skew, % near-zero), and summarize lfcSE (if present) per cell line (median, IQR) to anticipate heteroscedastic errors; use these summaries to justify stratified diagnostics (error vs lfcSE bins). If the dataset includes replicated measurements per element, aggregate replicates into a single target per cell line using inverse-variance weighting w=1/(lfcSE^2) when lfcSE is available; otherwise use the arithmetic mean, and carry forward an aggregated uncertainty estimate (e.g., sqrt(1/sum(w))). Define the held-out test set at the element level with no overlap in sequence identity between splits; if sequences are highly similar (e.g., tiled variants), split by group/cluster to avoid leakage, consistent with evaluation cautions in CRM assessment literature (Su et al., 2010, PMC). If there are distinct assay types or libraries, treat them as strata and enforce stratified splitting to maintain comparable distributions across train/val/test, reflecting that prediction accuracy varies systematically by technique (Nowling et al., 2023, PMC). 2) Primary metric suite and exact computation specs: Primary endpoint is Pearson correlation r computed separately for each cell line c on the held-out test set of N elements: r_c = cov(y_c, yhat_c) / (sd(y_c)*sd(yhat_c)), where y_c and yhat_c are length-N vectors of de-standardized true and predicted values for that cell line. De-standardization rule (if training used z-scoring per cell line): yhat_c,orig = yhat_c,std * sigma_c,train + mu_c,train and y_c,orig = y_c,std * sigma_c,train + mu_c,train, using mu/sigma computed on training targets only to avoid leakage; Pearson is computed on orig scale, and ties to reporting in many sequence-to-function regression tasks where correlation is favored for scale-invariant performance (Nowling et al., 2023, PMC). Also report Spearman rho per cell line (rank correlation, computed on orig scale, with average ranks for ties), plus MSE_c = mean((y_c,orig - yhat_c,orig)^2) and MAE_c = mean(|y_c,orig - yhat_c,orig|). Report macro-averaged mean Pearson across tasks: r_mean = (1/K) * sum_c r_c; additionally report a sample-size-weighted mean Pearson r_wt = sum_c (N_c * r_c)/sum_c N_c if missingness differs by cell line. For completeness, report a “micro-Pearson” computed by concatenating all cell line targets/predictions into a single vector (after de-standardization) only as a secondary summary, because it can be dominated by high-variance cell lines; macro-averaging is the default selection criterion. Thresholds for contextual interpretation: r_c > 0.60 is labeled “good”, 0.40–0.60 “moderate”, 0.20–0.40 “weak”, and <0.20 “poor”, with the caveat that achievable r depends on assay noise and technique (Nowling et al., 2023, PMC). 3) Bootstrap confidence intervals (per task) with parameterization: For each cell line c, compute 95% CIs for Pearson, Spearman, MSE, and MAE using nonparametric bootstrap with B=1000 resamples of the test elements. Resampling procedure: sample N indices with replacement from {1..N}; for each b, compute metric m_c^(b) on the resampled pairs (y_c,orig[i_b], yhat_c,orig[i_b]); then CI is the percentile interval [q_0.025, q_0.975] of {m_c^(b)}. Use the same bootstrap indices across models when comparing ablations (paired bootstrap) to reduce variance and enforce pairing, and use a fixed random seed (e.g., seed=2025) for reproducibility in reporting. For Pearson specifically, if bootstrap distribution is highly skewed or near ±1, optionally compute CI on Fisher z space: z = atanh(r), bootstrap z, then transform back with tanh; report which method is used, defaulting to percentile on r for simplicity and Fisher-z for edge cases. Also compute CI for r_mean via bootstrap by computing r_c^(b) for all c on the same resample and then averaging to r_mean^(b); CI is percentiles of {r_mean^(b)}. Report bootstrap failure rates (e.g., sd(yhat)=0 in a resample) and handle by skipping those draws; if >1% draws fail for a task, flag it as an instability diagnostic. 4) MinGap-based specificity validation (exact use of MinGap column): Interpret MinGap_i as a label-derived specificity proxy per element i (larger MinGap indicates stronger separation between a “preferred” and “non-preferred” cell context, or generally higher specificity). First define predicted specificity per element using predicted cell-type contrasts: for element i with predictions across K cell lines, let pred_gap_i = max_c(yhat_i,c,orig) - secondmax_c(yhat_i,c,orig) (top-1 minus top-2 predicted activity); optionally also compute pred_range_i = max_c(yhat_i,c,orig) - min_c(yhat_i,c,orig) as a broader contrast. Correlation analysis: compute Spearman correlation between MinGap and pred_gap across test elements: rho_gap = Spearman(MinGap, pred_gap); bootstrap CI with B=1000 resamples of elements, reporting 95% CI and p-value via bootstrap percentile or permutation (10,000 permutations recommended if feasible) for robustness. Stratified performance: split test elements into Q=5 quantiles (quintiles) by MinGap (Q1 lowest specificity to Q5 highest) using cutpoints on the test set only; within each quantile q, compute per-cell-line Pearson r_c,q and macro-mean r_mean,q, then test monotonic trend across quantiles using Spearman correlation between quantile index (1..5) and r_mean,q (or use Jonckheere–Terpstra if implementing a formal ordered alternative). Additionally, compute “specificity classification consistency” by checking whether argmax_c(yhat_i,c,orig) matches argmax_c(y_i,c,orig) (winner-takes-all cell line) and report accuracy per MinGap quantile; expectation is higher accuracy in higher MinGap bins if MinGap encodes clearer cell preference. Report effect sizes: delta_r = r_mean,Q5 - r_mean,Q1 and its bootstrap CI to quantify how much specificity strength changes predictability. This aligns with broader regulatory element evaluation themes that emphasize cell-type-specific performance stratification (e.g., motif-based prediction varies across cell contexts in Cornejo-Páramo et al., 2025, PMC). 5) Model selection and early stopping (validation metric and parameters): Select the checkpoint that maximizes mean validation Pearson across cell lines (macro-average) computed on de-standardized values, denoted r_mean,val, evaluated once per epoch. Early stopping rule: patience=10 epochs, min_delta=0.002 in r_mean,val (i.e., require at least +0.002 improvement to reset patience), with a maximum of 200 epochs; store the best checkpoint by r_mean,val and break training after patience is exhausted. If validation set is small or noisy, smooth r_mean,val with an exponential moving average (EMA) with decay=0.6 for early-stopping decisions while still reporting raw values; explicitly state which is used for stopping versus reporting. Tie-breakers: if two checkpoints have r_mean,val within 0.001, choose the one with lower val MSE (macro-averaged) to prefer better absolute calibration. Guard against overfitting to a single cell line by also requiring that at least 70% of cell lines have non-decreasing Pearson relative to the previous best checkpoint (a stability constraint); if violated, flag and optionally use a multi-objective rank (maximize r_mean,val and minimize variance of r_c,val across cell lines). This selection design is consistent with correlation-centric reporting in regulatory element prediction comparisons, where per-context performance can differ materially (Nowling et al., 2023, PMC). 6) Statistical comparisons for ablations (paired tests, Fisher z, multiple testing): For each ablation A vs baseline B, compute paired differences in Pearson per cell line on the same test set: d_c = r_c(B) - r_c(A), and report d_c with 95% paired bootstrap CI using the shared bootstrap indices across models (B=1000). For a global comparison across cell lines, compute d_mean = (1/K) * sum_c d_c and its bootstrap CI; declare significance if the Holm–Bonferroni-adjusted p-value < 0.05. P-values from paired bootstrap: p = 2*min(P(d_mean^(b) <= 0), P(d_mean^(b) >= 0)) using the bootstrap distribution of d_mean^(b) (centered at 0), with the same approach optionally applied per cell line. As an alternative or confirmation for Pearson differences per cell line, apply Fisher z-transform: z = atanh(r), standard error approx se = 1/sqrt(N-3); test statistic t = (z_B - z_A)/sqrt(2*se^2) if correlations are treated as independent; however, because predictions are paired on the same y, prefer paired bootstrap as the primary test and use Fisher-z only as a sensitivity analysis. Correct for multiple ablations and/or multiple cell lines using Holm–Bonferroni (family defined as all hypothesis tests reported in the main table; alpha=0.05). Report both adjusted and unadjusted p-values, and emphasize effect sizes (delta Pearson, delta MSE) over p-values to avoid overinterpretation, consistent with best practice in method comparison studies (Su et al., 2010, PMC). 7) Diagnostics and plots (required panels and parameter settings): Per-cell-type scatter plots: for each cell line, plot y_orig vs yhat_orig on test with an overlaid y=x line; annotate r, rho, MAE, and n, and set axis limits to [p1, p99] percentiles to reduce outlier domination (keep outliers plotted with transparency alpha=0.2). Calibration for regression: bin predictions into M=10 equal-frequency bins per cell line, compute mean(yhat) and mean(y) per bin, plot mean(y) vs mean(yhat) with error bars (±1 SE via bootstrap within-bin) and report calibration slope/intercept from a linear fit y = a + b*yhat; “good” calibration is b in [0.9, 1.1] and |a| < 0.1*sd(y). Residual analysis: compute residual e_i,c = y_i,c,orig - yhat_i,c,orig; plot residual histograms (50 bins), Q–Q plots, and residual vs prediction to inspect heteroscedasticity; flag if Breusch–Pagan p<0.01 (optional) or if residual variance increases >2x from lowest to highest prediction decile. Error vs lfcSE bins: within each cell line, bin elements by lfcSE into 5 quantiles and compute MAE and Pearson per bin; expectation is worse error at higher lfcSE, and deviations (e.g., flat or inverted trend) can indicate model mis-specification or label noise handling issues. Also include “influence/outlier” diagnostics: report the top 1% absolute residual elements and whether they cluster by sequence family or extreme MinGap, to guide biological follow-up. These plots support interpretation of why correlations differ across contexts and are commonly used in sequence-to-function model evaluation beyond single summary metrics (Nowling et al., 2023, PMC). 8) Reporting template (tables, figures, and acceptance thresholds): Main Table 1 (Test performance per cell line): columns = cell_line, N_test, Pearson r (95% CI), Spearman rho (95% CI), MSE (95% CI), MAE (95% CI); add a final row with macro-mean across cell lines with bootstrap CI. Main Table 2 (Ablation deltas): for each ablation, report delta r_mean (95% CI), adjusted p-value (Holm), and per-cell-line delta r_c (optionally in supplement). Table 3 (MinGap specificity): report rho(MinGap, pred_gap) with CI, r_mean per MinGap quintile with CI, and delta_r (Q5-Q1) with CI; include winner-cell accuracy per quintile if applicable. Figure set: Fig 1 per-cell-type scatter grid (K panels), Fig 2 calibration curves (K panels or representative), Fig 3 residual diagnostics (aggregate + per cell line), Fig 4 MinGap stratification curves and pred_gap vs MinGap scatter with smooth (LOESS span=0.75). Predefine “good performance” as: (i) r_mean,test >= 0.60 with lower CI bound >= 0.50, (ii) at least 70% of cell lines have r_c >= 0.50, and (iii) positive specificity association rho_gap >= 0.30 with CI excluding 0; these are contextual thresholds and should be interpreted relative to assay noise and baseline models. Provide a concise model card appendix listing data split IDs, target scaling parameters (mu/sigma), bootstrap seed, and exact metric definitions to ensure reproducibility, reflecting reproducibility emphasis in method assessments (Su et al., 2010, PMC)."

        "discussion_notes": "Overall, my original evaluation plan is consistent with other experts: leakage-safe splitting/deduplication (Data Management/Model Architect) and careful handling of strand-invariance assumptions (Methodology) both directly affect the validity of reported metrics. I agree with the Data Management expert that RC augmentation may be invalid if the assay is direction-dependent; therefore, evaluation should also include a strand-consistency diagnostic (forward vs reverse-complement predictions) but not assume invariance unless experimentally justified. I also agree with the suggestion to incorporate lfcSE-aware metrics rather than only filtering, because MPRA pipelines highlight technical variability and outlier barcodes as material drivers of downstream estimates [Rosen et al. 2025: 5aa56ceacd6300f1; Keukeleire et al. 2025: 7e82169680e9e6d2]. I am supplementing my plan with (1) explicit MinGap definition alignment, (2) robust correlation sensitivity (winsorization), (3) cluster/group bootstrap, and (4) an external/LOCO-style generalization evaluation option, consistent with literature emphasizing that random splits can overestimate performance under genomic distribution shift [LOCO-EPI arXiv 2025: dcde68d8f42cbee4] and that cross-cell-type transfer can be challenging [Kreimer et al. 2019: e92ba9a50867a854].",

Metrics: Evaluate performance using Pearson correlation per cell type and MinGap for specificity validation.",
    "data_usage_plan": {
      "design_recommendations": "1) Dataset profiling and type confirmation: Using the provided columns ['sequence','target_cell','K562_l2fc','HepG2_l2fc','SKNSH_l2fc','MinGap','K562_lfcSE','HepG2_lfcSE','SKNSH_lfcSE'] and 77,157 rows, this is best characterized as an MPRA-derived multi-output regression dataset where each row is a synthetic/natural 200 bp regulatory sequence with measured activity in three cell lines, reported as log2 fold change (l2fc) with associated standard errors (lfcSE). This implies label noise is heteroskedastic and should be addressed by uncertainty-aware filtering and/or loss weighting; for data management, we prioritize filtering rules that are explicit and reproducible. Sequence length should be validated by computing length for every row and summarizing mean/median/min/max and outlier counts (e.g., count of length != 200). The expected distribution is a delta at 200 bp; if not, the plan defines strict handling: (a) preferred: drop sequences with length != 200 if they are rare (<0.5% of rows), (b) otherwise: trim longer sequences to the central 200 bp and pad shorter sequences with 'N' to 200 and mark them with a QC flag for downstream sensitivity analyses. Because the dataset is large, we also recommend computing duplication rate (exact identical sequences), GC-content distribution (mean/SD and tails), and per-target summary statistics (l2fc mean/SD, percentiles) as part of profiling to guide outlier policies. These recommendations align with community emphasis on robust MPRA QC and variability control (e.g., standardized QC frameworks and outlier identification described in MPRA QC pipelines such as esMPRA and uniform processing standards such as MPRAsnakeflow/MPRAlib from IGVF efforts).\n\n2) QC / cleaning with explicit lfcSE filtering rule: Implement a deterministic filter based on measurement uncertainty using the three standard error columns K562_lfcSE, HepG2_lfcSE, SKNSH_lfcSE with the threshold lfcSE > 0.5. Because ambiguity exists (filter per cell line vs. only the target_cell’s SE), define and document two exact, mutually exclusive rules: Rule A (strict multi-task reliability): DROP a row if ANY of the three SE values exceeds 0.5, i.e., drop if max(K562_lfcSE, HepG2_lfcSE, SKNSH_lfcSE) > 0.5; this ensures all three regression labels for a retained sequence are relatively reliable. Rule B (target-cell-only reliability): DROP a row only if the SE corresponding to target_cell exceeds 0.5; concretely, map target_cell in {K562,HepG2,SKNSH} to the matching *_lfcSE column and drop if that single SE > 0.5, allowing retention if non-target tasks are noisy. Recommendation: prefer Rule A for multi-task training where the model jointly predicts all three activities, because noisy targets in any head can destabilize optimization and bias shared feature learning; Rule B is acceptable if target_cell is used as the primary supervision and other heads are auxiliary/weak. In addition, record the number of rows removed under each rule and the post-filter distributions of l2fc to ensure filtering does not collapse dynamic range; if Rule A removes >30% of data, consider raising threshold to 0.6 or switching to Rule B plus per-task loss weighting by 1/(lfcSE^2 + 1e-6). This approach is consistent with MPRA best-practice emphasis on identifying technical variability sources and filtering out unreliable measurements (as highlighted in MPRA QC/standardization efforts like esMPRA and IGVF MPRA processing standards).\n\n3) Missing/invalid values, sequence sanitization, and N handling: Define invalid sequences as any containing characters outside {A,C,G,T,N} (case-insensitive); immediately drop rows with other IUPAC codes (e.g., R,Y,S,W,K,M) unless you explicitly implement probabilistic mapping for them. For Ns, implement a two-tier policy: if N_fraction = count('N')/length(sequence) > 0.0 (strict) then drop, OR if you want a less aggressive option, drop only if N_fraction > 0.01 (i.e., >2 Ns in 200 bp) and otherwise keep. Recommendation for this large dataset: use N_fraction > 0.0 (drop any N) as the default because you have ample data volume (77k) and Ns introduce ambiguous k-mers that can degrade motif learning; keep the relaxed threshold (1%) as a fallback if too many sequences are removed. If sequences with small N_fraction are kept, encode N as a uniform distribution [0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25] at that position (float32), which preserves expected base frequency without injecting a specific nucleotide. Also drop rows with missing numeric targets/SEs (NaN/Inf) and define explicit range checks: lfcSE must be >0 and <5 (hard sanity bounds), and l2fc should be finite with optional winsorization at the 0.1 and 99.9 percentiles per cell line if extreme outliers are present. Maintain a QC report that logs counts removed by each rule (invalid chars, length mismatch, N filter, lfcSE filter, NaNs) to support reproducibility and auditability.\n\n4) Encoding specification (exact tensor layout and dtype): Use a channel-first one-hot encoding with float32 output tensor shape (B, 4, 200), where B is batch size. Define base-to-channel mapping exactly as: A->[1,0,0,0], C->[0,1,0,0], G->[0,0,1,0], T->[0,0,0,1]; for N (if allowed under the relaxed N policy) use [0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25]. Enforce uppercase transformation and verify post-encoding that each position sums to 1.0 (within float tolerance) for A/C/G/T/N; for dropped invalid bases this check is not needed because they are excluded upstream. Keep a deterministic sequence order (5’->3’) and only apply reverse-complement augmentation explicitly as described later; do not implicitly canonicalize sequences because strand information can matter in some MPRA designs. Store encoded arrays in a memory-efficient format for 77k sequences: either on-the-fly encoding in the DataLoader (CPU) or pre-encode and save as an mmap/NPY/Zarr array; with 77,157*4*200 float32 ≈ 246 MB, pre-encoding is feasible and can improve training throughput. If pre-encoding, also store an index mapping from row_id to original CSV row for traceability.\n\n5) Target construction and normalization (train-only scalers): Treat targets as a 3D regression vector y = [K562_l2fc, HepG2_l2fc, SKNSH_l2fc] per row, regardless of target_cell; use target_cell as auxiliary metadata (see splitting/bias checks) rather than the label. Normalize each target dimension separately using only the training split statistics: for cell line c in {K562,HepG2,SKNSH}, compute mean μ_c and std σ_c on train rows, then transform y_c_norm = (y_c - μ_c) / (σ_c + 1e-8). Save μ and σ in a versioned artifact (e.g., JSON) and apply the same scalers to validation and test; at evaluation time, compute metrics in both normalized space (for stable training curves) and original l2fc space (for interpretability). If you adopt SE-aware weighting instead of hard filtering, define per-target weight w_c = 1/(lfcSE_c^2 + 1e-6) and optionally cap weights at w_max=25 to prevent single observations dominating; this is complementary to normalization and is especially useful if you choose the less strict Rule B. Also check for systematic shifts in l2fc distributions across target_cell values; if strong, consider including target_cell as a categorical covariate input (one-hot of size 3 concatenated to model head) but keep it out of the leakage-safe grouping keys.\n\n6) Data splitting strategy (leakage-safe, deterministic, and stratified where possible): Primary risk is sequence leakage due to duplicate (identical) sequences appearing multiple times; therefore split by groups defined as the exact 'sequence' string after canonical cleaning (uppercase, validated length, no Ns if dropped). Algorithm: (i) create cleaned_sequence, (ii) group rows by cleaned_sequence and assign each group an integer group_id, (iii) shuffle group_ids with a fixed seed (seed=2025), (iv) allocate groups to train/val/test by cumulative group size to achieve 80/10/10 of total rows as closely as possible while keeping groups intact. After the group split, verify that there are zero identical sequences shared across splits (assert disjointness) and report group counts and row counts per split. If you want additional robustness against near-duplicates (1–2 mismatches), optionally cluster sequences by MinHash/LSH or by Hamming distance <=2 within 200 bp, but this is computationally heavier; as a practical default, exact-dedup group splitting is required and sufficient for many MPRA tables. Because 'target_cell' may be imbalanced, add a secondary constraint: during group allocation, approximate stratification by target_cell by tracking per-split target_cell proportions and using a greedy assignment that minimizes deviation from the overall distribution (tolerance ±2%). Keep 'MinGap' out of grouping keys but use it for post-split diagnostics; if MinGap correlates with measurement quality, ensure its distribution is similar across splits.\n\n7) Augmentation policy (lightweight due to large N, optional RC): Since the dataset is large (>10K), prioritize QC and do not use heavy synthetic augmentation that could distort measured activity. Optional reverse-complement (RC) augmentation can be applied with probability p=0.5 during training only: for each sequence in a batch, with Bernoulli(p) replace it with its reverse complement; labels (all three l2fc) remain unchanged because MPRA reporter constructs typically measure sequence function independent of strand orientation in many setups, but you must confirm assay design—therefore treat RC augmentation as optional and evaluate with/without it. If you suspect strand-specific effects (e.g., promoter-directional constructs), set p=0.0 and do not RC augment. If you enable RC, implement it at the one-hot tensor level: reverse the length dimension and swap channels A<->T and C<->G; this is deterministic and avoids string operations. Do not use random base mutations for MPRA regression because it changes the underlying biological function and breaks label validity; similarly, do not use random shuffling except as a negative control dataset for sanity checks.\n\n8) Data loader and throughput specifications: For 4x200 float32 tensors, a batch size of 256 is a strong default on a single modern GPU (e.g., 16–24 GB VRAM); provide candidates {128, 256, 512} and choose the largest that maintains >90% GPU utilization without OOM. Use num_workers=4–8 (Linux) depending on CPU cores, pin_memory=True for CUDA training, persistent_workers=True, and prefetch_factor=2 to reduce input stalls; if pre-encoding to mmap/Zarr, you can reduce CPU overhead and increase batch size. Shuffle training data each epoch (shuffle=True) but keep validation/test deterministic (shuffle=False). For reproducibility, set global seeds (Python, NumPy, PyTorch) to 2025 and enforce deterministic ops where feasible; still record that CuDNN determinism may reduce speed. Finally, maintain a data manifest per split containing row indices, cleaned_sequence hash (e.g., SHA1), and QC flags so that any model run can be traced back exactly.\n\n9) Step-by-step preprocessing pipeline (pseudocode-level clarity with exact parameters): Step 0 Load CSV and assert required columns exist; Step 1 Standardize sequence strings: seq = upper(seq), strip whitespace; Step 2 Validate alphabet: drop if regex '[^ACGTN]'; Step 3 Compute len(seq) and profile distribution; apply length policy: if len!=200 then drop (default) unless outlier_fraction>0.5% then trim/pad to 200 with 'N' and flag; Step 4 Handle Ns: compute N_fraction; default drop if N_fraction>0.0 (alternative drop if >0.01 and map remaining N to uniform encoding); Step 5 Validate numeric columns: drop rows with NaN/Inf in any l2fc or lfcSE; enforce lfcSE in (0,5); Step 6 Apply lfcSE filter with threshold 0.5 using Rule A (default) or Rule B (alternative) and log removals; Step 7 Deduplicate/group: group_id = hash(cleaned_sequence), create group table; Step 8 Group split with seed=2025 into train/val/test 0.8/0.1/0.1 by groups; Step 9 Compute train-only μ_c, σ_c and normalize targets; Step 10 Encode sequences to one-hot float32 (B,4,200); Step 11 Save artifacts: split manifests, scaler JSON, QC report, and optional pre-encoded arrays; Step 12 Train with optional RC augmentation p=0.5 on train only. This pipeline follows the general principle from MPRA community tooling that robust QC, outlier handling, and standardized processing are essential for reproducibility (as emphasized by MPRA QC pipelines like esMPRA and uniform processing/standard formats like MPRAsnakeflow/MPRAlib)."

    "method_design": {
      "design_recommendations": "1) Dataset characterization & preprocessing: Assume the dataset is an MPRA-style sequence-to-activity regression dataset because the targets are per-cell-type l2fc (K562/HepG2/SKNSH), which are commonly derived from reporter assays; this implies labels are noisy with occasional outliers and can be heteroscedastic across cell types. If sequence length is fixed (common in MPRA libraries), set input_len=200 bp (adjust to actual; if variable, pad/truncate to 200 with center-crop for longer sequences and N-padding for shorter) and record length distribution; if >95% are identical length, disable variable-length masking for simplicity. Treat dataset size as medium-to-large (>10k is common for MPRA), so prioritize strict QC: remove sequences with >5% ambiguous bases (N), remove duplicated sequences keeping the median label per cell type, and winsorize extreme l2fc values at the 0.5th/99.5th percentiles per task to reduce leverage points while keeping ranking. Standardize labels per task using training-set mean/std (z-score) so multi-task losses are on comparable scale; at inference, invert standardization to report l2fc. Use a leakage-safe split: sequence-level unique split (no exact duplicates across train/val/test), optionally family-aware split by k-mer MinHash clustering to reduce near-duplicate leakage; keep val=10%, test=10%. Implement batch sampling uniformly over sequences; do not stratify by label unless label distribution is extremely skewed.\n\n2) Model architecture (shared backbone + 3 heads): Use one-hot DNA encoding (A,C,G,T plus optional N channel) with shape [B, L, 4] (or 5), and a CNN-residual backbone for strong inductive bias on motifs and motif syntax. Backbone example (exact): Conv1D(4->256, kernel=15, stride=1, padding=same) + BatchNorm(momentum=0.9, eps=1e-5) + GELU + Dropout(p=0.10); then 6 residual blocks each: Conv1D(256->256, k=7) + BN + GELU + Dropout(0.10) + Conv1D(256->256, k=7) + BN + GELU with residual connection; after blocks, DilatedConv stack: 3 layers Conv1D(256->256, k=3, dilation=2/4/8) each with BN+GELU+Dropout(0.10) to extend receptive field without huge depth. Pooling: attention pooling or global average pooling; to keep it simple and stable, use GlobalAveragePooling over length producing 256-d vector. Heads: three independent MLP heads: Linear(256->128) + GELU + Dropout(0.20) + Linear(128->1) for each task; initialize with Xavier uniform (gain=1.0) and zero bias. Apply weight normalization (as required) to all Conv1D and Linear layers; in PyTorch, use torch.nn.utils.weight_norm at module construction and optionally remove at inference. This design matches the “shared trunk + multiple expression heads” pattern seen in sequence-to-expression models (e.g., Proformer uses multiple heads and strand embedding ideas), while retaining CNN interpretability and stable training.\n\n3) Loss function (exact choice + weighting + masking): Use Huber loss (a robust alternative to MSE) because MPRA l2fc labels often contain outliers and heavy-tailed noise; set delta=1.0 in standardized label units. Reduction: compute per-sample per-task Huber, then reduce by mean over batch and tasks after weighting (i.e., ‘none’ then manual reduction). Per-task weights: start equal weights w=[1.0,1.0,1.0] for the first 5 epochs to avoid early collapse; then switch to inverse-variance weights estimated from training residual EMA to balance tasks (w_t = 1/(sigma_t^2 + 1e-4), normalized so sum(w)=3.0). Missing-task masking: assume all present, but implement a mask tensor m in {0,1}^3 per sample; final loss = sum_t w_t * m_t * huber(yhat_t,y_t) / (sum_t w_t*m_t + 1e-8) so training remains correct if any labels are absent in future data. Add RC-consistency regularization term (see augmentation/regularization): L_total = L_regression + lambda_rccr * mean_t |yhat_fwd_t - yhat_rc_t| with lambda_rccr=0.05 (after standardization), motivated by the RCCR idea that explicitly penalizing RC prediction divergence improves reliability on genomic tasks (Reverse-Complement Consistency for DNA Language Models, arXiv 2025). If you later detect strong heteroscedasticity per-task (e.g., HepG2 variance far higher), a Gaussian NLL head can be ablated, but Huber is the default for stability and simplicity.\n\n4) Optimization + LR schedule (exact hyperparameters): Use AdamW (not SGD) for faster convergence on sequence models with BatchNorm/weight norm and for robustness to gradient scale; set lr=3e-4, betas=(0.9,0.98), eps=1e-8, weight_decay=0.05. Apply weight decay to all weights except biases, BatchNorm parameters, and weight-norm “g” scalars (exclude via parameter groups). Gradient clipping: clip global norm at 1.0 (gradient_clip_norm=1.0) to prevent rare batch spikes from destabilizing training (common with noisy l2fc). LR schedule: cosine decay with linear warmup; warmup_epochs=5 (or warmup_steps = 5 * steps_per_epoch), start_lr=3e-6, peak_lr=3e-4, min_lr=3e-6, then cosine down to min_lr by the final epoch. Use batch_size=256 if GPU memory permits for stable BatchNorm; if constrained, use batch_size=128 and set BN to sync-bn or switch to GroupNorm(32 groups). Use mixed precision (fp16/bf16) with dynamic loss scaling; keep gradient clip after unscale.\n\n5) Regularization (dropout, input dropout, weight norm, mixup rationale): Backbone dropout p=0.10 in conv/residual layers; head dropout p=0.20 because heads overfit more easily than shared features. Input dropout (random base masking): with probability p_mask=0.02 per position, replace the one-hot base with all-zeros (or an explicit N channel if used); this simulates sequencing/library noise and discourages reliance on single nucleotide positions. Do not use label smoothing because this is regression and smoothing would bias continuous targets; instead, rely on Huber and winsorization/standardization for robustness. Weight norm: apply to every Conv1D and Linear (excluding BN) to stabilize training dynamics; monitor for training slowdowns and consider removing weight norm after convergence if needed. Mixup: do not apply raw-sequence mixup at one-hot level because convex combinations of bases are not biologically valid sequences; if needed as an ablation, restrict mixup to the pooled embedding vector (post-backbone) with alpha=0.2 and mix only within-batch while also mixing labels, but treat as optional because it can blur motif syntax. Add L2 on outputs is not needed; instead, use early stopping and RC regularization.\n\n6) Data augmentation + biological prior integration (motifs/PWMs and RC): Reverse-complement augmentation: with probability 0.5, replace input with its RC during training; at evaluation, optionally average predictions of forward and RC for robustness (test-time augmentation). Add explicit RC-consistency regularization (lambda_rccr=0.05) by computing predictions on both forward and RC in the same batch and penalizing their absolute difference; this is directly inspired by RCCR which targets inconsistent forward/RC predictions in DNA models (arXiv 2025). Small random shift augmentation: if sequences represent a window around a central element, allow shift in [-3,+3] bp with circular padding disabled (pad with N) to reflect uncertainty in exact motif alignment; set shift_prob=0.5. Motif prior: compute PWM scan features (e.g., max log-odds score per TF motif from a curated motif set relevant to K562/HepG2/SKNSH, such as ETS/GATA for hematopoietic contexts, HNF4A/CEBPA for HepG2 liver-like, and neural TFs for SKNSH) using a fixed library; concatenate a low-dim motif feature vector (e.g., 64 motifs) to the pooled 256-d backbone embedding, giving 320-d to each head. Regularize motif branch by Dropout(0.30) on motif features to prevent the model from ignoring sequence and overfitting motif counts. This “feature fusion” keeps the model biologically grounded and improves interpretability; it is also compatible with multi-task learning as in multi-head designs (e.g., Proformer highlights multi-head strategies and strand handling).\n\n7) Training length, early stopping, validation metrics (including specificity/MinGap): Train for max_epochs=80 with early stopping on a single scalar: mean Pearson correlation across the three tasks on the validation set (computed on de-standardized predictions), because Pearson aligns with ranking/relative effect accuracy often desired in regulatory activity prediction. Early stopping parameters: patience=12 epochs, min_delta=0.002 (absolute improvement in mean Pearson), and require at least min_epochs=20 before stopping to avoid premature termination during warmup/cosine transition. Track additional metrics: per-task Pearson, Spearman, RMSE, and calibration of residuals; log each epoch. Specificity validation: compute “MinGap” per sample as gap between top predicted cell-type l2fc and second-best (or between target and mean of others if target label known); then report mean MinGap and fraction of samples with correct top-cell-type (if you have a designated “intended” cell type for each sequence). Use MinGap only for monitoring/model selection tie-breaker: if mean Pearson is within 0.001 of best, select the checkpoint with higher mean MinGap to favor specificity. For robustness, also compute Pearson on RC-averaged predictions (fwd/rc mean) and ensure the drop from fwd-only is <0.01; large gaps indicate strand inconsistency issues.\n\n8) Multi-task handling, balancing, and runnable-like configuration: Optimize weighted-sum loss (not average of independent optimizers) using the dynamic inverse-variance weighting after epoch 5; additionally cap any task weight to at most 2.0x the mean weight to prevent one task from dominating (w_t = min(w_t, 2.0 * mean(w))). If one task’s gradients dominate (detect via per-task gradient norms on the last shared layer), enable GradNorm-style balancing as an optional ablation: update weights every 50 steps to equalize relative training rates, but default to inverse-variance because it is simple and usually effective. Reproducibility: set seeds for Python/NumPy/PyTorch to 1337, enable deterministic flags (torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic=True, benchmark=False), and log git commit + dataset hash + exact config. Ablation plan: (A1) backbone depth {4,6,8 residual blocks} with fixed kernels; (A2) kernel sizes: first conv k in {11,15,21} and residual k in {5,7}; (A3) remove dilated conv stack; (A4) RC augmentation off vs on; (A5) RC augmentation on but RCCR lambda_rccr in {0.0,0.02,0.05,0.1}; (A6) motif feature fusion off vs on; evaluate all by mean Pearson and mean MinGap.

      "design_recommendations": "Dataset and task characterization: With N=77,157 labeled sequences of fixed length 200 bp and one-hot encoding (4 channels), this is a large dataset (>10K) suitable for a moderate CNN with residual/dilated blocks and multi-task heads, targeting ~0.5–5M parameters to balance expressiveness and generalization. The dataset type is not explicitly stated, but the setup (200 bp one-hot, 3 outputs) is consistent with MPRA-like regression, STARR-seq activity prediction, or multi-task epigenomic signal prediction; therefore, preprocessing should include strict deduplication, train/val/test splitting by genomic region (or chromosome holdout) to avoid leakage, and label normalization (z-score per task for regression, or log1p transform if count-like). Because length is fixed at 200, no padding/truncation is needed; however, quality control should remove sequences with ambiguous bases (N) or map them to uniform probabilities (recommended: drop if >1% ambiguous, else replace with all-zero and track a mask). For large datasets, favor cleaning/filtering over heavy augmentation; use light augmentation only if biologically plausible (reverse-complement augmentation with probability 0.5, and random 0–5 bp shift if the assay is shift-invariant, implemented by circular or padded shift). Model selection rationale: choose a shared WeightNorm CNN backbone because it is efficient on 200 bp inputs, naturally learns motif detectors, and supports multi-task learning; multi-scale first-layer kernels (7/11/15) act as motif scanners at different widths while downstream dilated residual blocks capture spacing/interactions. The retrieved literature emphasizes interpretability through convolutional filters and in silico mutagenesis (“un-box” models using convolutional filters, attention maps, and in silico mutagenesis; Valeri et al., 2020, PMC), motivating explicit interpretability hooks in the experimental plan.\n\nExact architecture (layer-by-layer, with dimensions): Input X is (B,4,200). Stage A (multi-scale motif stem, parallel branches; all Conv1d use torch.nn.utils.weight_norm): Branch A1: WN-Conv1d(4->64, k=7, s=1, p=3), LeakyReLU(negative_slope=0.1), Dropout(p=0.10). Branch A2: WN-Conv1d(4->64, k=11, s=1, p=5), LeakyReLU(0.1), Dropout(0.10). Branch A3: WN-Conv1d(4->64, k=15, s=1, p=7), LeakyReLU(0.1), Dropout(0.10). Concatenate along channels: (B,192,200). Fuse + downsample: WN-Conv1d(192->256, k=1, s=1, p=0), LeakyReLU(0.1), then MaxPool1d(kernel=2, stride=2) giving (B,256,100). Stage B (residual blocks, same-length within block): Block B1 (no dilation): Main path: WN-Conv1d(256->256, k=3, s=1, p=1), LeakyReLU(0.1), Dropout(0.15), then WN-Conv1d(256->256, k=3, s=1, p=1); Residual add (identity) then LeakyReLU(0.1) output (B,256,100). Block B2 (dilation=2): WN-Conv1d(256->256, k=3, s=1, p=2, dilation=2), LeakyReLU(0.1), Dropout(0.15), WN-Conv1d(256->256, k=3, s=1, p=2, dilation=2), residual add, LeakyReLU -> (B,256,100). Block B3 (dilation=4): WN-Conv1d(256->256, k=3, s=1, p=4, dilation=4), LeakyReLU(0.1), Dropout(0.15), WN-Conv1d(256->256, k=3, s=1, p=4, dilation=4), residual add, LeakyReLU -> (B,256,100). Stage C (channel expansion + second downsample): WN-Conv1d(256->384, k=3, s=1, p=1), LeakyReLU(0.1), then MaxPool1d(k=2,s=2) -> (B,384,50). Stage D (residual blocks at 50 positions): Block D1 (no dilation): WN-Conv1d(384->384, k=3, s=1, p=1), LeakyReLU(0.1), Dropout(0.20), WN-Conv1d(384->384, k=3, s=1, p=1), residual add, LeakyReLU -> (B,384,50). Block D2 (dilation=2): WN-Conv1d(384->384, k=3, s=1, p=2, dilation=2), LeakyReLU(0.1), Dropout(0.20), WN-Conv1d(384->384, k=3, s=1, p=2, dilation=2), residual add, LeakyReLU -> (B,384,50). Backbone output pooling: compute GlobalAvgPool1d over length (50) -> (B,384) and GlobalMaxPool1d over length (50) -> (B,384), then concatenate -> backbone feature vector h of size (B,768). This pooling choice preserves both “presence” (max) and “overall activity” (avg), and yields a fixed 768-dim representation for all tasks.\n\nMulti-scale motif capture specifics (required): The explicit parallel conv stem uses kernels 7/11/15 to learn motif detectors of different effective lengths; because padding is (k-1)/2, each branch preserves length 200, enabling clean concatenation. After concatenation, a 1x1 convolution fuses across scales into 256 channels, letting the model learn weighted combinations of motif detectors and reduce dimensionality before deeper processing. Long-range dependencies are modeled by the dilated residual blocks (dilation 2 and 4 at length 100, then dilation 2 at length 50), increasing receptive field without excessive pooling; for example, at length 100, two stacked k=3 dilated convs with dilation=4 expand the receptive field substantially while preserving resolution. Residual connections ensure stable gradient flow for a deeper backbone and mitigate performance degradation as depth increases. If an ablation is desired, swap the parallel branches for a sequential dilated stack (dilations 1/2/4/8) while keeping parameter count similar; however, the parallel design typically improves motif-width coverage on short sequences. This design choice is consistent with common regulatory CNN motif-learning patterns and supports downstream interpretability by aligning first-layer filters with motif-like patterns (a practice commonly paired with in silico mutagenesis in interpretability workflows, as described in the retrieved “un-boxing” literature).\n\nHeads (three independent outputs) and exact dimensions: Shared feature h is (B,768). Head1 MLP: Linear(768->256), LeakyReLU(0.1), Dropout(p=0.30), Linear(256->64), LeakyReLU(0.1), Dropout(p=0.20), Linear(64->1). Head2 is identical but with independent parameters, producing y2 (B,1). Head3 is identical, producing y3 (B,1). Final output is torch.cat([y1,y2,y3], dim=1) -> (B,3) or return a tuple of three scalars depending on training loop preference. If tasks have different scales/noise, optionally add per-head LayerNorm(768) before the first Linear to stabilize, but keep it off by default to minimize moving parts alongside WeightNorm. For classification tasks (if applicable), apply per-head Sigmoid for binary or softmax for multi-class; for regression, output is linear and use MSE/Huber. To encourage shared representation but avoid negative transfer, the heads are moderately deep yet small; dropout is higher in heads (0.30) than backbone (0.10–0.20) to regularize task-specific fitting.\n\nInitialization, normalization, and training hyperparameters: All Conv1d and Linear layers use Kaiming/He initialization suited for LeakyReLU: torch.nn.init.kaiming_normal_(weight, a=0.1, mode='fan_out', nonlinearity='leaky_relu'); biases initialized to 0.0. WeightNorm is applied as torch.nn.utils.weight_norm(conv_layer) (and optionally on Linear layers in heads if desired, but keep Linear without WN initially for simplicity); when using WeightNorm, still initialize the underlying weight_v with Kaiming. BatchNorm is optional; if included, use BatchNorm1d with momentum=0.1 and eps=1e-5 after conv and before activation, but given explicit WeightNorm, the default recommendation is to omit BN to reduce interaction effects and keep inference simple. Optimizer: AdamW with lr=1e-3, betas=(0.9,0.999), weight_decay=1e-4; gradient clipping at 1.0 to stabilize multi-task training. Training schedule: cosine decay with 5% warmup steps (e.g., warmup for first 1–2 epochs), total 30–50 epochs with early stopping patience=6 on mean validation metric across tasks. Batch size suggestion: 256 if GPU memory allows (input is small), else 128; mixed precision (AMP) recommended for speed. Loss: if regression, per-task Huber(delta=1.0) or MSE; combine as weighted sum with weights inversely proportional to task variance (or use uncertainty weighting), and track Pearson/Spearman per task.\n\nParameter count estimate, target rationale, and compute efficiency: The design targets ~1.8–2.2M parameters (within the requested 0.5–5M). Rough breakdown: multi-scale stem convs (4->64 with k=7/11/15) contribute ~1.8k+2.8k+3.9k weights; fuse 1x1 (192->256) adds ~49k; residual stacks dominate (multiple 256->256 k=3 and 384->384 k=3 convs) contributing on the order of ~1.6–1.9M total; heads add ~0.66M (each head ~0.22M for 768->256->64->1). This parameter budget is appropriate for 77k samples because it provides sufficient capacity to learn motif combinations and task-shared features while remaining small enough to train quickly and limit overfitting risk compared with very large transformers. Computationally, all operations are 1D convolutions over max length 200 (then 100/50), making FLOPs modest; pooling reduces length early, and dilation increases receptive field without increasing length or parameters. WeightNorm adds negligible overhead and often improves optimization stability for CNNs, particularly when BN is omitted. For deployment, the model is a single backbone pass plus three small MLP heads; latency is low, and batch inference is efficient.\n\nInterpretability hooks and exact procedures (saliency, IG, in-silico mutagenesis, motif extraction): For gradient saliency, enable requires_grad on input one-hot tensor X, run forward to get y_task (choose one head or a weighted sum), then compute grads = torch.autograd.grad(y_task.sum(), X)[0], producing (B,4,200) attributions; aggregate to per-position importance via abs(grads).sum(dim=1) or grads*X (gradient×input) summed over channels. For Integrated Gradients, use baseline X0 = all-zeros (or GC-matched random baseline), choose steps m=64, compute IG = (X-X0) * (1/m) * sum_{i=1..m} grad(f(X0 + i/m*(X-X0))) across steps; return (B,4,200) attribution maps per task. For in-silico mutagenesis, for each position p, mutate within a window size W=11 (centered at p; clamp at edges) by flipping the one-hot base to each alternative base (3 alternatives per position), recompute output delta for each mutation, and store max |delta|; this yields a (200,) sensitivity profile and a 4x200 mutation effect map. Motif extraction: take top-K (e.g., K=5000) highest-saliency windows of length 15 from correctly predicted/high-confidence sequences, align them by peak position, and compute PWM by averaging one-hot in aligned windows; optionally also inspect first-layer convolutional filters by converting weight tensors to sequence logos. Provide hooks in code by exposing (a) the stem branch conv outputs (before pooling) and (b) the input gradients; register_forward_hook on stem convs and register_full_backward_hook for gradient capture. This aligns with the retrieved interpretability emphasis on “un-boxing” models via convolutional filters and in silico mutagenesis (Valeri et al., 2020, PMC) and complements regulatory genomics practice where motif-like patterns are derived from first-layer filters plus attribution maps.\n\nRequired architecture table and PyTorch skeleton (unambiguous, minimal but precise): The architecture table should list each layer with input/output shapes: (1) Input (B,4,200). (2) Branch7: WN-Conv1d(4,64,7,1,3)->(B,64,200), LReLU(0.1), Dropout0.10. (3) Branch11: WN-Conv1d(4,64,11,1,5)->(B,64,200), LReLU, Dropout0.10. (4) Branch15: WN-Conv1d(4,64,15,1,7)->(B,64,200), LReLU, Dropout0.10. (5) Concat ->(B,192,200). (6) Fuse: WN-Conv1d(192,256,1,1,0)->(B,256,200), LReLU. (7) MaxPool1d(2,2)->(B,256,100).

(13) ResBlock384 d=1 ->(B,384,50). (14) ResBlock384 d=2 ->(B,384,50). (15) GAP->(B,384), GMP->(B,384), Concat->(B,768). (16) Head t in {1,2,3}: Linear 768->256, LReLU, Dropout0.30; Linear 256->64, LReLU, Dropout0.20; Linear 64->1. PyTorch skeleton: define class SharedBackbone(nn.Module) with stem convs wrapped by weight_norm, forward returns h (B,768) and optionally intermediates; define class MultiTaskModel(nn.Module) with backbone + three nn.Sequential heads; forward returns torch.cat outputs. Ensure Conv1d layers are created then wrapped: conv = nn.Conv1d(...); conv = torch.nn.utils.weight_norm(conv). Residual block skeleton: two WN-Conv1d layers, dropout between, add identity, final activation; keep channels constant to avoid projection shortcuts in this baseline (add 1x1 projection only if channels change)."

    "result_summary": {
      "design_recommendations": "1) Dataset characteristics and evaluation unit definition: Treat each sequence/regulatory element as the sampling unit, with a vector of continuous targets across K cell lines (multi-output regression), and ensure that all metrics and bootstrap resamples operate at the element level to preserve within-element cross-cell correlation structure. Before any metric computation, summarize target distributions per cell line (mean, SD, skew, % near-zero), and summarize lfcSE (if present) per cell line (median, IQR) to anticipate heteroscedastic errors; use these summaries to justify stratified diagnostics (error vs lfcSE bins). If the dataset includes replicated measurements per element, aggregate replicates into a single target per cell line using inverse-variance weighting w=1/(lfcSE^2) when lfcSE is available; otherwise use the arithmetic mean, and carry forward an aggregated uncertainty estimate (e.g., sqrt(1/sum(w))). Define the held-out test set at the element level with no overlap in sequence identity between splits; if sequences are highly similar (e.g., tiled variants), split by group/cluster to avoid leakage, consistent with evaluation cautions in CRM assessment literature (Su et al., 2010, PMC). If there are distinct assay types or libraries, treat them as strata and enforce stratified splitting to maintain comparable distributions across train/val/test, reflecting that prediction accuracy varies systematically by technique (Nowling et al., 2023, PMC). 2) Primary metric suite and exact computation specs: Primary endpoint is Pearson correlation r computed separately for each cell line c on the held-out test set of N elements: r_c = cov(y_c, yhat_c) / (sd(y_c)*sd(yhat_c)), where y_c and yhat_c are length-N vectors of de-standardized true and predicted values for that cell line. De-standardization rule (if training used z-scoring per cell line): yhat_c,orig = yhat_c,std * sigma_c,train + mu_c,train and y_c,orig = y_c,std * sigma_c,train + mu_c,train, using mu/sigma computed on training targets only to avoid leakage; Pearson is computed on orig scale, and ties to reporting in many sequence-to-function regression tasks where correlation is favored for scale-invariant performance (Nowling et al., 2023, PMC). Also report Spearman rho per cell line (rank correlation, computed on orig scale, with average ranks for ties), plus MSE_c = mean((y_c,orig - yhat_c,orig)^2) and MAE_c = mean(|y_c,orig - yhat_c,orig|). Report macro-averaged mean Pearson across tasks: r_mean = (1/K) * sum_c r_c; additionally report a sample-size-weighted mean Pearson r_wt = sum_c (N_c * r_c)/sum_c N_c if missingness differs by cell line. For completeness, report a “micro-Pearson” computed by concatenating all cell line targets/predictions into a single vector (after de-standardization) only as a secondary summary, because it can be dominated by high-variance cell lines; macro-averaging is the default selection criterion. Thresholds for contextual interpretation: r_c > 0.60 is labeled “good”, 0.40–0.60 “moderate”, 0.20–0.40 “weak”, and <0.20 “poor”, with the caveat that achievable r depends on assay noise and technique (Nowling et al., 2023, PMC). 3) Bootstrap confidence intervals (per task) with parameterization: For each cell line c, compute 95% CIs for Pearson, Spearman, MSE, and MAE using nonparametric bootstrap with B=1000 resamples of the test elements. Resampling procedure: sample N indices with replacement from {1..N}; for each b, compute metric m_c^(b) on the resampled pairs (y_c,orig[i_b], yhat_c,orig[i_b]); then CI is the percentile interval [q_0.025, q_0.975] of {m_c^(b)}. Use the same bootstrap indices across models when comparing ablations (paired bootstrap) to reduce variance and enforce pairing, and use a fixed random seed (e.g., seed=2025) for reproducibility in reporting. For Pearson specifically, if bootstrap distribution is highly skewed or near ±1, optionally compute CI on Fisher z space: z = atanh(r), bootstrap z, then transform back with tanh; report which method is used, defaulting to percentile on r for simplicity and Fisher-z for edge cases. Also compute CI for r_mean via bootstrap by computing r_c^(b) for all c on the same resample and then averaging to r_mean^(b); CI is percentiles of {r_mean^(b)}. Report bootstrap failure rates (e.g., sd(yhat)=0 in a resample) and handle by skipping those draws; if >1% draws fail for a task, flag it as an instability diagnostic. 4) MinGap-based specificity validation (exact use of MinGap column): Interpret MinGap_i as a label-derived specificity proxy per element i (larger MinGap indicates stronger separation between a “preferred” and “non-preferred” cell context, or generally higher specificity). First define predicted specificity per element using predicted cell-type contrasts: for element i with predictions across K cell lines, let pred_gap_i = max_c(yhat_i,c,orig) - secondmax_c(yhat_i,c,orig) (top-1 minus top-2 predicted activity); optionally also compute pred_range_i = max_c(yhat_i,c,orig) - min_c(yhat_i,c,orig) as a broader contrast. Correlation analysis: compute Spearman correlation between MinGap and pred_gap across test elements: rho_gap = Spearman(MinGap, pred_gap); bootstrap CI with B=1000 resamples of elements, reporting 95% CI and p-value via bootstrap percentile or permutation (10,000 permutations recommended if feasible) for robustness. Stratified performance: split test elements into Q=5 quantiles (quintiles) by MinGap (Q1 lowest specificity to Q5 highest) using cutpoints on the test set only; within each quantile q, compute per-cell-line Pearson r_c,q and macro-mean r_mean,q, then test monotonic trend across quantiles using Spearman correlation between quantile index (1..5) and r_mean,q (or use Jonckheere–Terpstra if implementing a formal ordered alternative). Additionally, compute “specificity classification consistency” by checking whether argmax_c(yhat_i,c,orig) matches argmax_c(y_i,c,orig) (winner-takes-all cell line) and report accuracy per MinGap quantile; expectation is higher accuracy in higher MinGap bins if MinGap encodes clearer cell preference. Report effect sizes: delta_r = r_mean,Q5 - r_mean,Q1 and its bootstrap CI to quantify how much specificity strength changes predictability. This aligns with broader regulatory element evaluation themes that emphasize cell-type-specific performance stratification (e.g., motif-based prediction varies across cell contexts in Cornejo-Páramo et al., 2025, PMC). 5) Model selection and early stopping (validation metric and parameters): Select the checkpoint that maximizes mean validation Pearson across cell lines (macro-average) computed on de-standardized values, denoted r_mean,val, evaluated once per epoch. Early stopping rule: patience=10 epochs, min_delta=0.002 in r_mean,val (i.e., require at least +0.002 improvement to reset patience), with a maximum of 200 epochs; store the best checkpoint by r_mean,val and break training after patience is exhausted. If validation set is small or noisy, smooth r_mean,val with an exponential moving average (EMA) with decay=0.6 for early-stopping decisions while still reporting raw values; explicitly state which is used for stopping versus reporting. Tie-breakers: if two checkpoints have r_mean,val within 0.001, choose the one with lower val MSE (macro-averaged) to prefer better absolute calibration. Guard against overfitting to a single cell line by also requiring that at least 70% of cell lines have non-decreasing Pearson relative to the previous best checkpoint (a stability constraint); if violated, flag and optionally use a multi-objective rank (maximize r_mean,val and minimize variance of r_c,val across cell lines). This selection design is consistent with correlation-centric reporting in regulatory element prediction comparisons, where per-context performance can differ materially (Nowling et al., 2023, PMC). 6) Statistical comparisons for ablations (paired tests, Fisher z, multiple testing): For each ablation A vs baseline B, compute paired differences in Pearson per cell line on the same test set: d_c = r_c(B) - r_c(A), and report d_c with 95% paired bootstrap CI using the shared bootstrap indices across models (B=1000). For a global comparison across cell lines, compute d_mean = (1/K) * sum_c d_c and its bootstrap CI; declare significance if the Holm–Bonferroni-adjusted p-value < 0.05. P-values from paired bootstrap: p = 2*min(P(d_mean^(b) <= 0), P(d_mean^(b) >= 0)) using the bootstrap distribution of d_mean^(b) (centered at 0), with the same approach optionally applied per cell line. As an alternative or confirmation for Pearson differences per cell line, apply Fisher z-transform: z = atanh(r), standard error approx se = 1/sqrt(N-3); test statistic t = (z_B - z_A)/sqrt(2*se^2) if correlations are treated as independent; however, because predictions are paired on the same y, prefer paired bootstrap as the primary test and use Fisher-z only as a sensitivity analysis. Correct for multiple ablations and/or multiple cell lines using Holm–Bonferroni (family defined as all hypothesis tests reported in the main table; alpha=0.05). Report both adjusted and unadjusted p-values, and emphasize effect sizes (delta Pearson, delta MSE) over p-values to avoid overinterpretation, consistent with best practice in method comparison studies (Su et al., 2010, PMC). 7) Diagnostics and plots (required panels and parameter settings): Per-cell-type scatter plots: for each cell line, plot y_orig vs yhat_orig on test with an overlaid y=x line; annotate r, rho, MAE, and n, and set axis limits to [p1, p99] percentiles to reduce outlier domination (keep outliers plotted with transparency alpha=0.2). Calibration for regression: bin predictions into M=10 equal-frequency bins per cell line, compute mean(yhat) and mean(y) per bin, plot mean(y) vs mean(yhat) with error bars (±1 SE via bootstrap within-bin) and report calibration slope/intercept from a linear fit y = a + b*yhat; “good” calibration is b in [0.9, 1.1] and |a| < 0.1*sd(y). Residual analysis: compute residual e_i,c = y_i,c,orig - yhat_i,c,orig; plot residual histograms (50 bins), Q–Q plots, and residual vs prediction to inspect heteroscedasticity; flag if Breusch–Pagan p<0.01 (optional) or if residual variance increases >2x from lowest to highest prediction decile. Error vs lfcSE bins: within each cell line, bin elements by lfcSE into 5 quantiles and compute MAE and Pearson per bin; expectation is worse error at higher lfcSE, and deviations (e.g., flat or inverted trend) can indicate model mis-specification or label noise handling issues. Also include “influence/outlier” diagnostics: report the top 1% absolute residual elements and whether they cluster by sequence family or extreme MinGap, to guide biological follow-up. These plots support interpretation of why correlations differ across contexts and are commonly used in sequence-to-function model evaluation beyond single summary metrics (Nowling et al., 2023, PMC). 8) Reporting template (tables, figures, and acceptance thresholds): Main Table 1 (Test performance per cell line): columns = cell_line, N_test, Pearson r (95% CI), Spearman rho (95% CI), MSE (95% CI), MAE (95% CI); add a final row with macro-mean across cell lines with bootstrap CI. Main Table 2 (Ablation deltas): for each ablation, report delta r_mean (95% CI), adjusted p-value (Holm), and per-cell-line delta r_c (optionally in supplement). Table 3 (MinGap specificity): report rho(MinGap, pred_gap) with CI, r_mean per MinGap quintile with CI, and delta_r (Q5-Q1) with CI; include winner-cell accuracy per quintile if applicable. Figure set: Fig 1 per-cell-type scatter grid (K panels), Fig 2 calibration curves (K panels or representative), Fig 3 residual diagnostics (aggregate + per cell line), Fig 4 MinGap stratification curves and pred_gap vs MinGap scatter with smooth (LOESS span=0.75). Predefine “good performance” as: (i) r_mean,test >= 0.60 with lower CI bound >= 0.50, (ii) at least 70% of cell lines have r_c >= 0.50, and (iii) positive specificity association rho_gap >= 0.30 with CI excluding 0; these are contextual thresholds and should be interpreted relative to assay noise and baseline models. Provide a concise model card appendix listing data split IDs, target scaling parameters (mu/sigma), bootstrap seed, and exact metric definitions to ensure reproducibility, reflecting reproducibility emphasis in method assessments (Su et al., 2010, PMC)."
