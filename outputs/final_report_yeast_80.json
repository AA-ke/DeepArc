This hybrid approach is supported by recent studies such as JanusDNA, which emphasize the effectiveness of combining these architectures for genomic tasks.",
        "layer_by_layer_design": "The model begins with an input layer that processes 80bp DNA sequences encoded as one-hot vectors. The first layer is a 1D convolutional layer with 64 filters, a kernel size of 8, and ReLU activation, followed by a second convolutional layer with 128 filters and a kernel size of 4. This is followed by max pooling to reduce dimensionality. Next, two LSTM layers with 128 units each are used to capture temporal dependencies. Batch normalization is applied after each convolutional layer to stabilize learning, and dropout with a rate of 0.5 is used after LSTM layers to prevent overfitting.",

Bootstrap resampling techniques will be applied to estimate confidence intervals for performance metrics, providing a robust measure of uncertainty. This design ensures that observed improvements are statistically significant and not due to random chance.",
      "validation_strategy": "The validation strategy includes a combination of cross-validation and external validation. A five-fold cross-validation is recommended to ensure that the model generalizes well across different data subsets. This involves splitting the dataset into five parts, training on four parts, and validating on the fifth, rotating the validation set across folds. External validation will involve testing the model on an independent dataset not used during training or hyperparameter tuning, ensuring unbiased performance evaluation. This approach mitigates overfitting and provides a comprehensive assessment of model robustness.",
