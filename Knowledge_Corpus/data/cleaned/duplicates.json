    "title": "NeuronMotif: Deciphering cis-regulatory codes by layer-wise demixing of deep neural networks",
    "abstract": "Cis-regulatory sequences regulate the expression of nearby genes. Recently, remarkable advances in our ability to predict the function of cis-regulatory sequences have been achieved by using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, the difficulty in interpreting these CNNs has hindered the translation of these advances to better understanding of the cis-regulatory code. The main difficulty is due to the problem of multifaceted CNN neurons, each of which can recognize multiple types of patterns. Visualizing a multifaceted neuron in one image will result in a mixed pattern that is hard to interpret. To address this difficulty, we propose an algorithm capable of revealing the individual facets of deep neurons, which enables better understanding of the cis-regulatory codes embedded in the state-of-the-art CNNs.",

    "abstract": "Despite extensive mapping of cis-regulatory elements (cREs) across cellular contexts with chromatin accessibility assays, the sequence syntax and genetic variants that regulate transcription factor (TF) binding and chromatin accessibility at context-specific cREs remain elusive. We introduce ChromBPNet, a deep learning DNA sequence model of base-resolution accessibility profiles that detects, learns and deconvolves assay-specific enzyme biases from regulatory sequence determinants of accessibility, enabling robust discovery of compact TF motif lexicons, cooperative motif syntax and precision footprints across assays and sequencing depths. Extensive benchmarks show that ChromBPNet, despite its lightweight design, is competitive with much larger contemporary models at predicting variant effects on chromatin accessibility, pioneer TF binding and reporter activity across assays, cell contexts and ancestry, while providing interpretation of disrupted regulatory syntax. ChromBPNet also helps prioritize and interpret regulatory variants that influence complex traits and rare diseases, thereby providing a powerful lens to decode regulatory DNA and genetic variation.",

    "title": "Identification of constrained sequence elements across 239 primate genomes",
    "abstract": "Noncoding DNA is central to our understanding of human gene regulation and complex diseases 1 , 2 , and measuring the evolutionary sequence constraint can establish the functional relevance of putative regulatory elements in the human genome 3 – 9 . Identifying the genomic elements that have become constrained specifically in primates has been hampered by the faster evolution of noncoding DNA compared to protein-coding DNA 10 , the relatively short timescales separating primate species 11 , and the previously limited availability of whole-genome sequences 12 . Here we construct a whole-genome alignment of 239 species, representing nearly half of all extant species in the primate order. Using this resource, we identified human regulatory elements that are under selective constraint across primates and other mammals at a 5% false discovery rate. We detected 111,318 DNase I hypersensitivity sites and 267,410 transcription factor binding sites that are constrained specifically in primates but not across other placental mammals and validate their cis -regulatory effects on gene expression. These regulatory elements are enriched for human genetic variants that affect gene expression and complex traits and diseases. Our results highlight the important role of recent evolution in regulatory sequence elements differentiating primates, including humans, from other placental mammals.",

    "title": "Multiplex profiling of developmental cis- regulatory elements with quantitative single-cell expression reporters",
    "abstract": "The inability to scalably and precisely measure the activity of developmental cis -regulatory elements (CREs) in multicellular systems is a bottleneck in genomics. Here we develop a dual RNA cassette that decouples the detection and quantification tasks inherent to multiplex single-cell reporter assays. The resulting measurement of reporter expression is accurate over multiple orders of magnitude, with a precision approaching the limit set by Poisson counting noise. Together with RNA barcode stabilization via circularization, these scalable single-cell quantitative expression reporters provide high-contrast readouts, analogous to classic in situ assays but entirely from sequencing. Screening >200 regions of accessible chromatin in a multicellular in vitro model of early mammalian development, we identify 13 (8 previously uncharacterized) autonomous and cell-type-specific developmental CREs. We further demonstrate that chimeric CRE pairs generate cognate two-cell-type activity profiles and assess gain- and loss-of-function multicellular expression phenotypes from CRE variants with perturbed transcription factor binding sites. Single-cell quantitative expression reporters can be applied in developmental and multicellular systems to quantitatively characterize native, perturbed and synthetic CREs at scale, with high sensitivity and at single-cell resolution.",

    "title": "Hemichordate cis -regulatory genomics and the gene expression dynamics of deuterostomes",
    "abstract": "Deuterostomes are one major group of bilaterians composed by hemichordates and echinoderms (collectively called Ambulacraria) and chordates. Comparative studies between these groups can provide valuable insights into the nature of the last common ancestor of deuterostomes and that of bilaterians. Indirect development of hemichordates, with larval phases similar to echinoderms and an adult body plan with an anteroposterior polarity like chordates and other bilaterians, makes them a suitable model for studying the molecular basis of development among deuterostomes. However, a comprehensive, quantitative catalogue of gene expression and chromatin dynamics in hemichordates is still lacking. In this study, we analysed the transcriptomes and chromatin accessibility of multiple developmental stages of the indirect-developing hemichordate Ptychodera flava . We observed that P. flava development is underpinned by a biphasic transcriptional program probably controlled by distinct genetic networks. Comparisons with other bilaterian species revealed similar transcriptional and regulatory dynamics during hemichordate gastrulation, cephalochordate neurulation and elongation stages of annelids. By means of regulatory networks analysis and functional validations by transgenesis experiments in echinoderms, we propose that gastrulation is the stage of highest molecular resemblance in deuterostomes and that much of the molecular basis of deuterostome development was probably present in the bilaterian last common ancestor.",

    "abstract": "Cell type-specific transcriptional differences between brain tissues from donors with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and unaffected controls have been well documented, but few studies have rigorously interrogated the regulatory mechanisms responsible for these alterations. We performed single nucleus multiomics (snRNA-seq plus snATAC-seq) on 105,332 nuclei isolated from cortical tissues from 7 AD and 8 unaffected donors to identify candidate cis -regulatory elements (CREs) involved in AD-associated transcriptional changes. We detected 319,861 significant correlations, or links, between gene expression and cell type-specific transposase accessible regions enriched for active CREs. Among these, 40,831 were unique to AD tissues. Validation experiments confirmed the activity of many regions, including several candidate regulators of APP expression. We identified ZEB1 and MAFB as candidate transcription factors playing important roles in AD-specific gene regulation in neurons and microglia, respectively. Microglia links were globally enriched for heritability of AD risk and previously identified active regulatory regions.",

To better delineate these elements, phase III of the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Project has expanded analysis of the cell and tissue repertoires of RNA transcription, chromatin structure and modification, DNA methylation, chromatin looping, and occupancy by transcription factors and RNA-binding proteins. Here we summarize these efforts, which have produced 5,992 new experimental datasets, including systematic determinations across mouse fetal development. All data are available through the ENCODE data portal ( https://www.encodeproject.org ), including phase II ENCODE 1 and Roadmap Epigenomics 2 data. We have developed a registry of 926,535 human and 339,815 mouse candidate cis -regulatory elements, covering 7.9 and 3.4% of their respective genomes, by integrating selected datatypes associated with gene regulation, and constructed a web-based server (SCREEN; http://screen.encodeproject.org ) to provide flexible, user-defined access to this resource. Collectively, the ENCODE data and registry provide an expansive resource for the scientific community to build a better understanding of the organization and function of the human and mouse genomes.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in single-cell transposase-accessible chromatin using a sequencing assay (scATAC-seq) allow cellular heterogeneity dissection and regulatory landscape reconstruction with an unprecedented resolution. However, compared to bulk-sequencing, its ultra-high missingness remarkably reduces usable reads in each cell type, resulting in broader, fuzzier peak boundary definitions and limiting our ability to pinpoint functional regions and interpret variant impacts precisely. We propose a weakly supervised learning method, scEpiLock, to directly identify core functional regions from coarse peak labels and quantify variant impacts in a cell-type-specific manner. First, scEpiLock uses a multi-label classifier to predict chromatin accessibility via a deep convolutional neural network. Then, its weakly supervised object detection module further refines the peak boundary definition using gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM). Finally, scEpiLock provides cell-type-specific variant impacts within a given peak region. We applied scEpiLock to various scATAC-seq datasets and found that it achieves an area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of ~0.9 and an area under precision recall (AUPR) above 0.7. Besides, scEpiLock’s object detection condenses coarse peaks to only ⅓ of their original size while still reporting higher conservation scores. In addition, we applied scEpiLock on brain scATAC-seq data and reported several genome-wide association studies (GWAS) variants disrupting regulatory elements around known risk genes for Alzheimer’s disease, demonstrating its potential to provide cell-type-specific biological insights in disease studies.",

    "abstract": "The imprinting control region (ICR) located far upstream of the H19 gene, in conjunction with enhancers, modulates the transcription of Igf2 and H19 genes in an allele-specific manner. On paternal inheritance, the methylated ICR silences the H19 gene and indirectly facilitates transcription from the distant Igf2 promoter, whereas on the maternal chromosome the unmethylated ICR, together with enhancers, activates transcription of the H19 gene and thereby contributes to the repression of Igf2. This repression of maternal Igf2 has recently been postulated to be due to a chromatin boundary or insulator function of the unmethylated ICR. Central to the insulator model is the site-specific binding of a ubiquitous nuclear factor CTCF which exhibits remarkable flexibility in functioning as transcriptional activator or silencer. We suggest that the ICR positioned close to the enhancers in an episomal context might function as a transcriptional silencer by virtue of interaction of CTCF with its modifiers such as SIN3A and histone deacetylases. Furthermore, a localised folded chromatin structure resulting from juxtaposition of two disparate regulatory sequences (enhancer ICR) could be the mechanistic basis of ICR-mediated position-dependent (ICR-promoter) transcriptional repression in transgenic Drosophila.",

    "abstract": "Cis-regulatory elements (CREs) play a pivotal role in orchestrating interactions with trans-regulatory factors such as transcription factors, RNA-binding proteins, and noncoding RNAs. These interactions are fundamental to the molecular architecture underpinning complex and diverse biological functions in living organisms, facilitating a myriad of sophisticated and dynamic processes. The rapid advancement in the identification and characterization of these regulatory elements has been marked by initiatives such as the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project, which represents a significant milestone in the field. Concurrently, the development of CRE detection technologies, exemplified by massively parallel reporter assays, has progressed at an impressive pace, providing powerful tools for CRE discovery. The exponential growth of multimodal functional genomic data has necessitated the application of advanced analytical methods. Deep learning algorithms, particularly large language models, have emerged as invaluable tools for deconstructing the intricate nucleotide sequences governing CRE function. These advancements facilitate precise predictions of CRE activity and enable the de novo design of CREs. A deeper understanding of CRE operational dynamics is crucial for harnessing their versatile regulatory properties. Such insights are instrumental in refining gene therapy techniques, enhancing the efficacy of selective breeding programs, pushing the boundaries of genetic innovation, and opening new possibilities in microbial synthetic biology.",

    "abstract": "Chromatin boundaries regulate gene expression by modulating enhancer–promoter interactions and insulating transcriptional influences from organized chromatin. However, mechanistic distinctions between these two aspects of boundary function are not well understood. Here we show that SF1, a chromatin boundary located in the Drosophila Antennapedia complex (ANT-C), can insulate the transgenic miniwhite reporter from both enhancing and silencing effects of surrounding genome, a phenomenon known as chromosomal position effect or CPE. We found that the CPE-blocking activity associates with different SF1 sub-regions from a previously characterized insulator that blocks enhancers in transgenic embryos, and is independent of GAF-binding sites essential for the embryonic insulator activity. We further provide evidence that the CPE-blocking activity cannot be attributed to an enhancer-blocking activity in the developing eye. Our results suggest that SF1 contains multiple non-overlapping activities that block diverse transcriptional influences from embryonic or adult enhancers, and from positive and negative chromatin structure. Such diverse insulating capabilities are consistent with the proposed roles of SF1 to functionally separate fushi tarazu ( ftz ), a non-Hox gene, from the enhancers and the organized chromatin of the neighboring Hox genes.",

To overcome the limitations of native promoters in controlling gene expression, artificial promoter design aims to synthesize short, inducible, and conditionally controlled promoters to coordinate the expression of multiple genes in diverse plant metabolic and signaling pathways. Synthetic promoters are versatile and can drive gene expression accurately with smart responses; they show potential for enhancing desirable traits in crops, thereby improving crop yield, nutritional quality, and food security. This review first illustrates the importance of synthetic promoters, then introduces promoter architecture and thoroughly summarizes advances in synthetic promoter construction. Restrictions to the development of synthetic promoters and future applications of such promoters in synthetic plant biology and crop improvement are also discussed.",

    "title": "An efficient algorithm for improving structure-based prediction of transcription factor binding sites",
    "abstract": "Gene expression is regulated by transcription factors binding to specific target DNA sites. Understanding how and where transcription factors bind at genome scale represents an essential step toward our understanding of gene regulation networks. Previously we developed a structure-based method for prediction of transcription factor binding sites using an integrative energy function that combines a knowledge-based multibody potential and two atomic energy terms. While the method performs well, it is not computationally efficient due to the exponential increase in the number of binding sequences to be evaluated for longer binding sites. In this paper, we present an efficient pentamer algorithm by splitting DNA binding sequences into overlapping fragments along with a simplified integrative energy function for transcription factor binding site prediction. A DNA binding sequence is split into overlapping pentamers (5 base pairs) for calculating transcription factor-pentamer interaction energy. To combine the results from overlapping pentamer scores, we developed two methods, Kmer-Sum and PWM (Position Weight Matrix) stacking, for full-length binding motif prediction. Our results show that both Kmer-Sum and PWM stacking in the new pentamer approach along with a simplified integrative energy function improved transcription factor binding site prediction accuracy and dramatically reduced computation time, especially for longer binding sites. Our new fragment-based pentamer algorithm and simplified energy function improve both efficiency and accuracy. To our knowledge, this is the first fragment-based method for structure-based transcription factor binding sites prediction.

    "title": "abc4pwm: affinity based clustering for position weight matrices in applications of DNA sequence analysis",
    "abstract": "Transcription factor (TF) binding motifs are identified by high throughput sequencing technologies as means to capture Protein-DNA interactions. These motifs are often represented by consensus sequences in form of position weight matrices (PWMs). With ever-increasing pool of TF binding motifs from multiple sources, redundancy issues are difficult to avoid, especially when every source maintains its own database for collection. One solution can be to cluster biologically relevant or similar PWMs, whether coming from experimental detection or in silico predictions. However, there is a lack of efficient tools to cluster PWMs. Assessing quality of PWM clusters is yet another challenge. Therefore, new methods and tools are required to efficiently cluster PWMs and assess quality of clusters. A new Python package Affinity Based Clustering for Position Weight Matrices (abc4pwm) was developed. It efficiently clustered PWMs from multiple sources with or without using DNA-Binding Domain (DBD) information, generated a representative motif for each cluster, evaluated the clustering quality automatically, and filtered out incorrectly clustered PWMs. Additionally, it was able to update human DBD family database automatically, classified known human TF PWMs to the respective DBD family, and performed TF motif searching and motif discovery by a new ensemble learning approach. This work demonstrates applications of abc4pwm in the DNA sequence analysis for various high throughput sequencing data using ~ 1770 human TF PWMs. It recovered known TF motifs at gene promoters based on gene expression profiles (RNA-seq) and identified true TF binding targets for motifs predicted from ChIP-seq experiments. Abc4pwm is a useful tool for TF motif searching, clustering, quality assessment and integration in multiple types of sequence data analysis including RNA-seq, ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq.

    "title": "Modeling binding specificities of transcription factor pairs with random forests",
    "abstract": "Transcription factors (TFs) bind regulatory DNA regions with sequence specificity, form complexes and regulate gene expression. In cooperative TF-TF binding, two transcription factors bind onto a shared DNA binding site as a pair. Previous work has demonstrated pairwise TF-TF-DNA interactions with position weight matrices (PWMs), which may however not sufficiently take into account the complexity and flexibility of pairwise binding. We propose two random forest (RF) methods for joint TF-TF binding site prediction: ComBind and JointRF. We train models with previously published large-scale CAP-SELEX DNA libraries, which comprise DNA sequences enriched for binding of a selected TF pair. JointRF builds a random forest with sub-sequences selected from CAP-SELEX DNA reads with previously proposed pairwise PWM. JointRF outperforms (area under receiver operating characteristics curve, AUROC, 0.75) the current state-of-the-art method i.e. orientation and spacing specific pairwise PWMs (AUROC 0.59). Thus, JointRF may be utilized to improve prediction accuracy for pre-determined binding preferences. However, pairwise TF binding is currently considered flexible; a pair may bind DNA with different orientations and amounts of dinucleotide gaps or overlap between the two motifs. Thus, we developed ComBind, which utilizes random forests by considering simultaneously multiple orientations and spacings of the two factors. Our approach outperforms (AUROC 0.78) PWMs, as well as JointRF ( p <0.00195). ComBind provides an approach for predicting TF-TF binding sites without prior knowledge on pairwise binding preferences. However, more research is needed to assess ComBind eligibility for practical applications. Random forest is well suited for modeling pairwise TF-TF-DNA binding specificities, and ComBind provides an improvement to pairwise binding site prediction accuracy.

    "abstract": "Positional weight matrix (PWM) is a de facto standard model to describe transcription factor (TF) DNA binding specificities. PWMs inferred from in vivo or in vitro data are stored in many databases and used in a plethora of biological applications. This calls for comprehensive benchmarking of public PWM models with large experimental reference sets. Here we report results from all-against-all benchmarking of PWM models for DNA binding sites of human TFs on a large compilation of in vitro (HT-SELEX, PBM) and in vivo (ChIP-seq) binding data. We observe that the best performing PWM for a given TF often belongs to another TF, usually from the same family. Occasionally, binding specificity is correlated with the structural class of the DNA binding domain, indicated by good cross-family performance measures. Benchmarking-based selection of family-representative motifs is more effective than motif clustering-based approaches. Overall, there is good agreement between in vitro and in vivo performance measures. However, for some in vivo experiments, the best performing PWM is assigned to an unrelated TF, indicating a binding mode involving protein-protein cooperativity. In an all-against-all setting, we compute more than 18 million performance measure values for different PWM-experiment combinations and offer these results as a public resource to the research community. The benchmarking protocols are provided via a web interface and as docker images. The methods and results from this study may help others make better use of public TF specificity models, as well as public TF binding data sets.",

    "abstract": "Transcription factors (TFs) are essential regulatory proteins controlling the cellular transcriptional states by binding to specific DNA sequences known as transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) or motifs. Accurate TFBS identification is crucial for unraveling regulatory mechanisms driving cellular dynamics. Over the years, various computational approaches have been developed to model TFBSs, with position weight matrices (PWMs) being one of the most widely adopted methods. PWMs provide a probabilistic framework by representing nucleotide frequencies at every position within the binding site. While effective and interpretable, PWMs face significant limitations, such as their inability to capture positional dependencies or model complex interactions. To address these, advanced methods, like support vector machine (SVM)–based, and deep learning (DL)–based models, have been introduced. Leveraging human ChIP-seq data from ENCODE, we systematically benchmarked the predictive performance of PWM, SVM-, and DL-based models across different scenarios. We evaluate the impact of key factors such as training dataset size, sequence length, and kernel functions (for SVMs) on models’ performance. Additionally, we explore the impact of synthetic versus real biological background data during model training. Our analysis highlights strengths and limitations of each approach under different conditions, providing practical guidance for selecting and tailoring models to specific biological datasets. To complement our analysis, we present a comprehensive database of pretrained SVM models for TFBS detection, trained on human ChIP-seq data from diverse cell lines and tissues. This resource aims to facilitate broader adoption of SVM-based methods in TFBS prediction and enhance their practical utility in regulatory genomics research.",

    "abstract": "Transcription factors bind DNA in specific sequence contexts. In addition to distinguishing one nucleobase from another, some transcription factors can distinguish between unmodified and modified bases. Current models of transcription factor binding tend not to take DNA modifications into account, while the recent few that do often have limitations. This makes a comprehensive and accurate profiling of transcription factor affinities difficult. Here, we develop methods to identify transcription factor binding sites in modified DNA. Our models expand the standard A/C/G/T DNA alphabet to include cytosine modifications. We develop Cytomod to create modified genomic sequences and we also enhance the MEME Suite, adding the capacity to handle custom alphabets. We adapt the well-established position weight matrix (PWM) model of transcription factor binding affinity to this expanded DNA alphabet. Using these methods, we identify modification-sensitive transcription factor binding motifs. We confirm established binding preferences, such as the preference of ZFP57 and C/EBPβ for methylated motifs and the preference of c-Myc for unmethylated E-box motifs. Using known binding preferences to tune model parameters, we discover novel modified motifs for a wide array of transcription factors. Finally, we validate our binding preference predictions for OCT4 using cleavage under targets and release using nuclease (CUT&RUN) experiments across conventional, methylation-, and hydroxymethylation-enriched sequences. Our approach readily extends to other DNA modifications. As more genome-wide single-base resolution modification data becomes available, we expect that our method will yield insights into altered transcription factor binding affinities across many different modifications.

    "title": "Variable structure motifs for transcription factor binding sites",
    "abstract": "Classically, models of DNA-transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) have been based on relatively few known instances and have treated them as sites of fixed length using position weight matrices (PWMs). Various extensions to this model have been proposed, most of which take account of dependencies between the bases in the binding sites. However, some transcription factors are known to exhibit some flexibility and bind to DNA in more than one possible physical configuration. In some cases this variation is known to affect the function of binding sites. With the increasing volume of ChIP-seq data available it is now possible to investigate models that incorporate this flexibility. Previous work on variable length models has been constrained by: a focus on specific zinc finger proteins in yeast using restrictive models; a reliance on hand-crafted models for just one transcription factor at a time; and a lack of evaluation on realistically sized data sets. We re-analysed binding sites from the TRANSFAC database and found motivating examples where our new variable length model provides a better fit. We analysed several ChIP-seq data sets with a novel motif search algorithm and compared the results to one of the best standard PWM finders and a recently developed alternative method for finding motifs of variable structure. All the methods performed comparably in held-out cross validation tests. Known motifs of variable structure were recovered for p53, Stat5a and Stat5b. In addition our method recovered a novel generalised version of an existing PWM for Sp1 that allows for variable length binding. This motif improved classification performance. We have presented a new gapped PWM model for variable length DNA binding sites that is not too restrictive nor over-parameterised. Our comparison with existing tools shows that on average it does not have better predictive accuracy than existing methods. However, it does provide more interpretable models of motifs of variable structure that are suitable for follow-up structural studies. To our knowledge, we are the first to apply variable length motif models to eukaryotic ChIP-seq data sets and consequently the first to show their value in this domain. The results include a novel motif for the ubiquitous transcription factor Sp1.",

    "abstract": "The representation and discovery of transcription factor (TF) sequence binding specificities is critical for understanding gene regulatory networks and interpreting the impact of disease-associated noncoding genetic variants. We present a novel TF binding motif representation, the k -mer set memory (KSM), which consists of a set of aligned k -mers that are overrepresented at TF binding sites, and a new method called KMAC for de novo discovery of KSMs. We find that KSMs more accurately predict in vivo binding sites than position weight matrix (PWM) models and other more complex motif models across a large set of ChIP-seq experiments. Furthermore, KSMs outperform PWMs and more complex motif models in predicting in vitro binding sites. KMAC also identifies correct motifs in more experiments than five state-of-the-art motif discovery methods. In addition, KSM-derived features outperform both PWM and deep learning model derived sequence features in predicting differential regulatory activities of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) alleles. Finally, we have applied KMAC to 1600 ENCODE TF ChIP-seq data sets and created a public resource of KSM and PWM motifs. We expect that the KSM representation and KMAC method will be valuable in characterizing TF binding specificities and in interpreting the effects of noncoding genetic variations.",

    "title": "Discovery of a non-canonical GRHL1 binding site using deep convolutional and recurrent neural networks",
    "abstract": "Transcription factors regulate gene expression by binding to transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs). Most models for predicting TFBSs are based on position weight matrices (PWMs), which require a specific motif to be present in the DNA sequence and do not consider interdependencies of nucleotides. Novel approaches such as Transcription Factor Flexible Models or recurrent neural networks consequently provide higher accuracies. However, it is unclear whether such approaches can uncover novel non-canonical, hitherto unexpected TFBSs relevant to human transcriptional regulation. In this study, we trained a convolutional recurrent neural network with HT-SELEX data for GRHL1 binding and applied it to a set of GRHL1 binding sites obtained from ChIP-Seq experiments from human cells. We identified 46 non-canonical GRHL1 binding sites, which were not found by a conventional PWM approach. Unexpectedly, some of the newly predicted binding sequences lacked the CNNG core motif, so far considered obligatory for GRHL1 binding. Using isothermal titration calorimetry, we experimentally confirmed binding between the GRHL1-DNA binding domain and predicted GRHL1 binding sites, including a non-canonical GRHL1 binding site. Mutagenesis of individual nucleotides revealed a correlation between predicted binding strength and experimentally validated binding affinity across representative sequences. This correlation was neither observed with a PWM-based nor another deep learning approach. Our results show that convolutional recurrent neural networks may uncover unanticipated binding sites and facilitate quantitative transcription factor binding predictions.

    "abstract": "Modelling the regulatory mechanisms that determine cell fate, response to external perturbation, and disease state depends on measuring many factors, a task made more difficult by the plasticity of the epigenome. Scanning the genome for the sequence patterns defined by Position Weight Matrices (PWM) can be used to estimate transcription factor (TF) binding locations. However, this approach does not incorporate information regarding the epigenetic context necessary for TF binding. CpG methylation is an epigenetic mark influenced by environmental factors that is commonly assayed in human cohort studies. We developed a framework to score inferred TF binding locations using methylation data. We intersected motif locations identified using PWMs with methylation information captured in both whole-genome bisulfite sequencing and Illumina EPIC array data for six cell lines, scored motif locations based on these data, and compared with experimental data characterizing TF binding (ChIP-seq). We found that for most TFs, binding prediction improves using methylation-based scoring compared to standard PWM-scores. We also illustrate that our approach can be generalized to infer TF binding when methylation information is only proximally available, i.e . measured for nearby CpGs that do not directly overlap with a motif location. Overall, our approach provides a framework for inferring context-specific TF binding using methylation data. Importantly, the availability of DNA methylation data in existing patient populations provides an opportunity to use our approach to understand the impact of methylation on gene regulatory processes in the context of human disease.",

    "abstract": "We describe an effort (“Codebook”) to determine the sequence specificity of 332 putative and largely uncharacterized human transcription factors (TFs), as well as 61 control TFs. Nearly 5,000 independent experiments across multiple in vitro and in vivo assays produced motifs for just over half of the putative TFs analyzed (177, or 53%), of which most are unique to a single TF. The data highlight the extensive contribution of transposable elements to TF evolution, both in cis and trans , and identify tens of thousands of conserved, base-level binding sites in the human genome. The use of multiple assays provides an unprecedented opportunity to benchmark and analyze TF sequence specificity, function, and evolution, as further explored in accompanying manuscripts. 1,421 human TFs are now associated with a DNA binding motif. Extrapolation from the Codebook benchmarking, however, suggests that many of the currently known binding motifs for well-studied TFs may inaccurately describe the TF’s true sequence preferences.",

By human curation, we approved a subset of experiments that yielded consistent motifs across platforms and replicates, and evaluated quantitatively the cross-platform performance of PWMs obtained with ten motif discovery tools.

    "abstract": "Transcription factors (TFs) play important roles in the regulation of gene expression. They can activate or block transcription of downstream genes in a manner of binding to specific genomic sequences. Therefore, motif discovery of these binding preference patterns is of central significance in the understanding of molecular regulation mechanism. Many algorithms have been proposed for the identification of transcription factor binding sites. However, it remains a challengeable problem. Here, we proposed a novel motif discovery algorithm based on support vector machine (MD-SVM) to learn a discriminative model for TF binding sites. MD-SVM firstly obtains position weight matrix (PWM) from a set of training datasets. Then it translates the MD problem into a computational framework of multiple instance learning (MIL). It was applied to several real biological datasets. Results show that our algorithm outperforms MI-SVM in terms of both accuracy and specificity. In this paper, we modeled the TF motif discovery problem as a MIL optimization problem. The SVM algorithm was adapted to discriminate positive and negative bags of instances. Compared to other svm-based algorithms, MD-SVM show its superiority over its competitors in term of ROC AUC. Hopefully, it could be of benefit to the research community in the understanding of molecular functions of DNA functional elements and transcription factors.",

    "title": "A General Pairwise Interaction Model Provides an Accurate Description of In Vivo Transcription Factor Binding Sites",
    "abstract": "The identification of transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) on genomic DNA is of crucial importance for understanding and predicting regulatory elements in gene networks. TFBS motifs are commonly described by Position Weight Matrices (PWMs), in which each DNA base pair contributes independently to the transcription factor (TF) binding. However, this description ignores correlations between nucleotides at different positions, and is generally inaccurate: analysing fly and mouse in vivo ChIPseq data, we show that in most cases the PWM model fails to reproduce the observed statistics of TFBSs. To overcome this issue, we introduce the pairwise interaction model (PIM), a generalization of the PWM model. The model is based on the principle of maximum entropy and explicitly describes pairwise correlations between nucleotides at different positions, while being otherwise as unconstrained as possible. It is mathematically equivalent to considering a TF-DNA binding energy that depends additively on each nucleotide identity at all positions in the TFBS, like the PWM model, but also additively on pairs of nucleotides. We find that the PIM significantly improves over the PWM model, and even provides an optimal description of TFBS statistics within statistical noise. The PIM generalizes previous approaches to interdependent positions: it accounts for co-variation of two or more base pairs, and predicts secondary motifs, while outperforming multiple-motif models consisting of mixtures of PWMs. We analyse the structure of pairwise interactions between nucleotides, and find that they are sparse and dominantly located between consecutive base pairs in the flanking region of TFBS. Nonetheless, interactions between pairs of non-consecutive nucleotides are found to play a significant role in the obtained accurate description of TFBS statistics. The PIM is computationally tractable, and provides a general framework that should be useful for describing and predicting TFBSs beyond PWMs.",

    "title": "Inferring intra-motif dependencies of DNA binding sites from ChIP-seq data",
    "abstract": "Statistical modeling of transcription factor binding sites is one of the classical fields in bioinformatics. The position weight matrix (PWM) model, which assumes statistical independence among all nucleotides in a binding site, used to be the standard model for this task for more than three decades but its simple assumptions are increasingly put into question. Recent high-throughput sequencing methods have provided data sets of sufficient size and quality for studying the benefits of more complex models. However, learning more complex models typically entails the danger of overfitting, and while model classes that dynamically adapt the model complexity to data have been developed, effective model selection is to date only possible for fully observable data, but not, e.g., within de novo motif discovery. To address this issue, we propose a stochastic algorithm for performing robust model selection in a latent variable setting. This algorithm yields a solution without relying on hyperparameter-tuning via massive cross-validation or other computationally expensive resampling techniques. Using this algorithm for learning inhomogeneous parsimonious Markov models, we study the degree of putative higher-order intra-motif dependencies for transcription factor binding sites inferred via de novo motif discovery from ChIP-seq data. We find that intra-motif dependencies are prevalent and not limited to first-order dependencies among directly adjacent nucleotides, but that second-order models appear to be the significantly better choice. The traditional PWM model appears to be indeed insufficient to infer realistic sequence motifs, as it is on average outperformed by more complex models that take into account intra-motif dependencies. Moreover, using such models together with an appropriate model selection procedure does not lead to a significant performance loss in comparison with the PWM model for any of the studied transcription factors. Hence, we find it worthwhile to recommend that any modern motif discovery algorithm should attempt to take into account intra-motif dependencies.

    "abstract": "Transcription factors (TFs) are proteins that promote or reduce the expression of genes by binding short genomic DNA sequences known as transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). While several tools have been developed to scan for potential occurrences of TFBS in linear DNA sequences or reference genomes, no tool exists to find them in pangenome variation graphs (VGs). VGs are sequence-labelled graphs that can efficiently encode collections of genomes and their variants in a single, compact data structure. Because VGs can losslessly compress large pangenomes, TFBS scanning in VGs can efficiently capture how genomic variation affects the potential binding landscape of TFs in a population of individuals. Here we present GRAFIMO (GRAph-based Finding of Individual Motif Occurrences), a command-line tool for the scanning of known TF DNA motifs represented as Position Weight Matrices (PWMs) in VGs. GRAFIMO extends the standard PWM scanning procedure by considering variations and alternative haplotypes encoded in a VG. Using GRAFIMO on a VG based on individuals from the 1000 Genomes project we recover several potential binding sites that are enhanced, weakened or missed when scanning only the reference genome, and which could constitute individual-specific binding events.

    "abstract": "Scanning through genomes for potential transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) is becoming increasingly important in this post-genomic era. The position weight matrix (PWM) is the standard representation of TFBSs utilized when scanning through sequences for potential binding sites. However, many transcription factor (TF) motifs are short and highly degenerate, and methods utilizing PWMs to scan for sites are plagued by false positives. Furthermore, many important TFs do not have well-characterized PWMs, making identification of potential binding sites even more difficult. One approach to the identification of sites for these TFs has been to use the 3D structure of the TF to predict the DNA structure around the TF and then to generate a PWM from the predicted 3D complex structure. However, this approach is dependent on the similarity of the predicted structure to the native structure. We introduce here a novel approach to identify TFBSs utilizing structure information that can be applied to TFs without characterized PWMs, as long as a 3D complex structure (TF/DNA) exists. This approach utilizes an energy function that is uniquely trained on each structure. Our approach leads to increased prediction accuracy and robustness compared with those using a more general energy function. The software is freely available upon request.",

    "title": "Application of experimentally verified transcription factor binding sites models for computational analysis of ChIP-Seq data",
    "abstract": "ChIP-Seq is widely used to detect genomic segments bound by transcription factors (TF), either directly at DNA binding sites (BSs) or indirectly via other proteins. Currently, there are many software tools implementing different approaches to identify TFBSs within ChIP-Seq peaks. However, their use for the interpretation of ChIP-Seq data is usually complicated by the absence of direct experimental verification, making it difficult both to set a threshold to avoid recognition of too many false-positive BSs, and to compare the actual performance of different models. Using ChIP-Seq data for FoxA2 binding loci in mouse adult liver and human HepG2 cells we compared FoxA binding-site predictions for four computational models of two fundamental classes: pattern matching based on existing training set of experimentally confirmed TFBSs (oPWM and SiteGA) and de novo motif discovery (ChIPMunk and diChIPMunk). To properly select prediction thresholds for the models, we experimentally evaluated affinity of 64 predicted FoxA BSs using EMSA that allows safely distinguishing sequences able to bind TF. As a result we identified thousands of reliable FoxA BSs within ChIP-Seq loci from mouse liver and human HepG2 cells. It was found that the performance of conventional position weight matrix (PWM) models was inferior with the highest false positive rate. On the contrary, the best recognition efficiency was achieved by the combination of SiteGA & diChIPMunk/ChIPMunk models, properly identifying FoxA BSs in up to 90% of loci for both mouse and human ChIP-Seq datasets. The experimental study of TF binding to oligonucleotides corresponding to predicted sites increases the reliability of computational methods for TFBS-recognition in ChIP-Seq data analysis. Regarding ChIP-Seq data interpretation, basic PWMs have inferior TFBS recognition quality compared to the more sophisticated SiteGA and de novo motif discovery methods. A combination of models from different principles allowed identification of proper TFBSs.

    "abstract": "A long-standing challenge in human regulatory genomics is that transcription factor (TF) DNA-binding motifs are short and degenerate, while the genome is large. Motif scans therefore produce many false-positive binding site predictions. By surveying 179 TFs across 25 families using >1,500 cyclic in vitro selection experiments with fragmented, naked, and unmodified genomic DNA – a method we term GHT-SELEX (Genomic HT-SELEX) – we find that many human TFs possess much higher sequence specificity than anticipated. Moreover, genomic binding regions from GHT-SELEX are often surprisingly similar to those obtained in vivo (i.e. ChIP-seq peaks). We find that comparable specificity can also be obtained from motif scans, but performance is highly dependent on derivation and use of the motifs, including accounting for multiple local matches in the scans. We also observe alternative engagement of multiple DNA-binding domains within the same protein: long C2H2 zinc finger proteins often utilize modular DNA recognition, engaging different subsets of their DNA binding domain (DBD) arrays to recognize multiple types of distinct target sites, frequently evolving via internal duplication and divergence of one or more DBDs. Thus, contrary to conventional wisdom, it is common for TFs to possess sufficient intrinsic specificity to independently delineate cellular targets.",

    "title": "Motif models proposing independent and interdependent impacts of nucleotides are related to high and low affinity transcription factor binding sites in Arabidopsis",
    "abstract": "Position weight matrix (PWM) is the traditional motif model representing the transcription factor (TF) binding sites. It proposes that the positions contribute independently to TFs binding affinity, although this hypothesis does not fit the data perfectly. This explains why PWM hits are missing in a substantial fraction of ChIP-seq peaks. To study various modes of the direct binding of plant TFs, we compiled the benchmark collection of 111 ChIP-seq datasets for Arabidopsis thaliana , and applied the traditional PWM, and two alternative motif models BaMM and SiteGA, proposing the dependencies of the positions. The variation in the stringency of the recognition thresholds for the models proposed that the hits of PWM, BaMM, and SiteGA models are associated with the sites of high/medium, any, and low affinity, respectively. At the medium recognition threshold, about 60% of ChIP-seq peaks contain PWM hits consisting of conserved core consensuses, while BaMM and SiteGA provide hits for an additional 15% of peaks in which a weaker core consensus is compensated through intra-motif dependencies. The presence/absence of these dependencies in the motifs of alternative/traditional models was confirmed by the dependency logo DepLogo visualizing the position-wise partitioning of the alignments of predicted sites. We exemplify the detailed analysis of ChIP-seq profiles for plant TFs CCA1, MYC2, and SEP3. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis revealed that among the three motif models, the SiteGA had the highest portions of genes with the significantly enriched GO terms among all predicted genes. We showed that both alternative motif models provide for traditional PWM greater extensions in predicted sites for TFs MYC2/SEP3 with condition/tissue specific functions, compared to those for TF CCA1 with housekeeping functions. Overall, the combined application of standard and alternative motif models is beneficial to detect various modes of the direct TF-DNA interactions in the maximal portion of ChIP-seq loci.",

    "title": "Cross-platform DNA motif discovery and benchmarking to explore binding specificities of poorly studied human transcription factors",
    "abstract": "A DNA sequence pattern, or “motif”, is an essential representation of DNA-binding specificity of a transcription factor (TF). Any particular motif model has potential flaws due to shortcomings of the underlying experimental data and computational motif discovery algorithm. As a part of the Codebook/GRECO-BIT initiative, here we evaluated at large scale the cross-platform recognition performance of positional weight matrices (PWMs), which remain popular motif models in many practical applications. We applied ten different DNA motif discovery tools to generate PWMs from the “Codebook” data comprised of 4,237 experiments from five different platforms profiling the DNA-binding specificity of 394 human proteins, focusing on understudied transcription factors of different structural families. For many of the proteins, there was no prior knowledge of a genuine motif. By benchmarking-supported human curation, we constructed an approved subset of experiments comprising about 30% of all experiments and 50% of tested TFs which displayed consistent motifs across platforms and replicates. We present the Codebook Motif Explorer ( https://mex.autosome.org ), a detailed online catalog of DNA motifs, including the top-ranked PWMs, and the underlying source and benchmarking data. We demonstrate that in the case of high-quality experimental data, most of the popular motif discovery tools detect valid motifs and generate PWMs, which perform well both on genomic and synthetic data. Yet, for each of the algorithms, there were problematic combinations of proteins and platforms, and the basic motif properties such as nucleotide composition and information content offered little help in detecting such pitfalls. By combining multiple PMWs in decision trees, we demonstrate how our setup can be readily adapted to train and test binding specificity models more complex than PWMs. Overall, our study provides a rich motif catalog as a solid baseline for advanced models and highlights the power of the multi-platform multi-tool approach for reliable mapping of DNA binding specificities.",

A comprehensive reference of ATAC-seq datasets for mammalian tissues is important for the understanding of regulatory specificity and developmental abnormality caused by genetic or environmental alterations. Here, we report an adult mouse ATAC-seq atlas by producing a total of 66 ATAC-seq profiles from 20 primary tissues of both male and female mice. The ATAC-seq read enrichment, fragment size distribution, and reproducibility between replicates demonstrated the high quality of the full dataset. We identified a total of 296,574 accessible elements, of which 26,916 showed tissue-specific accessibility. Further, we identified key transcription factors specific to distinct tissues and found that the enrichment of each motif reflects the developmental similarities across tissues. In summary, our study provides an important resource on the mouse epigenome and will be of great importance to various scientific disciplines such as development, cell reprogramming, and genetic disease.",

    "abstract": "Cis-regulatory elements (CREs) are pivotal in orchestrating gene expression throughout diverse biological systems. Accurate identification and in-depth characterization of functional CREs are crucial for decoding gene regulation networks during cellular processes. In this study, we develop Kethoxal-Assisted Single-stranded DNA Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin with Sequencing (KAS-ATAC-seq) to quantitatively analyze the transcriptional activity of CREs. A main advantage of KAS-ATAC-seq lies in its precise measurement of ssDNA levels within both proximal and distal ATAC-seq peaks, enabling the identification of transcriptional regulatory sequences. This feature is particularly adept at defining Single-Stranded Transcribing Enhancers (SSTEs). SSTEs are highly enriched with nascent RNAs and specific transcription factors (TFs) binding sites that define cellular identity. Moreover, KAS-ATAC-seq provides a detailed characterization and functional implications of various SSTE subtypes. Our analysis of CREs during mouse neural differentiation demonstrates that KAS-ATAC-seq can effectively identify immediate-early activated CREs in response to retinoic acid (RA) treatment. Our findings indicate that KAS-ATAC-seq provides more precise annotation of functional CREs in transcription. Future applications of KAS-ATAC-seq would help elucidate the intricate dynamics of gene regulation in diverse biological processes.",

    "abstract": "We report the generation of an organism-wide catalog of 976,813 cis -acting regulatory elements for the bovine detected by the assay for transposase accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq). We regroup these regulatory elements in 16 components by nonnegative matrix factorization. Correlation between the genome-wide density of peaks and transcription start sites, correlation between peak accessibility and expression of neighboring genes, and enrichment in transcription factor binding motifs support their regulatory potential. Using a previously established catalog of 12,736,643 variants, we show that the proportion of single-nucleotide polymorphisms mapping to ATAC-seq peaks is higher than expected and that this is owing to an approximately 1.3-fold higher mutation rate within peaks. Their site frequency spectrum indicates that variants in ATAC-seq peaks are subject to purifying selection. We generate eQTL data sets for liver and blood and show that variants that drive eQTL fall into liver- and blood-specific ATAC-seq peaks more often than expected by chance. We combine ATAC-seq and eQTL data to estimate that the proportion of regulatory variants mapping to ATAC-seq peaks is approximately one in three and that the proportion of variants mapping to ATAC-seq peaks that are regulatory is approximately one in 25. We discuss the implication of these findings on the utility of ATAC-seq information to improve the accuracy of genomic selection.",

We apply scMTR-seq to uncover dynamic and coordinated changes in chromatin states and transcriptomes during human endoderm differentiation. We also use scMTR-seq to produce lineage-resolved chromatin maps and gene regulatory networks in mouse blastocysts, revealing epigenetic asymmetries at gene regulatory regions between the three embryo lineages and identifying Trps1 as a potential repressor in epiblast cells of trophectoderm-associated enhancer networks and their target genes.

We capture transitions from pluripotency through neuroepithelium to retinal and brain region and cell type specification. Switching of repressive and activating epigenetic modifications can precede and predict cell fate decisions at each stage, providing a temporal census of gene regulatory elements and transcription factors. Removing H3K27me3 at the neuroectoderm stage disrupts fate restriction, resulting in aberrant cell identity acquisition.

    "abstract": "Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4A (HNF4A/NR2a1), a transcriptional regulator of hepatocyte identity, controls genes that are crucial for liver functions, primarily through binding to enhancers. In mammalian cells, active and primed enhancers are marked by monomethylation of histone 3 (H3) at lysine 4 (K4) (H3K4me1) in a cell type-specific manner. How this modification is established and maintained at enhancers in connection with transcription factors (TFs) remains unknown. Using analysis of genome-wide histone modifications, TF binding, chromatin accessibility and gene expression, we show that HNF4A is essential for an active chromatin state. Using HNF4A loss and gain of function experiments in vivo and in cell lines in vitro, we show that HNF4A affects H3K4me1, H3K27ac and chromatin accessibility, highlighting its contribution to the establishment and maintenance of a transcriptionally permissive epigenetic state. Mechanistically, HNF4A interacts with the mixed-lineage leukaemia 4 (MLL4) complex facilitating recruitment to HNF4A-bound regions. Our findings indicate that HNF4A enriches H3K4me1, H3K27ac and establishes chromatin opening at transcriptional regulatory regions.",

In contrast, zebrafish exhibit robust regenerative capacity, providing a powerful model for studying how to overcome intrinsic epigenetic barriers maintaining cardiac homeostasis and initiate regeneration. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of the histone modifications H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K27me3 and H3K27ac during various stages of zebrafish heart regeneration. We found a vast gain of repressive chromatin marks one day after myocardial injury, followed by the acquisition of active chromatin characteristics on day four and a transition to a repressive state on day 14, and identified distinct transcription factor ensembles associated with these events. The rapid transcriptional response involves the engagement of super-enhancers at genes implicated in extracellular matrix reorganization and TOR signaling, while H3K4me3 breadth highly correlates with transcriptional activity and dynamic changes at genes involved in proteolysis, cell cycle activity, and cell differentiation. Using loss- and gain-of-function approaches, we identified transcription factors in cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells influencing cardiomyocyte dedifferentiation or proliferation. Finally, we detected significant evolutionary conservation between regulatory regions that drive zebrafish and neonatal mouse heart regeneration, suggesting that reactivating transcriptional and epigenetic networks converging on these regulatory elements might unlock the regenerative potential of adult human hearts.",

    "abstract": "Substantial epigenetic resetting during early embryo development from fertilization to blastocyst formation ensures zygotic genome activation and leads to progressive cellular heterogeneities 1 – 3 . Mapping single-cell epigenomic profiles of core histone modifications that cover each individual cell is a fundamental goal in developmental biology. Here we develop target chromatin indexing and tagmentation (TACIT), a method that enabled genome-coverage single-cell profiling of seven histone modifications across mouse early embryos. We integrated these single-cell histone modifications with single-cell RNA sequencing data to chart a single-cell resolution epigenetic landscape. Multimodal chromatin-state annotations showed that the onset of zygotic genome activation at the early two-cell stage already primes heterogeneities in totipotency. We used machine learning to identify totipotency gene regulatory networks, including stage-specific transposable elements and putative transcription factors. CRISPR activation of a combination of these identified transcription factors induced totipotency activation in mouse embryonic stem cells. Together with single-cell co-profiles of multiple histone modifications, we developed a model that predicts the earliest cell branching towards the inner cell mass and the trophectoderm in latent multimodal space and identifies regulatory elements and previously unknown lineage-specifying transcription factors. Our work provides insights into single-cell epigenetic reprogramming, multimodal regulation of cellular lineages and cell-fate priming during mouse pre-implantation development.",

    "title": "The adapted Activity-By-Contact model for enhancer–gene assignment and its application to single-cell data",
    "abstract": "Identifying regulatory regions in the genome is of great interest for understanding the epigenomic landscape in cells. One fundamental challenge in this context is to find the target genes whose expression is affected by the regulatory regions. A recent successful method is the Activity-By-Contact (ABC) model which scores enhancer – gene interactions based on enhancer activity and the contact frequency of an enhancer to its target gene. However, it describes regulatory interactions entirely from a gene’s perspective, and does not account for all the candidate target genes of an enhancer. In addition, the ABC model requires two types of assays to measure enhancer activity, which limits the applicability. Moreover, there is neither implementation available that could allow for an integration with transcription factor (TF) binding information nor an efficient analysis of single-cell data. We demonstrate that the ABC score can yield a higher accuracy by adapting the enhancer activity according to the number of contacts the enhancer has to its candidate target genes and also by considering all annotated transcription start sites of a gene. Further, we show that the model is comparably accurate with only one assay to measure enhancer activity. We combined our generalized ABC model with TF binding information and illustrated an analysis of a single-cell ATAC-seq dataset of the human heart, where we were able to characterize cell type-specific regulatory interactions and predict gene expression based on TF affinities. All executed processing steps are incorporated into our new computational pipeline STARE.

    "title": "Impact of 3D genome organization, guided by cohesin and CTCF looping, on sex-biased chromatin interactions and gene expression in mouse liver",
    "abstract": "Several thousand sex-differential distal enhancers have been identified in mouse liver; however, their links to sex-biased genes and the impact of any sex-differences in nuclear organization and chromatin interactions are unknown. To address these issues, we first characterized 1847 mouse liver genomic regions showing significant sex differential occupancy by cohesin and CTCF, two key 3D nuclear organizing factors. These sex-differential binding sites were primarily distal to sex-biased genes but rarely generated sex-differential TAD (topologically associating domain) or intra-TAD loop anchors, and were sometimes found in TADs without sex-biased genes. A substantial subset of sex-biased cohesin-non-CTCF binding sites, but not sex-biased cohesin-and-CTCF binding sites, overlapped sex-biased enhancers. Cohesin depletion reduced the expression of male-biased genes with distal, but not proximal, sex-biased enhancers by >10-fold, implicating cohesin in long-range enhancer interactions regulating sex-biased genes. Using circularized chromosome conformation capture-based sequencing (4C-seq), we showed that sex differences in distal sex-biased enhancer–promoter interactions are common. Intra-TAD loops with sex-independent cohesin-and-CTCF anchors conferred sex specificity to chromatin interactions indirectly, by insulating sex-biased enhancer–promoter contacts and by bringing sex-biased genes into closer proximity to sex-biased enhancers. Furthermore, sex-differential chromatin interactions involving sex-biased gene promoters, enhancers, and lncRNAs were associated with sex-biased binding of cohesin and/or CTCF. These studies elucidate how 3D genome organization impacts sex-biased gene expression in a non-reproductive tissue through both direct and indirect effects of cohesin and CTCF looping on distal enhancer interactions with sex-differentially expressed genes.",

    "title": "Tandem CTCF sites function as insulators to balance spatial chromatin contacts and topological enhancer-promoter selection",
    "abstract": "CTCF is a key insulator-binding protein, and mammalian genomes contain numerous CTCF sites, many of which are organized in tandem. Using CRISPR DNA-fragment editing, in conjunction with chromosome conformation capture, we find that CTCF sites, if located between enhancers and promoters in the protocadherin ( Pcdh ) and β-globin clusters, function as an enhancer-blocking insulator by forming distinct directional chromatin loops, regardless whether enhancers contain CTCF sites or not. Moreover, computational simulation in silico and genetic deletions in vivo as well as dCas9 blocking in vitro revealed balanced promoter usage in cell populations and stochastic monoallelic expression in single cells by large arrays of tandem CTCF sites in the Pcdh and immunoglobulin heavy chain ( Igh ) clusters. Furthermore, CTCF insulators promote, counter-intuitively, long-range chromatin interactions with distal directional CTCF sites, consistent with the cohesin “loop extrusion” model. Finally, gene expression levels are negatively correlated with CTCF insulators located between enhancers and promoters on a genome-wide scale. Thus, single CTCF insulators ensure proper enhancer insulation and promoter activation while tandem CTCF topological insulators determine balanced spatial contacts and promoter choice. These findings have interesting implications on the role of topological chromatin insulators in 3D genome folding and developmental gene regulation.",

By MPRA (Massively parallel reporter assays), we deciphered the sequence features that regulate promoter transcriptional, including motifs and motif syntax (their combination and distance). Finally, we built and trained a deep learning model capable of predicting the transcriptional strength of the immunoglobulin V gene promoter directly from sequence. Prediction of thousands of promoter variants identified in the global human population shows that polymorphisms in promoters influence the transcription of immunoglobulin V genes, which may contribute to individual differences in adaptive humoral immune responses. Our work helps to decipher the transcription mechanism in immunoglobulin genes and offers thousands of non-similar promoters for B-cell engineering.",

    "abstract": "Design of de novo synthetic regulatory DNA is a promising avenue to control gene expression in biotechnology and medicine. Using mutagenesis typically requires screening sizable random DNA libraries, which limits the designs to span merely a short section of the promoter and restricts their control of gene expression. Here, we prototype a deep learning strategy based on generative adversarial networks (GAN) by learning directly from genomic and transcriptomic data. Our ExpressionGAN can traverse the entire regulatory sequence-expression landscape in a gene-specific manner, generating regulatory DNA with prespecified target mRNA levels spanning the whole gene regulatory structure including coding and adjacent non-coding regions. Despite high sequence divergence from natural DNA, in vivo measurements show that 57% of the highly-expressed synthetic sequences surpass the expression levels of highly-expressed natural controls. This demonstrates the applicability and relevance of deep generative design to expand our knowledge and control of gene expression regulation in any desired organism, condition or tissue.",

We discuss how the cis-regulatory sequence rules can be learned and interpreted with sequence-to-function neural networks, with the goal of identifying genetic variants in human disease. We also describe current methods for mapping gene regulatory networks to describe biological processes. We point out current gaps in knowledge along with technical limitations and benchmarking challenges of computational methods. Finally, we discuss newly emerging technologies, such as spatial transcriptomics, and outline strategies for creating a more general model of the cis-regulatory code that is more broadly applicable across cell types and individuals.",

While there is great potential for strategically incorporating CREs in therapeutic or biotechnology applications that require tissue specificity, there is no guarantee that an optimal CRE for these intended purposes has arisen naturally. Here we present a platform to engineer and validate synthetic CREs capable of driving gene expression with programmed cell-type specificity. We take advantage of innovations in deep neural network modelling of CRE activity across three cell types, efficient in silico optimization and massively parallel reporter assays to design and empirically test thousands of CREs 4 – 8 . Through large-scale in vitro validation, we show that synthetic sequences are more effective at driving cell-type-specific expression in three cell lines compared with natural sequences from the human genome and achieve specificity in analogous tissues when tested in vivo. Synthetic sequences exhibit distinct motif vocabulary associated with activity in the on-target cell type and a simultaneous reduction in the activity of off-target cells. Together, we provide a generalizable framework to prospectively engineer CREs from massively parallel reporter assay models and demonstrate the required literacy to write fit-for-purpose regulatory code.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide chromatin annotations have permitted the mapping of putative regulatory elements across multiple human cell types. However, their experimental dissection by directed regulatory motif disruption has remained unfeasible at the genome scale. Here, we use a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to measure the transcriptional levels induced by 145-bp DNA segments centered on evolutionarily conserved regulatory motif instances within enhancer chromatin states. We select five predicted activators (HNF1, HNF4, FOXA, GATA, NFE2L2) and two predicted repressors (GFI1, ZFP161) and measure reporter expression in erythroleukemia (K562) and liver carcinoma (HepG2) cell lines. We test 2104 wild-type sequences and 3314 engineered enhancer variants containing targeted motif disruptions, each using 10 barcode tags and two replicates. The resulting data strongly confirm the enhancer activity and cell-type specificity of enhancer chromatin states, the ability of 145-bp segments to recapitulate both, the necessary role of regulatory motifs in enhancer function, and the complementary roles of activator and repressor motifs. We find statistically robust evidence that (1) disrupting the predicted activator motifs abolishes enhancer function, while silent or motif-improving changes maintain enhancer activity; (2) evolutionary conservation, nucleosome exclusion, binding of other factors, and strength of the motif match are predictive of enhancer activity; (3) scrambling repressor motifs leads to aberrant reporter expression in cell lines where the enhancers are usually inactive. Our results suggest a general strategy for deciphering cis -regulatory elements by systematic large-scale manipulation and provide quantitative enhancer activity measurements across thousands of constructs that can be mined to develop predictive models of gene expression.",

However, computational efforts remain scant to evaluate and establish guidelines for sequence design strategies for perturbation MPRAs. In this study, we propose a framework for evaluating and comparing various perturbation strategies for MPRA experiments. Within this framework, we benchmark three different perturbation approaches from the perspectives of alteration in motif-based profiles, consistency of MPRA outputs, and robustness of models that predict the activities of putative regulatory motifs. While our analyses show very similar results across multiple benchmarking metrics, the predictive modeling for the approach involving random nucleotide shuffling shows significant robustness compared with the other two approaches. Thus, we recommend designing sequences by randomly shuffling the nucleotides of the perturbed site in perturbation-MPRA, followed by a coherence check to prevent the introduction of other variations of the target motifs. In summary, our evaluation framework and the benchmarking findings create a resource of computational pipelines and highlight the potential of perturbation-MPRA in predicting non-coding regulatory activities.",

Consensus ARE motifs have been determined, but little is known about how differences in 3′ UTR sequences that conform to these motifs affect their function.

Our analyses demonstrate that the length of an ARE and its registration (the first and last nucleotides of the repeating ARE motif) have significant effects on gene expression and stability. Based on this finding, we propose improved ARE classification and concomitant methods to categorize and predict the effect of AREs on gene expression and stability. Finally, to investigate the advantages of our general experimental design we examine other motifs including constitutive decay elements (CDEs), where we show that the length of the CDE stem-loop has a significant impact on steady-state expression and mRNA stability. We conclude that fast-UTR, in conjunction with our analytical approach, can produce improved yet simple sequence-based rules for predicting the activity of human 3′ UTRs.",

    "abstract": "As researchers and clinicians seek to identify human genomic alterations relevant to traits and disorders, identifying and aggregating evidence providing mechanistic support for associations between alterations and phenotypes remains challenging. In particular, the study of non-coding genomic variation remains a major challenge due to the lack of accurate functional annotation for activity in a given context and across alleles. Experimental evidence is critical for prioritizing and interpreting functional effects of genetic alterations. Massively Parallel Reporter Assays (MPRAs) have emerged as a powerful high-throughput approach, enabling quantification of regulatory element activity and allelic effects, and systematic dissection of gene regulatory logic and variant effects across different contexts. However, the diversity of MPRA designs, lack of standardized formats, and many potential processing parameters hamper data integration, reproducibility, and meta-analyses across studies. To address these challenges, the Impact of Genomic Variation on Function (IGVF) Consortium established an MPRA focus group to develop community standards, including harmonized file formats, and robust analysis pipelines for a wide range of library types and experimental designs. Here, we present these formats and comprehensive computational tools, MPRAlib and MPRAsnakeflow, for uniform processing from raw sequencing reads to counts, processing and visualization. Using diverse MPRA datasets, we characterize technical variability sources including barcode sequence bias, outlier barcodes, and delivery method (episomal vs. lentiviral). Our results establish best practices for MPRA data generation and analysis, facilitating robust, reproducible research and large-scale integration.

    "abstract": "Massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) functionally screen thousands of sequences for regulatory activity in parallel. To date, there has been no systematic comparison of differences in MPRA design. Here, we screen a library of 2,440 candidate liver enhancers and controls for regulatory activity in HepG2 cells using nine different MPRA designs. We identify subtle but significant differences that correlate with epigenetic and sequence-level features, as well as differences in dynamic range and reproducibility. We also validate en masse that enhancer activity is robustly independent of orientation, at least for our library and designs. Finally, with a new method, we assemble and test the same enhancers as 192-mers, 354-mers, and 678-mers, and observe surprisingly large differences. This work provides a framework for the experimental design of high-throughput reporter assays, suggesting that the extended sequence context of tested elements, and to a lesser degree the precise assay, influence MPRA results.",

    "abstract": "The master tumor suppressor p53 controls transcription of a wide-ranging gene network involved in apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, DNA damage repair, and senescence. Recent studies revealed pervasive binding of p53 to cis- regulatory elements (CREs), which are non-coding segments of DNA that spatially and temporally control transcription through the combinatorial binding of local transcription factors. Although the role of p53 as a strong trans- activator of gene expression is well known, the co-regulatory factors and local sequences acting at p53-bound CREs are comparatively understudied. We designed and executed a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to investigate the effect of transcription factor binding motifs and local sequence context on p53-bound CRE activity. Our data indicate that p53-bound CREs are both positively and negatively affected by alterations in local sequence context and changes to co-regulatory TF motifs. Our data suggest p53 has the flexibility to cooperate with a variety of transcription factors in order to regulate CRE activity. By utilizing different sets of co-factors across CREs, we hypothesize that global p53 activity is guarded against loss of any one regulatory partner, allowing for dynamic and redundant control of p53-mediated transcription.",

    "abstract": "Deciphering the potential of noncoding loci to influence gene regulation has been the subject of intense research, with important implications in understanding genetic underpinnings of human diseases. Massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) can measure regulatory activity of thousands of DNA sequences and their variants in a single experiment. With increasing number of publically available MPRA data sets, one can now develop data‐driven models which, given a DNA sequence, predict its regulatory activity. Here, we performed a comprehensive meta‐analysis of several MPRA data sets in a variety of cellular contexts. We first applied an ensemble of methods to predict MPRA output in each context and observed that the most predictive features are consistent across data sets. We then demonstrate that predictive models trained in one cellular context can be used to predict MPRA output in another, with loss of accuracy attributed to cell‐type‐specific features. Finally, we show that our approach achieves top performance in the Fifth Critical Assessment of Genome Interpretation “Regulation Saturation” Challenge for predicting effects of single‐nucleotide variants. Overall, our analysis provides insights into how MPRA data can be leveraged to highlight functional regulatory regions throughout the genome and can guide effective design of future experiments by better prioritizing regions of interest.",

Massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs), which quantify the regulatory activity of large libraries of DNA sequences in parallel, are a powerful approach to characterize this relationship. We present MPRA-DragoNN, a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based framework to predict and interpret the regulatory activity of DNA sequences as measured by MPRAs. While our method is generally applicable to a variety of MPRA designs, here we trained our model on the Sharpr-MPRA dataset that measures the activity of ∼500,000 constructs tiling 15,720 regulatory regions in human K562 and HepG2 cell lines. MPRA-DragoNN predictions were moderately correlated (Spearman ρ = 0.28) with measured activity and were within range of replicate concordance of the assay. State-of-the-art model interpretation methods revealed high-resolution predictive regulatory sequence features that overlapped transcription factor (TF) binding motifs. We used the model to investigate the cell type and chromatin state preferences of predictive TF motifs. We explored the ability of our model to predict the allelic effects of regulatory variants in an independent MPRA experiment and fine map putative functional SNPs in loci associated with lipid traits. Our results suggest that interpretable deep learning models trained on MPRA data have the potential to reveal meaningful patterns in regulatory DNA sequences and prioritize regulatory genetic variants, especially as larger, higher-quality datasets are produced.",

    "abstract": "The rapid improvement of descriptive genomic technologies has fueled a dramatic increase in hypothesized connections between cardiovascular gene expression and phenotypes. However, in vivo testing of these hypotheses has predominantly been relegated to slow, expensive, and linear generation of genetically modified mice. In the study of genomic cis -regulatory elements, generation of mice featuring transgenic reporters or cis -regulatory element knockout remains the standard approach. While the data obtained is of high quality, the approach is insufficient to keep pace with candidate identification and therefore results in biases introduced during the selection of candidates for validation. However, recent advances across a range of disciplines are converging to enable functional genomic assays that can be conducted in a high-throughput manner. Here, we review one such method, massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs), in which the activities of thousands of candidate genomic regulatory elements are simultaneously assessed via the next-generation sequencing of a barcoded reporter transcript. We discuss best practices for MPRA design and use, with a focus on practical considerations, and review how this emerging technology has been successfully deployed in vivo. Finally, we discuss how MPRAs are likely to evolve and be used in future cardiovascular research.",

    "abstract": "A growing number of variants associated with risk for neurodevelopmental disorders have been identified by genome-wide association and whole genome sequencing studies. As common risk variants often fall within large haplotype blocks covering long stretches of the noncoding genome, the causal variants within an associated locus are often unknown. Similarly, the effect of rare noncoding risk variants identified by whole genome sequencing on molecular traits is seldom known without functional assays. A massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) is an assay that can functionally validate thousands of regulatory elements simultaneously using high-throughput sequencing and barcode technology. MPRA has been adapted to various experimental designs that measure gene regulatory effects of genetic variants within cis- and trans-regulatory elements as well as posttranscriptional processes. This review discusses different MPRA designs that have been or could be used in the future to experimentally validate genetic variants associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. Though MPRA has limitations such as it does not model genomic context, this assay can help narrow down the underlying genetic causes of neurodevelopmental disorders by screening thousands of sequences in one experiment. We conclude by describing future directions of this technique such as applications of MPRA for gene-by-environment interactions and pharmacogenetics.",

These variants are enriched for variants associated with psychiatric disorders and neurobehavioral traits and influence transcripts that are altered in the postmortem brain of individuals with psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, these genetic variants are associated with changes in the physiological stress response.

Here we propose the concept of transcription factor binding unit (TFBU) to modularly model enhancers by quantifying the impact of context sequences surrounding TFBSs using deep learning models. Based on this concept, we develop DeepTFBU, a comprehensive toolkit for enhancer design. We demonstrate that designing TFBS context sequences can significantly modulate enhancer activities and produce cell type-specific responses. DeepTFBU is also highly efficient in the de novo design of enhancers containing multiple TFBSs. Furthermore, DeepTFBU enables flexible decoupling and optimization of generalized enhancers. We prove that TFBU is a crucial concept, and DeepTFBU is highly effective for rational enhancer design.",

Developing synthetic biology applications is often a lengthy and expensive process with extensive and tedious trial-and-error runs. Computational models can direct the engineering of biological circuits in a computer-aided design setting. By providing a virtual lab environment, in silico models of synthetic circuits can contribute to a quantitative understanding of the underlying molecular pathways before a wet-lab implementation. Here, we illustrate this notion from the point of view of signal fidelity and noise relationship. Noise in gene expression can undermine signal fidelity with implications on the well-functioning of the engineered organisms. For our analysis, we use a specific biological circuit that regulates the gene expression in bacterial inorganic phosphate economy. Applications that use this circuit include those in pollutant detection and wastewater treatment. We provide computational models with different levels of molecular detail as virtual labs. We show that inherent fluctuations in the gene expression machinery can be predicted via stochastic simulations to introduce control in the synthetic promoter design process. Our analysis suggests that noise in the system can be alleviated by strong synthetic promoters with slow unbinding rates. Overall, we provide a recipe for the computer-aided design of synthetic promoter libraries with specific signal to noise characteristics. The design and development of synthetic biology applications in a workflow often involve connecting modular components. Whereas computer-aided design tools are picking up in synthetic biology as in other areas of engineering, the methods for verifying the correct functioning of living technologies are still in their infancy. Especially, fine-tuning for the right promoter strength to match the design specifications is often a lengthy and expensive experimental process. In particular, the relationship between signal fidelity and noise in synthetic promoter design can be a key parameter that can affect the healthy functioning of the engineered organism. To this end, based on our previous work on synthetic promoters for the E. coli PhoBR two-component system, we make a case for using chemical reaction network models for computational verification of various promoter designs before a lab implementation. We provide an analysis of this system with extensive stochastic simulations at a single-cell level to assess the signal fidelity and noise relationship. We then show how quasi-steady-state analysis via ordinary differential equations can be used to navigate between models with different levels of detail. We compare stochastic simulations with our full and reduced models by using various metrics for assessing noise. Our analysis suggests that strong promoters with low unbinding rates can act as control tools for filtering out intrinsic noise in the PhoBR context. Our results confirm that even simpler models can be used to determine promoters with specific signal to noise characteristics.",

    "title": "Orthogonal control of gene expression in plants using synthetic promoters and CRISPR-based transcription factors",
    "abstract": "The construction and application of synthetic genetic circuits is frequently improved if gene expression can be orthogonally controlled, relative to the host. In plants, orthogonality can be achieved via the use of CRISPR-based transcription factors that are programmed to act on natural or synthetic promoters. The construction of complex gene circuits can require multiple, orthogonal regulatory interactions, and this in turn requires that the full programmability of CRISPR elements be adapted to non-natural and non-standard promoters that have few constraints on their design. Therefore, we have developed synthetic promoter elements in which regions upstream of the minimal 35S CaMV promoter are designed from scratch to interact via programmed gRNAs with dCas9 fusions that allow activation of gene expression. A panel of three, mutually orthogonal promoters that can be acted on by artificial gRNAs bound by CRISPR regulators were designed. Guide RNA expression targeting these promoters was in turn controlled by either Pol III (U6) or ethylene-inducible Pol II promoters, implementing for the first time a fully artificial Orthogonal Control System (OCS). Following demonstration of the complete orthogonality of the designs, the OCS was tied to cellular metabolism by putting gRNA expression under the control of an endogenous plant signaling molecule, ethylene. The ability to form complex circuitry was demonstrated via the ethylene-driven, ratiometric expression of fluorescent proteins in single plants. The design of synthetic promoters is highly generalizable to large tracts of sequence space, allowing Orthogonal Control Systems of increasing complexity to potentially be generated at will. The ability to tie in several different basal features of plant molecular biology (Pol II and Pol III promoters, ethylene regulation) to the OCS demonstrates multiple opportunities for engineering at the system level. Moreover, given the fungibility of the core 35S CaMV promoter elements, the derived synthetic promoters can potentially be utilized across a variety of plant species.

    "abstract": "To successfully engineer\nmammalian cells for a desired purpose,\nmultiple recombinant genes are required to be coexpressed at a specific\nand optimal ratio. In this study, we hypothesized that synthetic promoters\nvarying in transcriptional activity could be used to create single\nmultigene expression vectors coexpressing recombinant genes at a predictable\nrelative stoichiometry. A library of 27 multigene constructs was created\ncomprising three discrete fluorescent reporter gene transcriptional\nunits in fixed series, each under the control of either a relatively\nlow, medium, or high transcriptional strength synthetic promoter in\nevery possible combination. Expression of each reporter gene was determined\nby absolute quantitation qRT-PCR in CHO cells. The synthetic promoters\ndid generally function as designed within a multigene vector context;\nhowever, significant divergences from predicted promoter-mediated\ntranscriptional activity were observed. First, expression of all three\ngenes within a multigene vector was repressed at varying levels relative\nto coexpression of identical reporter genes on separate single gene\nvectors at equivalent gene copies. Second, gene positional effects\nwere evident across all constructs where expression of the reporter\ngenes in positions 2 and 3 was generally reduced relative to position\n1. Finally, after accounting for general repression, synthetic promoter\ntranscriptional activity within a local multigene vector format deviated\nfrom that expected.

Recently, electrochemical control of gene expression has been demonstrated in electrogenetic systems (redox-responsive promoters used alongside redox inducers and electrodes), allowing for the direct integration of electronics with biological processes. However, the use of electrogenetic systems is limited by poor activity, tunability, and standardization. In this work, we developed a strong, unidirectional, redox-responsive promoter before deriving a mutant promoter library with a spectrum of strengths. We constructed genetic circuits with these parts and demonstrated their activation by multiple classes of redox molecules. Last, we demonstrated electrochemical activation of gene expression under aerobic conditions using a novel, modular bioelectrochemical device. These genetic and electrochemical tools facilitate the design and improve the performance of electrogenetic systems. Furthermore, the genetic design strategies used can be applied to other redox-responsive promoters to further expand the available tools for electrogenetics.",

Its enzymes are applied in food, feed, and textile industry or in lignocellulose hydrolysis in biofuel and biorefinery industry. Over the last years, the demand to expand the molecular toolbox for T. reesei to facilitate genetic engineering and improve the production of heterologous proteins grew. An important instrument to modify the expression of key genes are promoters to initiate and control their transcription. To date, the most commonly used promoter for T. reesei is the strong inducible promoter of the main cellobiohydrolase cel7a . Beside this one, there is a number of alternative inducible promoters derived from other cellulase- and xylanase encoding genes and a few constitutive promoters. With the advances in genomics and transcriptomics the identification of new constitutive and tunable promoters with different expression strength was simplified. In this review, we will discuss new developments in the field of promoters and compare their advantages and disadvantages. Synthetic expression systems constitute a new option to control gene expression and build up complex gene circuits. Therefore, we will address common structural features of promoters and describe options for promoter engineering and synthetic design of promoters. The availability of well-characterized gene expression control tools is essential for the analysis of gene function, detection of bottlenecks in gene networks and yield increase for biotechnology applications.",

    "abstract": "Inducible gene expression systems can be used to control the expression of a gene of interest by means of a small-molecule. One of the most common designs involves engineering a small-molecule responsive transcription factor (TF) and its cognate promoter, which often results in a compromise between minimal uninduced background expression (leakiness) and maximal induced expression. Here, we focus on an alternative strategy using quantitative synthetic biology to mitigate leakiness while maintaining high expression, without modifying neither the TF nor the promoter. Through mathematical modelling and experimental validations, we design the CASwitch, a mammalian synthetic gene circuit based on combining two well-known network motifs: the Coherent Feed-Forward Loop (CFFL) and the Mutual Inhibition (MI). The CASwitch combines the CRISPR-Cas endoribonuclease CasRx with the state-of-the-art Tet-On3G inducible gene system to achieve high performances. To demonstrate the potentialities of the CASwitch, we apply it to three different scenarios: enhancing a whole-cell biosensor, controlling expression of a toxic gene and inducible production of Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV) vectors.",

    "abstract": "Synthetic biology has successfully advanced our ability to design and implement complex, time-varying genetic circuits to control the expression of recombinant proteins. However, these circuits typically require the production of regulatory genes whose only purpose is to coordinate expression of other genes. When designing very small genetic constructs, such as viral genomes, we may want to avoid introducing such auxiliary gene products while nevertheless encoding complex expression dynamics. To this end, here we demonstrate that varying only the placement and strengths of promoters, terminators, and RNase cleavage sites in a computational model of a bacteriophage genome is sufficient to achieve solutions to a variety of basic gene expression patterns. We discover these genetic solutions by computationally evolving genomes to reproduce desired gene expression time-course data. Our approach shows that non-trivial patterns can be evolved, including patterns where the relative ordering of genes by abundance changes over time. We find that some patterns are easier to evolve than others, and comparable expression patterns can be achieved via different genetic architectures. Our work opens up a novel avenue to genome engineering via fine-tuning the balance of gene expression and gene degradation rates.",

    "abstract": "Most of the gene expression systems available for Gram‐negative bacteria are afflicted by relatively high levels of basal (i.e. leaky) expression of the target gene(s). This occurrence affects the system dynamics, ultimately reducing the output and productivity of engineered pathways and synthetic circuits. In order to circumvent this problem, we have designed a novel expression system based on the well‐known XylS/ Pm transcriptional regulator/promoter pair from the soil bacterium Pseudomonas putida mt‐2, in which the key functional elements are physically decoupled. By integrating the xylS gene into the chromosome of the platform strain KT2440, while placing the Pm promoter into a set of standard plasmid vectors, the inducibility of the system (i.e. the output difference between the induced and uninduced state) improved up to 170‐fold. We further combined this modular system with an extra layer of post‐translational control by means of conditional proteolysis. In this setup, the target gene is tagged with a synthetic motif dictating protein degradation. When the system features were characterized using the monomeric superfolder GFP as a model protein, the basal levels of fluorescence were brought down to zero (i.e. below the limit of detection). In all, these novel expression systems constitute an alternative tool to altogether suppress leaky gene expression, and they can be easily adapted to other vector formats and plugged‐in into different Gram‐negative bacterial species at the user's will.",

    "abstract": "Translation of mRNAs is a tightly regulated process in gene expression. In mRNA, the 5′ untranslated region (5′ UTR) controls ribosome recruitment and frequently contains structured elements that modulate translation efficacy. This study investigates stable structural motifs within the 5′ UTR of DDX23 mRNA, encoding a protein relevant for anticancer therapy, as potential regulators and targets for antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs). Despite bioinformatic predictions and transcriptomic validations suggesting RNA G-quadruplex (rG4) formation, comprehensive structural analysis using a light-up assay and CD, UV, and NMR spectroscopy revealed that most putative rG4-forming sequences do not fold into stable rG4 structures, although one of them exists in an equilibrium between rG4 and an alternative, likely hairpin, conformation. Reporter assays using a robust G4 stabilizer also argue against the significant regulatory role of rG4s in DDX23 mRNA translation. Instead, we identified and characterized a stable hairpin structure with potential regulatory function. Based on these findings, we designed fully locked nucleic acid (LNA)-modified ASOs to target this hairpin and regions flanking the upstream open reading frame (uORF) and start codon of the coding sequence. A reporter assay demonstrated that cap-proximal targeting achieved robust translation inhibition up to 80%. In contrast, targeting the efficiently translated uORF was ineffective, presumably due to steric hindrances from the ribosomal complex. The study yields crucial design principles for translation-regulating ASOs: avoid targeting regions shielded by efficient uORF translation and carefully tune ASO-RNA duplex stability to surpass endogenous structures without disrupting regulatory mechanisms. These findings provide insights into the regulation of DDX23 expression and establish a framework for developing ASO-based therapeutics with broad implications for mRNA targeting in anticancer applications.",

We first show that the resulting data define accurate maps of functional transcription factor binding sites in both enhancers at single-nucleotide resolution.

Beyond conserved 5′ss and 3′ss motifs, splicing regulatory elements (SREs) play a pivotal role in this recognition process. Here, we present in silico designed sequences with arbitrary a priori prescribed splicing regulatory HEXplorer properties that can be concatenated to arbitrary length without changing their regulatory properties. We experimentally validated in silico predictions in a massively parallel splicing reporter assay on more than 3000 sequences and exemplarily identified some SRE binding proteins. Aiming at a unified ‘functional splice site strength’ encompassing both U1 snRNA complementarity and impact from neighboring SREs, we developed a novel RNA-seq based 5′ss usage landscape, mapping the competition of pairs of high confidence 5′ss and neighboring exonic GT sites along HBond and HEXplorer score coordinate axes on human fibroblast and endothelium transcriptome datasets. These RNA-seq data served as basis for a logistic 5′ss usage prediction model, which greatly improved discrimination between strong but unused exonic GT sites and annotated highly used 5′ss. Our 5′ss usage landscape offers a unified view on 5′ss and SRE neighborhood impact on splice site recognition, and may contribute to improved mutation assessment in human genetics.",

    "abstract": "In any given cell type, dozens of transcription factors (TFs) act in concert to control the activity of the genome by binding to specific DNA sequences in regulatory elements. Despite their considerable importance, we currently lack simple tools to directly measure the activity of many TFs in parallel. Massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) allow the detection of TF activities in a multiplexed fashion; however, we lack basic understanding to rationally design sensitive reporters for many TFs. Here, we use an MPRA to systematically optimize transcriptional reporters for 86 TFs and evaluate the specificity of all reporters across a wide array of TF perturbation conditions. We thus identified critical TF reporter design features and obtained highly sensitive and specific reporters for 62 TFs, many of which outperform available reporters. The resulting collection of “prime” TF reporters can be used to uncover TF regulatory networks and to illuminate signaling pathways.

    "title": "HDI-STARR-seq: Condition-specific enhancer discovery in mouse liver in vivo",
    "abstract": "STARR-seq and other massively-parallel reporter assays are widely used to discover functional enhancers in transfected cell models, which can be confounded by plasmid vector-induced type-I interferon immune responses and lack the multicellular environment and endogenous chromatin state of complex mammalian tissues. We describe HDI-STARR-seq, which combines STARR-seq plasmid library delivery to the liver, by hydrodynamic tail vein injection (HDI), with reporter RNA transcriptional initiation driven by a minimal Albumin promoter, which we show is essential for mouse liver STARR-seq enhancer activity assayed 7 days after HDI. Importantly, little or no vector-induced innate type-I interferon responses were observed. Comparisons of HDI-STARR-seq activity between male and female mouse livers and in livers from males treated with an activating ligand of the transcription factor (TF) CAR ( Nr1i3 ) identified many condition-dependent enhancers linked to condition-specific gene expression. Further, thousands of active liver enhancers were identified using a high complexity STARR-seq library comprised of ~ 50,000 genomic regions released by DNase-I digestion of mouse liver nuclei. When compared to stringently inactive library sequences, the active enhancer sequences identified were highly enriched for liver open chromatin regions with activating histone marks (H3K27ac, H3K4me1, H3K4me3), were significantly closer to gene transcriptional start sites, and were significantly depleted of repressive (H3K27me3, H3K9me3) and transcribed region histone marks (H3K36me3). HDI-STARR-seq offers substantial improvements over current methodologies for large scale, functional profiling of enhancers, including condition-dependent enhancers, in liver tissue in vivo, and can be adapted to characterize enhancer activities in a variety of species and tissues by selecting suitable tissue- and species-specific promoter sequences.

    "abstract": "Cell type–specific enhancers are critically important for lineage specification. The mechanisms that determine cell-type specificity of enhancer activity, however, are not fully understood. Most current models for how enhancers function invoke physical proximity between enhancer elements and their target genes. Here, we use an imaging-based approach to examine the spatial relationship of cell type–specific enhancers and their target genes with single-cell resolution. Using high-throughput microscopy, we measure the spatial distance from target promoters to their cell type–specific active and inactive enhancers in individual pancreatic cells derived from distinct lineages. We find increased proximity of all promoter-enhancer pairs relative to non-enhancer pairs separated by similar genomic distances. Strikingly, spatial proximity between enhancers and target genes was unrelated to tissue-specific enhancer activity. Furthermore, promoter-enhancer proximity did not correlate with the expression status of target genes. Our results suggest that promoter-enhancer pairs exist in a distinctive chromatin environment but that genome folding is not a universal driver of cell-type specificity in enhancer function.",

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of genome editing technologies has opened up new possibilities in the field of medicine. Nuclease-based techniques such as the CRISPR/Cas9 system are now used to target genetically linked disorders that were previously hard-to-treat. The CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing approach wields several advantages over its contemporary editing systems, notably in the ease of component design, implementation and the option of multiplex genome editing. While results from the early phase clinical trials have been encouraging, the small patient population recruited into these trials hinders a conclusive assessment on the safety aspects of the CRISPR/Cas9 therapy. Potential safety concerns include the lack of fidelity in the CRISPR/Cas9 system which may lead to unintended DNA modifications at non-targeted gene loci. This review focuses modifications to the CRISPR/Cas9 components that can mitigate off-target effects in in vitro and preclinical models and its translatability to gene therapy in patient populations.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR-Cas is a powerful genome editing technology and has a great potential for in vivo gene therapy. Successful translational application of CRISPR-Cas to biomedicine still faces many safety concerns, including off-target side effect, cell fitness problem after CRISPR-Cas treatment, and on-target genome editing side effect in undesired tissues. To solve these issues, it is needed to design sgRNA with high cell-specific efficacy and specificity. Existing single-guide RNA (sgRNA) design tools mainly depend on a sgRNA sequence and the local information of the targeted genome, thus are not sufficient to account for the difference in the cellular response of the same gene in different cell types. To incorporate cell-specific information into the sgRNA design, we develop novel interpretable machine learning models, which integrate features learned from advanced transformer-based deep neural network with cell-specific gene property derived from biological network and gene expression profile, for the prediction of CRISPR-Cas9 and CRISPR-Cas12a efficacy and specificity. In benchmark studies, our models significantly outperform state-of-the-art algorithms. Furthermore, we find that the network-based gene property is critical for the prediction of cell-specific post-treatment cellular response. Our results suggest that the design of efficient and safe CRISPR-Cas needs to consider cell-specific information of genes. Our findings may bolster developing more accurate predictive models of CRISPR-Cas across a broad spectrum of biological conditions as well as provide new insight into developing efficient and safe CRISPR-based gene therapy.",

    "abstract": "The composition of muscle fibers, characterized by distinct contractile and metabolic properties, significantly influences meat quality and glucose homeostasis. However, the mechanisms by which three-dimensional (3D) genome topology integrates with epigenetic states to regulate muscle fiber specification and transformation remain poorly understood. Here, we present an integrative analysis of the transcriptome, epigenome, and 3D genome architecture in the slow-twitch glycolytic extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and fast-twitch oxidative soleus (SOL) muscles of the pig ( Sus scrofa ). Global remodeling of enhancer-promoter (E-P) interactions emerged as a central driver of transcriptional reprogramming associated with muscle contraction and glucose metabolism. We identified tissue-specific super-enhancers (SEs) that regulate muscle fiber-type specification through cooperation of chromatin looping and transcription factors such as KLF5. Notably, the SE-driven activation of STARD7 facilitated the transformation of glycolytic fibers into oxidative fibers by mitigating reactive oxygen species levels and suppressing ERK MAPK signaling. This study elucidates the principles of 3D genome organization in the epigenetic regulation of muscle fiber specification and transformation, providing a foundation for novel therapeutic strategies targeting metabolic disorders and enhancing meat quality.",

    "abstract": "Cells in renewing tissues exhibit dramatic transcriptional changes as they differentiate. The contribution of chromatin looping to tissue renewal is incompletely understood. Enhancer-promoter interactions could be relatively stable as cells transition from progenitor to differentiated states; alternatively, chromatin looping could be as dynamic as the gene expression from their loci. The intestinal epithelium is the most rapidly renewing mammalian tissue. Proliferative cells in crypts of Lieberkühn sustain a stream of differentiated cells that are continually shed into the lumen. We apply chromosome conformation capture combined with chromatin immunoprecipitation (HiChIP) and sequencing to measure enhancer-promoter interactions in progenitor and differentiated cells of the intestinal epithelium. Despite dynamic gene regulation across the differentiation axis, we find that enhancer-promoter interactions are relatively stable. Functionally, we find HNF4 transcription factors are required for chromatin looping at target genes. Depletion of HNF4 disrupts local chromatin looping, histone modifications, and target gene expression. This study provides insights into transcriptional regulatory mechanisms governing homeostasis in renewing tissues.",

Here, we mapped the 3D genome of ventral hippocampal neurons across the oestrous cycle and by sex in mice. In females, we find cycle-driven dynamism in 3D chromatin organization, including in oestrogen response elements-enriched X chromosome compartments, autosomal CTCF loops, and enhancer-promoter interactions. With rising oestrogen levels, the female 3D genome becomes more similar to the male 3D genome. Cyclical enhancer-promoter interactions are partially associated with gene expression and enriched for brain disorder-relevant genes and pathways. Our study reveals unique 3D genome dynamics in the female brain relevant to female-specific gene regulation, neuroplasticity, and disease risk.",

    "abstract": "Chromatin looping is important for gene regulation, and studies of 3D chromatin structure across species and cell types have improved our understanding of the principles governing chromatin looping. However, 3D genome evolution and its relationship with natural selection remains largely unexplored. In mammals, the CTCF protein defines the boundaries of most chromatin loops, and variations in CTCF occupancy are associated with looping divergence. While many CTCF binding sites fall within transposable elements (TEs), their contribution to 3D chromatin structural evolution is unknown. Here we report the relative contributions of TE-driven CTCF binding site expansions to conserved and divergent chromatin looping in human and mouse. We demonstrate that TE-derived CTCF binding divergence may explain a large fraction of variable loops. These variable loops contribute significantly to corresponding gene expression variability across cells and species, possibly by refining sub-TAD-scale loop contacts responsible for cell-type-specific enhancer-promoter interactions.",

    "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) genome folding has a fundamental role in the regulation of developmental genes by facilitating or constraining chromatin interactions between cis -regulatory elements (CREs). Polycomb response elements (PREs) are a specific kind of CRE involved in the memory of transcriptional states in Drosophila melanogaster . PREs act as nucleation sites for Polycomb group (PcG) proteins, which deposit the repressive histone mark H3K27me3, leading to the formation of a class of topologically associating domain (TAD) called a Polycomb domain. PREs can establish looping contacts that stabilize the gene repression of key developmental genes during development. However, the mechanism by which PRE loops fine-tune gene expression is unknown. Using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and Cas9 genome engineering, we specifically perturbed PRE contacts or enhancer function and used complementary approaches including 4C-seq, Hi-C and Hi-M to analyze how chromatin architecture perturbation affects gene expression. Our results suggest that the PRE loop at the dac gene locus acts as a constitutive 3D chromatin scaffold during Drosophila development that forms independently of gene expression states and has a versatile function; it restricts enhancer–promoter communication and contributes to enhancer specificity.",

    "abstract": "Nuclear compartments are prominent features of 3D chromatin organization, but sequencing depth limitations have impeded investigation at ultra fine-scale. CTCF loops are generally studied at a finer scale, but the impact of looping on proximal interactions remains enigmatic. Here, we critically examine nuclear compartments and CTCF loop-proximal interactions using a combination of in situ Hi-C at unparalleled depth, algorithm development, and biophysical modeling. Producing a large Hi-C map with 33 billion contacts in conjunction with an algorithm for performing principal component analysis on sparse, super massive matrices (POSSUMM), we resolve compartments to 500 bp. Our results demonstrate that essentially all active promoters and distal enhancers localize in the A compartment, even when flanking sequences do not. Furthermore, we find that the TSS and TTS of paused genes are often segregated into separate compartments. We then identify diffuse interactions that radiate from CTCF loop anchors, which correlate with strong enhancer-promoter interactions and proximal transcription. We also find that these diffuse interactions depend on CTCF’s RNA binding domains. In this work, we demonstrate features of fine-scale chromatin organization consistent with a revised model in which compartments are more precise than commonly thought while CTCF loops are more protracted.",

    "abstract": "Evidence indicates that enhancers are transcriptionally active. Herein, we investigated transcriptionally active enhancers by using cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) combined with epigenetic marks and chromatin interactions. We identified CAGE-tag highly active (CHA) enhancers as distant regulatory elements with CAGE-tag ≥ 90th percentile and overlapping with H3K27ac peaks (4.5% of enhancers). CHA enhancers were conserved between mouse and man and were independent from super-enhancers in predicting cell identity with lower P-values. CHA enhancers had increased open chromatin and a higher recruitment of cell-specific transcription factors as well as molecules involved in 3D genome interactions. HiChIP analysis of enhancer-promoter looping indicated that CHA enhancers had a higher density of anchor loops when compared to regular enhancers. A subset of CHA enhancers and promoters characterized by a high density of chromatin loops and forming hub regulatory units were connected to the promoter of immediate early response genes, genes involved in cancer and encoding for transcription factors. Promoter of genes within hub CHA regulatory units were less likely to be paused. CHA enhancers were enriched in gene variants associated with autoimmune disorders and had looping with causal candidate genes as revealed by Mendelian randomization. Hence, CHA enhancers form a dense hierarchical network of chromatin interactions between regulatory elements and genes involved in cell identity and disorders.",

While enhancers regulate spatiotemporal gene expression, chromatin looping is a means for enhancer-promoter interactions yielding cell-type-specific gene expression. Further, non-canonical DNA secondary structures, such as G-quadruplexes (G4s), are related to increased gene expression. However, the role of G4s in promoter-distal regulatory elements, such as super-enhancers (SE), and in chromatin looping has remained elusive. Here we show that mature microRNA 9 ( miR-9 ) is enriched at promoters and SE of genes that are inducible by transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFB1) signaling. Moreover, we find that miR-9 is required for formation of G4s, promoter-super-enhancer looping and broad domains of the euchromatin histone mark H3K4me3 at TGFB1-responsive genes. Our study places miR-9 in the same functional context with G4s and promoter-enhancer interactions during 3D genome organization and transcriptional activation induced by TGFB1 signaling, a critical signaling pathway in cancer and fibrosis.",

Combinations of (single-cell) transcriptomics and chromatin accessibility allow the prediction of fine-grained regulatory programs that go beyond mere correlation of transcription factor and target gene expression, with enhancer GRNs (eGRNs) modeling molecular interactions between transcription factors, regulatory elements, and target genes. In this review, we highlight the key components for successful (e)GRN inference from (sc)RNA-seq and (sc)ATAC-seq data exemplified by state-of-the-art methods as well as open challenges and future developments. Moreover, we address preprocessing strategies, metacell generation and computational omics pairing, transcription factor binding site detection, and linear and three-dimensional approaches to identify chromatin interactions as well as dynamic and causal eGRN inference. We believe that the integration of transcriptomics together with epigenomics data at a single-cell level is the new standard for mechanistic network inference, and that it can be further advanced with integrating additional omics layers and spatiotemporal data, as well as with shifting the focus towards more quantitative and causal modeling strategies.",

    "abstract": "A major driving force behind the evolution of species-specific traits and novel structures is alterations in gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Comprehending evolution therefore requires an understanding of the nature of changes in GRN structure and the responsible mechanisms. Here, we review two insect pigmentation GRNs in order to examine common themes in GRN evolution and to reveal some of the challenges associated with investigating changes in GRNs across different evolutionary distances at the molecular level. The pigmentation GRN in Drosophila melanogaster and other drosophilids is a well-defined network for which studies from closely related species illuminate the different ways co-option of regulators can occur. The pigmentation GRN for butterflies of the Heliconius species group is less fully detailed but it is emerging as a useful model for exploring important questions about redundancy and modularity in cis -regulatory systems. Both GRNs serve to highlight the ways in which redeployment of trans -acting factors can lead to GRN rewiring and network co-option. To gain insight into GRN evolution, we discuss the importance of defining GRN architecture at multiple levels both within and between species and of utilizing a range of complementary approaches.",

    "abstract": "Lipid mediators are important regulators in inflammatory responses, and their biosynthetic pathways are targeted by commonly used anti-inflammatory drugs. Switching from pro-inflammatory lipid mediators (PIMs) to specialized pro-resolving (SPMs) is a critical step toward acute inflammation resolution and preventing chronic inflammation. Although the biosynthetic pathways and enzymes for PIMs and SPMs have now been largely identified, the actual transcriptional profiles underlying the immune cell type-specific transcriptional profiles of these mediators are still unknown. Using the Atlas of Inflammation Resolution, we created a large network of gene regulatory interactions linked to the biosynthesis of SPMs and PIMs. By mapping single-cell sequencing data, we identified cell type-specific gene regulatory networks of the lipid mediator biosynthesis. Using machine learning approaches combined with network features, we identified cell clusters of similar transcriptional regulation and demonstrated how specific immune cell activation affects PIM and SPM profiles. We found substantial differences in regulatory networks in related cells, accounting for network-based preprocessing in functional single-cell analyses. Our results not only provide further insight into the gene regulation of lipid mediators in the immune response but also shed light on the contribution of selected cell types in their biosynthesis.",

    "abstract": "Wound response programs are often activated during neoplastic growth in tumors. In both wound repair and tumor growth, cells respond to acute stress and balance the activation of multiple programs, including apoptosis, proliferation, and cell migration. Central to those responses are the activation of the JNK/MAPK and JAK/STAT signaling pathways. Yet, to what extent these signaling cascades interact at the cis -regulatory level and how they orchestrate different regulatory and phenotypic responses is still unclear. Here, we aim to characterize the regulatory states that emerge and cooperate in the wound response, using the Drosophila melanogaster wing disc as a model system, and compare these with cancer cell states induced by ras V12 scrib -/- in the eye disc. We used single-cell multiome profiling to derive enhancer gene regulatory networks (eGRNs) by integrating chromatin accessibility and gene expression signals. We identify a ‘proliferative’ eGRN, active in the majority of wounded cells and controlled by AP-1 and STAT. In a smaller, but distinct population of wound cells, a ‘senescent’ eGRN is activated and driven by C/EBP-like transcription factors (Irbp18, Xrp1, Slow border, and Vrille) and Scalloped. These two eGRN signatures are found to be active in tumor cells at both gene expression and chromatin accessibility levels. Our single-cell multiome and eGRNs resource offers an in-depth characterization of the senescence markers, together with a new perspective on the shared gene regulatory programs acting during wound response and oncogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Large amounts of effort have been invested in trying to understand how a single genome is able to specify the identity of hundreds of cell types. Inspired by some aspects of Caenorhabditis elegans biology, we implemented an in silico evolutionary strategy to produce gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that drive cell-specific gene expression patterns, mimicking the process of terminal cell differentiation. Dynamics of the gene regulatory networks are governed by a thermodynamic model of gene expression, which uses DNA sequences and transcription factor degenerate position weight matrixes as input. In a version of the model, we included chromatin accessibility. Experimentally, it has been determined that cell-specific and broadly expressed genes are regulated differently. In our in silico evolved GRNs, broadly expressed genes are regulated very redundantly and the architecture of their cis-regulatory modules is different, in accordance to what has been found in C . elegans and also in other systems. Finally, we found differences in topological positions in GRNs between these two classes of genes, which help to explain why broadly expressed genes are so resilient to mutations. Overall, our results offer an explanatory hypothesis on why broadly expressed genes are regulated so redundantly compared to cell-specific genes, which can be extrapolated to phenomena such as ChIP-seq HOT regions.",

    "abstract": "Identifying master regulators of biological processes and mapping their downstream gene networks are key challenges in systems biology. We developed a computational method, called iRegulon, to reverse-engineer the transcriptional regulatory network underlying a co-expressed gene set using cis -regulatory sequence analysis. iRegulon implements a genome-wide ranking-and-recovery approach to detect enriched transcription factor motifs and their optimal sets of direct targets. We increase the accuracy of network inference by using very large motif collections of up to ten thousand position weight matrices collected from various species, and linking these to candidate human TFs via a motif2TF procedure. We validate iRegulon on gene sets derived from ENCODE ChIP-seq data with increasing levels of noise, and we compare iRegulon with existing motif discovery methods. Next, we use iRegulon on more challenging types of gene lists, including microRNA target sets, protein-protein interaction networks, and genetic perturbation data. In particular, we over-activate p53 in breast cancer cells, followed by RNA-seq and ChIP-seq, and could identify an extensive up-regulated network controlled directly by p53. Similarly we map a repressive network with no indication of direct p53 regulation but rather an indirect effect via E2F and NFY. Finally, we generalize our computational framework to include regulatory tracks such as ChIP-seq data and show how motif and track discovery can be combined to map functional regulatory interactions among co-expressed genes. iRegulon is available as a Cytoscape plugin from http://iregulon.aertslab.org .",

Here we investigated the gene regulatory programs in the primary motor cortex of human, macaque, marmoset and mouse using single-cell multiomics assays, generating gene expression, chromatin accessibility, DNA methylome and chromosomal conformation profiles from a total of over 200,000 cells. From these data, we show evidence that divergence of transcription factor expression corresponds to species-specific epigenome landscapes. We find that conserved and divergent gene regulatory features are reflected in the evolution of the three-dimensional genome. Transposable elements contribute to nearly 80% of the human-specific candidate cis- regulatory elements in cortical cells. Through machine learning, we develop sequence-based predictors of candidate cis- regulatory elements in different species and demonstrate that the genomic regulatory syntax is highly preserved from rodents to primates. Finally, we show that epigenetic conservation combined with sequence similarity helps to uncover functional cis- regulatory elements and enhances our ability to interpret genetic variants contributing to neurological disease and traits.",

    "abstract": "Comparative genomics has revealed a class of non-protein-coding genomic sequences that display an extraordinary degree of conservation between two or more organisms, regularly exceeding that found within protein-coding exons. These elements, collectively referred to as conserved non-coding elements (CNEs), are non-randomly distributed across chromosomes and tend to cluster in the vicinity of genes with regulatory roles in multicellular development and differentiation. CNEs are organized into functional ensembles called genomic regulatory blocks–dense clusters of elements that collectively coordinate the expression of shared target genes, and whose span in many cases coincides with topologically associated domains. CNEs display sequence properties that set them apart from other sequences under constraint, and have recently been proposed as useful markers for the reconstruction of the evolutionary history of organisms. Disruption of several of these elements is known to contribute to diseases linked with development, and cancer. The emergence, evolutionary dynamics and functions of CNEs still remain poorly understood, and new approaches are required to enable comprehensive CNE identification and characterization. Here, we review current knowledge and identify challenges that need to be tackled to resolve the impasse in understanding extreme non-coding conservation.",

By combining the genome-wide transcription factor occupancy repertoires, associated epigenetic signals, and co-association patterns, here we deduce several evolutionary principles of gene regulatory features operating since the mouse and human lineages diverged. The genomic distribution profiles, primary binding motifs, chromatin states, and DNA methylation preferences are well conserved for TF-occupied sequences. However, the extent to which orthologous DNA segments are bound by orthologous TFs varies both among TFs and with genomic location: binding at promoters is more highly conserved than binding at distal elements. Notably, occupancy-conserved TF-occupied sequences tend to be pleiotropic; they function in several tissues and also co-associate with many TFs. Single nucleotide variants at sites with potential regulatory functions are enriched in occupancy-conserved TF-occupied sequences.

The atlas includes approximately 1 million cCREs and their chromatin accessibility across 1,482 distinct brain cell populations, adding over 446,000 cCREs to the most recent such annotation in the mouse genome. The mouse brain cCREs are moderately conserved in the human brain. The mouse-specific cCREs—specifically, those identified from a subset of cortical excitatory neurons—are strongly enriched for transposable elements, suggesting a potential role for transposable elements in the emergence of new regulatory programs and neuronal diversity. Finally, we infer the gene regulatory networks in over 260 subclasses of mouse brain cells and develop deep-learning models to predict the activities of gene regulatory elements in different brain cell types from the DNA sequence alone. Our results provide a resource for the analysis of cell-type-specific gene regulation programs in both mouse and human brains.",

We simultaneously profiled gene expression and chromatin accessibility in 45,549 cortical nuclei across six broad developmental time points from fetus to adult. We identified cell type–specific domains in which chromatin accessibility is highly correlated with gene expression. Differentiation pseudotime trajectory analysis indicates that chromatin accessibility at CREs precedes transcription and that dynamic changes in chromatin structure play a critical role in neuronal lineage commitment. In addition, we mapped cell type–specific and temporally specific genetic loci implicated in neuropsychiatric traits, including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Together, our results describe the complex regulation of cell composition at critical stages in lineage determination and shed light on the impact of spatiotemporal alterations in gene expression on neuropsychiatric disease.",

    "abstract": "Analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data has revolutionized our understanding of cellular heterogeneity, yet current approaches face challenges in efficiency, interpretability, and connecting molecular insights to therapeutic applications. Despite advances in deep learning methods, identifying cell-type-specific functional gene sets remains difficult. In this study, we present scKAN, an interpretable framework for scRNA-seq analysis with two primary goals: accurate cell-type annotation and the discovery of cell-type-specific marker genes and gene sets. The key innovation is using the learnable activation curves of the Kolmogorov-Arnold network to model gene-to-cell relationships. This approach provides a more direct way to visualize and interpret these specific interactions compared to the aggregated weighting schemes typical of attention mechanisms. This architecture achieves superior performance in cell-type annotation, with a 6.63% improvement in macro F1 score over state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, it enables the systematic identification of functionally coherent cell-type-specific gene sets. We demonstrate the framework’s translational potential through a case study on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, where gene signatures identified by scKAN led to a potential drug repurposing candidate, whose binding stability was supported by molecular dynamics simulations. Our work establishes scKAN as an efficient and interpretable framework that effectively bridges single-cell analysis with drug discovery. By combining lightweight architecture with the ability to uncover nuanced biological patterns, our approach offers an interpretable method for translating large-scale single-cell data into actionable therapeutic strategies. This approach provides a robust foundation for accelerating the identification of cell-type-specific targets in complex diseases.

    "abstract": "DNA accessibility of cis -regulatory elements (CREs) dictates transcriptional activity and drives cell differentiation during development. While many genes regulating embryonic development have been identified, the underlying CRE dynamics controlling their expression remain largely uncharacterized. To address this, we produced a multimodal resource and genomic regulatory map for the zebrafish community, which integrates single-cell combinatorial indexing assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (sci-ATAC-seq) with bulk histone PTMs and Hi-C data to achieve a genome-wide classification of the regulatory architecture determining transcriptional activity in the 24-h post-fertilization (hpf) embryo. We characterized the genome-wide chromatin architecture at bulk and single-cell resolution, applying sci-ATAC-seq on whole 24-hpf stage zebrafish embryos, generating accessibility profiles for ∼23,000 single nuclei. We developed a genome segmentation method, ScregSeg (single-cell regulatory landscape segmentation), for defining regulatory programs, and candidate CREs, specific to one or more cell types. We integrated the ScregSeg output with bulk measurements for histone post-translational modifications and 3D genome organization and identified new regulatory principles between chromatin modalities prevalent during zebrafish development. Sci-ATAC-seq profiling of npas4l / cloche mutant embryos identified novel cellular roles for this hematovascular transcriptional master regulator and suggests an intricate mechanism regulating its expression. Our work defines regulatory architecture and principles in the zebrafish embryo and establishes a resource of cell-type-specific genome-wide regulatory annotations and candidate CREs, providing a valuable open resource for genomics, developmental, molecular, and computational biology.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR-based gene activation (CRISPRa) is a strategy for upregulating gene expression by targeting promoters or enhancers in a tissue/cell-type specific manner. Here, we describe an experimental framework that combines highly multiplexed perturbations with single-cell RNA sequencing (sc-RNA-seq) to identify cell-type-specific, CRISPRa-responsive cis- regulatory elements and the gene(s) they regulate. Random combinations of many gRNAs are introduced to each of many cells, which are then profiled and partitioned into test and control groups to test for effect(s) of CRISPRa perturbations of both enhancers and promoters on the expression of neighboring genes. Applying this method to a library of 493 gRNAs targeting candidate cis- regulatory elements in both K562 cells and iPSC-derived excitatory neurons, we identify gRNAs capable of specifically upregulating intended target genes and no other neighboring genes within 1 Mb, including gRNAs yielding upregulation of six autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) risk genes in neurons. A consistent pattern is that the responsiveness of individual enhancers to CRISPRa is restricted by cell type, implying a dependency on either chromatin landscape and/or additional trans- acting factors for successful gene activation. The approach outlined here may facilitate large-scale screens for gRNAs that activate genes in a cell type-specific manner.",

    "abstract": "The precise spatio-temporal expression of the hematopoietic ETS transcription factor PU.1 that determines the hematopoietic cell fates is tightly regulated at the chromatin level. However, it remains elusive as to how chromatin signatures are linked to this dynamic expression pattern of PU.1 across blood cell lineages. Here we performed an unbiased and in-depth analysis of the relationship between human PU.1 expression, the presence of trans-acting factors, and 3D architecture at various cis-regulatory elements (CRE) proximal to the PU.1 locus. We identified multiple novel CREs at the upstream region of the gene following an integrative inspection for conserved DNA elements at the chromatin-accessible regions in primary human blood lineages. We showed that a subset of CREs localize within a 10 kb-wide cluster that exhibits that exhibit molecular features of a myeloid-specific super-enhancer involved in mediating PU.1 autoregulation, including open chromatin, unmethylated DNA, histone enhancer marks, transcription of enhancer RNAs, and occupancy of the PU.1 protein itself. Importantly, we revealed the presence of common 35-kb-wide CTCF-bound insulated neighborhood that contains the CRE cluster, forming the chromatin territory for lineage-specific and CRE-mediated chromatin interactions. These include functional CRE-promoter interactions in myeloid and B cells but not in erythroid and T cells. Our findings also provide mechanistic insights into the interplay between dynamic chromatin structure and 3D architecture in defining certain CREs as enhancers or silencers in chromatin regulation of PU.1 expression. The study lays the groundwork for further examination of PU.1 CREs as well as epigenetic regulation in malignant hematopoiesis.",

By human curation, we approved a subset of experiments that yielded consistent motifs across platforms and replicates, and evaluated quantitatively the cross-platform performance of PWMs obtained with ten motif discovery tools. Notably, nucleotide composition and information content are not correlated with motif performance and do not help in detecting underperformers, while motifs with low information content, in many cases, describe well the binding specificity assessed across different experimental platforms.

Recent development of chromatin conformation capture technologies has enabled genome-wide profiling of various 3D structures, even with single cells. However, current catalogs of 3D structures remain incomplete and unreliable due to differences in technology, tools, and low data resolution. Machine learning methods have emerged as an alternative to obtain missing 3D interactions and/or improve resolution. Such methods frequently use genome annotation data (ChIP-seq, DNAse-seq, etc.), DNA sequencing information (k-mers, Transcription Factor Binding Site (TFBS) motifs), and other genomic properties to learn the associations between genomic features and chromatin interactions. In this review, we discuss computational tools for predicting three types of 3D interactions (EPIs, chromatin interactions, TAD boundaries) and analyze their pros and cons. We also point out obstacles of computational prediction of 3D interactions and suggest future research directions.",

This locus resides in a non-coding region within FAIM2 ; thus, the underlying causal variant(s) presumably influence disease susceptibility via an influence on cis -regulation within the genomic region. We implicated rs7132908 as a putative causal variant at this locus leveraging a combination of our inhouse 3D genomic data, public domain datasets, and several computational approaches. Using a luciferase reporter assay in human primary astrocytes, we observed allele-specific cis -regulatory activity of the immediate region harboring rs7132908. Motivated by this finding, we went on to generate isogenic human embryonic stem cell lines homozygous for either rs7132908 allele with CRISPR-Cas9 homology-directed repair to assess changes in gene expression due to genotype and chromatin accessibility throughout a differentiation to hypothalamic neurons, a key cell type known to regulate feeding behavior. We observed that the rs7132908 obesity risk allele influenced the expression of FAIM2 along with other genes, decreased the proportion of neurons produced during differentiation, up-regulated cell death gene sets, and conversely down-regulated neuron differentiation gene sets. We have therefore functionally validated rs7132908 as a causal obesity variant which temporally regulates nearby effector genes at the ch12q13 locus and influences neurodevelopment and survival.",

    "abstract": "The interplay between nucleosomes and transcription factors leads to programs of gene expression. Transcriptional silencing involves the generation of a chromatin state that represses transcription and is faithfully propagated through DNA replication and cell division. Using multiple reporter assays, including directly visualizing transcription in single cells, we investigated a diverse set of UAS enhancers and core promoters for their susceptibility to heterochromatic gene silencing. These results show that heterochromatin only stably silences weak and stress induced regulatory elements but is unable to stably repress housekeeping gene regulatory elements and the partial repression did not result in bistable expression states. Permutation analysis of different UAS enhancers and core promoters indicate that both elements function together to determine the susceptibility of regulatory sequences to repression. Specific histone modifiers and chromatin remodellers function in an enhancer specific manner to aid these elements to resist repression suggesting that Sir proteins likely function in part by reducing nucleosome mobility. We also show that the strong housekeeping regulatory elements can be repressed if silencer bound Sir1 is increased, suggesting that Sir1 is a limiting component in silencing. Together, our data suggest that the heterochromatic locus has been optimized to stably silence the weak mating type gene regulatory elements but not strong housekeeping gene regulatory sequences which could help explain why these genes are often found at the boundaries of silenced domains.",

    "abstract": "V0v spinal interneurons are highly conserved, glutamatergic, commissural neurons that function in locomotor circuits. We have previously shown that Evx1 and Evx2 are required to specify the neurotransmitter phenotype of these cells. However, we still know very little about the gene regulatory networks that act downstream of these transcription factors in V0v cells. To identify candidate members of V0v gene regulatory networks, we FAC-sorted wild-type and evx1;evx2 double mutant zebrafish V0v spinal interneurons and expression-profiled them using microarrays and single cell RNA-seq. We also used in situ hybridization to compare expression of a subset of candidate genes in evx1;evx2 double mutants and wild-type siblings. Our data reveal two molecularly distinct subtypes of zebrafish V0v spinal interneurons at 48 h and suggest that, by this stage of development, evx1;evx2 double mutant cells transfate into either inhibitory spinal interneurons, or motoneurons. Our results also identify 25 transcriptional regulator genes that require Evx1/2 for their expression in V0v interneurons, plus a further 11 transcriptional regulator genes that are repressed in V0v interneurons by Evx1/2. Two of the latter genes are hmx2 and hmx3a . Intriguingly, we show that Hmx2/3a, repress dI2 interneuron expression of skor1a and nefma , two genes that require Evx1/2 for their expression in V0v interneurons. This suggests that Evx1/2 might regulate skor1a and nefma expression in V0v interneurons by repressing Hmx2/3a expression. This study identifies two molecularly distinct subsets of zebrafish V0v spinal interneurons, as well as multiple transcriptional regulators that are strong candidates for acting downstream of Evx1/2 to specify the essential functional characteristics of these cells. Our data further suggest that in the absence of both Evx1 and Evx2, V0v spinal interneurons initially change their neurotransmitter phenotypes from excitatory to inhibitory and then, later, start to express markers of distinct types of inhibitory spinal interneurons, or motoneurons. Taken together, our findings significantly increase our knowledge of V0v and spinal development and move us closer towards the essential goal of identifying the complete gene regulatory networks that specify this crucial cell type.

    "abstract": "Gene regulatory divergence between species can result from cis -acting local changes to regulatory element DNA sequences or global trans -acting changes to the regulatory environment. Understanding how these mechanisms drive regulatory evolution has been limited by challenges in identifying trans -acting changes. We present a comprehensive approach to directly identify cis - and trans -divergent regulatory elements between human and rhesus macaque lymphoblastoid cells using assay for transposase-accessible chromatin coupled to self-transcribing active regulatory region (ATAC-STARR) sequencing. In addition to thousands of cis changes, we discover an unexpected number (∼10,000) of trans changes and show that cis and trans elements exhibit distinct patterns of sequence divergence and function. We further identify differentially expressed transcription factors that underlie ∼37% of trans differences and trace how cis changes can produce cascades of trans changes. Overall, we find that most divergent elements (67%) experienced changes in both cis and trans , revealing a substantial role for trans divergence—alone and together with cis changes—in regulatory differences between species.",

    "abstract": "The master tumor suppressor p53 regulates multiple cell fate decisions, like cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, via transcriptional control of a broad gene network. Dysfunction in the p53 network is common in cancer, often through mutations that inactivate p53 or other members of the pathway. Induction of tumor-specific cell death by restoration of p53 activity without off-target effects has gained significant interest in the field. In this study, we explore the gene regulatory mechanisms underlying a putative anti-cancer strategy involving stimulation of the p53-independent Integrated Stress Response (ISR). Our data demonstrate the p53 and ISR pathways converge to independently regulate common metabolic and pro-apoptotic genes. We investigated the architecture of multiple gene regulatory elements bound by p53 and the ISR effector ATF4 controlling this shared regulation. We identified additional key transcription factors that control basal and stress-induced regulation of these shared p53 and ATF4 target genes. Thus, our results provide significant new molecular and genetic insight into gene regulatory networks and transcription factors that are the target of numerous antitumor therapies.",

    "abstract": "Insulators are cis -regulatory elements that separate transcriptional units, whereas silencers are elements that repress transcription regardless of their position. In plants, these elements remain largely uncharacterized. Here, we use the massively parallel reporter assay Plant STARR-seq with short fragments of eight large insulators to identify more than 100 fragments that block enhancer activity. The short fragments can be combined to generate more powerful insulators that abolish the capacity of the strong viral 35S enhancer to activate the 35S minimal promoter. Unexpectedly, when tested upstream of weak enhancers, these fragments act as silencers and repress transcription. Thus, these elements are capable of both insulating or repressing transcription dependent upon regulatory context. We validate our findings in stable transgenic Arabidopsis , maize, and rice plants. The short elements identified here should be useful building blocks for plant biotechnology efforts.",

Methods were assessed using in vivo data from hundreds of adeno-associated virus (AAV)-packaged, retro-orbitally delivered enhancers. Open chromatin was the strongest predictor of functional enhancers, while sequence models improved prediction of non-functional enhancers and identified cell-type-specific transcription factor codes to inform in silico enhancer design.

    "abstract": "Enhancers play a crucial role in regulating gene expression and their functional status can be queried with cell type precision using using single-cell (sc)ATAC-seq. To facilitate analysis of such data, we developed Enhlink, a novel computational approach that leverages single-cell signals to infer linkages between regulatory DNA sequences, such as enhancers and promoters. Enhlink uses an ensemble strategy that integrates cell-level technical covariates to control for batch effects and biological covariates to infer robust condition-specific links and their associated p -values. It can integrate simultaneous gene expression and chromatin accessibility measurements of individual cells profiled by multi-omic experiments for increased specificity. We evaluated Enhlink using simulated and real scATAC-seq data, including those paired with physical enhancer-promoter links enumerated by promoter capture Hi-C and with multi-omic scATAC-/RNA-seq data we generated from the mouse striatum. These examples demonstrated that our method outperforms popular alternative strategies. In conjunction with eQTL analysis, Enhlink revealed a putative super-enhancer regulating key cell type-specific markers of striatal neurons. Taken together, our analyses demonstrate that Enhlink is accurate, powerful, and provides features that can lead to novel biological insights.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale sequencing efforts of thousands of tumor samples have been undertaken to understand the mutational landscape of the coding genome. However, the vast majority of germline and somatic variants occur within non-coding portions of the genome. These genomic regions do not directly encode for specific proteins, but can play key roles in cancer progression, for example by driving aberrant gene expression control. Here, we designed an integrative computational and experimental framework to identify recurrently mutated non-coding regulatory regions that drive tumor progression. Application of this approach to whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data from a large cohort of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) revealed a large set of recurrently mutated regions. We used (i) in silico prioritization of functional non-coding mutations, (ii) massively parallel reporter assays, and (iii) in vivo CRISPR-interference (CRISPRi) screens in xenografted mice to systematically identify and validate driver regulatory regions that drive mCRPC. We discovered that one of these enhancer regions, GH22I030351, acts on a bidirectional promoter to simultaneously modulate expression of U2-associated splicing factor SF3A1 and chromosomal protein CCDC157. We found that both SF3A1 and CCDC157 are promoters of tumor growth in xenograft models of prostate cancer. We nominated a number of transcription factors, including SOX6, to be responsible for higher expression of SF3A1 and CCDC157. Collectively, we have established and confirmed an integrative computational and experimental approach that enables the systematic detection of non-coding regulatory regions that drive the progression of human cancers.",

    "title": "An intrinsically interpretable neural network architecture for sequence to function learning",
    "abstract": "Sequence-based deep learning approaches have been shown to predict a multitude of functional genomic readouts, including regions of open chromatin and RNA expression of genes. However, a major limitation of current methods is that model interpretation relies on computationally demanding post hoc analyses, and even then, one can often not explain the internal mechanics of highly parameterized models. Here, we introduce a deep learning architecture called tiSFM (totally interpretable sequence to function model). tiSFM improves upon the performance of standard multi-layer convolutional models while using fewer parameters. Additionally, while tiSFM is itself technically a multi-layer neural network, internal model parameters are intrinsically interpretable in terms of relevant sequence motifs. We analyze published open chromatin measurements across hematopoietic lineage cell-types and demonstrate that tiSFM outperforms a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network model custom-tailored to this dataset. We also show that it correctly identifies context specific activities of transcription factors with known roles in hematopoietic differentiation, including Pax5 and Ebf1 for B-cells, and Rorc for innate lymphoid cells. tiSFM’s model parameters have biologically meaningful interpretations, and we show the utility of our approach on a complex task of predicting the change in epigenetic state as a function of developmental transition.

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous noncoding variants associated with complex human diseases, disorders, and traits. However, resolving the uncertainty between GWAS association and causality remains a significant challenge. The small subset of noncoding GWAS variants with causative effects on gene regulatory elements can only be detected through accurate methods that assess the impact of DNA sequence variation on gene regulatory activity. Deep learning models, such as those based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transformers, have gained prominence in predicting the regulatory effects of genetic variants, particularly in enhancers, by learning patterns from genomic and epigenomic data. Despite their potential, selecting the most suitable model is hindered by the lack of standardized benchmarks, consistent training conditions, and performance evaluation criteria in existing reviews. This study evaluates state-of-the-art deep learning models for predicting the effects of genetic variants on enhancer activity using nine datasets stemming from MPRA, raQTL, and eQTL experiments, profiling the regulatory impact of 54,859 SNPs across four human cell lines. The results reveal that CNN models, such as TREDNet and SEI, consistently outperform other architectures in predicting the regulatory impact of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). However, hybrid CNN-transformer models, such as Borzoi, display superior performance in identifying causal SNPs within a linkage disequilibrium block. While fine-tuning enhances the performance of transformer-based models, it remains insufficient to surpass CNN and hybrid models when evaluated under optimized conditions.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of genomic language models (gLMs) offers an unsupervised approach to learning a wide diversity of cis-regulatory patterns in the non-coding genome without requiring labels of functional activity generated by wet-lab experiments. Previous evaluations have shown that pre-trained gLMs can be leveraged to improve predictive performance across a broad range of regulatory genomics tasks, albeit using relatively simple benchmark datasets and baseline models. Since the gLMs in these studies were tested upon fine-tuning their weights for each downstream task, determining whether gLM representations embody a foundational understanding of cis-regulatory biology remains an open question. Here, we evaluate the representational power of pre-trained gLMs to predict and interpret cell-type-specific functional genomics data that span DNA and RNA regulation for six major functional genomics prediction tasks. Our findings suggest that probing the representations of current pre-trained gLMs do not offer substantial advantages over conventional machine learning approaches that use one-hot encoded sequences. Nevertheless, highly tuned supervised models trained from scratch using one-hot encoded sequences can achieve performance competitive with or better than pre-trained models across the datasets explored in this study. This work highlights a major gap with current gLMs, raising potential issues in conventional pre-training strategies for the non-coding genome.

We used a Gaussian mixture model to evaluate the contribution of background noise in the measured activity signal to confirm the activity of ~ 35% of the tested enhancers, with most showing temporal-specific activity, suggesting their evolving role in neurodevelopment. The temporal specificity was further supported by the correlation of activity with gene expression. Our findings provide a valuable gene regulatory resource to the scientific community.",

We found a strong and specific correlation between MPRA and mouse neuronal enhancer activity including changes in neuronal enhancer activity in mouse embryos for variants with strong MPRA effects.

    "title": "U-rich elements drive pervasive cryptic splicing in 3’ UTR massively parallel reporter assays",
    "abstract": "Untranslated RNA sequences play essential roles in orchestrating gene expression. However, the sequence codes and mechanisms underpinning post-transcriptional regulation remain incompletely understood. Here, we revisit the finding from a prior massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) that AU-rich elements in 3’ untranslated regions (3’ UTRs) can drive upregulation or downregulation of mRNA expression depending on 3’ UTR context. We unexpectedly discover that this variable regulation arises from widespread cryptic splicing, predominately from an unannotated splice donor in the coding sequence of GFP to diverse acceptor sites in reporter 3’ UTRs. Splicing is activated by U-rich sequences, which function as potent position-dependent regulators of 5’ and 3’ splice site choice and overall splicing efficiency. Splicing has diverse impacts on reporter expression, causing both increases and decreases in reporter expression via multiple mechanisms. We further provide evidence that cryptic splicing significantly impacts measurements made by other published 3’ UTR MPRAs. Overall, our work emphasizes U-rich sequences as principal drivers of splicing and provides strategies to minimize cryptic splicing artifacts in reporter assays.",

    "title": "Transcriptional repression and enhancer decommissioning silence cell cycle genes in postmitotic tissues",
    "abstract": "The mechanisms that maintain a non-cycling status in postmitotic tissues are not well understood. Many cell cycle genes have promoters and enhancers that remain accessible even when cells are terminally differentiated and in a non-cycling state, suggesting their repression must be maintained long term. In contrast, enhancer decommissioning has been observed for rate-limiting cell cycle genes in the Drosophila wing, a tissue where the cells die soon after eclosion, but it has been unclear if this also occurs in other contexts of terminal differentiation. In this study, we show that enhancer decommissioning also occurs at specific, rate-limiting cell cycle genes in the long-lived tissues of the Drosophila eye and brain, and we propose this loss of chromatin accessibility may help maintain a robust postmitotic state. We examined the decommissioned enhancers at specific rate-limiting cell cycle genes and show that they encode dynamic temporal and spatial expression patterns that include shared, as well as tissue-specific elements, resulting in broad gene expression with developmentally controlled temporal regulation. We extend our analysis to cell cycle gene expression and chromatin accessibility in the mammalian retina using a published dataset, and find that the principles of cell cycle gene regulation identified in terminally differentiating Drosophila tissues are conserved in the differentiating mammalian retina. We propose a robust, non-cycling status is maintained in long-lived postmitotic tissues through a combination of stable repression at most cell cycle gens, alongside enhancer decommissioning at specific rate-limiting cell cycle genes.",

    "title": "Cell type-specific cis -regulatory divergence in gene expression and chromatin accessibility revealed by human-chimpanzee hybrid cells",
    "abstract": "Although gene expression divergence has long been postulated to be the primary driver of human evolution, identifying the genes and genetic variants underlying uniquely human traits has proven to be quite challenging. Theory suggests that cell type-specific cis -regulatory variants may fuel evolutionary adaptation due to the specificity of their effects. These variants can precisely tune the expression of a single gene in a single cell type, avoiding the potentially deleterious consequences of trans -acting changes and non-cell type-specific changes that can impact many genes and cell types, respectively. It has recently become possible to quantify human-specific cis -acting regulatory divergence by measuring allele-specific expression in human-chimpanzee hybrid cells—the product of fusing induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells of each species in vitro . However, these cis -regulatory changes have only been explored in a limited number of cell types. Here, we quantify human-chimpanzee cis -regulatory divergence in gene expression and chromatin accessibility across six cell types, enabling the identification of highly cell type-specific cis -regulatory changes. We find that cell type-specific genes and regulatory elements evolve faster than those shared across cell types, suggesting an important role for genes with cell type-specific expression in human evolution. Furthermore, we identify several instances of lineage-specific natural selection that may have played key roles in specific cell types, such as coordinated changes in the cis -regulation of dozens of genes involved in neuronal firing in motor neurons. Finally, using novel metrics and a machine learning model, we identify genetic variants that likely alter chromatin accessibility and transcription factor binding, leading to neuron-specific changes in the expression of the neurodevelopmentally important genes FABP7 and GAD1 . Overall, our results demonstrate that integrative analysis of cis -regulatory divergence in chromatin accessibility and gene expression across cell types is a promising approach to identify the specific genes and genetic variants that make us human.",

Herein, we present matched chromatin accessibility (single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin by sequencing [scATAC-seq]) and transcriptome (single-cell RNA sequencing [scRNA-seq]) profiles at single-cell resolution from human breast tumors and healthy mammary tissues processed immediately following surgical resection. We identify the most likely cell of origin for subtype-specific breast tumors and implement linear mixed-effects modeling to quantify associations between regulatory elements and gene expression in malignant versus normal cells. These data unveil cancer-specific regulatory elements and putative silencer-to-enhancer switching events in cells that lead to the upregulation of clinically relevant oncogenes. In addition, we generate matched scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq profiles for breast cancer cell lines, revealing a conserved oncogenic gene expression program between in vitro and in vivo cells. This work highlights the importance of non-coding regulatory mechanisms that underlie oncogenic processes and the ability of single-cell multi-omics to define the regulatory logic of cancer cells.",

Using a spatially resolved single-cell atlas of gene expression with chromatin accessibility across ten soybean tissues, we identified 103 distinct cell types and 303,199 accessible chromatin regions (ACRs). Nearly 40% of the ACRs showed cell-type-specific patterns and were enriched for transcription factor (TF) motifs defining diverse cell identities. We identified de novo enriched TF motifs and explored conservation of gene regulatory networks underpinning legume symbiotic nitrogen fixation. With comprehensive developmental trajectories for endosperm and embryo, we uncovered the functional transition of the three sub-cell types of endosperm, identified 13 sucrose transporters sharing the DOF11 motif that were co-up-regulated in late peripheral endosperm and identified key embryo cell-type specification regulators during embryogenesis, including a homeobox TF that promotes cotyledon parenchyma identity. This resource provides a valuable foundation for analyzing gene regulatory programs in soybean cell types across tissues and life stages.",

If anything is confusing, you can always check [here](http://sourceforge.net/p/raspberry-gpio-python/wiki/Examples/) for the original Python module's documentation.\n\n#### Download the gem\n\nThe easiest way to download the gem is to use [Bundler](http://bundler.io/) with a Gemfile. In your Gemfile, include the line \n```ruby\ngem 'rpi_gpio'\n```\nThen you can run `bundle install` to automatically download and compile the gem for your system. To include the gem in a Ruby file, use the line `require 'rpi_gpio'`.\n\n#### Pin numbering\n\nBefore you can do anything with the GPIO pins, you need to specify how you want to number them.\n```ruby\nRPi::GPIO.set_numbering :board\n# or\nRPi::GPIO.set_numbering :bcm\n````\n`:board` numbering refers to the physical pin numbers on the Pi, whereas `:bcm` numbering refers to the Broadcom SOC channel numbering. Note that `:bcm` numbering differs between Pi models, while `:board` numbering does not.\n\n#### Input\n\nTo receive input from a GPIO pin, you must first initialize it as an input pin:\n```ruby\nRPi::GPIO.setup PIN_NUM, :as => :input\n# or\nRPi::GPIO.setup [PIN1_NUM, PIN2_NUM, ...], :as => :input\n```\nThe pin number will differ based on your selected numbering system and which pin you want to use.\n\nYou can use the additional hash argument `:pull` to apply a pull-up or pull-down resistor to the input pin like so:\n```ruby\nRPi::GPIO.setup PIN_NUM, :as => :input, :pull => :down\n# or\nRPi::GPIO.setup PIN_NUM, :as => :input, :pull => :up\n# or (not necessary; :off is the default value)\nRPi::GPIO.setup PIN_NUM, :as => :input, :pull => :off\n```\n\nNow you can use the calls\n```ruby\nRPi::GPIO.high? PIN_NUM\nRPi::GPIO.low? PIN_NUM\n```\nto receive either `true` or `false`.\n\nIf you prefer to use a callback when a pin edge is detected, you can use the `watch` method:\n```ruby\nRPi::GPIO.watch PIN_NUM, :on => :rising do |pin, value| # :on supports :rising, :falling, and :both\n  ...\nend\n```\n\n`watch` also supports the optional `bounce_time` parameter found in the Python module to prevent duplicate events from firing:\n```ruby\nRPi::GPIO.watch PIN_NUM, :on => :falling, :bounce_time => 200 do |pin, value|\n  ...\nend\n```\n\nTo stop watching a pin, use `stop_watching`:\n```ruby\nRPi::GPIO.stop_watching PIN_NUM\n```\n\nIf you want to block execution until a pin edge is detected, there's `wait_for_edge`:\n```ruby\nputs 'Waiting to start...'\nRPi::GPIO.wait_for_edge PIN_NUM, :rising # :rising, :falling, and :both are also supported here\nputs 'Here we go!'\n```\n\n`wait_for_edge` accepts optional `bounce_time` and `timeout` arguments too:\n```ruby\nputs 'Waiting to start...'\nvalue = RPi::GPIO.wait_for_edge PIN_NUM, :falling, :bounce_time => 200, :timeout => 5000\nif value.nil? # nil is returned if the timeout is reached\n  print 'You took too long. '\nend\nputs 'Here we go!'\n```\n\n#### Output\n\nTo send output to a GPIO pin, you must first initialize it as an output pin:\n```ruby\nRPi::GPIO.setup PIN_NUM, :as => :output\n# or\nRPi::GPIO.setup [PIN1_NUM, PIN2_NUM, ...], :as => :output\n```\nNow you can use the calls\n```ruby\nRPi::GPIO.set_high PIN_NUM\nRPi::GPIO.set_low PIN_NUM\n```\nto set the pin either high or low.\n\nYou can use the additional hash argument `:initialize` to set the pin's initial state like so:\n```ruby\nRPi::GPIO.setup PIN_NUM, :as => :output, :initialize => :high\n# or\nRPi::GPIO.setup PIN_NUM, :as => :output, :initialize => :low\n```\n\n#### PWM (pulse-width modulation)\n\nPulse-width modulation is a useful tool for controlling things like LED brightness or motor speed. To utilize PWM, first create a PWM object for an [output pin](#output).\n```ruby\npwm = RPi::GPIO::PWM.new(PIN_NUM, PWM_FREQ)\n```\nThe `PWM_FREQ` is a value in hertz that specifies the amount of pulse cycles per second.\n\nNow you can call the following method to start PWM:\n```ruby\npwm.start DUTY_CYCLE\n```\n`DUTY_CYCLE` is a value from `0.0` to `100.0` indicating the percent of the time that the signal will be high.\n\nOnce running, you can get/set the PWM duty cycle with\n```ruby\npwm.duty_cycle # get\npwm.duty_cycle = NEW_DUTY_CYCLE # set\n```\nget/set the PWM frequency with\n```ruby\npwm.frequency # get\npwm.frequency = NEW_FREQUENCY # set\n```\nand get the PWM GPIO number with\n```ruby\npwm.gpio\n```\nNote that this number corresponds to `:bcm` numbering of the GPIO pins, so it will be different than pin number you used if you created the PWM with `:board` numbering.\n\nTo stop PWM, use\n```ruby\npwm.stop\n```\n\nTo check if a PWM object is currently running, use\n```ruby\npwm.running?\n```\n\n#### Cleaning up\n\nAfter your program is finished using the GPIO pins, it's a good idea to release them so other programs can use them later. Simply call\n```ruby\nRPi::GPIO.clean_up PIN_NUM\n```\nto release a specific pin, or\n```ruby\nRPi::GPIO.clean_up\n```\nto release all allocated pins.\n\nAlternatively, you can call\n```ruby\nRPi::GPIO.reset\n```\nto clean up all pins and to also reset the selected numbering mode.\n\n## Credits\n\nOriginal Python code by Ben Croston modified for Ruby by Nick Lowery\n\nCopyright (c) 2014-2020 [Nick Lowery](https://github.com/ClockVapor)\n\nView LICENSE for full license.\n\n",

It shows you the existing value and lets you pick a new one.\n\nIt was inspired by this \nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Backlight#Backlight_PWM_modulation_frequency_.28Intel_i915_only.29\nand this\nhttp://devbraindom.blogspot.com/2013/03/eliminate-led-screen-flicker-with-intel.html\nBut its for Windows x64 instead.  \n\nI think the value it reads back and writes is the frequency in Hz.  The actual output was not checked via high speed camera or anything like that, but it seems to have the same behavior as sending those intel_reg_write commands from linux with the computed values.  The driver actually has two configuration DWORDs,  the default for me for these two values in decimal is 2 and 200.  This utility just keeps the first value as read back from the driver and changes only the second value.  It's possible the first value is duty cycle or mode related, or something completely different.

Only retain paragraphs relevant to your analysis. References [ref] to the respective publications are curated in the software table above. Versions (ver) have to be read out from the respective conda environment specifications (`workflow/envs/*.yaml file`) or post-execution in the result directory (`atacseq_pipeline/envs/*.yaml`). Parameters that have to be adapted depending on the data or workflow configurations are denoted in squared brackets e.g., [X].\n\n**Processing.**\nSequencing adapters were removed using the software fastp (ver) [ref]. Bowtie2 (ver) [ref] was used for the alignment of the short reads (representing locations of transposition events) to the [GRCh38 (hg38)/GRCm38 (mm10)] assembly of the [human/mouse] genome using the “--very-sensitive” parameter. PCR duplicates were marked using samblaster (ver) [ref]. Aligned BAM files were then sorted, filtered using ENCODE blacklisted regions [ref], samtools view flags [SAM_flag], and indexed using samtools (ver) [ref]. To detect the open chromatin regions, peak calling was performed using MACS2 (ver) [ref] using the “--nomodel”, “--keep-dup [macs2_keep_dup]” and “--extsize 147” options on each sample. HOMER (ver) [ref] function findMotifs was used for motif enrichment analysis of the detected open chromatin regions. Quality control metrics were aggregated and reported using MultiQC (ver) [ref], [X] sample(s) needed to be removed.\n\n**Quantification.**\nA consensus region set, comprising of [X] genomic regions, was generated, by merging the identified peak summits, extended by [slop_extension]bp on both sides using the slop function from bedtools (ver) [ref] and pybedtools (ver) [ref], across all samples while again discarding peaks overlapping blacklisted features as defined by the ENCODE project [ref]. The consensus region set was used to quantify the chromatin accessibility in each sample by summing the number of reads overlapping each consensus region. The consensus region set, and sample-wise quantification of accessibility was performed using bedtools (ver) [ref] and pybedtools (ver) [ref]. Furthermore, the consensus region set was used to quantify the peak support per sample and each region was mapped to its closest TSS according to the HOMER annotation within proximal TSS up and downstream distances [proximal_size_up/down] yielding a gene/TSS-based quantification. Complementary, all promoter regions, defined by the same parameters, were quantified for each sample and aggregated to yield a gene/promoter-based quantification. Finally, all sample-wise enriched known motifs according to HOMER were aggregated.\n\n**Annotation.**\nConsensus regions were annotated using annotatePeaks function from HOMER (ver) [ref]. Additionally, we annotated all consensus regions using UROPA (ver) [ref] and genomic features from the [GENCODE vX] basic gene annotation as: “TSS proximal” if the region’s midpoint was within [X] bp upstream or [X] bp downstream from a TSS, or if the region overlapped with a TSS; “gene body” if the region overlapped with a gene; “distal” if the region’s midpoint was within [X] bp of a TSS; and “intergenic” otherwise. For each region, only the closest feature was considered, and the annotations took precedence in the following order: TSS proximal, gene body, distal, and intergenic. Finally, bedtools was employed to quantify nucleotide counts and proportional content per consensus region.\n\nThe processing and quantification described here was performed using a publicly available Snakemake [ver] (ref) workflow [[10.5281/zenodo.6323634](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6323634)].\n\n# 🚀 Features\n- Processing (`results/`)\n    - Alignment of both single-end and paired-end reads in raw/unaligned/unmapped [uBAM](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360035532132-uBAM-Unmapped-BAM-Format) format with Bowtie2.\n      - Filtering using `samtools view` can be configured using [SAM Flags](https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/explain-flags.html) (`SAM_flag`).\n    - Peak calling with `MACS2`.\n      - Duplicate handling can be configured using `macs2_keep_dup`.\n      - Even though the peak support of a region in a certain sample is 0, does not mean that there are no reads counted in the count matrix, it just states that there was no peak called.\n      - The peak support can be >1 for certain samples in case of a consensus region spanning more than one peak within the respective sample.\n    - Peak annotation and motif analysis HOMER.\n    - Quantification of TSS coverage.\n- Reporting (`report/`)\n    - MultiQC report generation using MultiQC, extended with an in-house developed plugin [atacseq_report](./workflow/scripts/multiqc_atacseq).\n    - Sample annotation is visualized as a hierarchically-clustered QC heatmap with matching metadata annotation, exported both as a `PNG` and an interactive `HTML` with metadata as tooltips (`sample_annotation.{png|html}`).\n- Quantification (`counts/`)\n    - Consensus region set generation across all called peaks (`consensus_regions.bed`).\n    - Read count quantification of the consensus regions across samples, yielding a count matrix with dimensions consensus regions X samples (`consensus_counts.csv`).\n    - Peak support quantification of the consensus regions across samples, yielding a count matrix with dimensions consensus regions X samples (`support_counts.csv`).\n    - Consensus regions mapped to closest gene TSS according to HOMER (Distance to TSS) within proximal TSS up and downstream distances (`TSS_regions.bed`, `TSS_counts.csv`, `TSS_annotation.csv`).\n    - Read count quantification of promoter regions based on provided proximal TSS up and downstream distances (`promoter_regions.bed`, `promoter_counts.csv`, `promoter_annotation.csv`).\n      - [Pseudoautosomal regions in human](https://www.ensembl.org/info/genome/genebuild/human_PARS.html) chromosome `Y` are skipped.\n    - Aggregation of all sample-wise HOMER known motif enrichment results into one CSV in long-format (`HOMER_knownMotifs.csv`).\n- Annotation (`counts/`)\n    - Sample annotation file based on `MultiQC` general stats and provided annotations for downstream analysis (`sample_annotation.csv`).\n    - Consensus region set annotation using (`consensus_annotation.csv`)\n      - `UROPA` with regulatory build and gencode as references, configurable here: `workflow/resources/UROPA/*.txt`.\n      - `HOMER` with `annotatePeaks.pl`. NB: We have empirically found, that some human sex genes, e.g., the well established protein coding genes UTY and STS, are not annotated.\n      - `bedtools` for nucleotide counts/content (e.g., % of GC).\n\n\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> **Duplicate Handling Strategy: PCR vs. Biological Signal**\n> \n> ATAC-seq libraries often contain **PCR duplicates** (artifacts from amplification) and **biological duplicates** (independent transposition events at the same locus). Differentiating them is critical: PCR duplicates inflate false positives, while removing biological duplicates reduces signal dynamic range.\n> \n> You can control duplicate handling at two distinct stages in `config/config.yaml`, and should do so with intention:\n> \n> 1. **Alignment Filtering (`SAM_flag`):** Controls whether duplicates are physically removed from the output BAM files.\n>    * **Recommendation:** Keep duplicates in the `BAM` (`SAM_flag: 2316`). This preserves library complexity information (useful for QC) and allows downstream tools to model redundancy themselves.\n>    * **Alternative:** Hard-filter duplicates (`SAM_flag: 3340`) in case of low-complexity/noisy libraries or to reduce file size.\n> \n> 2. **Peak Calling (`macs2_keep_dup`):** Controls how `MACS2` counts duplicates when identifying open chromatin regions.\n>    * **`auto` (Default/Recommended):** `MACS2` calculates the maximum expected duplicates based on sequencing depth and genome size, retaining biological signal while removing excessive PCR artifacts.\n>    * **`1`:** Conservative approach. Counts only one read per genomic location. Removes all potential PCR bias but may underestimate signal in highly open regions (e.g., promoters).\n>    * **`all`:** Uses every read. Only use this if you have very low duplication rates or have already hard-filtered PCR duplicates in the alignment step.\n> \n> **The decision depends** also on your downstream analysis steps e.g., rigorous filtering (e.g., using `edgeR::filterByExpr`) and/or accounting for PCR bias by normalization conditional on genomic region length and GC content (e.g., [CQN](https://academic.oup.com/biostatistics/article/13/2/204/1746212)) and goals (e.g., differential accessibility analysis).\n> **We recommend** reading this **ChIP-seq** tutorial's section on [\"Removing redundancy\"](https://hbctraining.github.io/Intro-to-ChIPseq/lessons/05_peak_calling_macs.html), while keeping in mind critical assay differences.\n\n# 🛠️ Usage\nThese steps are the recommended usage for this workflow:\n\n0. Configure the workflow by pointing to the relevant resources, e.g., downloaded from Zenodo for [hg38 or mm10 (see instructions below)](#resources).\n1. Perform only the processing, by setting the pass_qc annotation for all samples to 0.\n2. Use the generated MultiQC report (result_path/ataceq_pipeline/report/multiqc_report.html) to judge the quality of each sample (see tips in the next section on [Quality Control](#quality-control)).\n3. Fill out the mandatory quality control column (pass_qc) in the annotation file accordingly (everything >0 will be included in the downstream steps).\n4. Finally, execute the remaining downstream quantification and annotation steps by running the workflow. Thereby only the samples that passed quality control will be included in the consensus region set generation (i.e., the feature space) and all downstream steps.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Although inputs and parameters may be identical, **MACS2 peak calling can yield slightly varying results** (± a few peaks) due to stochastic elements in its algorithm (e.g., duplicate handling). This minor variability in peak calls sohuld have no impact on downstream analyses or the overall robustness of results.\n\nThis workflow is written with Snakemake and its usage is described in the [Snakemake Workflow Catalog](https://snakemake.github.io/snakemake-workflow-catalog?usage=epigen/atacseq_pipeline).\n\n# ⚙️ Configuration\nDetailed specifications can be found here [./config/README.md](./config/README.md)\n\n# 📖 Examples\nExplore a detailed example showcasing module usage and downstream analysis in our comprehensive end-to-end [MrBiomics Recipe](https://github.com/epigen/MrBiomics?tab=readme-ov-file#-recipes) for [ATAC-seq Analysis](https://github.com/epigen/MrBiomics/wiki/ATAC%E2%80%90seq-Analysis-Recipe), including data, configuration, annotation and results.\n\n# 🔍 Quality Control\nBelow are some guidelines for the manual quality control of each sample using the generated `MultiQC` report and visualized (interactive) sample annotation, but keep in mind that every experiment/dataset is different. Thresholds are general suggestions and may vary based on experiment type, organism, and library prep.\n\n1. Reads Mapped ~ $30\\cdot 10^{6}$ ($>20\\cdot 10^{6}$ at least)\n2. % Aligned >90%\n3. % Mitochondrial <10%\n4. Peaks (depend on reads)\n    - FriP (Fraction of reads in Peaks) ~ >20% (can be misleading as 80-90% are also not good)\n    - Regulatory regions >10% (as it is roughly 10% of the genome)\n    - TSS (Transcription Start Site) normalized coverage ideally > 4 (at least >2)\n    - % Duplications “not excessive”\n5. Inspect [Genome Browser Tracks](https://github.com/epigen/genome_tracks/) using UCSC Genome Browser (online) or IGV (local)\n    - Compare all samples to the best, based on above's QC metrics.\n    - Check cell type / experiment-specific markers or sex chromosome (`X`/`Y`) for accessibility as positive controls.\n    - Check e.g., developmental regions for accessibility as negative controls.\n6. [Unsupervised Analysis](https://github.com/epigen/unsupervised_analysis) (e.g., PCA or UMAP)\n    - Identify outliers/drivers of variation, especially in the control samples and within replicates.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]  \n> Sometimes reads map to `Y` in females, because `X` and `Y` chromosomes both have [pseudoautosomal regions (PARs)](https://www.ensembl.org/info/genome/genebuild/human_PARS.html) that are common between the two chromosomes.\n  \nMy personal QC value scheme to inform downstream analyses (e.g., unsupervised analysis)\n- 0 = did not pass\n- 2 options\n  - for every metric that is not ok subtract 0.25 from 1, which means it requires 4 “strikes” for a sample to be removed due to low quality.\n  - alternative\n      - 0.5 = passed with reservations (e.g., metrics and genome browser tracks were not optimal, but still good enough)\n      - 0.75 = not ideal (e.g., at least metrics or IGV tracks were not optimal)\n- 1 = passed (perfect)\n\nFinally, a previous PhD student in our lab, [André Rendeiro](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9362-5373), wrote about [\"ATAC-seq sample quality, wet lab troubleshooting and advice\"](https://github.com/epigen/open_pipelines/blob/master/pipelines/atacseq.md#sample-quality-wet-lab-troubleshooting-and-advice).\n\n# 🔗 Links\n- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/epigen/atacseq_pipeline/)\n- [GitHub Page](https://epigen.github.io/atacseq_pipeline/)\n- [Zenodo Repository](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6323634)\n- [Snakemake Workflow Catalog Entry](https://snakemake.github.io/snakemake-workflow-catalog?usage=epigen/atacseq_pipeline)\n\n# 📚 Resources\n- Data Resources: To ensure the reproducibility of results and to make the workflow accessible we provide all required reference data for the analysis of ATAC-seq samples for [human GRCh38 (hg38)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6344173) and [mouse GRCm38 (mm10)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6344321) genomes on Zendodo.\n\n  **Command line**\n  ```console\n  # download Zenodo records using zenodo_get\n\n  # install zenodo_get v1.3.4\n  conda install -c conda-forge zenodo_get=1.3.4\n\n  # human GRCh38 (hg38)\n  zenodo_get --record 6344173 --output-dir=resources/atacseq_pipeline/hg38/\n  cd resources/atacseq_pipeline/hg38\n  unzip indices_for_Bowtie2.zip && rm indices_for_Bowtie2.zip\n\n  # mouse GRCm38 (mm10)\n  zenodo_get --record 6344322 --output-dir=resources/atacseq_pipeline/mm10/\n  cd resources/atacseq_pipeline/mm10\n  unzip indices_for_Bowtie2.zip && rm indices_for_Bowtie2.zip\n  ```\n  **Snakemake rule** for workflows\n  ```python\n  #### Get resources from Zenodo as custom Snakemake rule ####\n  # Downloads Bowtie2 indices for hg38 from Zenodo record 6344173 and unpacks them.\n    rule MyATAC_get_resources:\n        output:\n            \"resources/MyATAC/atacseq_pipeline/hg38/gencode.v38.basic.annotation.gtf\",\n            resource_dir = directory(\"resources/MyATAC/atacseq_pipeline/hg38/\"),\n        params:\n            zenodo_record = \"6344173\",\n            zip_filename = \"indices_for_Bowtie2.zip\"\n        conda:\n            \"../envs/zenodo_get.yaml\"\n        shell:\n            \"\"\"\n            # Download the specific record to the target directory\n            zenodo_get --record {params.zenodo_record} --output-dir={output.resource_dir}\n    \n            # Change directory, unzip the specific file, and remove the zip archive\n            # Using && ensures commands run sequentially and stop if one fails\n            cd {output.resource_dir} && \\\n            unzip {params.zip_filename} && \\\n            rm {params.zip_filename}\n            \"\"\"\n  ```\n- [How to convert feature lists to BED files](https://github.com/epigen/enrichment_analysis?tab=readme-ov-file#-how-to-convert-feature-lists-to-bed-files)\n- Recommended compatible [MrBiomics](https://github.com/epigen/MrBiomics) modules for\n  - upstream analysis:\n      - [Fetch Public Sequencing Data and Metadata Using iSeq](https://github.com/epigen/fetch_ngs/) to retrieve and prepare public ATAC-ses data for downstream processing.\n  - downstream analysis (in that order):\n      - [Genome Browser Track Visualization](https://github.com/epigen/genome_tracks/) for quality control and visual inspection/analysis of genomic regions/genes of interest or top hits.\n      - [<ins>Sp</ins>lit, F<ins>ilter</ins>, Norma<ins>lize</ins> and <ins>Integrate</ins> Sequencing Data](https://github.com/epigen/spilterlize_integrate/) after count quantification.\n      - [Unsupervised Analysis](https://github.com/epigen/unsupervised_analysis) to understand and visualize similarities and variations between cells/samples, including dimensionality reduction and cluster analysis.
