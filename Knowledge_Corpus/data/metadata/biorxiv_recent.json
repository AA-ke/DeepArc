    "abstract": "Genetic contributions of Neanderthals to the modern human genome have been evidenced by comparison of present-day human genomes with paleogenomes suggesting that the Neanderthal introgression is higher in Asians and Europeans and lower in Africans. Neanderthal signatures in extant human genomes are attributed to intercrosses between Neanderthals and archaic Anatomically Modern Humans (AMH). Although Neanderthal signatures are well documented in the nuclear genome, it has been proposed that there is no contribution of Neanderthal mitochondrial DNA to contemporary human genomes. Here we show that modern human mitochondrial genomes contain potential 66 Neanderthal signatures, or Neanderthal single nucleotide variants (N-SNVs) being 36 in coding regions of which 7 are nonsynonymous. Also, 7 N-SNVs are associated with traits such as cycling vomiting syndrome, Alzheimers disease, Parkinsons disease and 2 N-SNVs are associated with intelligence quotient. Based on recombination tests, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the complete absence of these N-SNVs in 41 archaic AMH mitogenomes we conclude that convergent evolution due to homoplasy and not recombination, explains the presence of N-SNVs in present-day human mitogenomes.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association analysis is a powerful tool to identify genomic loci underlying complex traits. However, the application in natural populations comes with challenges, especially power loss due to population stratification. Here, we introduce a bivariate analysis approach to a GWAS dataset of Arabidopsis thaliana. We demonstrate the efficiency of double-phenotype analysisto uncover hidden genetic loci masked by population structure via a series of simulations. In real data analysis, acommon allele, strongly confounded with population structure, is discovered to be associated with late flowering and slow maturation of the plant. The discovered genetic effect on flowering time is further replicated in independent datasets. Using Mendelian randomization analysis based on summary statistics from our GWAS and expression QTL scans, we predicted and replicated a candidate gene AT1G11560 that potentially causes this association. Further analysis indicates that this locusis co-selected with flowering-time-related genes. The discovered pleiotropic genotypephenotype map provides new insights into understanding the genetic correlation of complex traits.",

    "abstract": "What is the nature of the ageing process? What is the spore survival, that one would expect upon analysing a self-cross, in a wild fission yeast strain? Could this two research questions be, somehow, related? In this manuscript, I am describing some interesting observations obtained while studying fission yeast spore survival values upon genetic crosses. Early findings brought my attention into mainly studying self-crosses (intra-strain crosses in which any cell can be involved in by mating with a sibling cell). This study, yield some interesting findings. As a summary: 1) most fission yeast self-crosses do show low spore survival values; 2) clonally related strains show a high phenotypic variability in self-cross spore survival values; 3) differences in self-cross spore survival values can be detected when comparing zygotic and azygotic matings; 4) self-cross spore survival values are highly affected by environmental factors, mainly producing a reduction in the spore survival values; 5) self-cross spore survival values are \"recovered\" when cells are subjected to several rounds of meiotic divisions; 6) signs of correlation between spore survival and vegetative cell survival (prior to the entry into meiosis) have been observed in this study. All those observations, among others, are discussed as part of an epigenetic variability that exist in fission yeast populations. A cyclical behaviour, of this epigenetic variability it is proposed, defining an underlying ratchet-like epigenetic mechanisms acting in all cells. In this manuscript, I propose that this mechanism, is, indeed, the main cause of the ageing process.",

    "abstract": "The C. elegans Argonaute protein PRG-1/Piwi and associated piRNAs protect metazoan genomes by silencing transposons and other types of foreign DNA. As prg-1 mutants are propagated, their fertility deteriorates prior to the onset of a reproductive arrest phenotype that resembles a starvation-induced stress response. We found that late-generation prg-1 mutants with substantially reduced fertility were long-lived, whereas early- or mid-generation prg-1 mutants had normal lifespans. Loss of the stress response transcription factor DAF-16 caused mid- or late-generation prg-1 mutants to live very short lives, whereas overexpression of DAF-16 enabled both mid- and late-generation prg-1 mutants to live long. Cytoplasmic P-bodies that respond to stress increased in long-lived late-generation prg-1 mutants and were transmitted to F1 but not F2 cross-progeny. Moreover, moderate levels of heritable stress shorten late-generation prg-1 mutant longevity when DAF-16 or P bodies are deficient. Together, these results suggest that the longevity of late-generation prg-1 mutants is a hormetic stress response. However, dauer larvae that occur in response to stress were not observed in late-generation prg-1 mutants. Small germ cell nucleoli that depended on germline DAF-16 were present in late-generation prg-1 mutants but were not necessary for their longevity. We propose that prg-1 mutant germ cells transmit a form of heritable stress, high levels of which promote longevity and strongly reduce fertility. The heritable stress transmitted by PRG-1/Piwi mutant germ cells may be generally relevant to epigenetic inheritance of longevity.\n\nCore message of paperprg-1/Piwi mutants with strongly reduced fertility live long and longevity is transmitted for one generation to F1 cross progeny. Stress granules are increased and germ cell nucleoli are small for long-lived Piwi mutants and their F1 progeny. Loss of daf-16 stress response transcription factor or dcap-1 P body protein causes very short life for worms when prg-1 mutant fertility is moderately reduced, whereas moderate fertility is sufficient to extend lifespan when somatic DAF-16 is overexpressed. We propose that prg-1 mutant germ cells transmit a heritable epigenetic factor that is stressful and elicits two hormetic stress responses: reproductive arrest and longevity.",

    "abstract": "In genetic association analysis of complex traits, permutation testing can be a valuable tool for assessing significance when the distribution of the test statistic is unknown or not well-approximated. This commonly arises, e.g, in tests of gene-set, pathway or genome-wide significance, or when the statistic is formed by machine learning or data adaptive methods. Existing applications include eQTL mapping, association testing with rare variants, inclusion of admixed individuals in genetic association analysis, and epistasis detection among many others. For genetic association testing in samples with population structure and/or relatedness, use of naive permutation can lead to inflated type 1 error. To address this in quantitative traits, the MVNpermute method was developed. However, for association mapping of a binary trait, the relationship between the mean and variance makes both naive permutation and the MVNpermute method invalid. We propose BRASS, a permutation method for binary traits, for use in association mapping in structured samples. In addition to modeling structure in the sample, BRASS allows for covariates, ascertainment and simultaneous testing of multiple markers, and it accommodates a wide range of test statistics. In simulation studies, we compare BRASS to other permutation and resampling-based methods in a range of scenarios that include population structure, familial relatedness, ascertainment and phenotype model misspecification. In these settings, we demonstrate the superior control of type 1 error by BRASS compared to the other 6 methods considered. We apply BRASS to assess genome-wide significance for association analyses in domestic dog for elbow dysplasia (ED) and idiopathic epilepsy (IE). For both traits we detect previously identified associations, and in addition, for ED, we detect significant association with a SNP on chromosome 35 that was not detected by previous analyses, demonstrating the potential of the method.\n\nAuthor summaryTo determine whether genetic association with a trait is significant, permutation methods are an attractive and popular approach when analytic methods based on distributional assumptions are not available, e.g., when applying machine learning or data adaptive methods, or when performing a multiple testing correction, e.g., to assess region-wide or genome-wide significance in association mapping studies. Existing applications include eQTL mapping, association testing with rare variants, inclusion of admixed individuals in genetic association analysis, and detection of genetic interaction among many others. However, when there is population structure in the sample, naive permutation of the data can lead to inflated significance of the association results. For continuous traits, linear mixed-model based approaches have been proposed for permutation-based tests that can also adjust for sample structure; however, these do not remain valid when applied to binary traits, as key features of binary data are not well accounted for. We propose BRASS, a permutation-based testing method for binary data that incorporates important characteristics of binary data in the trait model, can accommodate relevant covariates and ascertainment, and adjusts for the presence of structure in the sample. In simulations, we demonstrate the superior control of type 1 error by BRASS compared to other methods, and we apply BRASS in the context of correcting for multiple testing in two genome-wide association studies in domestic dog: one for elbow dysplasia and one for idiopathic epilepsy.",

    "abstract": "Moores law states that computers get faster and less expensive over time. In contrast in biopharma, there is the reverse spelling, Erooms law, which states that drug discovery is getting slower and costing more money every year. Herein, we propose a solution to this problem. We put forth a consensus algorithm for inexpensively and rapidly prioritizing new factors of interest (e.g., a gene or drug) in human disease research. Specifically, we argue for synthetic interaction testing in mammalian cells using cell fitness - which reflect changes in cell number that could be due many effects - as a readout to judge the potential of the new factor. That is, if we combine perturbing a known factor with perturbing an unknown factor and they produce a synergistic, i.e., multiplicative rather than additive cell fitness phenotype, this justifies proceeding with the unknown gene/drug in more complex models where the known perturbation is already validated. This recommendation is backed by the following evidence we demonstrate herein: 1) human genes currently known to be important to cell fitness involve nearly all classifications of cellular and molecular processes; 2) Nearly all human genes important in cancer - a disease defined by altered cell number - are also important in other common diseases; 3) Many drugs affect a patients condition and the fitness of their cells comparably. We provide proof of concept of the Omniphenotype model using the widely used osteoporosis drug, bisphosphonates, implicating its mechanism of action (MoA) genes, ATRAID, SLC37A3, and FDPS, as potential gerotargets for neurodegenerative conditions. Taken together, these findings suggest cell fitness could be a broadly applicable phenotype for understanding gene, disease, and drug function. Measuring cell fitness is robust and requires little time and money. These are features that have long been capitalized on by pioneers using model organisms that we hope more mammalian biologists will recognize.\n\nShort summaryCell fitness is a biological hash function that enables interoperability of biomedical data.",

    "abstract": "Natural selection can maintain local adaptation despite the presence of gene flow. However, the genomic basis and environmental factors involved in adaptation at fine-spatial scales are not well understood. Here, we address these questions using Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus), an abundant, migratory, and widely distributed marine species with substantial genomic resources including a chromosome-level genome assembly and genomic data from the eastern Atlantic and Baltic populations. We analysed whole-genome sequence and oceanographic data to examine the genetic variation of 15 spawning aggregations across the northwest Atlantic Ocean ([~]1,600 km of coastline) and the association of this variation with environmental variables. We found that population structure lies in a small fraction of the genome involving adaptive genetic variants of functional importance. We discovered 10 highly differentiated genomic regions distributed across four chromosomes. Two of these loci appear to be private to the northwest, four loci share a large number of adaptive variants between northwest and northeast Atlantic, and four shared loci exhibit an outstanding diversity in haplotype composition, including a novel putative inversion on chromosome 8. Another inversion on chromosome 12 underlies a latitudinal genetic pattern discriminating populations north and south of a biogeographic transition zone on the Scotian Shelf. Our genome-environment association analysis indicates that sea water temperature during winter is the environmental factor that best correlates with the latitudinal pattern of this inversion. We conclude that the timing and geographic location of spawning and early development are under diverse selective pressures related to environmental gradients. Natural selection appears to act on early-life performance traits with differential fitness across environments. Our study highlights the role of genomic architecture, ancestral haplotypes, and selection in maintaining adaptive divergence in species with large population sizes and presumably high gene flow.",

Mycobacterium marinum, a fish pathogen and a close relative of the tuberculosis group, is able to infect the free-living amoeba and professional phagocyte Dictyostelium discoideum and to manipulate its phagosome maturation. By using this host-pathogen model system, we have established an innovative process to isolate MCVs. This procedure allowed us to isolate the M. marinum-MCV at 1, 3 and 6 hours post infection to study the early M. marinum-MCV proteome. By using isobaric labelling and mass spectrometry, we quantitatively compared the proteomic composition of those MCVs isolated at different stages of the early infection phase to understand how M. marinum impacts on this compartment to divert it from the normal phagosomal pathway. Furthermore, we also compared the manipulated compartment M. marinum-MCV to non- or less manipulated compartments containing different mycobacteria strains: the non-pathogenic M. smegmatis, the avirulent M. marinum-L1D or the attenuated M. marinum-RD1.",

    "abstract": "During development and wound healing, cells need to form long-ranged ordered structures to ensure precise formation of organs and repair damage. This requires cells to locate specific partner cells to which to adhere. How such cell matching reliably happens is an open problem, particularly in the presence of biological variability. Here, we use an equilibrium energy model to simulate how cell matching can occur with subcellular precision. A single parameter - encapsulating the competition between selective cell adhesion and cell compressibility - can reproduce experimental observations of cell alignment in the Drosophila embryonic heart. This demonstrates that adhesive differences between cells (in the case of the heart, mediated by filopodia interactions) are sufficient to drive cell matching without requiring cell rearrangements. The biophysical model can explain observed matching defects in mutant conditions and when there is significant biological variability. We also demonstrate that a dynamic vertex model gives results consistent with the equilibrium energy model. Overall, this work shows that equilibrium energy considerations are consistent with observed cell matching in cardioblasts, and has potential application to other systems, such as neuron connections and wound repair.\n\nStatement of SignificanceCells often need to identify specific neighboring cells, such as during wound repair and forming neural connections. Here, we develop a biophysical model of such cell-cell interactions within the context of the developing heart. We demonstrate that precise cell matching can occur by minimizing the energy costs of interfacial interactions. This model can explain a breadth of experimental observations despite it being a steady-state approximation of a dynamic system. This opens the possibility that such approaches may be applicable to other systems, providing a powerful yet simple framework for understanding cell matching.",

Its own regulation is of interest, as it displays a highly restricted expression pattern, limited to erythroid cells and its progenitors. Here we use biochemical affinity purification to identify the Ddx5/p68 protein as an activator of KLF1 by virtue of its interaction with the erythroid-specific DNAse hypersensitive site upstream enhancer element (EHS1). We postulate that its range of interactions with other proteins known to interact with this element render it part of the enhanseosome complex critical for optimal expression of KLF1. These individual interactions provide quantitative contributions that, in sum, establish high level activity of the KLF1 promoter and suggest they can be selectively manipulated for clinical benefit.",

Here, we present a re-analysis of the primary data underlying this variant database and identify a pervasive genotyping artifact, especially present at long insertion and deletion polymorphisms. Specifically, very low levels of contamination can affect the variant calling likelihood models, leading to the misidentification of homozygous individuals as heterozygous, and thereby creating an apparent depletion of homozygous calls, which is especially prominent at large insertions and deletions. The deviation from HWE observed at CCR5-{Delta}32 is a consequence of this specific genotyping error mode rather than a signature of selective pressure at this locus.",

    "abstract": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a genetic disorder that affects people of all ages, with the elderly population being inadequately studied. It is primarily caused by gene variants that encode proteins involved in the structure and function of the heart muscle. The identification of genes associated with elderly HCM requires ethnic-specific genomic sequences from Wellderly individuals. Currently, no Indian Wellderly dataset is available. To address this, we collected and sequenced the Indian Wellderly population. We built a novel Indian database of healthy aging nucleotide sequences (named i-DHANS) and is newly accessible at IndiCardiome. Utilizing this database and Indian HCM cohort, we identified nebulin-related anchoring protein (NRAP) as a gene associated with elderly HCM. NRAP is crucial for the assembly of myofibrils and transmission of force from the sarcomere to the extracellular matrix. Our functional analysis showed that the identified NRAP variant had significantly reduced interactions with its interacting partners, such as Kelch-like protein 41 (KLHL41) and -actinin, implying a loss of function. In summary, our findings indicate that NRAP is a new elderly cardiomyopathy gene, and our Indian Wellderly database is a valuable resource for identifying ethnic-specific genes for various diseases.",

    "abstract": "Dysregulation of redox homeostasis has been implicated in the ageing process and the pathology of age-related diseases. To study redox signalling by H2O2 in vivo, we established a redox-shifted model by manipulating levels of the H2O2-degrading enzyme catalase in Drosophila. Here we report that ubiquitous over-expression of catalase robustly extends lifespan in flies. As anticipated, these flies were strongly resistant to a range of oxidative stress challenges, but interestingly were sensitive to starvation, which could not be explained by differences in levels of energy reserves. This led us to explore the contribution of autophagy, which is an important mechanism for organismal survival in response to starvation. We show that autophagy is essential for the increased lifespan upon catalase up-regulation, as the survival benefits were completely abolished upon global autophagy knock-down. Furthermore, using a specific redox-inactive knock-in mutant, we highlight the in vivo role of a key regulatory cysteine residue in Atg4a, which is required for the lifespan extension in our catalase model. Altogether, these findings confirm the redox regulation of autophagy in vivo as an important modulator of longevity.",

    "abstract": "Aspen (Populus tremula L.) is a widely distributed keystone species and a model system for forest tree genomics, with extensive resources developed for population genetics and genomics. Here we present an updated resource comprising a chromosome-scale assembly of P. tremula and population genetics and genomics data integrated into the PlantGenIE.org web resource. We demonstrate use of the diverse data types included to explore the genetic basis of natural variation in leaf size and shape as examples of traits with complex genetic architecture.\n\nWe present a chromosome-scale genome assembly generated using long-read sequencing, optical and high-density genetic maps containing 39,894 annotated genes with functional annotations for 73,765 transcripts from 37,184 gene loci. We conducted whole-genome resequencing of the Ume[a] Aspen (UmAsp) collection comprising 227 aspen individuals. We utilised the assembly, the UmAsp re-sequencing data and existing whole genome re-sequencing data from the Swedish Aspen (SwAsp) and Scottish Aspen (ScotAsp) collections to perform genome-wide association analyses (GWAS) using Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) for leaf physiognomy phenotypes. We conducted Assay of Transposase Accessible Chromatin sequencing (ATAC-Seq) and identified genomic regions of accessible chromatin and subset SNPs to these regions, which improved the GWAS detection rate. We identified candidate long non-coding RNAs in leaf samples and quantified their expression in an updated co-expression network (AspLeaf, available in PlantGenIE.org), which we further used to explore the functions of candidate genes identified from the GWAS.\n\nWe examined synteny to the reference P. trichocarpa assembly and identified P. tremula-specific regions. Analysis of whole-genome duplication indicated differential substitution rates for the two Populus species, indicating more rapid evolution in P. tremula. A GWAS of 26 leaf physiognomy traits and all SNPs in each of the three aspen collections found significant associations for only two traits in ScotAsp collection and one in UmAsp, whereas subsetting SNPs to those in open chromatin regions revealed associations for a further four traits among all three aspen collections. The significant SNPs were associated with genes annotated for developmental and growth functions, which represent candidates for further study. Of particular interest was a 177-kbp region of chromosome 9 harbouring SNPs associated with multiple leaf phenotypes in ScotAsp, with the set of SNPs in linkage disequilibrium explaining 24 to 30 % of the phenotypic variation in leaf indent depth variation.\n\nWe have incorporated the assembly, population genetics, genomics and leaf physiognomy GWAS data into the PlantGenIE.org web resource, including updating existing genomics data to the new genome version. This enables easy exploration and visualisation of the genomics data and exploration of GWAS results. We provide all raw and processed data used for the presented analyses to facilitate reuse in future studies.",

    "abstract": "Many biobanks and consortiums have generated large whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing datasets, making it possible to perform rare variant association studies. Compared to common variants, rare variants tend to have larger effect sizes and generally have much lower linkage disequilibrium (LD), making it easier to identify causal variants. These potential benefits make association analysis with rare variants a priority for human genetics researchers. Because of the low frequencies of these variants, however, the power of single-variant association is often low. To improve the power, numerous methods have been developed to aggregate information of all variants of a gene to better identify risk genes. These gene-based methods, however, often make unrealistic assumptions, e.g. all rare variants in a risk gene have the same effects. In practice, current gene-based analysis methods often fail to show any advantage over simple single-variant analysis. In this work, we develop a Bayesian method: MIxture model based Rare variant Analysis on GEnes (MIRAGE). MIRAGE captures the heterogeneity of variant effects by treating all variants of a gene as a mixture of risk and non-risk variants, and models the prior probabilities of being risk variants as function of external information of variants, such as allele frequencies and predicted deleterious effects. MIRAGE uses an empirical Bayes approach, combining information across genes to estimate these prior probabilities. We demonstrate in both simulations and analysis of an exome-sequencing dataset of Autism, that MIRAGE significantly outperforms current methods for rare variant analysis. The top genes identified by MIRAGE are highly enriched with known or plausible Autism risk genes. Our results highlight several novel Autism genes.

    "abstract": "The brain of Drosophila melanogaster is a complex organ with various cell types, orchestrating the physiology and behaviors of the fly. While each cell type in the Drosophila brain is known to express a unique set of genes, their complete genetic profile is still unknown. Advances in the RNA-sequencing techniques at single cell resolution facilitate identifying novel cell type-specific markers and/or examining the specificity of the available markers.\n\nIn this study, exploiting a single cell RNA sequencing data of Drosophila optic lobe (which comprises two thirds of the brain with extensive cell type diversity), we first categorized cell types based on their known molecular markers, then the genes with enriched expression in astrocytes were identified. Consistent with previous findings, the known glial markers CG34335, Inx2 and nrv2 as well as the astrocytic genes CG9394, Eaat1, Gat, Gs2 and CG1552 exhibited enriched expression in the identified astrocyte cluster. Moreover, we identified CG11000 as a gene with positive expression correlation with the astrocytic marker Eaat1. The positive expression correlation between CG11000 and Eaat1 genes was also observed in the single-cell RNA-sequencing data of Drosophila mid-brain as well as in the bulk RNA-sequencing data of Drosophila whole brain during development.\n\nImmunostaining of the brains dissected from adult flies showed overlapping fluorescence signals of CG11000 and Eaat1 expression, supporting co-expression of these genes in a set of single cells in Drosophila optic lobe. At the physiological level, RNAi-mediated suppression of CG11000 impeded th normal development of male flies without any effects on females. In adult flies, CG11000 suppression affected the locomotion activity and lifespan of D. melanogaster in an astrocyte-specific manner, suggesting pivotal role of CG11000 gene in astrocytes.",

    "abstract": "Here we report that stress-induced nuclear translocation of GAPDH mediates heart hypertrophy via Brahma-Related-Gene-1 (BRG1)-associated chromatin remodelling. In response to pressure overload elicited by transverse aortic constriction, we observed nuclear translocation of GAPDH in the mouse heart. We also demonstrated a robust nuclear localization of GAPDH in cardiomyocytes from patients with dilated hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, whereas negligible GAPDH in the nucleus in control subjects. This is the first demonstration of disease-associated nuclear GAPDH directly in living patients. Using immunohistochemical methods and a pharmacological way that selectively blocks GAPDH nuclear translocation (RR compound), we proved the causal involvement of GAPDH cysteine-150 modification in this translocation in Gq-induced cell model for heart hypertrophy. Accordingly, both pharmacological and genetic interventions proved that the same mechanism played a causal role for heart hypertrophy and dysfunction in vivo. We discovered that, upon nuclear translocation, GAPDH augmented the protein interaction of BRG1 and histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2), which further facilitated the Myh7/Myh6 isoform ratio from the mature to immature status, an essential mechanism for heart hypertrophy. Beyond medical implications, we provide a novel mechanism of stress-induced reversion of a cellular phenotype from adult to fetal state, which is mediated by a \"moonlighting\" function of GAPDH.",

    "abstract": "Here we report that stress-induced nuclear translocation of GAPDH mediates heart hypertrophy via Brahma-Related-Gene-1 (BRG1)-associated chromatin remodelling. In response to pressure overload elicited by transverse aortic constriction, we observed nuclear translocation of GAPDH in the mouse heart. We also demonstrated a robust nuclear localization of GAPDH in cardiomyocytes from patients with dilated hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, whereas negligible GAPDH in the nucleus in control subjects. This is the first demonstration of disease-associated nuclear GAPDH directly in living patients. Using immunohistochemical methods and a pharmacological way that selectively blocks GAPDH nuclear translocation (RR compound), we proved the causal involvement of GAPDH cysteine-150 modification in this translocation in Gq-induced cell model for heart hypertrophy. Accordingly, both pharmacological and genetic interventions proved that the same mechanism played a causal role for heart hypertrophy and dysfunction in vivo. We discovered that, upon nuclear translocation, GAPDH augmented the protein interaction of BRG1 and histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2), which further facilitated the Myh7/Myh6 isoform ratio from the mature to immature status, an essential mechanism for heart hypertrophy. Beyond medical implications, we provide a novel mechanism of stress-induced reversion of a cellular phenotype from adult to fetal state, which is mediated by a \"moonlighting\" function of GAPDH.",

    "abstract": "While alignment has traditionally been the primary approach for establishing homology prior to phylogenetic inference, alignment-free methods offer a simplified alternative, particularly beneficial when handling genome-wide data involving long sequences and complex events such as rearrangements. Moreover, alignment-free methods become crucial for data types like genome skims, where assembly is impractical. However, despite these benefits, alignment-free techniques have not gained widespread acceptance since they lack the accuracy of alignment-based techniques, primarily due to their reliance on simplified models of pairwise distance calculation. Here, we present a likelihood based alignment-free technique for phylogenetic tree construction. We encode the presence or absence of k-mers in genome sequences in a binary matrix, and estimate phylogenetic trees using a maximum likelihood approach. We analyze the performance of our method on seven real datasets and compare the results with the state of the art alignment-free methods. Results suggest that our method is competitive with existing alignment-free tools. This indicates that maximum likelihood based alignment-free methods may in the future be refined to outperform alignment-free methods relying on distance calculation as has been the case in the alignment-based setting. A likelihood based alignment-free method for phylogeny estimation is implemented for the first time in a software named PO_SCPLOWEAFOWLC_SCPLOW, which is available at: https://github.com/hasin-abrar/Peafowlrepo.",

    "abstract": "Investigating tumor heterogeneity using single-cell sequencing technologies is imperative to understand how tumors evolve since each cell subpopulation harbors a unique set of genomic features that yields a unique phenotype, which is bound to have clinical relevance. Clustering of cells based on copy number data obtained from single-cell DNA sequencing provides an opportunity to identify different tumor cell subpopulations. Accordingly, computational methods have emerged for single-cell copy number profiling and clustering; however, these two tasks have been handled sequentially by applying various ad-hoc pre- and post-processing steps; hence, a procedure vulnerable to introducing clustering artifacts. Moreover, clonal copy number profiling has been missing except for one method, CONET, which unfortunately computes it by a post-processing tool. Finally, a common copy number profiling tool, HMMcopy, requires parameter tuning. We avoid the clustering artifact issues and provide clonal copy number profiles without the labor of parameter tuning in our method, CopyMix, a Variational Inference for a novel mixture model, by jointly inferring cell clusters and their underlying copy number profile. We evaluate CopyMix using simulated data and published biological data from ovarian cancer. The results reveal high clustering performance and low errors in copy number profiling. These favorable results indicate a considerable potential to obtain clinical impact by using CopyMix in studies of cancer tumor heterogeneity.",

    "abstract": "We previously identified a homozygous Alu insertion variant (Alu_Ins) in the 3-UTR of the SPINK1 gene as the cause of a novel pediatric disease. Although we established that Alu_Ins leads to the complete loss of SPINK1 mRNA expression, the precise mechanisms remained elusive. Here we aimed to elucidate these mechanisms through a hypothesis-driven approach. Initially, we speculated that Alu_Ins could independently disrupt mRNA 3 end formation and/or affect other post-transcriptional processes such as nuclear export and translation, due to its particular location. However, the presence of Alu_Ins in the 3-UTR resulted in only an ~50% reduction in luciferase reporter activity compared to the wild-type, suggesting the involvement of additional mechanisms. Using RepeatMasker, we identified two Alu elements within SPINK1s third intron, both of which resided in an orientation opposite to that of Alu_Ins. Through RNAfold predictions and full-length gene expression assays designed to examine orientation-dependent interactions between Alu repeats, we present evidence linking the detrimental effect of Alu_Ins to extensive double-stranded RNA structures formed between Alu_Ins and pre-existing intronic Alu sequences. Our results reveal a novel pathogenetic mechanism involving an Alu insertion, highlighting the importance of considering interactions between new and pre-existing Alu elements in inverted orientations within disease-associated genes.",

CCNMF couples multi-omics single cells by linking copy number and gene expression profiles through their general concordance. We validated CC-NMF using both simulated benchmarks and real-world applications, demon-strating its robustness and accuracy. We analyzed scRNA and scDNA data from an ovarian cancer cell lines mixture, a gastric cancer cell line, as well as a primary gastric cancer, successfully resolving underlying clonal structures and identifying high correlations of coexisting clones between genome and transcriptome. Overall, CCNMF is a coherent computational framework that simultaneously resolves genomic and transcriptomic clonal architecture, facilitating understanding of how cellular gene expression changes along with clonal genome alternations.",

Lineage 1 (L1) is associated with low virulence, while Lineage 2 (L2) is linked to hyper-virulence, increased transmission, and drug resistance. We performed multi-layer comparative analyses integrating whole-genome sequencing with quantitative transcriptomic and proteomic profiling of a panel of L1 and L2 clinical strains, each grown under two in vitro conditions. Our data revealed variable correlations between transcript and protein levels across strains and gene categories, indicating lineage-specific post-translational regulation. Transcriptional and translational differences scaled with phylogenetic distance, with one in three SNPs on average leading to gene expression changes. A newly developed genome-scale transcriptional regulatory model identified master transcription factors--closely linked to the sigma factor network--whose targets were differentially expressed between L1 and L2. Notably, DosR proteins showed higher basal levels and a stronger nitric oxide (NO) response in L2. Time-course validation using an Rv1985c induction and wild-type H37Rv under hypoxia and reaeration confirmed the role of Rv1985c in the differentially expressed genes between L1 and L2.

    "abstract": "Accurate reconstruction of pedigrees from genetic data remains a challenging problem. Pedigree inference algorithms are often trained only on European-descent families in urban locations. Many relationship categories can be difficult to distinguish (e.g. half-sibships versus avuncular) without external information. Furthermore, existing methods perform poorly in endogamous populations for which there may be reticulations within the pedigrees and elevated haplotype sharing. We present a simple, rapid algorithm which initially uses only high-confidence first-degree relationships to seed a machine learning step based on summary statistics of identity-by-descent (IBD) sharing. One of these statistics, our \"haplotype score\", is novel and can be used to: (1) distinguish half-sibling pairs from avuncular or grandparent-grandchildren pairs; and (2) assign individuals to ancestor versus descendant generation. We test our approach in a sample of 700 individuals from northern Namibia, sampled from an endogamous population called the Himba. Due to a culture of concurrent relationships in the Himba, there is a high proportion of half-sibships. We accurately identify first through fourth-degree relationships and distinguish between various second-degree relationships: half-sibships, avuncular pairs, and grandparent-grandchildren. We further validate our approach in a second diverse African-descent dataset, the Barbados Asthma Genetics Study (BAGS). Accurate reconstruction of pedigrees holds promise for tracing allele frequency trajectories, improved phasing and other population genomic questions.",

    "abstract": "Co-transcriptional RNA quality control is essential for gene expression. However, its regulation remains poorly understood. Here, we report that the evolutionarily conserved ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling INO80 complex promotes transcription termination by the non-coding RNA quality control pathway in S. cerevisiae. Loss of INO80 leads to accumulation of stalled RNA Polymerase II preferentially at promoter-proximal pausing sites, compromising Pol II processivity and hindering transcription elongation. We reveal that binding of RNA surveillance and non-coding transcription termination factors to promoter-proximal mRNA regions is associated with increased promoter-proximal pausing. INO80 counteracts promoter-proximal stalling of genes attenuated by the Nrd1-Nab3-Sen1 (NNS) non-coding transcription termination complex, promoting their expression. We show that INO80 interacts with Nrd1 and the Nab2 RNA surveillance factor in vivo. Absence of INO80 leads to defective transcription termination by the Nrd1-Nab3-Sen1 (NNS) complex. We demonstrate that INO80 facilitates the recruitment of Nab2 at non-coding transcription termination sites and its association with promoter-proximally terminated mRNA transcripts. Finally, we provide evidence that INO80 promotes the release of stalled RNA Polymerase II from a non-coding transcription termination site. Collectively, our work suggests that the INO80 complex regulates transcription by removal of stalled Polymerase, implicating a chromatin-based mechanism for non-coding and premature transcription termination in gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Proliferative quiescence in {beta}-cells is required to maintain functional competence. While this presents a significant hurdle in regenerative therapy for diabetes, the molecular underpinnings of this reciprocal relationship remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that TEAD1, the transcription effector of the mammalian-Hippo pathway, drives developmental stage-specific {beta}-cell proliferative capacity in conjunction with its functional maturation. TEAD1 promotes adult {beta}-cell mature identity by direct transcriptional control of a network of critical {beta}-cell transcription factors, including, Pdx1, Nkx6.1, and MafA, while its regulation of Cdkn2a maintains proliferative quiescence. Consequently, mice with either constitutive or inducible genetic deletion of TEAD1 in {beta}-cells developed overt diabetes due to a severe loss of secretory function despite induction of proliferation. Furthermore, we show that TEAD1 has a similar regulatory role in human {beta}-cells. Consistent with this function in {beta}-cells, variants in TEAD1 have been associated with c-HOMA-B in American Indians. We propose that TEAD1 is an essential intrinsic molecular switch coordinating adult {beta}-cell proliferative quiescence with mature identity and its differential modulation may be necessary to overcome the challenge of inducing proliferation with functional competence in human beta cells.",

    "abstract": "Early detection of infection with SARS-CoV-2 is key to managing the current global pandemic, as evidence shows the virus is most contagious on or before symptom onset. Here, we introduce a low-cost, high-throughput method for diagnosing and studying SARS-CoV-2 infection. Dubbed Pathogen-Oriented Low-Cost Assembly & Re-Sequencing (POLAR), this method amplifies the entirety of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. This contrasts with typical RT-PCR-based diagnostic tests, which amplify only a few loci. To achieve this goal, we combine a SARS-CoV-2 enrichment method developed by the ARTIC Network (https://artic.network/) with short-read DNA sequencing and de novo genome assembly. Using this method, we can reliably (>95% accuracy) detect SARS-CoV-2 at a concentration of 84 genome equivalents per milliliter (GE/mL). Almost all diagnostic methods currently authorized for use by the United States Food and Drug Administration with the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Emergency Use Authorization require larger concentrations of the virus to achieve this degree of accuracy. In addition, we can reliably assemble the SARS-CoV-2 genome in the sample, often with no gaps and perfect accuracy. The genotypic data contained in these genome assemblies enable the more effective analysis of disease spread than is possible with an ordinary binary diagnostic. These data can also help identify vaccine and drug targets. Finally, we show that the diagnoses obtained using POLAR of both positive and negative clinical nasopharyngeal swab samples 100% match the diagnoses obtained in a clinical diagnostic lab using the Center for Disease Controls 2019-Novel Coronavirus test. Using POLAR, a single person can manually process 192 samples over an 8- hour experiment at the cost of [~]$36 per patient (as of December 7th, 2022), enabling a 24-hour turnaround with sequencing and data analysis time. We anticipate that further testing and refinement will allow greater sensitivity in this approach.",

Furthermore, the higher inbreeding coefficient (F) values observed in the TK affected compared to unaffected individuals correlated with a larger median span of long-sized (>2.64 Mb) runs of homozygosity (ROH) regions (p-value=2.09e-18). We show that long-sized ROHs are more likely to be formed on recently configured haplotypes enriched for rare homozygous deleterious variants in the TK-affected compared to TK-unaffected individuals (p-value= 3.35e-11). Analysis of genotype-phenotype correlations reveals that genes with rare homozygous deleterious variants in long-sized ROHs provide the most comprehensive set of molecular diagnoses for the observed disease traits with a systematic quantitative analysis of HPO (Human Phenotype Ontology) terms.\n\nConclusionOur findings support the notion that novel rare variants on newly configured haplotypes arising within the recent past generations of a family or clan contribute significantly to recessive disease traits in the TK population.",

    "abstract": "Predictive models of signaling pathways have proven to be difficult to develop. Traditional approaches to developing mechanistic models rely on collecting experimental data and fitting a single model to that data. This approach works for simple systems but has proven unreliable for complex systems such as biological signaling networks. Thus, there is a need to develop new approaches to create predictive mechanistic models of complex systems. To meet this need, we developed a method for generating artificial signaling networks that were reasonably realistic and thus could be treated as ground truth models. These synthetic models could then be used to generate synthetic data for developing and testing algorithms designed to recover the underlying network topology and associated parameters. We defined the reaction degree and reaction distance to measure the topology of reaction networks, especially to consider enzymes. To determine whether our generated signaling networks displayed meaningful behavior, we compared them with signaling networks from the BioModels Database. This comparison indicated that our generated signaling networks had high topological similarities with BioModels signaling networks with respect to the reaction degree and distance distributions. In addition, our synthetic signaling networks had similar behavioral dynamics with respect to both steady states and oscillations, suggesting that our method generated synthetic signaling networks comparable with BioModels and thus could be useful for building network evaluation tools.\n\nHighlightsO_LIWe provided a Julia script to generate synthetic signaling networks.\nC_LIO_LIWe defined reaction degree and distance to measure the reaction network topology.\nC_LIO_LIWe provided the Python scripts to calculate the reaction network topology.\nC_LIO_LIThe synthetic signaling networks had topological similarities with the BioModels.\nC_LIO_LIThe synthetic signaling networks had dynamic similarities with the BioModels.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "AbstractGenotype-based approaches for the estimation of SNP-based narrow-sense heritability [Formula] have limited utility in pregnancy-related outcomes due to confounding by the shared alleles between mother and child. Here, we propose a haplotype-based approach to estimate the genetic variance attributable to three haplotypes - maternal transmitted [Formula], maternal non-transmitted [Formula] and paternal transmitted [Formula] in mother-child pairs. We show through extensive simulations that our haplotype-based approach outperforms the conventional and contemporary approaches for resolving the contribution of maternal and fetal effects, particularly when m1 and p1 have different effects in the offspring. We apply this approach to estimate the explicit and relative maternal-fetal genetic contribution to the phenotypic variance of gestational duration and gestational duration adjusted fetal size measurements at birth in 10,375 mother-child pairs. The results reveal that variance of gestational duration is mainly attributable to m1 and m2 ([Formula]= 17.3%, S. E. = 5.2%; [Formula] = 12.2%, S. E. = 5.2%; [Formula] = 0.0%, S. E. = 5.0%). In contrast, variance of fetal size measurements at birth are mainly attributable to m1 and p1 ([Formula] = 18.6 - 36.4%, [Formula] = 0.0 - 5.2% and [Formula] = 4.4 - 13.6%). Our results suggest that gestational duration and fetal size measurements are primarily genetically determined by the maternal and fetal genomes, respectively. In addition, a greater contribution of m1 as compared to m2 and p1 [Formula] to birth length and head circumference suggests a substantial influence of correlated maternal-fetal genetic effects on these traits. Our newly developed approach provides a direct and robust alternative for resolving explicit maternal and fetal genetic contributions to the phenotypic variance of pregnancy-related outcomes.",

A comprehensive point of truth of resistance conferring mutations has been missing but would be important to aid the development of antiviral drugs and in management of infections. We therefore developed HerpesDRG, a drug resistance mutation database for all the known important genes and current treatment options, built from a systematic review of available genotype to phenotype literature. The database is released along with an R package to provide a low barrier of entry to variant resistance annotation and clinical implication analysis from common sanger and NGS sequence data. This represents the first openly available and community maintainable knowledgebase of drug resistance mutations for the human herpes viruses (HHV), developed for the community of researchers and clinicians tackling HHV drug resistance.\n\nAvailabilityThe HerpesDRG database is available at github.com/ojcharles/herpesdrg-db.

    "abstract": "Efficient co-transcriptional splicing is thought to suppress genome-destabilizing R-loops. Inhibition of SF3B1, a core U2 spliceosome component, by Pladienolide B (PladB) in human K562 cells caused widespread intron retention and modest R-loops gains. Minimal overlap existed between these events, suggesting that unspliced introns by themselves do not cause excessive R-loops. R-loop gains were instead driven by extensive readthrough transcription at a subset of stress-response genes, defining a new class of aberrant \"downstream of genes\" (DoG) R-loops. Such DoG R-loops were temporally and spatially uncoupled from loci experiencing DNA damage. Unexpectedly, the predominant response to splicing inhibition was a global R-loop loss. This resulted from increased promoter-proximal pausing and defective transcription elongation associated with premature termination. Similar results were observed upon depletion of Aquarius, a U2 spliceosome-associated factor previously thought to suppress R-loops. Thus, U2 spliceosome-targeted splicing inhibition triggered profound alterations in transcriptional dynamics, leading to unexpected disruptions in R-loop landscapes.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIIntron retention caused by SF3B1 inhibition does not trigger excessive R-loops\nC_LIO_LIStress-response genes shows readthrough transcription and R-loop gains\nC_LIO_LIR-loop gains and DNA damage are temporally and spatially uncoupled\nC_LIO_LIU2 snRNP inhibition causes broad reduction in transcription and dominant R-loop loss\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Autism is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder. Functional roles of several non-coding transcripts including long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to influence the pathobiology of autism. We hypothesized that there are more autism-associated lncRNAs to be discovered. Here, we utilized a systems biology approach to identify novel lncRNAs that might play a role in the molecular pathogenesis of autism. Based on the data provided by the Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative (SFARI), a three-component regulatory network comprising mRNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs) and lncRNAs was constructed. Functional enrichment analysis was performed to identify molecular pathways potentially mediated by components of the network. The potential association of four candidate lncRNAs with autism was investigated experimentally by developing and verifying a valproic acid (VPA)-exposed mouse model of autism. We composed a network of 33 mRNA, 25 miRNA and 4 lncRNA nodes associated with neurologically-relevant pathways and functions. We then verified the differential expression of four candidate lncRNAs: Gm10033, 1500011B03Rik, A930005H10Rik and Gas5 in the brain of VPA-exposed mice. We furthermore identified a novel splice variant of Gm10033, designated as Gm10033-{Delta}Ex2, which was expressed in various mouse tissues. The integrative approach, we utilized, combines the analysis of a three-component regulatory network with experimental validation of targets in an animal model of autism. As a result of the analysis, we prioritized a set of candidate autism-associated lncRNAs. These links add to the common understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms that are involved in disease etiology, specifically in the autism.",

    "abstract": "The northern pike Esox lucius is a freshwater fish renowned for having low genetic diversity but ecological success throughout the Northern Hemisphere. Here we generate an annotated chromosome-level genome assembly of 941 Mbp in length with 25 chromosome-length scaffolds using long-reads and chromatin capture technology. We then align whole-genome resequencing data against this reference to genotype northern pike from Alaska through New Jersey (n = 47). A striking decrease in genetic diversity occurs along the sampling range, whereby samples to the west of the North American Continental Divide have substantially higher diversity than populations to the east. As an example, individuals from Interior Alaska in the west and St. Lawrence River in the east have on average 181K and 64K heterozygous SNPs per individual, respectively (i.e., a SNP variant every 3.2 kbp and 11.2 kbp, respectively). Even with such low diversity, individuals clustered with strong support within each population, and this may be related to numerous private alleles in each population. Evidence for recent population expansion was observed for a Manitoba hatchery and the St. Lawrence population (Tajimas D = -1.07 and -1.30, respectively). Non-uniform patterns of diversity were observed across the genome, with large regions showing elevated diversity in several chromosomes, including LG24. In populations with the master sex determining gene amhby still present in the genome, amhby is in LG24. As expected, amhby was largely male-specific in Alaska and the Yukon and absent southeast to these populations, but we also document some amhby(-) males in Alaska and amhby(+) males in the Columbia River. This indicates that rather than a discrete boundary after which amhby was lost in North America, there is a patchwork of presence of this system in the western region. These results support the theory that northern pike recolonized North America from refugia in Alaska and expanded following deglaciation from west to east, with probable founder effects resulting in loss of both neutral and functional diversity including the loss of the sex determination system.",

    "abstract": "Embryonic development is characterized by series of cell fate transitions, during which non-linear feedback of signaling events and network dynamics in the transcriptome are instrumental to determine differentiation outcomes. Changes in selected genes or pathways have been described extensively, but a system-level understanding of gene regulatory network regulation is still lacking. Leveraging time-series data from single-cell transcriptome profiling of developing mouse embryos, we collapsed dynamic gene expressions into changes in 14 core biological processes, and constructed an ordinary differential equation-based machine learning model of the transcriptomic network to capture its feedback structure. We evaluated the polarity and magnitude of direct pairwise causal relationships between biological processes and identified higher-order feedback loops that dominate system behavior. Despite heterogeneous expressions at the gene level, we find that the transcriptome at the macroscale level has a feedback structure that is intrinsically stable and robust. We show the pivotal role of intracellular signaling in driving systemic changes and uncover the importance of homeostatic process and establishment of localization in regulating network dynamics. Local regulatory structures represent domain-specific regulations that are essential to cell fate transition, especially lipid metabolic process. Together, this study provides a holistic picture of transcriptomic network dynamics during mouse organogenesis, offering insight into key aspects of information flow in the transcriptome that control cell fate transition.\n\nConflict of interest statementThe authors declare no potential conflicts of interest.\n\nFundingThe authors received no funding for this study.\n\nAuthor contributionsConceptualization: LX; Methodology: LX, WAS, and JDS; Data Curation: LX; Investigation: LX and WAS; Formal Analysis: LX and WAS; Visualization: WAS and LX;\n\nWriting - review & editing: LX and WAS.",

    "abstract": "While single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a popular method to analyze gene expression and cellular composition at single-cell resolution, it harbors shortcomings: The failure to account for cell-to-cell variations of transcriptome-size (i.e., the total number of transcripts per cell) and also cell dissociation/processing-induced cryptic gene expression. This is particularly a problem when analyzing highly heterogeneous solid tissues/organs, which requires cell dissociation for the analysis. As a result, there exists a discrepancy between bulk RNA-seq result and virtually reconstituted bulk RNA-seq result using its composite scRNA-seq data. To fix this problem, we propose a computationally calculated coefficient, \"cell type-specific weighting-factor (cWF)\". Here, we introduce a concept and a method of its computation and report cWFs for 76 cell-types across 10 solid organs.

    "abstract": "While single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a popular method to analyze gene expression and cellular composition at single-cell resolution, it harbors shortcomings: The failure to account for cell-to-cell variations of transcriptome-size (i.e., the total number of transcripts per cell) and also cell dissociation/processing-induced cryptic gene expression. This is particularly a problem when analyzing highly heterogeneous solid tissues/organs, which requires cell dissociation for the analysis. As a result, there exists a discrepancy between bulk RNA-seq result and virtually reconstituted bulk RNA-seq result using its composite scRNA-seq data. To fix this problem, we propose a computationally calculated coefficient, \"cell type-specific weighting-factor (cWF)\". Here, we introduce a concept and a method of its computation and report cWFs for 76 cell-types across 10 solid organs. Their fidelity is validated by more accurate reconstitution and deconvolution of bulk RNA-seq data of diverse solid organs using the scRNA-seq data and the cWFs of their composite cells. Furthermore, we also show that cWFs effectively predict aging-progression, implicating their diagnostic applications and also their association with aging mechanism.

    "abstract": "In response to excess nutrients, white adipose tissue expands by both generating new adipocytes and by upregulating lipogenesis in existing adipocytes. Here, we performed a genome-wide functional genomics screen to identify regulators of adipogenesis in the mouse 3T3-L1 preadipocyte model. The pooled screening strategy utilized FACS to isolate populations based on lipid content by gating for fluorescence intensity of the lipophilic, green fluorescent BODIPY dye. Additionally, the approach categorized if genes functioned during mitotic expansion or lipogenesis. Cellular mechanisms regulating the rate of protein translation and protein stability were found critical for adipogenesis and lipogenesis. These protein-directed mechanisms were further supported by proteomic analyses, which demonstrated that essential changes in protein abundance driving 3T3-L1 adipogenesis were not driven by transcription. We exemplify this theme by showing that the hypusination pathway, a conserved regulator of translation initiation, is critical to translate adipogenic inducers of mitotic expansion and that the neddylation/ubiquitin pathway modulates insulin sensitivity to regulate lipogenesis.",

Currently approved demethylating agents lack specificity and exhibit high toxicity. Herein we show, using the p16 gene as an example, that targeted demethylation of the promoter-exon 1-intron 1 (PrExI) region initiates an epigenetic wave of local chromatin remodeling and distal long-range interactions, culminating in gene-locus specific activation. Through development of CRISPR-DiR (DNMT1-interacting RNA), in which ad hoc edited guides block methyltransferase activity in a locus-specific fashion, we demonstrate that demethylation is coupled to epigenetic and topological changes.

    "abstract": "1The Linux shell is arguably one of the most important computational tools across various scientific disciplines. Its high flexibility makes it the platform of choice for many file operations and smaller scripting tasks. Also, many stand-alone programs are called from the Linux shell - typically followed by multiple command-line parameters. However, in larger analysis projects, keeping track of the work quickly becomes challenging, as a typical shell workflow involves the iterative execution of commands with many parameters, modification of scripts, and editing of configuration files. Too often, researchers find themselves in the uncomfortable position that a computational result generated a few weeks ago can no longer be reproduced, despite having taken great care documenting the work manually. On the other hand, there is a lack of tools able to record the researchers shell activity automatically with reasonably low runtime- and storage overhead. To close this critical gap, we developed shournal, a program that tightly integrates with the Linux shell and automatically records every shell command along with the files it reads or writes. Besides logging command- and file metadata, such as working directory, file path, and checksums, shournal can be configured to archive scripts or configuration files that are not regularly under version control via git or svn.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning can extract meaningful features from data given enough training examples. Large-scale genomic data are well suited for this class of machine learning algorithms; however, for many of these data the labels are at the level of the sample instead of at the level of the individual genomic measures. Conventional approaches to this data statically featurise and aggregate the measures separately from prediction. We propose to featurise, aggregate, and predict with a single trainable end-to-end model by turning to attention-based multiple instance learning. This allows for direct modelling of instance importance to sample-level classification in addition to trainable encoding strategies of genomic descriptions, such as mutations. We first demonstrate this approach by successfully solving synthetic tasks conventional approaches fail. Subsequently we applied the approach to somatic variants and achieved best-in-class performance when classifying tumour type or microsatellite status, while simultaneously providing an improved level of model explainability. Our results suggest that this framework could lead to biological insights and improve performance on tasks that aggregate information from sets of genomic data.",

    "abstract": "Polygenic risk scores, or PRS, are a tool to estimate individuals liabilities to a disease or trait measurement based solely on genetic information. One commonly discussed potential use is in the clinic to identify people who are at greater risk of developing a disease. In this paper, we compare three PRS models that incorporate a large number of genetic markers for coronary artery disease (CAD). In the UK Biobank, the cohort which was used at some point in the creation or validation of each score, we calculated the association between CAD, the scores, and population structure for the white British subset. After adjusting for geographic and socioeconomic factors, CAD was not associated with the first principal components of genetic diversity, which reflect fine-scale population structure. In contrast, all three scores were confounded by these genetic components, highlighting that PRS may be influenced by genetic factors not directly causal for CAD, thereby raising concerns about their biases in clinical application.Furthermore, we investigated the differences in risk stratification using four different UK Biobank assessment centers as separate cohorts, and tested how missing genetic data affected risk stratification through simulation. We show that missing data impact classification for extreme individuals for high- and low-risk, and quantiles of risk are sensitive to individual-level genotype missingness. Distributions of scores varied between assessment centers, revealing that thresholding based on quantiles can be problematic for consistency across centers and populations. Based on these results, we discuss potential avenues of improvements of PRS methodologies for usage in clinical practice.",

As the amount of data generated daily continues to increase, efficient transmission and storage has never been more critical. In this study, a novel encoding algorithm is proposed, motivated by the compression of DNA data and associated characteristics. The proposed algorithm follows a divide-and-conquer approach by scanning the whole genome, classifying subsequences based on similarity patterns, and binning similar subsequences together. The data are then compressed in each bin independently. This approach is different than the currently known approaches: entropy, dictionary, predictive, or transform based methods. Proof-of-concept performance was evaluated using a benchmark dataset with seventeen genomes ranging in size from kilobytes to gigabytes. The results showed considerable improvement in the compression of each genome, preserving several megabytes compared with state-of-art tools. Moreover, the algorithm can be applied to the compression of other data types include mainly text, numbers, images, audio, and video which are being generated daily and unprecedentedly in massive volumes.",

    "abstract": "Molecular dating is the inference of divergence time from genetic sequences. Knowing the time of appearance of a taxon sets the evolutionary context by connecting it with past ecosystems and species. Knowing the divergence times of gene lineages would provide a context to understand adaptation at the genomic level. However, molecular clock inference faces uncertainty due to the variability of the rate of substitution between species, between genes and between sites within genes. When dating speciations, per-lineage rate variability can be informed by fossil calibrations, and gene-specific rates can be either averaged out or modeled by concatenating multiple genes. By contrast when dating gene-specific events, fossil calibrations only inform about speciation nodes and concatenation does not apply to divergences other than speciations.\n\nThis study aims at benchmarking the accuracy of molecular dating applied to single gene trees, and identify how it is affected by gene tree characteristics. We analyze 5205 alignments of genes from 21 Primates in which no duplication or loss is observed. We also simulated alignments based on characteristics from Primates under a relaxed clock model, to analyze the dating accuracy. Divergence times were estimated with the bayesian program Beast2.\n\nFrom the empirical dataset, we find that the date estimates deviate more from the median age with shorter alignments, high rate heterogeneity between branches and low average rate, features that underlie the amount of dating information in alignments, hence statistical power. The smallest deviation is associated with core biological functions such as ATP binding, cellular organization and anatomical development, categories that are expected to be under strong negative selection.We then investigated the accuracy of dating with simulated alignments, by controlling the three above parameters separately. It confirmed the factors of precision, but also revealed biases when branch rates are highly heterogeneous. This suggests that in the case of the relaxed uncorrelated molecular clock, biases arise from the tree prior when calibrations are lacking and rate heterogeneity is high. Our study finally reports the scale of the gene tree features that influence the dating consistency with median ages, so that comparisons can be made with other genes and taxa. To tackle the molecular dating of events only observed in single gene trees, like deep coalescence, horizontal gene transfers and gene duplications, future models should overcome the lack of power due to limited information from single genes.",

However, statistical methods for detecting changes in large-scale chromatin organization such as topologically-associating domains (TADs) are still lacking. We proposed a new statistical method, DiffGR, for detecting differentially interacting genomic regions at the TAD level between Hi-C contact maps. We utilized the stratum-adjusted correlation coefficient to measure similarity of local TAD regions. We then developed a non-parametric approach to identify statistically significant changes of genomic interacting regions. Through simulation studies, we demonstrated that DiffGR can robustly and effectively discover differential genomic regions under various conditions. Furthermore, we successfully revealed cell type-specific changes in genomic interacting regions in both human and mouse Hi-C datasets, and illustrated that DiffGR yielded consistent and advantageous results compared with state-of-the-art differential TAD detection methods. The DiffGR R code is published under the GNU GPL [&ge;] 2 license and is publicly available at https://github.com/wmalab/DiffGR.",

The transcription factors were enriched for terms related to vision, motor neurons, homeobox, and brain, whereas the target genes and their direct interactors were enriched in terms related to autism, brain, connective tissue, trachea, prostate, skull morphology, and vision. Secondary analysis of single-cell data revealed that a subset of the identified transcription factors (CUX1, CUX2, ESRRG, FOXP1, FOXP2, MEF2C, POU6F2, PRRX1 and RORA) co-occur as marker genes in L4 glutamatergic neurons. The majority of these genes have known roles in autism and/or schizophrenia and are associated with human accelerated regions (elevated divergence in humans vs. other primates). These results support the value of gene regulation studies for the evolution of human cognitive abilities and the neuropsychiatric disorders that accompany it.",

Here, TGIRT-seq identified >9,000 different FLEXIs in human cells, including relatively abundant FLEXIs with cell-type-specific expression patterns. Analysis of published CLIP-seq datasets identified 126 RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) that bind different FLEXIs, including 53 RBPs that bind [&ge;]30 FLEXIs. These RBPs included splicing factors, transcription factors, a chromatin remodeling protein, cellular growth regulators, and proteins with cytoplasmic functions. Analysis of published datasets identified subsets of these RBPs that bind at FLEXI splice sites and impact alternative splicing or FLEXI host gene mRNA levels. Hierarchical clustering identified 6 subsets of RBPs whose binding sites were co-enriched in different subsets of FLEXIs: AGO1-4 and DICER, including but not limited to annotated agotrons and mirtron pre-miRNAs; DKC1, NOLC1, SMNDC1, and AATF (Apoptosis Antagonizing Transcription Factor), including but not limited to FLEXIs encoding snoRNAs; two sets of alternative splicing factors; and two sets that included RBPs with cytoplasmic functions (e.g., LARP4, PABPC4, METAP2, and ZNF622) together with nuclear regulatory proteins. The subsets of host genes encoding FLEXIs that bind these RBPs were enriched with non-FLEXI other short and long introns that bind the same RBPs, and TGIRT-seq of nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions from 4 cell lines showed cytoplasmic enrichment of FLEXIs with binding sites for RBPs that function in the cytoplasm. Collectively, our findings suggest that different subsets of RBPs bind FLEXIs and other introns to coordinately regulate the expression of functionally related host genes and then co-localize with stably bound FLEXIs to different intracellular locations. The cell-type specific expression of relatively abundant FLEXIs suggests utility as cellular as well as blood-based RNA biomarkers.",

This results in unique features in their multi-omics profiles. Although these unique profiles are important to understand long genes, a database that provides an integrated view and easy access to the multi-omics profiles of long genes does not exist. We leveraged the publicly accessible multi-omics data and systematically analyzed the genomic conservation, histone modifications, chromatin organization, tissue-specific transcriptome, and single cell transcriptome of 992 protein-coding genes that are longer than 200 kb in the mouse genome. We also examined the evolution history of their gene lengths in 15 species that belong to six Classes and 11 Orders. To share the multi-omics profiles of long genes, we developed a user-friendly and easy-to-use database, LongGeneDB (https://longgenedb.org), for users to search, browse, and download these profiles. LongGeneDB will be a useful data hub for the biomedical research community to understand long genes.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell sequencing (sc-Seq) experiments are producing increasingly large data sets. However, large data sets do not necessarily contain large amounts of information. Here, we formally quantify the information obtained from a sc-Seq experiment and show that it corresponds to an intuitive notion of gene expression heterogeneity. We demonstrate a natural relation between our notion of heterogeneity and that of cell type, decomposing heterogeneity into that component attributable to differential expression between cell types (inter-cluster heterogeneity) and that remaining (intra-cluster heterogeneity). We test our definition of heterogeneity as the objective function of a clustering algorithm, and show that it is a useful descriptor for gene expression patterns associated with different cell types. Thus, our definition of gene heterogeneity leads to a biologically meaningful notion of cell type, as groups of cells that are statistically equivalent with respect to their patterns of gene expression. Our measure of heterogeneity, and its decomposition into inter- and intra-cluster, is non-parametric, intrinsic, unbiased, and requires no additional assumptions about expression patterns.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveFetal regenerative wound healing is characterized by hyaluronan(HA)-rich microenvironment and fibroblasts that produce pericellular matrices(PCM) abundant in high molecular weight HA. Recent studies showed that while small wounds in fetal skin heal regeneratively, large wounds heal with fibrosis. We posit large wounds generate higher mechanical tension which alters HA metabolism in the fetal fibroblasts and lead to a pro-fibrotic phenotype.\n\nApproachC57BL/6J murine fetal (FFB; E14.5) and adult (AFB; 8wk) dermal fibroblasts were subjected to +/-10% tonic strain. Changes in PCM, HA enzymes and molecular weight, and fibrotic gene expression were measured.\n\nResultsFFB pericellular matrix reduced upon exposure to increased tension, and the HA profile shifted from high to lower molecular weight. Under static conditions, AFB had higher expression of HA synthases (HAS) 1 and 2 and degradation enzymes KIAA1199, HYAL1, and TMEM2 than FFB, suggesting more HA turnover in AFB. Tension resulted in an increase in HAS1, HAS3, KIAA1199, and HYAL2 expression and a decrease in HAS2 and TMEM2 expression in FFB. CD26, a marker associated with scar production, increased in FFB under tension, along with altered fibrotic gene expression profile and reorganized cytoskeletal f-actin and increased -SMA that resembled AFB.\n\nInnovationThis study elucidates the differences in how biomechanical tension alters HA metabolism and fibrotic phenotype of FFB vs AFB, providing further understanding of the fetal regenerative wound healing phenotype.\n\nConclusionUnderstanding the intrinsic differences in HA metabolism and fibrotic phenotype among FFB and AFB in response to wound mechanical stimuli may yield new insights to promote regenerative wound healing.",

    "abstract": "AbstractMulti-parent populations (MPPs), model organisms derived from two or more inbred founder strains, are widely used in biomedical and agricultural research. Gene expression profiling by direct RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) is commonly applied to MPPs to investigate gene expression regulation and to identify candidate genes. In genetically diverse populations, including MPPs, quantification of gene expression is improved when the RNA-Seq reads are aligned to individualized transcriptomes that incorporate known polymorphic loci. However, the process of constructing and analyzing individual genomes can be computationally demanding and error prone. We propose a new approach, genome reconstruction by RNA-Seq (GBRS), that relies on simultaneous alignment of RNA-Seq reads to founder strain transcriptomes to reconstruct the diploid genome and quantify total and allele-specific gene expression in MPPs. We demonstrate that GBRS performs as well as methods that rely on high-density genotyping arrays. When used in conjunction with other genotyping methods, GBRS provides quality control for detecting sample mix-ups or contamination.

    "abstract": "Canonically, heterochromatin formation in fission yeast and metazoans is initiated by di/trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 position by the histone methyltransferase Suv39H1/Clr4, followed by binding of Swi6/HP1 to H3-K9-me2/me3 via its chromodomain. Subsequent self-association of Swi6/HP1 on adjacent nucleosomes or a cooperative interaction between Clr4 and Swi6/HP1 leads to folded heterochromatin structure. HP1 binding to RNA is shown to facilitate its localization at and assembly of heterochromatin in metazoans. Likewise, recruitment of Swi6/HP1 to centromere depends on the RNAi pathway in fission yeast; paradoxically, Swi6/HP1 is also thought to play a role in RNA turnover. Here we provide evidence in support of RNAi-independent recruitment of Swi6. We show that, apart from the low affinity binding to RNAs through its hinge domain, as already reported, Swi6/HP1 displays a hierarchy of increasing binding affinity through its chromodomain to the siRNAs corresponding to specific dg-dh repeats and even stronger binding to the cognate siRNA-DNA hybrids than to the siRNA precursors or general RNAs. Our results support a mechanism of recruitment of Swi6, which is dependent on its specific and high affinity binding to siRNA-DNA hybrid at the dg-dh repeats. This binding, which is independent of, albeit augmented by binding to H3-K9-Me2, leads to heterochromatin formation and silencing. We suggest that the net role of Swi6 in RNA physiology may be regulated by a balance between abundance and affinity of Swi6 towards heterochromatic and euchromatic RNAs and siRNAs.",

These species are axenically culturable, cryopreservable, and can be measured noninvasively via microscopy, aided by machine learning. This system includes prokaryotic and eukaryotic producers and decomposers, and eukaryotic consumers to ensure functional redundancy. Our model system displayed both positive and negative interspecific interactions and higher-order interactions that surpassed the scope of any two-species interaction. Although complete species coexistence was not our primary objective, we identified several conditions under which at least one species from the producers, consumers, and decomposers groups, and one functionally redundant species, persisted for over six months. These conditions set the stage for detailed investigations in the future. Given its designability and experimental replicability, our model ecosystem offers a promising platform for deeper insights into both individual and ecosystem dynamics, including evolution and species interactions.",

    "abstract": "Draft genome sequences of non-bilaterian species have provided important insights into the evolution of the metazoan gene repertoire. However, there is little information about the evolution of gene clusters, genome architectures and karyotypes during animal evolution. In this regard, slowly evolving anthozoan Cnidaria, the sister group of Bilateria, are particularly informative. Here we report chromosome-level genome assemblies of two related cnidarians, the sea anemones Nematostella vectensis and Scolanthus callimorphus. We find a robust set of 15 chromosomes with a clear one-to-one correspondence between the two species. Both sea anemone genomes show remarkable chromosomal conservation with other cnidarians, several bilaterians and the sponge Ephydatia muelleri, allowing us to reconstruct ancestral cnidarian and metazoan chromosomal blocks, consisting of at least 19 and 16 ancestral linkage groups, respectively. We show that, in contrast to Bilateria, the Hox and NK clusters of investigated cnidarians are largely disintegrated, despite the presence of staggered hox/gbx expression in Nematostella. This loss of microsynteny conservation may be facilitated by shorter distances between cis-regulatory sequences and their cognate transcriptional start sites. In line with that, we find no clear evidence for topologically associated domains, suggesting fundamental differences in long-range gene regulation compared to vertebrates. These data suggest that large sets of ancestral metazoan genes have been retained in ancestral linkage groups of some extant lineages, yet, higher order gene regulation with associated 3D architecture may have evolved only after the cnidarian-bilaterian split.",

Similar to microbial taxa, individuals from the same country tend to cluster together based on their plasmid diversity. However, we found no correlation between plasmid diversity and bacterial taxonomy. Individual plasmids were often country-specific, yet most plasmid systems spanned across geographically distinct human populations, revealing cargo genes that likely respond to environmental selection. Our study introduces powerful tools to recognize and organize plasmids, uncovers their tremendous diversity and intricate ecological and evolutionary patterns in naturally occurring habitats, and demonstrates that plasmids represent a dimension of ecosystems that is not explained by microbial taxonomy alone.",

A total of 12,332 expressed genes were identified, with 227 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) detected, revealing intricate adaptive responses in gill tissues. Functional enrichment analysis highlighted DEGs associated with ion-transport regulation, bio-metabolism and detoxification (based on GO terms). The upregulation of ATP1A1, SLC26A2, and STK39 suggested a pivotal role of ion-transport regulation, emphasizing the importance of maintaining osmotic balance. In terms of bio-metabolism, ENPP6, GLS, and DMGDH exhibited significant upregulation, indicating adjustments in energy metabolism for low-salinity adaptation. Notably, the downregulation of GSTO1 and CTH raised questions about detoxification pathways, potentially reflecting adaptations or compromises in response to low salinity. Further correlation network analysis highlighted key genes like GLS, STK39, SESN1, and SARDH, revealing intricate relationships among DEGs. RT-qPCR validation confirmed the consistency of gene expression patterns with RNA-seq results. In conclusion, this study provides a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying Chinese shrimp responses to low salinity stress. The identified genes lay the groundwork for targeted interventions and strategies to enhance shrimp aquaculture system resilience amid changing salinity levels.",

Uncovering the genetic variations associated with the diversity in rice populations is the key to breed stable and high yielding rice varieties.\n\nResultsWe performed Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) on 7 rice yielding traits (grain length, grain width, grain weight, panicle length, leaf length, leaf width and leaf angle) based on a population of 183 rice landraces of Bangladesh. Our GWA studies reveal various chromosomal regions and candidate genes that are associated with different traits in Bangladeshi rice varieties. Noteworthy was the recurrent implication of chromosome 10 in all three grain shape related traits (grain length, grain width, and grain weight), indicating its pivotal role in shaping rice grain morphology. Our study also underscores the involvement of transposon gene families across these three traits. For leaf related traits, chromosome 10 was found to harbor regions that are significantly associated with leaf length and leaf width. The results of these association studies support previous findings as well as provide additional insights into the genetic diversity of rice.\n\nConclusionsThis is the first known GWAS study on various yield-related traits in the varieties of Oryza sativa available in Bangladesh - the fourth largest rice-producing country.

Using it, we obtained reliable lipidomics datasets from mutant cells without being affected by variances related to clone isolation. Through this, we found that an enzyme involved in congenital generalized lipodystrophy regulates glycerophospholipids with specific acyl-chains. We also demonstrate the possibility to dissect complex lipid co-regulatory mechanisms, explaining cell adaptations to altered lipid metabolism.

    "abstract": "Detecting epistatic drivers of human phenotypes is a considerable challenge. Traditional approaches use regression to sequentially test multiplicative interaction terms involving pairs of genetic variants. For higher-order interactions and genome-wide large-scale data, this strategy is computationally intractable. Moreover, multiplicative terms used in regression modeling may not capture the form of biological interactions. Building on the Predictability, Computability, Stability (PCS) framework, we introduce the epiTree pipeline to extract higher-order interactions from genomic data using tree-based models. The epiTree pipeline first selects a set of variants derived from tissue-specific estimates of gene expression. Next, it uses iterative random forests (iRF) to search training data for candidate Boolean interactions (pairwise and higher-order). We derive significance tests for interactions, based on a stabilized likelihood ratio test, by simulating Boolean tree-structured null (no epistasis) and alternative (epistasis) distributions on hold-out test data. Finally, our pipeline computes PCS epistasis p-values that probabilisticly quantify improvement in prediction accuracy via bootstrap sampling on the test set. We validate the epiTree pipeline in two case studies using data from the UK Biobank: predicting red hair and multiple sclerosis (MS). In the case of predicting red hair, epiTree recovers known epistatic interactions surrounding MC1R and novel interactions, representing non-linearities not captured by logistic regression models. In the case of predicting MS, a more complex phenotype than red hair, epiTree rankings prioritize novel interactions surrounding HLA-DRB1, a variant previously associated with MS in several populations. Taken together, these results highlight the potential for epiTree rankings to help reduce the design space for follow up experiments.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundLong reads have gained popularity in the analysis of metagenomics data. Therefore, we comprehensively assessed metagenomics classification tools on the species taxonomic level. We analysed kmer-based tools, mapping-based tools and two general-purpose long reads mappers. We evaluated more than 20 pipelines which use either nucleotide or protein databases and selected 13 for an extensive benchmark. We prepared seven synthetic datasets to test various scenarios, including the presence of a host, unknown species and related species. Moreover, we used available sequencing data from three well-defined mock communities, including a dataset with abundance varying from 0.0001% to 20% and six real gut microbiomes.\n\nResultsGeneral-purpose mappers Minimap2 and Ram achieved similar or better accuracy on most testing metrics than best-performing classification tools. They were up to ten times slower than the fastest kmer-based tools requiring up to four times less RAM. All tested tools were prone to report organisms not present in datasets, except CLARK-S, and they underperformed in the case of the high presence of the hosts genetic material. Tools which use a protein database performed worse than those based on a nucleotide database. Longer read lengths made classification easier, but due to the difference in read length distributions among species, the usage of only the longest reads reduced the accuracy.\n\nThe comparison of real gut microbiome datasets shows a similar abundance profiles for the same type of tools but discordance in the number of reported organisms and abundances between types. Most assessments showed the influence of database completeness on the reports.\n\nConclusionThe findings indicate that kmer-based tools are well-suited for rapid analysis of long reads data. However, when heightened accuracy is essential, off-the-shelf mappers demonstrate slightly superior performance, albeit at a considerably slower pace. Nevertheless, a combination of diverse categories of tools and databases will likely be necessary to analyse complex samples. Discrepancies observed among tools when applied to real gut datasets, as well as a reduced performance in cases where unknown species or a significant proportion of the host genome is present in the sample, highlight the need for continuous improvement of existing tools. Additionally, regular updates and curation of databases are important to ensure their effectiveness.",

We further incorporate protein embeddings and model uncertainty scoring to enhance the biological relevance and interpretability of the predicted interactions.

    "abstract": "The medicinal leech, Hirudo verbana, is a powerful model organism for investigating fundamental neurobehavioral processes. The well-documented arrangement and properties of H. verbanas nervous system allows changes at the level of specific neurons or synapses to be linked to physiological and behavioral phenomena. Juxtaposed to the extensive knowledge of H. verbanas nervous system is a limited, but recently expanding, portfolio of molecular and multi-omics tools. Together, the advancement of genetic databases for H. verbana will complement existing pharmacological and electrophysiological data by affording targeted manipulation and analysis of gene expression in neural pathways of interest. Here, we present the first draft genome assembly for H. verbana, which is approximately 250 Mbp in size and consists of 61,282 contigs. Whole genome sequencing was conducted using an Illumina sequencing platform followed by genome assembly with CLC-Bio Genomics Workbench and subsequent functional annotation. Ultimately, the diversity of organisms for which we have genomic information should parallel the availability of next generation sequencing technologies to widen the comparative approach to understand the involvement and discovery of genes in evolutionarily conserved processes. Results of this work hope to facilitate comparative studies with H. verbana and provide the foundation for future, more complete, genome assemblies of the leech.",

    "abstract": "In bacteria, post-translational acetylation of lysine residues affects the activities of numerous proteins, thus constituting an important regulatory mechanism that influences bacterial growth and adaptation to various environments. Conversely, the modification level of some lysine residues is controlled by deacetylases that remove the acetyl group. Most bacterial deacetylases are homologous to eukaryotic sirtuins, which utilize NAD+ as a cofactor. The Escherichia coli genome encodes a single sirtuin - CobB. However, both the regulation of CobB activity and the role that reversible acetylation plays in the control of protein functions and cellular pathways are not fully understood.\n\nIn this study, we demonstrate that CobB forms a stable complex with PRPP synthase Prs. PRPP synthase is responsible for providing precursor metabolite for the synthesis of certain amino acids as well as nucleotides, including the cofactor NAD+. This association stimulates the deacetylation rate by CobB and protects it from inhibition by its reaction byproduct nicotinamide. We present evidence indicating that acetylation of Prs is physiologically significant and impacts E. coli metabolism and global protein acetylation level, although it does not affect CobB binding in vitro. In turn, Prs can be deacetylated by CobB, while formation of CobB-Prs complex formation safeguards PRPP synthase activity under non-optimal conditions. We propose that formation of the complex regulates deacetylation of other protein substrates by CobB.",

    "abstract": "Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) is transforming fields like genomics, transcriptomics, and epigenetics with rapidly increasing throughput at reduced cost. This also demands overcoming performance bottlenecks in the downstream analysis of the sequencing data. A key performance bottleneck is searching for exact matches of entire or substrings of short DNA/RNA sequence queries in a long reference sequence database. This task is typically performed by using an index of the reference - such as FM-index, suffix arrays, suffix trees, hash tables, or lookup tables.\n\nIn this paper, we propose accelerating this sequence search by substituting or enhancing the indexes with machine learning based indexes - called learned indexes - and present LISA (Learned Indexes for Sequence Analysis). We evaluate LISA through a number of case studies - that cover widely used software tools; short and long reads; human, animal, and plant genome datasets; DNA and RNA sequences; various traditional indexing techniques (FM-indexes, hash tables and suffix arrays) - and demonstrate significant performance benefits in a majority of them. For example, our experiments on real datasets show that LISA achieves speedups of up to 2.2 fold and 4.7 fold over the state-of-the-art FM-index based implementations for exact sequence search modules in popular tools bowtie2 and BWA-MEM2, respectively.\n\nCode availabilityLISA-based FM-index: https://github.com/IntelLabs/Trans-Omics-Acceleration-Library/tree/master/src/LISA-FMI\n\nLISA-based hash-table: https://github.com/IntelLabs/Trans-Omics-Acceleration-Library/tree/master/src/LISA-hash\n\nLISA applied to BWA-MEM2: https://github.com/bwa-mem2/bwa-mem2/tree/bwa-mem2-lisa.",

    "abstract": "In mammals, sex chromosome dosage is compensated through X-chromosome inactivation and active-X upregulation. It is believed that during early development, X-chromosome inactivation and active X upregulation happen in a highly coordinated fashion. However, such coordination between two X-chromosomes in other developmental contexts remains unexplored. Here, we have profiled the coordination between two X-chromosomes in female cells in different developmental contexts and cell types: pre-implantation embryos, embryonic epiblast cells, iPSC reprogramming, germ cell reprogramming, B-cell, and extra-embryonic endoderm stem (XEN) cells. Interestingly, we found that two X-chromosomes in female cells are not always coordinated; instead, it happens in a lineage-specific manner. Specially, while embryonic mouse epiblast cells, iPSC undergo erasure of X-upregulation upon reactivation of the inactive X, germ cells do not. Importantly, we show that the erasure of X-upregulation in epiblast or iPSC is potentially mediated via undifferentiated embryonic transcription Factor 1 (UTF1), which is absent or lowly expressed in late germ cells and therefore, germ cells are unable to erase upregulation. Moreover, we found that partial reactivation of the inactive X is insufficient to drive the erasure of upregulation globally, nor from their counterparts on the active X in XEN and B-cells. Finally, through a phenomenological mathematical model, we show that cross-inhibition between two X-chromosomes can reproduce the dynamics of reactivation and erasure of upregulation. Altogether, our study provides insight into the coordination between two X-chromosomes in female cells in different developmental contexts and related mechanistic aspects.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=117 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/424181v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (38K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f01b7borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9c586borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@70f8eaorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e5d000_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

In this work, we introduce PyDyNo (Python Dynamic analysis of biochemical NetwOrks), a non-equilibrium reaction-flux based analysis to identify dominant reaction paths within a biochemical reaction network calibrated to experimental data. We first show, in a simplified apoptosis execution model, that Bayesian parameter optimization can yield thousands of parameter vectors with equally good fits to experimental data. Our analysis however enables us to identify the dynamic differences between these parameter sets and identify three dominant execution modes. We further demonstrate that parameter vectors from each execution mode exhibit varying sensitivity to perturbations. We then apply our methodology to JAK2/STAT5 network in colony-forming unit-erythroid (CFU-E) cells to identify its signal execution modes. Our analysis identifies a previously unrecognized mechanistic explanation for the survival responses of the CFU-E cell population that would have been impossible to deduce with traditional protein-concentration based analyses.\n\nImpact StatementGiven the mechanistic models of network-driven cellular processes and the associated parameter uncertainty, we present a framework that can identify dominant reaction paths that could in turn lead to unique signal execution modes (i.e., dominant paths of flux propagation), providing a novel statistical and mechanistic insights to explain and predict signal processing and execution.",

Here, by examining five cohorts with dietary intake data collected on different time scales, we show that the food intake profile varies substantially across individuals and over time, while the nutritional intake profile appears fairly stable. We refer to this phenomenon as  nutritional redundancy and attribute it to the nested structure of the food-nutrient network. This network enables us to quantify the level of nutritional redundancy for each diet assessment of any individual. Interestingly, this nutritional redundancy measure does not strongly correlate with any classical healthy diet scores, but its performance in predicting healthy aging shows comparable strength. Moreover, after adjusting for age, we find that a high nutritional redundancy is associated with lower risks of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Similarities in phenotypic descriptions can be indicative of shared genetics, metabolism, and stress responses, to name a few. Finding and measuring similarity across descriptions of phenotype is not straightforward, with previous successes in computation requiring a great deal of expert data curation. Natural language processing of free text descriptions of phenotype is often less resource intensive than applying expert curation. It is therefore critical to understand the performance of natural language processing techniques for organizing and analyzing biological datasets and for enabling biological discovery. For predicting similar phenotypes, a wide variety of approaches from the natural language processing domain perform as well as curation-based methods. These computational approaches also show promise both for helping curators organize and work with large datasets and for enabling researchers to explore relationships among available phenotype descriptions. Here we generate networks of phenotype similarity and share a web application for querying a dataset of associated plant genes using these text mining approaches.

    "abstract": "AbstractThe identification of chromosome number alterations is now widespread in cancer research, but three features of genomic data hinder copy number calling and downstream analyses: the purity of the tumour sample, intra-tumour heterogeneity, and the ploidy of the tumour. To assess these features, consensus methods are often utilised, though these become onerous in projects that involve thousands of genomes. To facilitate the validation of clonal and subclonal copy number variants we present CNAqc, an evolution-inspired toolset that leverages the known quantitative relationships of purity, ploidy and heterogeneity. We validate the algorithms in CNAqc using low-pass single-cell data, as well as extensive simulations. Its application is demonstrated using over 4000 whole genomes and exomes from TCGA, and PCAWG. A real world application of CNAqc in the analysis of clinical tumour samples, has been demonstrated by its incorporation into the validation of clinically accredited bioinformatics pipeline at Genomics England. Our approach is compatible with most bioinformatic pipelines and designed to augment algorithms with automated quality control procedures for data validation.",

    "abstract": "Harmful algal blooms (HABs) have significantly impacted the seafood industry along the Tasmanian east coast over the past four decades. To investigate the history of regional HABs, we applied sedimentary ancient DNA analyses (sedaDNA) to coastal sediments up to [~]9 000 years old collected inshore and offshore Maria Island, Tasmania. We used metagenomic shotgun sequencing combined with a hybridisation capture array ( HABbaits1) to target harmful dinoflagellates of the genera Alexandrium, Gymnodinium, and Noctiluca scintillans. Bioinformatic analyses were used to verify sedaDNA sequences and their presence in older layers, especially for microreticulate cyst forming species including Gymnodinium catenatum due to its important role in shellfish toxicity. Our results show that the Alexandrium genus (up to 854 and 20 reads per sample inshore and offshore, respectively, based on capture-data) has been present off eastern Tasmania within the last [~]8 307 years. For G. catenatum we detected a total of only 9 unambiguously verified reads sporadically between [~]7 638 years ago and the present in the offshore core. We recovered verified sedaDNA of the fragile, non-fossilising species N. scintillans, along with evidence of increased relative abundance from 2010, consistent with plankton surveys. This study identifies challenges regarding sedaDNA sequence validation of some species (in particular, for G. catenatum), and provides guidance for the development of tools to monitor past and present HAB species and events, and to improve future HAB event predictions.\n\nHighlightsO_LIMetagenomic sedaDNA and hybridisation capture enabled analyses of harmful dinoflagellates off Tasmania\nC_LIO_LISequence validation was used to confirm the presence of Alexandrium spp., Gymnodinium spp. and Noctiluca scintillans\nC_LIO_LIAlexandrium and Gymnodinium have been present in Tasmanian waters during the past [~]9 000 years\nC_LIO_LINoctiluca scintillans sedaDNA derived relative abundance correlates with its recorded increase since 2010\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The development of hematopoietic cell lineages is a highly complex process that is governed by a delicate interplay of various transcription factors. The expression of these factors is influenced, in part, by epigenetic signatures that define each stage of cell differentiation. In particular, the formation of B lymphocytes depends on the sequential silencing of stemness genes and the balanced expression of interdependent transcription factors, along with DNA rearrangement. We have investigated the impact that the deficiency of DIDO3, a protein involved in chromatin status readout, has on B cell differentiation within the hematopoietic compartment of mice. Our findings revealed significant impairments in the successive stages of B cell development. The absence of DIDO3 resulted in remarkable alterations in the expression of essential transcription factors and differentiation markers, which are crucial for orchestrating the differentiation process. In addition, the somatic recombination process, which is responsible for generation of antigen receptor diversity, was also adversely affected. These observations highlight the vital role of epigenetic regulation, in particular the involvement of DIDO3, in ensuring proper B cell differentiation. This study show new mechanisms underlying disruptive alterations which deepen our understanding of hematopoiesis and may potentially lead to insights that aid in the development of therapeutic interventions for disorders involving aberrant B cell development.",

    "abstract": "The genomes of mitochondria and chloroplasts contain ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes, reflecting their evolutionary ancestry as free-living bacteria prior to endosymbiosis. In microbiome studies of animals, plants, or other eukaryotic hosts, these organellar rRNAs are often amplified. If identified, they can be discarded, merely reducing sequencing depth. However, incorrectly annotated mitochondrial reads may compromise statistical analysis by distorting relative abundances of free-living microbes. We quantified this by reanalyzing 7,459 samples from seven 16S rRNA sequencing studies, including the microbiomes of 927 unique animal genera. We find that under-annotation of cryptic mitochondrial reads affects multiple of these large-scale cross-species microbiome comparisons, and can be severe in some samples. It also varies between host species, potentially biasing cross-species microbiome comparisons. We propose a straightforward solution: by supplementing existing taxonomies with diverse mitochondrial rRNA sequences, we resolve up to 97% of unique unclassified sequences in some entire studies as mitochondrial (14% averaged across all studies), without increasing false positive annotations in mitochondria-free mock communities. Overall, improved annotation decreases the proportion of unknown sequences by [&ge;]10-fold in 2,262 of 7,459 samples (30%), including representatives from 5 of 7 studies examined. While standard DADA2 analyses are severely affected, the default positive filter in Deblur run through QIIME2 discards many divergent mitochondrial sequences, preventing bias in analysis, but also making analysis of these sequences more difficult. We recommend leveraging mitochondrial sequence diversity to better identify, remove and analyze mitochondrial rRNA gene sequences in microbiome studies.",

    "abstract": "AimsIntermittent fasting (IF) reduces cardiovascular risk factors in animals and humans, and can protect the heart against ischemic injury in models of myocardial infarction, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are unknown. To delineate molecular and cellular adaptations of the heart to IF, we carried out system-wide comprehensive analyses of proteome and phosphoproteome, complemented with transcriptome profiling, followed by functional analysis.\n\nMethods and resultsIn order to understand molecular and cellular remodeling of the heart during IF, we employed advanced mass spectrometry for system-wide profiling of the proteome and phosphoproteome of heart tissues obtained from mice maintained for 6 months on either daily 12- or 16-hour fasting, every-other-day fasting or ad libitum control feeding regimens. We also performed transcriptome analyses using RNA sequencing to evaluate whether the observed molecular responses to IF occur at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional levels. IF regimens significantly affected pathways that regulate cyclic GMP signaling, lipid and amino acid metabolism, cell adhesion, cell death, and inflammation. Comparison of differentially expressed proteome and transcriptome upon IF showed the higher correlation of pathway alternation in short IF regimen but the inverse correlation of metabolic processes such as fatty acid oxidation and immune processes in longer IF regimens. In addition, functional echocardiographic analyses demonstrated that IF enhances stress-induced cardiac performance.\n\nConclusionOur systematic multi-omics study elucidates a molecular framework for understanding how IF impacts the hearts function and its vulnerability to injury and disease.\n\nTranslational perspectiveIntermittent fasting is emerging as a desirable lifestyle adaptation to impact cardiovascular health through the modulation of molecular and cellular mechanisms, and by acting on disease risk factors. Evidence from numerous studies indicates that the fasting cycles are highly and consistently effective in protecting against cardiovascular diseases and improving cardiac health in animals and human. Using multi-omics, here we dissect distinct molecular adaptations of the heart to different intermittent fasting regimens. Our results unveil novel cardioprotective mechanisms and open up new avenues for innovative pharmacological approaches to prevent and treat cardiovascular diseases.",

Epigenomic profiling assays have identified millions of putative regulatory elements, but systematically determining the function of those regulatory elements remains a substantial challenge. Here we adapt CRISPR screening by epigenetic repression to screen all 111,619 putative non-coding regulatory elements defined by open chromatin sites in human K562 leukemia cells for their role in regulating essential cellular processes and proliferation. In an initial screen containing 1,084,704 gRNAs, we implemented an analysis framework to quantify perturbation effects, and nominate 1,108 regulatory elements that strongly impact cell fitness. We tested 8,845 of the primary screen elements in a secondary screen, evaluated their cell-type specificity in a second cancer cell line, and then used a single-cell RNA-seq CRISPR screen to discover 63 connections between distal regulatory elements and target genes. This comprehensive and quantitative genome-wide map of essential gene regulatory elements presents a framework for extensive characterization of noncoding regulatory elements that drive complex cell phenotypes and for prioritizing non-coding genetic variants that may contribute to common traits and disease risk.",

In the first hierarchy, the GBVs were predicted by solving for the genomic best linear unbiased prediction for GLMM with the estimated variance components or genomic heritability in advance, and in the second hierarchy, association tests were performed using the generalized least square (GLS) method for the GBVs. Like the Hi-LMM for regular quantitative traits, the so-called Hi-GLMM method exhibited higher statistical power to detect quantitative trait nucleotides (QTNs) with better genomic control for complex population structure than existing methods, especially when the GBVs were estimated precisely and using joint association analysis for QTN candidates obtained from a test at once.

We integrate eQTLs identified in adult islets and whole pancreas samples, which reveal 1,805 eQTL associations that are unique to the fetal-like iPSC-PPCs and 1,043 eQTLs that exhibit regulatory plasticity across the fetal-like and adult pancreas tissues. Colocalization with GWAS risk loci for pancreatic diseases and traits show that some putative causal regulatory variants are active only in the fetal-like iPSC-PPCs and likely influence disease by modulating expression of disease-associated genes in early development, while others with regulatory plasticity likely exert their effects in both the fetal and adult pancreas by modulating expression of different disease genes in the two developmental stages.",

Yet the mechanisms by which specific TFs and RBPs function together in context-specific ways to drive precise co-transcriptional splicing at each of thousands of genomic loci remains unknown. Therefore, we have used sex-specific splicing in Drosophila as a model to understand how the function of TFs and RBPs is coordinated to transcribe and process specific RNA transcripts at the correct genomic locations. We show widespread sex-specific transcript diversity occurs much earlier than previously thought and present a new pipeline called time2splice to quantify splicing changes over time. We define several mechanisms by which the essential and functionally-conserved CLAMP TF functions with specific RBPs to precisely regulate co-transcriptional splicing: 1) CLAMP links the DNA of gene bodies of sex-specifically spliced genes directly to the RNA of target genes and physically interacts with snRNA and protein components of the splicing machinery; 2) In males, CLAMP regulates the distribution of the highly conserved RBP Maleless (MLE) (RNA Helicase A) to prevent aberrant sex-specific splicing; 3) In females, CLAMP modulates alternative splicing by directly binding to target DNA and RNA and indirectly through regulating the splicing of sex lethal, the master regulator of sex determination. Overall, we provide new insight into how TFs function specifically with RBPs to drive alternative splicing.",

    "abstract": "The intracellular endosymbiotic proteobacteria Wolbachia have evolved across the phyla nematoda and arthropoda. In Wolbachia phylogeny, supergroup F is the only clade known so far with members from both arthropod and filarial nematode hosts and therefore can provide unique insights into their evolution and biology. In this study, 4 new supergroup F Wolbachia genomes have been assembled using a metagenomic assembly and binning approach, wMoz and wMpe from the human filarial parasites Mansonella ozzardi and Mansonella perstans, and wOcae and wMoviF from the blue mason bee Osmia caerulescens and the sheep ked Melophagus ovinus respectively. A comprehensive phylogenomic analysis revealed two independent origins of filarial Wolbachia in supergroup F, most likely from ancestral arthropod hosts. The analysis also reveals that the switch from arthropod to filarial host is accompanied by a convergent pseudogenization and loss of the bacterioferritin gene, a phenomenon found to be shared by all filarial Wolbachia, even those outside supergroup F. These observations indicate that differences in heme metabolism might be a key feature distinguishing filarial and arthropod Wolbachia. The new genomes provide a valuable resource for further studies on symbiosis, evolution, and the discovery of new antibiotics to treat mansonellosis.\n\nSignificance statementWolbachia are bacterial endosymbionts of medically important parasitic filarial nematodes and arthropods. The evolutionary history and biological roles of Wolbachia in these different hosts are not well understood. The supergroup F in Wolbachia phylogeny harbors members from both filarial and arthropod hosts, providing an unparalleled opportunity for genomic comparisons to uncover distinguishing characteristics. This study provides new genomes from filarial and arthropod Wolbachia from this unique supergroup. Their phylogenomic analysis reveals multiple, independent transfers of Wolbachia from arthropod to filariae. Remarkably, these transfers were associated with a convergent loss of the bacterioferritin gene, a key regulator of heme metabolism. Heme supplementation is considered a critical component of Wolbachia - filaria symbiosis. We demonstrate bacterioferritin loss is a novel feature exclusive to filarial Wolbachia.",

    "abstract": "How virulent parasites are maintained in nature is an important paradigm of eukaryotic pathogenesis. Here we used population genetics and molecular methods to study the evolution and emergence of genetic variants of the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii, referred collectively as Type X (HG12), recovered from a threatened marine mammal species. Specifically, 53 T. gondii strains were isolated from southern sea otters (SSO) that stranded between 1998-2004 with T. gondii infection (ranging from chronic incidental infections to fatal encephalitis). Over 74% of these SSO, collected throughout their geographic range, were infected with Type X, based on multi-locus PCR-DNA sequencing. Depending on the locus investigated, Type X strains possessed one of three allelic types that had independently assorted across the strains examined; either genetically distinct alleles, referred to as \"{psi}\" or \"8\", or a Type II allele. Phylogenetic incongruence among locus-specific trees, genome-wide CGH array and WGS analyses confirmed that Type X is a sexual clade of natural recombinants that resemble F1 progeny from a genetic cross between Type II and a mosaic of two distinct \"{psi}\" or \"{delta}\" ancestries. A single Type X genotype (19/53; 36%) that largely caused subclinical chronic infections in SSO, was highly pathogenic to mice (LD100= 1 parasite). To determine whether murine virulence genes could be mapped within this population of natural isolates, we performed a genome scan and identified four QTLs with LOD scores greater than 4.0. Targeted disruption of ROP33, the strongest candidate from among 16 genes within the highest QTL on Chromosome VIIa established ROP33 as a murine virulence locus. The ability of this highly pathogenic mouse-virulent T. gondii clone to expand its environmental niche and infect a majority of SSO supports a virulence shift model whereby generalist pathogens like T. gondii utilize their sexual cycles to produce new strains that possess an expanded biological potential. Such a trait enables pathogens to extend their host range or be naturally selected within their vast intermediate host range to maximize transmission. Our work establishes a rationale for how virulent strains can be maintained cryptically in nature across a pathogens broad host range, and act as potential reservoirs for epidemic disease.\n\nImportanceWaterborne outbreaks of protozoal parasites are capable of causing fatal disease in a wide range of animals, including humans. Population expansion of felids in addition to anthropogenic changes near marine estuarine environments may facilitate marine wildlife exposure to highly infectious Toxoplasma gondii oocysts shed in felid feces. Infected cats shed millions of environmentally-resistant T. gondii oocysts that can be widely dispersed by storm events. In North America T. gondii is thought to possess a highly clonal population structure dominated by 4 clonal lineages (I, II, III, and X). Population genetic analysis of 53 T. gondii isolates collected longitudinally from SSO infected with T. gondii that stranded between 1998-2004 identified 74% of otters infected with Type X T. gondii, and that Type X is not a clonal lineage, but rather a recombinant clade of at least 12 distinct strains consistent with a recent genetic cross. Importantly, one Type X haplotype was isolated from 36% of southern sea otters (Enhydra lutris neries) across their geographic range in California. This haplotype was highly pathogenic to mice but caused relatively benign infections in SSO. A genome scan was performed to identify a virulence locus; a secreted serine threonine kinase (ROP33) that enhanced pathogenicity in laboratory mice, but not sea otters. Our data support a virulence shift model whereby generalist pathogens like T. gondii utilize their sexual cycles to produce virulent strains that can be maintained cryptically in nature, according to their differential capacity to cause disease within the pathogens broad intermediate host range. This type of \"host selection\" has important public health implications. Strains capable of causing fatal infections can persist in nature by circulating as chronic infections in resistant intermediate host species that act as reservoirs for epidemic disease.",

While DM1 affects multiple systems, recent studies highlight its link to liver pathology, glucose intolerance, and drug sensitivity. Our study focused on liver implications by creating a hepatocyte-specific DM1 mouse model. Expression of toxic RNA in hepatocytes sequestered muscleblind-like (MBNL) proteins, impacting hepatocellular activity. DM1-induced liver alterations included morphological changes, inflammation, necrosis, and fatty accumulation. Impaired drug metabolism and clearance were evident in DM1 mice and increased susceptibility to diet-induced fatty liver disease. Notably, alternative splicing of acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 induced excessive lipid accumulation in DM1 livers, exacerbated by high-fat, high-sugar diets. These findings unveil disruptions in hepatic functions, predisposing DM1 livers to injury, fatty liver disease, and compromised drug clearance. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for addressing the complex health challenges in DM1 patients and optimizing treatment strategies.",

Here we use a series of genetic tests in Drosophila to explore the relative contribution of the pleiotropic cytokine Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) in Myc-mediated cell competition (also known as Myc super-competition or Myc cell competition). We find that the sole Drosophila TNF, Eiger (Egr), its receptor Grindelwald (Grnd/TNFR), and the adaptor proteins Traf4 and Traf6 are required to eliminate wild-type \"loser\" cells during Myc cell competition. Although typically the interaction between Egr and Grnd leads to cell death by activating the Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) stress signaling pathway, our experiments reveal that many components of canonical JNK signaling are dispensable for cell death in Myc cell competition, including the JNKKK Tak1, the JNKK Hemipterous (Hep) and the JNK Basket (BSK). Our results suggest that Egr/Grnd signaling participates in Myc cell competition, but functions in a role that is independent of JNK activation.",

Linear clustering of genes in a single BP is one strategy for their transcriptional coregulation. However, whether such gene clustering also plays a role in transcriptional coherence of several disparate BPs remains unexplored. Here, by analyzing the genomes of eukaryotes ranging from yeast to human, we report the identification of thousands of conserved and species-specific disparate clustered BP pairs, many of which in normal human tissues are transcriptionally correlated. Strikingly, our results reveal that often this system-level transcriptional coordination is achieved in part by the genic proximity of regulatory nodes of disparate BPs whose coregulation drives the transcriptional coherence of their respective pathways. This, we hypothesize, is one strategy for creating coregulated, tunable modulons in eukaryotes.",

The accumulation of genomic data has resolved the tree of life to a great extent, yet timing evolutionary events remains challenging if not impossible without external information such as fossil ages and morphological characters. Methods for incorporating morphology in tree estimation have lagged behind their molecular counter-parts, especially in the case of continuous characters. Despite recent advances, such tools are still direly needed as we approach the limits of what molecules can teach us. Here, we implement a suite of state-of-the-art methods for leveraging continuous morphology in phylogenetics, and by conducting extensive simulation studies we thoroughly validate and explore our methods properties. While retaining model generality and scalability, we make it possible to estimate absolute and relative divergence times from multiple continuous characters while accounting for uncertainty. We compile and analyze one of the most data-type diverse data sets to date, comprised of contemporaneous and ancient molecular sequences, and discrete and continuous characters from living and extinct Carnivora taxa.

We have developed an objective, integrated, and automated approach to personalized food and supplement recommendations that is powered by artificial intelligence and individualized molecular data from the gut microbiome, the human host, and their interactions. The process starts with a clinically validated transcriptomic analysis of a persons stool (and some cases also blood) sample, from which the following molecular data are computed using clinically validated bioinformatics: 1. Quantitative strain-level taxonomic classification of all microorganisms, 2. Gene expression level for microbial genes, 3. Gene expression level for all human genes.

We describe an application of our precision nutrition technology platform to human populations with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), depression, anxiety, and type 2 diabetes (T2D). In these pilot interventional studies, our precision nutrition program achieved significant improvements in clinical outcomes of IBS (39% for severe IBS), depression (31% for severe depression), anxiety (31% for severe anxiety), and the risk score for T2D (>30% reduction relative to the control arm).

    "abstract": "Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a gene expression profiling technique that is presently revolutionizing the study of complex cellular systems in the biological sciences. Existing scRNA-seq methods suffer from sub-optimal target recovery leading to inaccurate measurements including many false negatives. The resulting  zero-inflated data may confound data interpretation and visualization. Since cells have coherent phenotypes defined by conserved molecular circuitries (i.e. multiple gene products working together) and since similar cells utilize similar circuits, information about each expression value or  node in a multi-cell, multi-gene scRNA-seq data set is expected to also be predictable from other nodes in the data set. Based on this logic, several approaches have been proposed to impute missing values in a data set by extracting information from its non-zero measurements. In this study, we apply non-negative matrix factorization to a selection of published scRNA-seq data sets followed by multiplication of the factor matrices to generate idealized  completed model versions of the data. From the model matrices, we recommend new values where original measurements are likely to be inaccurate and where  zero measurements are predicted to be false negatives. The resulting imputed data model predicts novel type markers and expression patterns that match orthogonal measurements and field literature better than those obtained from pre-imputation data or alternative imputation strategies.\n\nContactbenjamin.spike@hci.utah.edu\n\nAvailability and implementationFIESTA is written in R and is available at https://github.com/elnazmirzaei/FIESTA and https://github.com/TheSpikeLab/FIESTA.\n\nAuthor summaryIn this work, we develop FIESTA, a novel, unsupervised, mathematical approach to impute missing values in scRNA-seq data. For each dataset, we use parts-based, non-negative matrix factorization to break the cells-by-genes expression matrix into optimized component matrices and then multiply these component matrices to generate an idealized,  completed matrix. The completed matrix has many of the null values filled in because the optimized low rank factors from which it is generated, take multiple cells into account when estimating a particular component, including some cells with positive expression values for genes which are false negatives in other related cells. We also implement scaling and thresholding approaches based on intrinsic data topology for improved interpretability and graphical representation. Overall, FIESTA performs favorably relative to alternative imputation approaches and uncovers gene-gene and gene-cell relationships that are occluded in the raw data. The FIESTA computational pipeline is freely available for download and use by other researchers analyzing scRNA-seq data or other sparse data sets.",

The fixation-free method identifies chromatin interactions at the NPCs in intact nuclei from cells and tissues.

This problem becomes even more serious in the context of cell signaling studies that are specifically designed to quantify heterogeneity in single-cell gene regulation, where important RNA and protein copy numbers are themselves subject to the inherently random fluctuations of biochemical reactions. It is not clear how measurement noise should be managed in addition to other experiment design variables (e.g., sampling size, measurement times, or perturbation levels) to ensure that collected data will provide useful insights on signaling or gene expression mechanisms of interest. To address these fundamental single-cell analysis and experiment design challenges, we propose a computational framework that takes explicit consideration of measurement errors to analyze single-cell observations and Fisher Information Matrix-based criteria to decide between experiments. Using simulations and single-cell experiments for a reporter gene controlled by an HIV promoter construct, we demonstrate how our approach can analyze and redesign experiments to optimally harvest fluctuation information while mitigating the effects of image distortion.",

    "abstract": "In the study of single cell RNA-seq data, a key component of the analysis is to identify sub-populations of cells in the data. A variety of approaches to this have been considered, and although many machine learning based methods have been developed, these rarely give an estimate of uncertainty in the cluster assignment. To allow for this probabilistic models have been developed, but single cell RNA-seq data exhibit a phenomenon known as dropout, whereby a large proportion of the observed read counts are zero. This poses challenges in developing probabilistic models that appropriately model the data. We develop a novel Dirichlet process mixture model which employs both a mixture at the cell level to model multiple populations of cells, and a zero-inflated negative binomial mixture of counts at the transcript level. By taking a Bayesian approach we are able to model the expression of genes within clusters, and to quantify uncertainty in cluster assignments. It is shown that this approach out-performs previous approaches that applied multinomial distributions to model single cell RNA-seq counts and negative binomial models that do not take into account zero-inflation. Applied to a publicly available data set of single cell RNA-seq counts of multiple cell types from the mouse cortex and hippocampus, we demonstrate how our approach can be used to distinguish sub-populations of cells as clusters in the data, and to identify gene sets that are indicative of membership of a sub-population.

Various competing null models have been proposed to serve as baselines against which to compare the effect of drug combinations. In this work, we introduce Correlated Drug Action (CDA), a baseline model for the study of drug combinations in both cell cultures and in patient populations. CDA assumes that the efficacy of pairs of drugs to be used in a combination may be correlated, that is, if the efficacy of a drug in a given patient or cell is high (low), then the efficacy of the other drug may also be high (low) in the same patient or cell. Our model can be used in the temporal domain (temporal CDA or tCDA) to explain survival curves in patient populations, and in the dose domain (dose CDA or dCDA), to explain dose-response curves in cell cultures. At the level of clinical trials, we demonstrate tCDAs utility in identifying possibly synergistic combinations and cases where the combination can be explained in terms of the monotherapies. At the level of cells in culture, dCDA generalizes null models such as Bliss independence, the Highest Single Agent model, the dose equivalence principle, and is consistent with what should be expected in sham combinations. We demonstrate the applicability of dCDA in assessing combinations in experimental MCF7 cell-line data by introducing a new metric, the Excess over CDA (EOCDA).",

    "abstract": "Live cell imaging provides unparallel insights into dynamic cellular processes across spatiotemporal scales. Despite its potential, the inherent spatiotemporal heterogeneity within live cell imaging data often obscures critical mechanical details underlying cellular dynamics. Uncovering fine-grained phenotypes of live cell dynamics is pivotal for precise understandings of the heterogeneity of physiological and pathological processes. However, this endeavor introduces formidable technical challenges to unsupervised machine learning, demanding the extraction of features that can faithfully preserve heterogeneity, effectively discriminate between different molecularly perturbed states, and provide interpretability. While deep learning shows promise in extracting useful features from large datasets, it often falls short in producing such high-fidelity features, especially in unsupervised learning settings. To tackle these challenges, we present DeepHACX (Deep phenotyping of Heterogeneous Activities of Cellular dynamics with eXplanations), a self-training deep learning framework designed for fine-grained and interpretable phenotyping. This framework seamlessly integrates an unsupervised teacher model with interpretable features to facilitate feature learning in a student deep neural network (DNN). Significantly, it incorporates an autoencoder-based regularizer, termed SENSER (SENSitivity-enhancing autoEncoding Regularizer), designed to prompt the student DNN to maximize the heterogeneity associated with molecular perturbations. This approach enables the acquisition of features that not only discriminate between different molecularly perturbed states but also faithfully preserve the heterogeneity linked to these perturbations. In our study, DeepHACX successfully delineated fine-grained phenotypes within the heterogeneous protrusion dynamics of migrating epithelial cells, uncovering specific responses to pharmacological perturbations. Remarkably, DeepHACX adeptly captured a minimal number of highly interpretable features uniquely linked to these fine-grained phenotypes, each corresponding to specific temporal intervals crucial for their manifestation. This unique capability positions DeepHACX as a valuable tool for investigating diverse cellular dynamics and comprehensively studying their heterogeneity.",

Furthermore, we introduce the feature-fusion HoloNet model, which extracts diffraction features associated with breast cancer cell types and their marker intensities.

    "abstract": "The modular organization of a cell which can be determined by its interaction network allows us to understand a mesh of cooperation among the functional modules. Therefore, cellular level identification of functional modules aids in understanding the functional and structural characteristics of the biological network of a cell and also assists in determining or comprehending the evolutionary signal. We develop ProFuM-Cell that performs real-time web scraping for generating clusters of the cellular level functional units of an organism. ProFuMCell constructs the Protein Locality Graphs and clusters the cellular level functional units of an organism by utilizing experimentally verified data from various online sources. Also, we develop ProModb, a database service that houses precomputed whole-cell protein-protein interaction network-based functional modules of an organism using ProFuMCell. Our web service is entirely synchronized with the KEGG pathway database and allows users to generate spatially localized protein modules for any organism belonging to the KEGG genome using its real-time web scraping characteristics. Hence, the server will host as many organisms as is maintained by the KEGG database. Our web services provide the users a comprehensive and integrated tool for an efficient browsing and extraction of the spatial locality-based protein locality graph and the functional modules constructed by gathering experimental data from several interaction databases and pathway maps. We believe that our web services will be beneficial in pharmacological research, where a novel research domain called modular pharmacology has initiated the study on the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of deadly diseases using functional modules.\n\nGraphical TOC Entry\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=111 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/446966v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (21K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@145374borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13121aeorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9a3681org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@707985_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Telomeres in the house mouse, Mus musculus, are about five times longer than human telomeres, limiting the use of this common laboratory animal for studying the contribution of telomere biology to aging and cancer. We identified a key amino acid variation in the helicase RTEL1, naturally occurring in the short-telomere mouse species M. spretus. Introducing this variation into M. musculus is sufficient to reduce the telomere length set point in the germline and generate mice with human-length telomeres. While these mice are fertile and appear healthy, the regenerative capacity of their colonic epithelium is compromised.

It remains unclear whether the genome architecture modulates the spatial distribution of caRNA and vice versa. Here, we generate a resource of genome-wide RNA-DNA and DNA-DNA contact maps in human cells. These maps reveal the chromosomal domains demarcated by locally transcribed RNA, hereafter termed RNA-defined chromosomal domains. Further, the spreading of caRNA is constrained by the boundaries of topologically associating domains (TADs), demonstrating the role of the 3D genome structure in modulating the spatial distribution of RNA. Conversely, stopping transcription or acute depletion of RNA induces thousands of chromatin loops genome-wide. Activation or suppression of the transcription of specific genes suppresses or creates chromatin loops straddling these genes. Deletion of a specific caRNA-producing genomic sequence promotes chromatin loops that straddle the interchromosomal target sequences of this caRNA. These data suggest a feedback loop where the 3D genome modulates the spatial distribution of RNA, which in turn affects the dynamic 3D genome organization.",

We find that loss of WDR-31 together with RP-2 and ELMD-1 (the sole ortholog ELMOD1-3) results in ciliary accumulations of IFT Complex B components and KIF17 kinesin, with fewer IFT/BBSome particles traveling along cilia in both anterograde and retrograde directions, suggesting that the IFT/BBSome entry into cilia and exit from cilia are impacted. Furthermore, anterograde IFT in the middle segment travel at increased speed in wdr-31;rpi-2;elmd-1.

TAD boundaries frequently coincide with genome breaks while boundary deletion is under negative selection, suggesting that TADs may facilitate genome rearrangements and evolution. We show that genes co-localise by evolutionary age in humans and mice, resulting in TADs having different proportions of younger and older genes. We observe a major transition in the age co-localisation patterns between the genes born during vertebrate whole genome duplications (WGDs) or before, and those born afterwards. We also find that genes recently duplicated in primates and rodents are more frequently essential when they are located in old-enriched TADs and interact with genes that last duplicated during the WGD. Therefore, the evolutionary relevance of recent genes may increase when located in TADs with established regulatory networks. Our data suggests that TADs could play a role in organising ancestral functions and evolutionary novelty.\n\nHighlightsO_LITADs coincide with clusters of genes that are close in their evolutionary age.\nC_LIO_LIWhole genome duplications mark a transition in gene age co-localisation clusters.\nC_LIO_LIGene age co-localisation patterns are associated with TAD insulation.\nC_LIO_LIYoung essential genes share TADs and interact with old genes.\nC_LI",

The often large, complex plant genomes make identifying TEIs from short reads difficult and expensive. Moreover, rare somatic insertions that reflect mobilome dynamics are difficult to track using short reads. To address these challenges, we combined Cas9-targeted Nanopore sequencing (CANS) with the novel pipeline NanoCasTE to trace both genetically inherited and somatic TEIs in plants. We performed CANS of the EVADE (EVD) retrotransposon in wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana and rapidly obtained up to 40x sequence coverage. Analysis of hemizygous T-DNA insertion sites and genetically inherited insertions of the EVD transposon in the ddm1 genome uncovered the crucial role of DNA methylation in shaping EVD insertion preference. We also investigated somatic transposition events of the ONSEN transposon family, finding that genes that are downregulated during heat stress are preferentially targeted by ONSENs. Finally, we detected hypomethylation of novel somatic insertions for two ONSENs. CANS and NanoCasTE are effective tools for detecting TEIs and exploring mobilome organization in plants in response to stress and in different genetic backgrounds, as well as screening T-DNA insertion mutants and transgenic plants.",

    "abstract": "RNA-Seq data analysis of non-model organisms is often difficult because of the lack of a well-annotated genome. However, in non-model organisms, contigs can be generated by de novo assembling. This can result in a large number of transcripts, making it difficult to easily remove redundancy. A large number of transcripts can also lead to difficulty in the recognition of differentially expressed transcripts (DETs) between more than two experimental conditions, because P-values must be corrected by considering multiple comparison corrections whose effect is enhanced as the number of transcripts increases. Heavily corrected P-values often fail to take sufficiently small P-values as significant. In this study, we applied a recently proposed tensor decomposition (TD)-based unsupervised feature extraction (FE) to the RNA-seq data obtained for a non-model organism, planarian Dugesia japonica; Although we used de novo assembled transcriptome reference with high redundancy, we successfully obtained a larger number of transcripts whose expression was altered between normal and defective samples as well as during time development than those identified by a conventional method. TD-based unsupervised FE is expected to be an effective tool that can identify a substantial number of DETs, even when a poorly annotated genome is available.",

Using simulations, we demonstrate that FastGxC is up to nine times more powerful and 106 times faster than existing approaches, reducing computation time from years to minutes. We applied FastGxC to bulk multi-tissue (N=698) and single-cell PBMC (N=1,218) RNA-seq datasets, generating comprehensive tissue- and cell-type-specific eQTL maps. These eQTLs exhibited up to four-fold enrichment in open chromatin regions from matched contexts and were twice as enriched as standard context-specific eQTLs, highlighting their biological relevance. Furthermore, we examined the relationship between context-specific eQTLs and complex human traits and diseases. FastGxC improved precision in identifying relevant contexts for each trait by three-fold and expanded candidate causal genes by 25% in cell types and 6% in tissues compared to standard eQTLs. In summary, FastGxC provides a powerful framework for mapping context-specific eQTLs, advancing our understanding of gene regulatory mechanisms underlying complex human traits and diseases.",

    "abstract": "Interleukin-2 (IL-2) based immunotherapy has been approved for treating certain types of cancer, as IL-2 plays a crucial role in regulating the immune system. In this study, we developed a method for predicting IL-2-inducing peptides. Our method was trained, tested, and validated on a main dataset containing 6,574 experimentally validated Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) binders, including 3,429 IL-2-inducing and 3,145 non-inducing peptides. A primary analysis of IL-2 inducing and non-inducing peptides revealed that certain residues, such as alanine and leucine, are more abundant in IL-2-inducing peptides. Initially, we developed alignment-based methods, which demonstrated high precision but limited coverage. Subsequently, we developed artificial intelligence-based models, including machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and large language models (LLM), to predict IL-2-inducing peptides. Our Extra Tree-based model, developed using dipeptide composition and peptide length, achieved a maximum AUC of 0.82. Finally, we constructed ensemble models that combined artificial intelligence and alignment-based methods. Our best ensemble model, which integrates the Extra Tree-based model with MERCI, achieved the highest AUC of 0.84 and an MCC of 0.51 on the main dataset. One limitation of the main dataset is that both IL-2-inducing and non-inducing peptides are MHC binders. To address this limitation, we created two additional datasets: Alternate Dataset 1, consisting of 3,429 IL-2-inducing peptides and 3,429 non-inducing peptides (MHC non-binders), and Alternate Dataset 2, consisting of 3,429 IL-2-inducing peptides and 3,439 non-inducing peptides (MHC binders + MHC non-binders). Our best ensemble model achieved AUCs of 0.9 and 0.8 with MCCs of 0.61 and 0.44 on Alternate Datasets 1 and 2, respectively.

    "abstract": "To understand immune activation and evasion mechanisms in cancer, one crucial step is to characterize the composition of immune and stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Deconvolution analysis based on bulk transcriptomic data has been used to estimate cell composition in TME. However, these algorithms are sub-optimal for proteomic data, which has hindered research in the rapidly growing field of proteogenomics. Moreover, with the increasing prevalence of multi-omics studies, there is an opportunity to enhance deconvolution analysis by utilizing paired proteomic and transcriptomic profiles of the same tissue samples. To bridge these gaps, we propose BayesDeBulk, a new method for estimating the immune/stromal cell composition based on bulk proteomic and gene expression data. BayesDeBulk utilizes the information of known cell-type-specific markers without requiring their absolute abundance levels as prior knowledge. We compared BayesDeBulk with existing tools on synthetic and real data examples, demonstrating its superior performance and versatility.\n\nAvailabilitySoftware available at http://www.BayesDeBulk.com/\n\nContactFor any information, please contact francesca.petralia@mssm.edu",

    "abstract": "Favored biological characteristics can evolve by a subtle path, but beneficial selection has predictable qualities to guide thought. These favored pathways are paths of \"least selection\". Faster evolution is least selection, more probable because earlier evolutionary success is simply, \"success\". A more likely path also requires least selection in the form of least selected change. Truncation selections, accepting only extreme values of a distributed quantity, produce greater change in population means. Truncation selection therefore readily offers a least selection. Assuming selection for a Normally-distributed quality, truncation is enhanced via simple dependences on increased standard deviation and higher selection threshold (consistent with some population survival). Least selection applies to both chemical and biological evolution, and can be estimated in general form, without reference to its genetics, from an underlying phenotypic distribution. Chemical truncation selection is free of the Haldane cost of natural selection; potentially yielding very rapid early evolution. Notably, a principle of least selection unifies prior examples of quick evolution. For example: the  crescendo of accurate codes leading to the Standard Genetic Code facilitates a least selection. More generally, evolutionary extinctions and radiations are events with multiple coercive thresholds; thus Earths history offers many wide-ranging truncation/least selection events.",

While many useful software tools have emerged to facilitate analysis of these data, packages can become complex and challenging to adapt to specialized needs. We therefore introduce ribofootPrinter, a suite of Python tools designed to offer an accessible and modifiable set of code for analysis of data from ribosome profiling and related types of small RNA sequencing experiments. Alignments are made to a simplified transcriptome to keep the code intuitive and multiple normalization options help facilitate interpretation of meta analysis, particularly outside coding regions. We demonstrate how mapping of short reads to the transcriptome increases the frequency of matches to multiple sites and we provide multimapper identifier files to highlight these regions. Overall, this tool has the capability to carry out sophisticated analysis while maintaining enough simplicity to make it readily understandable and adaptable.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe utility of long-read genome sequencing platforms has been shown in many fields including whole genome assembly, metagenomics, and amplicon sequencing. Less clear is the applicability of long reads to reference-guided human genomics, the foundation of genomic medicine. Here, we benchmark available platform-agnostic alignment tools on datasets from nanopore and single-molecule real-time platforms to understand their suitability in producing a genome representation.\n\nResultsFor this study, we leveraged publicly-available data from sample NA12878 generated on Oxford Nanopore and sample NA24385 on Pacific Biosciences platforms. Each tool that was benchmarked, including GraphMap2, LRA, Minimap2, NGMLR, and Winnowmap2 produced the same alignment file each time. However, the different tools widely disagreed on which reads to leave unaligned, affecting the end genome coverage and the number of discoverable breakpoints. Minimap2 and winnowmap2 were computationally lightweight enough for use at scale. No alignment from one tool independently resolved all large structural variants (10,000-100,000 basepairs) present in the Database of Genome Variants (DGV) for sample NA12878 or the truthset for NA24385.\n\nConclusionsIt should be best practice to use an analysis pipeline that generates alignments with both minimap2 and winnowmap2 as both are lightweight and yield different views of the genome. If computational resources and time are not a factor for a given case or experiment, a third representation from NGMLR will provide another view, and another chance to resolve a case. LRA, while fast, did not work on the nanopore data for our cluster, but PacBio results were promising in that those computations completed faster than Mininmap2. Graphmap2 is not an ideal tool for exploration of a whole human genome generated on a long-read sequencing platform.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe widespread application of CRISPR/Cas9 technology has yielded numerous findings in biomedical research in recent years, making it an invaluable tool for gene knockout and for high-throughput screening studies. In (low-throughput) gene knockout studies, editing efficiency is not a major concern because only a few edited clones are necessary for a successful assay. However, in large scale pooled screening studies, editing efficiency is a major concern because each sgRNA has to knockout its target gene in a large cell population in a short period of time. Therefore, a thorough understanding of the role that key factors play in determining CRISPR knockout efficiency is essential to improve the performance of pooled CRISPR screening.\n\nMethodsIn this study, cell lines with different expression levels of CAS9 were generated and used to determine gene-editing efficiency. Collections of sgRNAs targeting essential genes were used to study their depletion in the different cell line models.\n\nResultsUsing cell lines with variable expression of Cas9, we confirmed that editing efficiency and speed are mostly dependent on the sgRNA sequence and Cas9 expression, respectively. Importantly, we show that the strategy employed for delivering sgRNAs and Cas9 to cells impacts the performance of high-throughput screens, which is improved in conditions with higher Cas9 expression.\n\nConclusionsOur findings highlight the importance of optimizing Cas9 expression levels when performing gene editing experiments and provide guidance on the necessary decisions for implementing optimal pooled CRISPR screening strategies.",

    "abstract": "Genomes are pervasively transcribed, leading to stable and unstable transcripts that influence 3-dimensional genome organisation and gene regulation. High sensitivity and nucleotide resolution are required to resolve mammalian nascent transcriptomes. Here, we exploit the sensitivity of 4-thio-uridine (4sU) metabolic pulse-labelling to develop two nucleotide-resolution methods: Single-Nucleotide resolution 4sU sequencing (SNU-Seq) and size-fractionated 4sU-Seq (sf4sU-Seq). sf4sU-Seq involves gel isolation of abundant 4sU-labelled promoter proximal nascent transcripts, enabling nucleotide resolution mapping of transcription start sites and promoter proximal pauses (PPPs) on the same transcript. SNU-Seq exploits 3 end RNA-Seq, using bacterial poly(A) polymerase (bPAP) to polyadenylate the 3 ends of nascent transcripts and create oligo(dT)-primed libraries. The artificial poly(A) tail marks the precise position of polymerase on a transcription unit. SNU-Seq read levels are similar at pre-mRNAs and enhancers genome-wide and read spikes in pre-mRNA outputs map pauses, PPPs and polyadenylation sites. SNU-Seq enables discovery of thousands of unannotated regions of divergent transcription and helps define hundreds of the more than 10,000 regions of primed non-transcribed acetylated open chromatin that induce divergent nascent transcripts within 0.5h of IFN-{gamma} treatment in Hep3B cells.

    "abstract": "AbstractWe introduce a deep learning model that predicts super-resolved versions of diffraction-limited microscopy images. Our model, named Task- Assisted Generative Adversarial Network (TA-GAN), incorporates an auxiliary task (e.g. segmentation, localization) closely related to the observed biological nanostructures characterization. We evaluate how TA-GAN improves generative accuracy over unassisted methods using images acquired with different modalities such as confocal, brightfield (diffraction-limited), super-resolved stimulated emission depletion, and structured illumination microscopy. The generated synthetic resolution enhanced images show an accurate distribution of the F-actin nanostructures, replicate the nanoscale synaptic cluster morphology, allow to identify dividing S. aureus bacterial cell boundaries, and localize nanodomains in simulated images of dendritic spines. We expand the applicability of the TA-GAN to different modalities, auxiliary tasks, and online imaging assistance. Incorporated directly into the acquisition pipeline of the microscope, the TA-GAN informs the user on the nanometric content of the field of view without requiring the acquisition of a super-resolved image. This information is used to optimize the acquisition sequence, and reduce light exposure. The TA-GAN also enables the creation of domain-adapted labeled datasets requiring minimal manual annotation, and assists microscopy users by taking online decisions regarding the choice of imaging modality and regions of interest.",

We present SIRV, a method to spatially infer RNA velocities at the single-cell resolution by enriching spatial transcriptomics data with the expression of spliced and unspliced mRNA from reference scRNA-seq data. We used SIRV to infer spatial differentiation trajectories in the developing mouse brain, including the differentiation of midbrain-hindbrain boundary cells and marking the forebrain origin of the cortical hem and diencephalon cells. Our results show that SIRV reveals spatial differentiation patterns not identifiable with scRNA-seq data alone. Additionally, we applied SIRV to mouse organogenesis data and obtained robust spatial differentiation trajectories. Finally, we verified the spatial RNA velocities obtained by SIRV using 10x Visium data of the developing chicken heart and MERFISH data from human osteosarcoma cells. Altogether, SIRV allows the inference of spatial RNA velocities at the single-cell resolution to facilitate studying tissue development.",

This phosphorylation allows recruitment to the gapped DNA structure found in single-strand DNA nicks and/or gaps between Okazaki fragments (OFs) during DNA replication. T118A (alanine)-substituted PNKP-expressing cells exhibited accumulation of single-strand DNA gaps in S phase and accelerated replication fork progression. Furthermore, PNKP is involved in poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1)-dependent replication gap filling as a backup pathway in the absence of OFs ligation.

    "abstract": "To unravel the mechanism of immune activation and suppression within tumors, a critical step is to identify transcriptional signals governing cell-cell communication between tumor and immune/stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment. Central to this communication are interactions between secreted ligands and cell-surface receptors, creating a highly connected signaling network among cells. Recent advancement in in situ-omics profiling, particularly spatial transcriptomic (ST) technology, provide unique opportunities to directly characterize ligand-receptor signaling networks that powers cell-cell communication. In this paper, we propose a novel statistical method, LRnetST, to characterize the ligand-receptor interaction networks between adjacent tumor and stroma cells based on ST data. LRnetST utilizes a directed acyclic graph (DAG) model with a novel treatment to handle the zero-inflated distribution observed in the ST data. It also leverages existing ligand-receptor regulation databases as prior information, and employs a bootstrap aggregation strategy to achieve robust network estimation. Application of LRnetST to ST data of high-grade serous ovarian tumor samples revealed both common and distinct ligand-receptor regulations across different tumors. Some of these interactions were validated through a MERFISH data set of independent ovarian tumor samples. These results cast light on biological processes relating to the communication between tumor and immune/stromal cells in ovarian tumors.

Recent advancement in in situ-omics profiling, particularly spatial transcriptomic (ST) technology, provide unique opportunities to directly characterize ligand-receptor signaling networks that powers cell-cell communication. In this paper, we propose a novel statistical method, LRnetST, to characterize the ligand-receptor interaction networks between adjacent tumor and stroma cells based on ST data. LRnetST utilizes a directed acyclic graph (DAG) model with a novel treatment to handle the zero-inflated distribution observed in the ST data. It also leverages existing ligand-receptor regulation databases as prior information, and employs a bootstrap aggregation strategy to achieve robust network estimation. Application of LRnetST to ST data of high-grade serous ovarian tumor samples revealed both common and distinct ligand-receptor regulations across different tumors. Some of these interactions were validated through a MERFISH data set of independent ovarian tumor samples. These results cast light on biological processes relating to the communication between tumor and immune/stromal cells in ovarian tumors. An open-source R package of LRnetST is available on GitHub at https://github.com/jie108/LRnetST.",

    "abstract": "Intra-thymic T cell development is coordinated by the regulatory actions of SATB1 genome organizer. In this report, we show that SATB1 is involved in the regulation of transcription and splicing, both of which displayed deregulation in Satb1 knockout murine thymocytes. More importantly, we characterized a novel SATB1 protein isoform and described its distinct biophysical behavior, implicating potential functional differences compared to the commonly studied isoform. SATB1 utilized its prion-like domains to transition through liquid-like states to aggregated structures. This behavior was dependent on protein concentration as well as phosphorylation and interaction with nuclear RNA. Notably, the long SATB1 isoform was more prone to aggregate following phase separation. Thus, the tight regulation of SATB1 isoforms expression levels alongside with protein post-translational modifications, are imperative for SATB1s mode of action in T cell development. Our data indicate that deregulation of these processes may also be linked to disorders such as cancer.",

Results from TWAS analyses are often interpreted as indicating a geneticrelationship between gene expression and a phenotype, but this interpretation is not consistent with the null hypothesis that is evaluated in the traditional TWAS framework. In this study we provide a mathematical outline of this TWAS framework, and elucidate what interpretations are warrantedgiven the null hypothesis it actually tests. We then use both simulations and real data analysis to assess the implications of misinterpreting TWAS results as indicative of a genetic relationship between gene expression and the phenotype. Our simulation results show considerably inflated type 1 error rates for TWAS when interpreted this way, with 41% of significant TWAS associations detected in the real data analysis found to have insufficient statistical evidence to infer such a relationship. This demonstrates that in current implementations, TWAS cannot reliably be used to investigate genetic relationships between gene expression and a phenotype, but that local genetic correlation analysis can serve as a potential alternative.",

    "abstract": "The rational design of RNA is becoming important for rapidly developing technologies in medicine and biochemistry, spurring development of numerous RNA secondary structure design algorithms and benchmarks to evaluate their performance. However, the problem of RNA design is dependent upon the reverse problem of RNA structure prediction through \"folding engines\" that predict structure from sequence. We hypothesized that differences in RNA folding engines could impact design algorithms, and recruited an online community of RNA design experts to modify the widely-used RNA secondary structure design benchmark, Eterna100, to address unsolvability of some cases when changing the folding engine used (Vienna 1.8 updated to Vienna 2.6). We tested this new Eterna100-V2 benchmark with five RNA design algorithms, and found that while overall rankings remained similar, the performance of RNA design algorithms that depended on folding engines in their training did indeed depend on which underlying parameter set was used in training. This work demonstrates that the design \"difficulty\" of RNA structures is intrinsically linked to thermodynamic models, and suggests that future RNA design algorithms that are agnostic to thermodynamic models will result in optimal performance and development. Eterna100-V1 and Eterna100-V2 benchmarks and example solutions are freely available at https://github.com/eternagame/eterna100-benchmarking.\n\nAuthor SummaryDesigning RNA molecules that fold to a desired target structure is an algorithmic problem gathering increasing attention due to the emergence of RNA-based therapies and the need for rational design of RNAs. The Eterna100 dataset, a collection of target structures with increasing design difficulty, designed and selected by players of the crowdsourced RNA game Eterna, has been widely used to benchmark RNA design algorithms. However, these puzzles were originally developed using the now-deprecated version 1 of the ViennaRNA folding engine. In this manuscript, we introduce an updated benchmark, called the Eterna100-V2. We found that nineteen puzzles using Vienna 1 were unsolvable in Vienna 2, but that Eterna participants were able to re-design the puzzles with minimal modifications to make them solvable in Vienna 2. We confirmed that the rankings of 5 RNA design algorithms remained consistent between Eterna100-V1 and -V2. However, discrepancies in performance from algorithms that relied on thermodynamic models in their training suggest that algorithms will benefit from being agnostic to thermodynamic models as these models continue to improve.",

    "abstract": "ELT-2 is the major transcription factor required for Caenorhabditis elegans intestinal development. ELT-2 expression initiates in embryos to promote development and then persists after hatching through the larval and adult stages. Though the sites of ELT-2 binding are characterized and the transcriptional changes that result from ELT-2 depletion are known, an intestine-specific transcriptome profile spanning developmental time has been missing. We generated this dataset by performing Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) on intestine cells at distinct developmental stages. We analyzed this dataset in conjunction with previously conducted ELT-2 studies to evaluate the role of ELT-2 in directing the intestinal gene regulatory network through development. We found that only 33% of intestine-enriched genes in the embryo were direct targets of ELT-2 but that number increased to 75% by the L3 stage. This suggests additional transcription factors promote intestinal transcription especially in the embryo. Furthermore, only half of ELT-2s direct target genes were dependent on ELT-2 for their proper expression levels, and an equal proportion of those responded to elt-2 depletion with over-expression as with under-expression. That is, ELT-2 can either activate or repress direct target genes. Additionally, we observed that ELT-2 repressed its own promoter, implicating new models for its autoregulation. Together, our results illustrate that ELT-2 impacts roughly 20 - 50% of intestine-specific genes, that ELT-2 both positively and negatively controls its direct targets, and that the current model of the intestinal regulatory network is incomplete as the factors responsible for directing the expression of many intestinal genes remain unknown.",

However, NMF has a reputation as a less efficient alternative to the singular value decomposition (SVD), a standard operation that is highly optimized in most linear algebra libraries. Sparse single-cell sequencing assays, now feasible in thousands of subjects and millions of cells, generate data matrices with tens of thousands of strictly non-negative transcript abundance entries. We present an extremely fast NMF implementation made available in the RcppML (Rcpp Machine Learning library) R package that rivals the runtimes of state-of-the-art Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). NMF can now be run quickly on desktop computers to analyze sparse single-cell datasets consisting of hundreds of thousands of cells. Our method improves upon current NMF implementations by introducing a scaling diagonal to increase interpretability, guarantee consistent regularization penalties across different random initializations, and symmetry in symmetric factorizations. We use our method to show how NMF models learned on standard log-normalized count data are interpretable dimensional reductions, describe interpretable patterns of coordinated gene activities, and explain biologically relevant metadata. We believe NMF has the potential to replace PCA in most single-cell analyses, and the presented NMF implementation overcomes previous challenges with long runtime.",

    "abstract": "The tumor cell population in cancer tissue has distinct molecular characteristics and exhibits different phenotypes, thus, resulting in different subpopulations. This phenomenon is known as Intratumor Heterogeneity (ITH), a major contributor to drug resistance, poor prognosis, etc. Therefore, quantifying the levels of ITH in cancer patients is essential, and many algorithms do so in different ways, using different types of omics data. DEPTH (Deviating gene Expression Profiling Tumor Heterogeneity) is the latest algorithm that uses transcriptomic data to evaluate the ITH score. It shows promising performance, has strong similarity with six other algorithms and has an advantage over two algorithms that uses the same type of data (tITH, sITH). However, it has a major drawback since it uses expression values of all the genes ([~]20K genes) in quantifying ITH levels. We hypothesize that a subset of key genes is sufficient to quantify the ITH level. To prove our hypothesis, we developed a deep learning-based computational framework using unsupervised Concrete Autoencoder (CAE) to select a set of cancer-specific key genes that can be used to evaluate the ITH score. For the experiment, we used gene expression profile data of tumor cohorts of breast, kidney, and lung cancer from the TCGA repository. Using multi-run CAE, we selected three sets of key genes, each set related to breast, kidney, and lung tumor cohorts. For the three cancers stated and three molecular subtypes of lung cancer, we calculated the ITH level using all genes and key genes selected by CAE and performed a side-by-side comparison. We could reach similar conclusions for survival and prognostic outcomes based on ITH scores derived from all genes and the sets of key genes. Additionally, for subtypes of lung cancer, the comparative distribution of ITH scores derived from all and key genes remains similar. Based on these observations, it can be stated that a subset of key genes, instead of all genes, is sufficient for ITH quantification. Our results also showed that many key genes are prognostically significant, which can be used as possible therapeutic targets.",

However, cell type-specific contributions to epigenetic dysregulation in disease are unclear as studies have often used bulk brain tissue. Therefore, methods for the deconvolution of bulk H3K27ac profiles are critical. Here we developed the Cell type-specific Histone Acetylation Score (CHAS), a computational tool for inferring cell type-specific signatures in bulk brain H3K27ac profiles. We applied CHAS to > 300 H3K27ac ChIP-seq samples from studies of Alzheimers disease, Parkinsons disease, autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder in bulk post-mortem brain tissue. In addition to recapitulating known disease-associated shifts in cellular proportions, we identified novel cell type-specific biological insights into brain disorder associated regulatory variation. In most cases, genetic risk and epigenetic dysregulation targeted different cell types, thus suggesting independent mechanisms. For instance, Alzheimers disease genetic risk was exclusively enriched within microglia, while epigenetic dysregulation predominantly fell within oligodendrocyte-specific H3K27ac regions. In addition, reanalysis of the original datasets using CHAS enabled identification of biological pathways associated with each neurological and psychiatric disorder at cellular resolution.",

Given the strong performance of the Generalized Berk-Jones (GBJ) statistic, which effectively incorporates correlation within the test statistic, we adapted this method to the time-to-event framework using a Cox model. We then compared its performance with established methods, including the Wald test, global test, and global boost test.\n\nOur proposed method, sGBJ, shows an over-control of Type I error, leading to reduced statistical power compared to other methods in numerical studies. We further benchmarked these methods in two different real-world contexts: gliomas and breast cancer.

    "abstract": "Advances in mass spectrometry (MS) have enabled high-throughput analysis of proteomes in biological systems. The state-of-the-art MS data analysis relies on database search algorithms to quantify proteins by identifying peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs), which convert mass spectra to peptide sequences. Different database search algorithms use distinct search strategies and thus may identify unique PSMs. However, no existing approaches can aggregate all user-specified database search algorithms with a guaranteed increase in the number of identified peptides and control on the false discovery rate (FDR). To fill in this gap, we propose a statistical framework, Aggregation of Peptide Identification Results (APIR), that is universally compatible with all database search algorithms. Notably, under an FDR threshold, APIR is guaranteed to identify at least as many, if not more, peptides as individual database search algorithms do. Evaluation of APIR on a complex proteomics standard shows that APIR outpowers individual database search algorithms and empirically controls the FDR. Real data studies show that APIR can identify disease-related proteins and post-translational modifications missed by some individual database search algorithms. The APIR framework is easily extendable to aggregating discoveries made by multiple algorithms in other high-throughput biomedical data analysis, e.g., differential gene expression analysis on RNA sequencing data.

    "abstract": "A universal coordinate system that can ensemble the huge number of cells and capture their heterogeneities is of vital importance for constructing large-scale cell atlases as references for future molecular and cellular studies. Studies have shown that cells in complex organs exhibit multifaceted heterogeneities in their transcriptomic features at multiple resolutions. This nature of complexity makes it hard to design a fixed coordinate system through a combination of known features. It is desirable to build a learnable universal coordinate model that can capture major heterogeneities and serve as a controlled generative model for data argumentation. We developed UniCoord, a specially tuned joint-VAE model to represent single-cell transcriptomic data in a lower-dimensional latent space with high interpretability. Each latent dimension can represent either discrete or continuous feature, and either supervised by prior knowledge or unsupervised. The original transcriptomic profiles can be regenerated from the latent dimensions. The latent dimensions can be easily reconfigured to generate transcriptomic profiles of pseudo cells with desired properties. UniCoord can also be used as a pre-trained model to analyze new data with unseen cell types and thus can serve as a feasible framework for cell annotation and comparison. UniCoord provides a prototype for a learnable universal coordinate framework to enable better analysis and generation of cells with highly orchestrated functions and heterogeneities.",

    "abstract": "Upstream ORFs (uORFs) are common regulatory elements in the 5 untranslated regions of eukaryotic mRNAs. In addition to repressing main ORF translation, uORF translation in animals also reduces mRNA stability through nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). In contrast, the roles of uORFs in plants are less understood. Here, we identified actively translated uORFs (TuORFs) in Arabidopsis through ribosome profiling and systematically examined their roles in gene expression. Like animal systems, Arabidopsis TuORFs are associated with 38%, 14%, and 43% reductions in translation efficiency, mRNA half-lives, and protein levels, respectively. However, we found TuORF-containing mRNAs have 51% higher transcript levels, and this phenomenon is persistent in diverse tissues and developmental stages across plants. We present multiple lines of evidence that indicate Arabidopsis uORF-containing mRNAs generally exhibit distinct behavior from known NMD targets. First, TuORF-containing mRNAs are not increased in NMD mutants. Second, TuORF-containing mRNAs and known NMD targets have distinct expression patterns, and they are translationally repressed via different mechanisms. Finally, TuORF- containing mRNAs and NMD targets are degraded through separate pathways. Our results suggest that Arabidopsis TuORFs reduce mRNA stability and translation through mechanisms different from NMD and highlight a fundamental difference in gene regulation mediated by TuORFs in plants and animals.",

    "abstract": "Phenotype transition takes place in many biological processes such as differentiation and reprogramming. A fundamental question is how cells coordinate switching of expressions of clusters of genes. Through analyzing single cell RNA sequencing data in the framework of transition path theory, we studied how such a genome-wide expression program switching proceeds in five different cell transition processes. For each process we reconstructed a reaction coordinate describing the transition progression, and inferred the gene regulation network (GRN) along the reaction coordinate. In all processes we observed common pattern that the overall effective number and strength of regulation between different communities increase first and then decrease. The change accompanies with similar change of the GRN frustration, defined as overall conflict between the regulation received by genes and their expression states, and GRN heterogeneity. While studies suggest that biological networks are modularized to contain perturbation effects locally, our analyses reveal a general principle that during a cell phenotypic transition, intercommunity interactions increase to concertedly coordinate global gene expression reprogramming, and canalize to specific cell phenotype as Waddington visioned.",

    "abstract": "The insertion of fusion proteins has enabled the crystallization of a wide range of G-protein-coupled receptors. Here, we adapted this engineering strategy to cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). We inserted the soluble protein AmpC {beta}-lactamase into the third intracellular loop (ICL3) of ultra-thermostable {beta}1-adrenoceptor ({beta}1AR) via chimeric helix fusions. Biochemical and biophysical characterization showed that the resulting fusion protein after expression, solubilization and purification was monodisperse and able to bind the known {beta}1AR weak partial agonist cyanopindolol, and the antagonist propranolol. The protein particles comprised sufficient mass and discernable structural features to elucidate its cryo-EM structure in complex with cyanopindolol without any natural (G-proteins, arrestins) or artificial (Nanobodies, DARPins) binding partners, to an overall resolution of 4.2 [A]. The seven-helix architecture and helix eight, as well as both GPCR - AmpC {beta}-lactamase connections are clearly resolved. {beta}1AR is in its inactive conformation. 3D variability analysis revealed significant flexibility between the two protein domains and within the GPCR helices, offering insights into conformational dynamics. The map contains clear density for the cyanopindolol. The fusion protein geometry theoretically fits a wide range of class A GPCRs, presenting a powerful platform for structure elucidation of a diverse array of class A GPCR - ligand complexes by cryo-EM in the inactive receptor state. The approach furthermore holds potential for structure elucidation of GPCRs in the absence of ligands.",

    "abstract": "Protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) inhibition is efficacious in treating conditions ranging from cancer to fibrosis but can be limited by endothelial cell dysfunction. In trials of protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) a broad range of vascular effects is observed, inducing clinically detrimental endothelial cell apoptosis, impaired barrier function, or improved pulmonary vascular resistance in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). We hypothesize this range of effects is due to subsets of PTKs either impairing or promoting endothelial homeostasis by modulating Bone Morphogenetic Protein receptor 2 (BMPR2) signaling, a pathway essential for vascular development and dysfunctional in PAH. In a high-throughput siRNA screen we find SRC-Family B PTKs activate whereas SRC-Family A PTKs suppress BMPR2 signaling, measured by the transcription factor inhibitor of differentiation 1 (Id1). Induced loss of function of the strongest ID1 activating PTK LCK (a Src-B kinase) in human pulmonary artery endothelial cells suppresses BMPR2 signaling and induces multiple measures of endothelial dysfunction. However, loss of function of the strongest ID1 inhibitor PTK FYN (a Src- A kinase) does the opposite. Whole-genome transcriptional analysis identifies two multi-gene signatures inversely regulated by LCK and FYN we term \"endothelial\" and \"inflammatory\". To find TKIs mimicking selective Src-A and Src-B inhibition, we use Connectivity map to identify drugs connecting to the endothelial and inflammatory signatures. We find several TKIs: a pro-inflammatory (Regorafanib), a BMPR2 potentiating (Brivanib), and a BMPR2 suppressing (Quizartinib). Here we show a dichotomy in pathway regulation by Src- A and -B kinases that may have utility in transcriptionally based drug discovery.",

One variant, rs11556924-T, has been found to lower the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) and blood pressure but increases carotid intima-media thickness (IMT).\n\nObjectiveThis study aimed to determine how ZC3HC1 affects IMT using in vitro and in vivo models.\n\nWe analyzed the effect of the rs11556924-T allele on ZC3HC1 expression in vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) from 151 multi-ethnic heart transplant donors. The results showed that rs11556924-T was associated with lower ZC3HC1 expression and faster SMC migration. ZC3HC1 knockdown (KD) experiments supported these findings, showing increased migration and proliferation. Mechanistically ZC3HC1 KD led to decreased expression of contractile marker genes and the accumulation of cyclin B1, a key cell cycle protein. Pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes between ZC3HC1 KD and controls SMCs showed decreased expression of genes in the cell division and cytoskeleton organization pathways, as well as higher expression of genes involved in extracellular matrix organization and cytokine-mediated signaling.\n\nTo validate these findings in vivo, we generated and characterized knockout (Zc3hc1-/-) mice. These mice had enhanced neointima formation in response to arterial injury and faster SMCs migration ability. However, complete loss of Zc3hc1 led to a significant reduction in SMC proliferation and lower cyclin B1 protein level. In addition, immunostaining and confocal microscopy demonstrated, for the first time, that ZC3HC1 and Cyclin B1 were located at the cleavage furrow during mitotic progression of SMCs.\n\nConclusionsCollectively, our study suggests that lower ZC3HC1/NIPA level leads to increased SMC migration and neointima formation. Moreover, we proposed a biphasic role of NIPA in proliferation. Lower levels of NIPA promote SMC proliferation, while complete loss of NIPA hampers cell division and abrogates proliferation.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies have yielded transformative clinical success for patients with blood tumors, but their full potential remains to be unleashed against solid tumors. One challenge is finding selective targets: cell surface proteins that are expressed widely by cancer cells and minimally by healthy cells in the tumor microenvironment and other normal tissues.\n\nMETHODS: Analyzing pan-cancer patient tumor single cell transcriptomics data, we first define and quantify selectivity and safety scores of existing CAR targets for indications in which they are in clinical trials or approved. Selectivity scores are computed by the ability of a given surfaceome gene to classify tumor from nontumor cells in the tumor microenvironment. Safety scores are computed by mining healthy tissue transcriptomics and proteomics atlas data. Second, we identify new candidate cell surface CAR targets that have better selectivity and safety scores than the leading targets among those currently being tested, in an indication-specific manner.\n\nRESULTS: Remarkably, in almost all cancer types, we cannot find such better targets, testifying to the overall near optimality of the current target space. However, in HPV-negative head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC), for which there is currently a dearth of existing CAR targets, we find five new targets that have both superior selectivity and safety scores. Among the HNSC new targets, we find a few that additionally are strongly essentiality in HNSC cell lines.",

    "abstract": "Identifying causal variants from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) is challenging due to widespread linkage disequilibrium (LD) and the possible existence of multiple causal variants in the same genomic locus. Functional annotations of the genome may help to prioritize variants that are biologically relevant and thus improve fine-mapping of GWAS results. Classical fine-mapping methods conducting an exhaustive search of variant-level causal configurations have a high computational cost, especially when the underlying genetic architecture and LD patterns are complex. SuSiE provided an iterative Bayesian stepwise selection algorithm for efficient fine-mapping. In this work, we build connections between SuSiE and a paired mean field variational inference algorithm through the implementation of a sparse projection, and propose effective strategies for estimating hyperparameters and summarizing posterior probabilities. Moreover, we incorporate functional annotations into fine-mapping by jointly estimating enrichment weights to derive functionally-informed priors. We evaluate the performance of SparsePro through extensive simulations using resources from the UK Biobank. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, SparsePro achieved improved power for fine-mapping with reduced computation time. We demonstrate the utility of SparsePro through fine-mapping of five functional biomarkers of clinically relevant phenotypes.

    "abstract": "Identifying causal variants from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) is challenging due to widespread linkage disequilibrium (LD) and the possible existence of multiple causal variants in the same genomic locus. Functional annotations of the genome may help to prioritize variants that are biologically relevant and thus improve fine-mapping of GWAS results. Classical fine-mapping methods conducting an exhaustive search of variant-level causal configurations have a high computational cost, especially when the underlying genetic architecture and LD patterns are complex. SuSiE provided an iterative Bayesian stepwise selection algorithm for efficient fine-mapping. In this work, we build connections between SuSiE and a paired mean field variational inference algorithm through the implementation of a sparse projection, and propose effective strategies for estimating hyperparameters and summarizing posterior probabilities. Moreover, we incorporate functional annotations into fine-mapping by jointly estimating enrichment weights to derive functionally-informed priors. We evaluate the performance of SparsePro through extensive simulations using resources from the UK Biobank. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, SparsePro achieved improved power for fine-mapping with reduced computation time. We demonstrate the utility of SparsePro through fine-mapping of five functional biomarkers of clinically relevant phenotypes. In summary, we have developed an efficient fine-mapping method for integrating summary statistics and functional annotations.

    "abstract": "The International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC) systematically produces and phenotypes mouse lines with presumptive null mutations to provide insight into gene function. The IMPC now uses the programmable RNA-guided nuclease Cas9 for its increased capacity and flexibility to efficiently generate null alleles in the C57BL/6N strain. In addition to being a valuable novel and accessible research resource, the production of 3,313 knockout mouse lines using comparable protocols provides a rich dataset to analyze experimental and biological variables affecting in vivo gene engineering with Cas9. Mouse line production has two critical steps - generation of founders with the desired allele and germline transmission (GLT) of that allele from founders to offspring. A systematic evaluation of the variables impacting success rates identified gene essentiality as the primary factor influencing successful production of null alleles. Collectively, our findings provide best practice recommendations for using Cas9 to generate alleles in mouse essential genes, many of which are orthologs of genes linked to human disease.",

Whole-organoid lineage tracing has revealed the number of progeny arising from each initial stem cell to be highly diverse, with lineage sizes ranging from one to more than 20,000 cells. This exceeds what can be explained by existing stochastic models of corticogenesis, indicating the existence of an additional source of stochasticity. We propose an explanation in terms of the SAN model in which this additional source of stochasticity is the survival time of a lineage within a long-lived population of symmetrically dividing cells under neutral competition. We demonstrate that this model explains the experimentally observed variability of lineage sizes and we derive a formula that captures the quantitative relationship between survival time and lineage size. Finally, we show that our model implies the existence of a regulatory mechanism to keeps the size of the symmetrically dividing cell population constant.",

    "abstract": "MotivationIn time-critical clinical settings, such as precision medicine, genomic data needs to be processed as fast as possible to arrive at data-informed treatment decisions in a timely fashion. While sequencing throughput has dramatically increased over the past decade, bioinformatics analysis throughput has not, and consequently has now turned into the primary bottleneck. Modern computational hardware are capable of much higher performance than current genomic informatics algorithms can typically utilize, therefore presenting opportunities for significant improvement of performance. Accessing the raw sequencing data from BAM files, for example, is a necessary and time-consuming step in nearly all sequence analysis tools, however existing programming libraries for BAM access do not take full advantage of the parallel input/output capabilities of storage devices.\n\nResultsIn an effort to stimulate the development of a new generation of faster sequence analysis tools, We developed quickBAM, a software library to accelerate sequencing data access by exploiting the parallelism in commodity storage hardware currently widely available. We demonstrate that analysis software ported to quickBAM consistently outperforms their current versions, in some cases finishing an analysis in under 4 minutes while the original version took 1.5 hours, using the same storage solution.\n\nAvailability and ImplementationOpen source and freely available at https://gitlab.com/yiq/quickbam/, we envision that quickBAM will enable a new generation of high performance informatics tools, either directly boosting their performance if they are currently dataaccess bottlenecked, or allow data-access to keep up with further optimizations in algorithms and compute techniques.\n\nContactyi.qiao@genetics.utah.edu.",

    "abstract": "Time-lapse imaging is a powerful approach to gain insight into the dynamic responses of cells, but the quantitative analysis of morphological changes over time remains challenging. Here, we exploit the concept of \"trajectory embedding\" to analyze cellular behavior using morphological feature trajectory histories--that is, multiple time points simultaneously, rather than the more common practice of examining morphological feature time courses in single timepoint (snapshot) morphological features. We apply this approach to analyze live-cell images of MCF10A mammary epithelial cells after treatment with a panel of microenvironmental perturbagens that strongly modulate cell motility, morphology, and cell cycle behavior. Our morphodynamical trajectory embedding analysis constructs a shared cell state landscape revealing ligand-specific regulation of cell state transitions and enables quantitative and descriptive models of single-cell trajectories. Additionally, we show that incorporation of trajectories into single-cell morphological analysis enables (i) systematic characterization of cell state trajectories, (ii) better separation of phenotypes, and (iii) more descriptive models of ligand-induced differences as compared to snapshot-based analysis. This morphodynamical trajectory embedding is broadly applicable to the quantitative analysis of cell responses via live-cell imaging across many biological and biomedical applications.",

    "abstract": "Fine-mapping causal variants from GWAS loci is challenging in populations with substantial relatedness, such as livestock, as standard methods often assume unrelatedness, leading to poor fine-mapping accuracy. Here, we introduce a comprehensive Bayesian framework to address this. Our approach features BFMAP-SSS for individual-level data, which uses a linear mixed model (LMM) and shotgun stochastic search with simulated annealing. For summary statistics, we develop FINEMAP-adj and SuSiE-adj, novel strategies that directly use standard FINEMAP and SuSiE for samples of related individuals by employing LMM-derived inputs (particularly a relatedness-adjusted linkage disequilibrium matrix). Furthermore, gene-level posterior inclusion probability (PIPgene) is proposed to enhance detection power by aggregating variant signals. Extensive simulations based on pig genotypes show our methods substantially outperform existing tools (FINEMAP, SuSiE, FINEMAP-inf, SuSiE-inf, and GCTA-COJO) in samples of related individuals, achieving notable improvements in fine-mapping accuracy (e.g., up to several-fold increases in AUPRC). PIPgene markedly improves candidate gene identification. Application to Duroc pig traits demonstrates practical utility. This work provides robust, validated methods and associated software and scripts for accurate fine-mapping in populations with complex relatedness.",

Patients with depression who have experienced adverse life events tend to be treatment refractory. However, the mechanism by which stress during childhood and adolescence are involved in the pathophysiology of PPD remains unclear. We investigated the longitudinal effects of adolescent stress on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and behaviors in the postpartum period through mouse and human studies. We observed that adolescent social isolation caused an aberrantly sustained elevation of glucocorticoids via dysregulation of the HPA axis, leading to long-lasting postpartum behavioral changes in female mice. The postpartum behavioral changes elicited by this adolescent stress were not ameliorated by the medicines currently used for PPD treatment. However, a post-delivery treatment with a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist effectively ameliorated the behavioral changes in mice. We also demonstrated a significant impact of stress during childhood and adolescence on the HPA axis dysregulation and PPD in women. We provide experimental evidence that suggests a mechanism-driven therapeutic strategy (repurposing a GR antagonist) for at least some cases of treatment refractory PPD.",

    "abstract": "The clustering of single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data enables the classification of cell types, and the development of integration mapping algorithms has enabled the tracing of altered-from-baseline transcriptomes to their respective cell type origins. Here, we developed an algorithm that removes sources of noise from scRNA-seq reference dataset, and in the next step optimizes weight-assignment to anchors, cumulatively improving the accuracy of query cells mapping to reference dataset. The denoising step of our algorithm also improved the performance of other mapping algorithms. To further demonstrate biological relevance, using our algorithm we determined the type-origin of the 17% of injured retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) that a prior algorithm did not identify. As we found that most of the originally unassigned cells belonged to only some RGC types, a consequent change in the proportions of the surviving types resulted in an amended ranking of resiliency to injury. We also identified new cluster-markers for RGC types, validated two novel markers by immunostaining in retinas, and developed a website for cluster-by-cluster comparison of gene expression between uninjured and injured RGC types. Additional bioinformatic analyses contributed new insights into the global characteristics of RGC types and how axonal injury affects them, showing how dissimilarity between transcriptomes of RGC types increases during maturation and after injury. We further characterized the correspondence between the neonatal and adult RGC types, and showed which cluster markers change expression developmentally or after injury. We also show, for the first time, that global properties of the transcriptome can predict the resilience to injury of at least some cell types. The R-package, CellTools, for the algorithms we developed, will assist scRNA-seq studies across biological fields.",

    "abstract": "MotivationThe genome-wide chromosome conformation capture assay Hi-C is widely used to study chromatin 3D structures and their functional implications. Read counts from Hi-C indicate the strength of chromatin contact between each pair of genomic loci. These read counts are heteroskedastic: that is, a difference between the interaction frequency of 0 and 100 is much more significant than a difference between the interaction frequency of 1000 and 1100. This property impedes visualization and downstream analysis because it violates the Gaussian variable assumption of many computational tools. Thus heuristic transformations aimed at stabilizing the variance of signals like the shifted-log transformation are typically applied to data before its visualization and inputting to models with Gaussian assumption. However, such heuristic transformations cannot fully stabilize the variance because of their restrictive assumptions about the mean-variance relationship in the data.\n\nResultsHere we present VSS-Hi-C, a data-driven variance stabilization method for Hi-C data. We show that VSS-Hi-C signals have a unit variance improving visualization of Hi-C, for example in heatmap contact maps. VSS-Hi-C signals also improve the performance of subcompartment callers relying on Gaussian observations. VSS-Hi-C is implemented as an R package and can be used for variance stabilization of different genomic and epigenomic data types with two replicates available.\n\nAvailabilityhttps://github.com/nedashokraneh/vssHiC\n\nContactmaxwl@sfu.ca",

The concomitant ANCOR-H2A.Z interaction is essential for the cells to initiate duplication of their genetic heritage.

    "abstract": "The integrity of DNA is put at risk by different lesions, among which double strand breaks (DSBs) occur at low frequency, yet remain one of the most life-threatening harms. The study of DSB repair requests tools provoking their accumulation, and include the use of chemical genotoxins, ionizing radiations or the expression of sequence-specific nucleases. While genotoxins and irradiation allow for dose-dependent studies, nuclease expression permits assessments at precise locations. In this work, we have exploited the repetitiveness of the Ty transposon elements in the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the cutting activity of the RNA-guided Cas9 nuclease to create a tool that combines sequence specificity and dose-dependency. In particular, we can achieve the controlled induction of 0, 1, 15 or 59 DSBs in cells with an otherwise identical genetic background. We make the first application of this tool to better understand the behavior of the apical kinase of the DNA damage response Tel1 in the nuclear space. We found that Tel1 is capable of forming nuclear foci, which are clustered by condensing when DSBs occur in Ty elements. In striking contrast with other DSB-related protein foci, Tel1 foci are in tight contact with the nuclear periphery, therefore suggesting a role for the nuclear membrane in their congregation.",

    "abstract": "SUMMARY STATEMENTThis work shows how a C. elegans transcription factor controls remodeling of the apical extracellular matrix during development and in which tissues it acts.\n\nABSTRACTNematode molting is a remarkable process where animals must repeatedly build a new apical extracellular matrix (aECM) beneath a previously built aECM that is subsequently shed. The nuclear hormone receptor NHR-23/NR1F1 is an important regulator of C. elegans molting. NHR-23 expression oscillates in the epidermal epithelium, and soma-specific NHR-23 depletion causes severe developmental delay and death. Tissue-specific RNAi suggests that nhr-23 acts primarily in seam and hypodermal cells. NHR-23 coordinates the expression of factors involved in molting, lipid transport/metabolism, and remodeling of the aECM. NHR-23 depletion causes dampened expression of a nas-37 promoter reporter and a loss of reporter oscillation. The cuticle collagen ROL-6 and zona pellucida protein NOAH-1 display aberrant annular localization and severe disorganization over the seam cells following NHR-23 depletion, while the expression of the adult-specific cuticle collagen BLI-1 is diminished and frequently found in patches. Consistent with these localization defects, the cuticle barrier is severely compromised when NHR-23 is depleted. Together, this work provides insight into how NHR-23 acts in the seam and hypodermal cells to coordinate aECM regeneration during development.",

    "abstract": "Sequence classification reduces the complexity of metagenomes and facilitates a fundamental understanding of the structure and function of microbial communities. Binary metagenomic classifiers offer an insufficient solution because environmental metagenomes are typically derived from multiple sequence sources, including prokaryotes, eukaryotes and the viruses of both. Here we introduce a deep-learning based (as opposed to alignment-based) sequence classifier, DeepMicroClass, that classifies metagenomic contigs into five sequence classes, i.e., viruses infecting prokaryotic or eukaryotic hosts, eukaryotic or prokaryotic chromosomes, and prokaryotic plasmids. At different sequence lengths, DeepMicroClass achieved area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) scores >0.98 for most sequence classes, with the exception of distinguishing plasmids from prokaryotic chromosomes (AUC scores{approx} 0.97). By benchmarking on 20 designed datasets with variable sequence class composition, we showed that DeepMicroClass obtained average accuracy scores of [~]0.99, [~]0.97, and [~]0.99 for eukaryotic, plasmid and viral contig classification, respectively, which were significantly higher than the other state-of-the-art individual predictors. Using a 1-300 {micro}m daily time-series metagenomic dataset sampled from coastal Southern California as a case study, we showed that metagenomic read proportions recruited by eukaryotic contigs could be doubled with DeepMicroClasss classification compared to the counterparts of other alignment-based classifiers. With its inclusive modeling and unprecedented performance, we expect DeepMicroClass will be a useful addition to the toolbox of microbial ecologists, and will promote metagenomic studies of under-appreciated sequence types.",

    "abstract": "Phylogenetic trees are an important tool for interpreting sequenced genomes, and their interrelationships. Estimating the date associated with each node of such a phylogeny creates a \"time tree\", which can be especially useful for visualising and analysing evolution of organisms such as viruses. Several tools have been developed for time-tree estimation, but the sequencing explosion in response to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has created phylogenies so large as to prevent the application of these previous approaches to full datasets. Here we introduce Chronumental, a tool that can rapidly infer time trees from phylogenies featuring large numbers of nodes. Chronumental uses stochastic gradient descent to identify lengths of time for tree branches which maximise the evidence lower bound under a probabilistic model, implemented in a framework which can be compiled into XLA for rapid computation. We show that Chronumental scales to phylogenies featuring millions of nodes, with chronological predictions made in minutes, and is able to accurately predict the dates of nodes for which it is not provided with metadata.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe majority of high-throughput single-cell molecular profiling methods quantify RNA expression; however, recent multimodal profiling methods add simultaneous measurement of genomic, proteomic, epigenetic, and/or spatial information on the same cells. The development of new statistical and computational methods in Bioconductor for such data will be facilitated by easy availability of landmark datasets using standard data classes.\n\nResultsWe collected, processed, and packaged publicly available landmark datasets from important single-cell multimodal protocols, including CITE-Seq, ECCITE-Seq, SCoPE2, scNMT, 10X Multiome, seqFISH, and G&T. We integrate data modalities via the MultiAssayExperiment Bioconductor class, document and re-distribute datasets as the SingleCellMultiModal package in Bioconductors Cloud-based ExperimentHub. The result is single-command actualization of landmark datasets from seven single-cell multimodal data generation technologies, without need for further data processing or wrangling in order to analyze and develop methods within Bioconductors ecosystem of hundreds of packages for single-cell and multimodal data.\n\nConclusionsWe provide two examples of integrative analyses that are greatly simplified by SingleCellMultiModal. The package will facilitate development of bioinformatic and statistical methods in Bioconductor to meet the challenges of integrating molecular layers and analyzing phenotypic outputs including cell differentiation, activity, and disease.\n\nAuthor SummaryExperimental data packages that provide landmark datasets have historically played an important role in the development of new statistical methods in Bioconductor by lowering the barrier of access to relevant data, providing a common testing ground for software development and benchmarking, and encouraging interoperability around common data structures. In this manuscript, we review major classes of technologies for collecting multimodal data including genomics, transcriptomics, epigenetics, proteomics, and spatial information at the level of single cells. We present the SingleCellMultiModal R/Bioconductor package that provides single-command access to landmark datasets from seven different technologies, storing datasets using HDF5 and sparse arrays for memory efficiency and integrating data modalities via the MultiAssayExperiment class.

    "abstract": "Cancer cells exhibit rewired transcriptional regulatory networks that promote tumor growth and survival. However, the mechanisms underlying the formation of these pathological networks remain poorly understood. Through a pan-cancer epigenomic analysis, we found that primate-specific endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are a rich source of enhancers displaying cancer-specific activity. In colorectal cancer and other epithelial tumors, oncogenic AP1/MAPK signaling drives the activation of enhancers derived from the primate-specific ERV family LTR10. Functional studies in colorectal cancer cells revealed that LTR10 elements regulate tumor-specific expression of multiple genes associated with tumorigenesis, such as ATG12 and XRCC4. Within the human population, individual LTR10 elements exhibit germline and somatic structural variation resulting from a highly mutable internal tandem repeat region, which affects AP1 binding activity. Our findings reveal that ERV-derived enhancers contribute to transcriptional dysregulation in response to oncogenic signaling and shape the evolution of cancer-specific regulatory networks.",

    "abstract": "Dietary adaptation involves evolving an efficient system to digest food available in an ecosystem. The diet of archaic humans is traditionally reconstructed by isotopic analyses of human remains combined with the faunal assemblages found on the sites, and, recently, from metagenomic analyses of dental calculus. Here, we propose a new computational approach to find the genetic basis for human dietary adaptation. We searched 15 genomes from Neandertal, Denisovan and Early Sapiens for food digestion genes that tend to have more or fewer copies than the modern human reference genome. We identify 50 genes, including 10 gene clusters, with discernible copy number variation (CNV) trends at the population level, from an analysis of the full set of 20,000 human genes. The genomic variation of 19 of these genes shows how metabolic pathways for carbohydrates, lipids, liver lipids and brown fat in archaic humans adapted to metabolize food from animal or plant sources. The remaining 31 genes are all highly expressed in tissues of the digestive apparatus and are involved in immune response, environmental response and obesity. Analysis of the CNV profiles, compared to 64 modern human individuals belonging to distinct ethnic groups in Eurasia, Africa, Oceania, suggests that Homo sapiens may have had an evolutionary advantage compared to Neandertal and Denisovan in adapting to cold and temperate ecosystems.\n\nSignificance StatementUnderstanding dietary strategies and foraging behaviors of past populations are among the goals of paleoanthropological and prehistoric studies. Based on a new computational approach, we seek for the genetic basis for human dietary adaptation. Gene copy number variation (CNV) is a major type of structural genome variation that we used as indicator of efficient metabolic processes for food digestion. By analysing billions of short sequences from 15 archaic human genomes and 64 modern human ones, across the full set of 20,000 human genes, we identify 50 genes whose population-wide discernable CNV trends point to lipid metabolism as being crucial for Neandertal, the efficiency in carbohydrate metabolism for Sapiens diet, and the importance of lipid metabolism and brown fat metabolism for both Neandertal and early Sapiens compared to modern humans.\n\nPreprint availability: an early version, where the CNV analysis of ancient genomes was conducted on the human reference genome hg19, was deposited on BioRxiv on November 2, 2021 (DOI: 10.1101/2021.10.30.466563). The current version, which utilises CNV estimates based on the human reference genome hg38 and includes comparisons with modern human populations, was deposited in BioRxiv in November 2024.",

    "abstract": "Connectomics--the study of brain networks--provides a unique and valuable opportunity to study the brain. Research in human connectomics, leveraging functional and diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), is a resource-intensive practice. Typical analysis routines require significant computational capabilities and subject matter expertise. Establishing a pipeline that is low-resource, easy to use, and off-the-shelf (can be applied across multifarious datasets without parameter tuning to reliably estimate plausible connectomes), would significantly lower the barrier to entry into connectomics, thereby democratizing the field by empowering a more diverse and inclusive community of connectomists. We therefore introduce  MRI to Graphs (m2g). To illustrate its properties, we used m2g to process MRI data from 35 different studies ({approx} 6,000 scans) from 15 sites without any manual intervention or parameter tuning. Every single scan yielded an estimated connectome that adhered to established properties, such as stronger ipsilateral than contralateral connections in structural connectomes, and stronger homotopic than heterotopic correlations in functional connectomes. Moreover, the connectomes estimated by m2g are more similar within individuals than between them, suggesting that m2g preserves biological variability. m2g is portable, and can run on a single CPU with 16 GB of RAM in less than a couple hours, or be deployed on the cloud using its docker container.

    "abstract": "Meta-analysis poses a challenge when original study results have been expressed in a non-uniform manner, such as when regression results from some original studies were based on a log-transformed key independent variable while in others no transformation was used. Methods of re-expressing regression coefficients to generate comparable results across studies regardless of data transformation have recently been developed. We examined the relative bias of three re-expression methods using simulations and 15 real data examples where the independent variable had a skewed distribution.\n\nRegression coefficients from models with log-transformed independent variables were re-expressed as though they were based on an untransformed variable. We compared the re-expressed coefficients to those from a model fit to the untransformed variable. In the simulated and real data, all three reexpression methods usually gave biased results, and the skewness of the independent variable predicted the amount of bias. Meta-analyses stratified by whether the key independent variable was log-transformed and synthesis of the stratified results without meta-analysis appear to be preferable to use of the re-expression methods examined.",

    "abstract": "Drug-induced gene expression profiles can identify potential mechanisms of toxicity. We focused on obtaining signatures for cardiotoxicity of FDA-approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes. Using bulk transcriptomics profiles, we applied singular value decomposition to identify drug-selective patterns in cell lines obtained from multiple healthy human subjects. Cellular pathways affected by highly cardiotoxic TKIs include energy metabolism, contractile, and extracellular matrix dynamics. Projecting these pathways to single cell expression profiles indicates that TKI responses can be evoked in both cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts. Whole genome sequences of the cell lines, using outlier responses enabled us to correctly reidentify a genomic variant associated with anthracycline cardiotoxicity and predict genomic variants potentially associated with TKI cardiotoxicity. We conclude that mRNA expression profiles when integrated with publicly available genomic, pathway, and single cell transcriptomic datasets, provide multiscale predictive understanding of cardiotoxicity for drug development and patient stratification.\n\nOne sentence summaryGenes, pathways, and cell types of the human heart associated with antineoplastic drug cardiotoxicity.",

    "abstract": "Differential abundance analysis is an essential and commonly used tool to characterize the difference between microbial communities. However, identifying differentially abundant microbes remains a challenging problem because the observed microbiome data is inherently compositional, excessive sparse, and distorted by experimental bias. Besides these major challenges, the results of differential abundance analysis also depend largely on the choice of analysis unit, adding another practical complexity to this already complicated problem. In this work, we introduce a new differential abundance test called the MsRDB test, which embeds the sequences into a metric space and integrates a multi-scale adaptive strategy for utilizing spatial structure to identify differentially abundant microbes. Compared with existing methods, the MsRDB test can detect differentially abundant microbes at the finest resolution offered by data and provide adequate detection power while being robust to zero counts, compositional effect, and experimental bias in the microbial compositional data set. Applications to both simulated and real microbial compositional data sets demonstrate the usefulness of the MsRDB test.",

As a result, we identified single DEGs and gained insights into the mechanisms involved in the response to cold stress in young rubber trees.\n\nConclusionsOur findings may represent the species genetic stress responses developed during the course of evolution, since the examined varieties were genotypes selected during the early years of rubber tree domestication. Understanding the cold response mechanisms in H. brasiliensis could improve breeding strategies for this crop, which has a narrow genetic base, is being impacted by climate change and is the only source for large-scale rubber production.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in PKD1 (encoding polycystin-1) or PKD2 (encoding polycystin-2) gene cause autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), however high levels of polycystins are detected in renal tissues of ADPKD patients. Animal studies showed that loss and gain of function of polycystins are both pathogenic and can induce cystic phenotype in the kidney, which are associated with enhanced renal fibrosis. Recent studies showed that increased expression of polycystins contributes to organ fibrosis. However, the role of polycystins in renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that polycystin-1 or polycystin-2 was highly expressed in the kidney of two different fibrotic mouse models and positively correlated with expression of collagen-I. Pharmaceutical inhibition of polycystin-2 with triptolide or genetic knockout of polycystin-2 reduced the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers and deposition of extracellular matrix proteins in fibrotic kidneys. Similarly, conditional knockout of Pkd1 gene also attenuated renal fibrosis in mouse models. Thus, we further hypothesized that inhibition of polycystins delays cyst growth by mitigating renal fibrosis. Here, we showed that polycystin-1 or polycystin-2 was up-regulated in Pkd2 or Pkd1 mice respectively and tightly correlated with the growth of renal cysts and fibrosis development. Genetic deletion of both polycystin-1 and polycystin-2 retarded cyst growth in Pkd1 or Pkd2 mice. Finally, we deleted pkd1 gene in a fibrosis triggered adult ADPKD mouse model at different time point before or after the fibrotic injury. We showed that early and long-term inactivation of Pkd1 delayed fibrosis triggered renal cyst growth in adult Pkd1 mice as compared with mice with late and short-term inactivation of Pkd1 gene. We conclude that tubular obstruction induced polycystin up-regulation is pro-fibrotic and accelerates cyst growth through enhancing renal interstitial fibrosis in ADPKD mice. Our study indicates that ADPKD is caused by both loss and gain function of polycystins. Reduction of the aberrant upregulation of polycystins in cystic kidneys is a therapeutic option for ADPKD patients.\n\nResearch highlightsO_LIPolycystin1 and polycystin-2 are up-regulated in fibrotic kidneys\nC_LIO_LIInhibition or deletion of polycystins inhibits EMT and attenuates renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis\nC_LIO_LIUpregulation of polycystin1 or polycystin-2 is positively correlated with fibrosis progression and renal cyst growth in ADPKD mice\nC_LIO_LIDouble knockout of Pkd1 and Pkd2 gene inhibits renal cyst growth in ADPKD mice\nC_LIO_LILong-term deletion of Pkd1 gene delayed fibrosis triggered renal cyst growth in ADPKD mice\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Oncogenic FGFR4 signalling represents a potential therapeutic target in various cancer types, including triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, resistance to FGFR4 single-agent therapy remains a major challenge, emphasizing the need for effective combinatorial treatments. Our study sought to develop a comprehensive computational model of FGFR4 signalling and provide network-level insights into resistance mechanisms driven by signalling dynamics. Our integrated approach, combining computational network modelling with experimental validation, uncovered potent AKT reactivation following FGFR4 targeting in the TNBC cell line MDA-MB-453. By systematically simulating the model to analyse the effects of co-targeting specific network nodes, we were able to predict, and subsequently confirm through experimental validation, the strong synergy of co-targeting FGFR4 and AKT or specific ErbB kinases, but not PI3K. Incorporating protein expression data from hundreds of cancer cell lines, we then adapted our model to diverse cellular contexts. This revealed that while AKT rebound is common, it is not a general phenomenon. ERK reactivation, for example, occurs in certain cell types, including the FGFR4-driven HCC cell line Hep3B, where there is a synergistic effect of co-targeting FGFR4 and MEK, but not AKT. In summary, our study offers key insights into drug-induced network remodelling and the role of protein expression heterogeneity in targeted therapy responses. We underscore the utility of computational network modelling for designing cell type-selective combination therapies and enhancing precision cancer treatment.\n\nSignificanceThis study underscores the potential of computational predictive modelling in deciphering mechanisms of cancer cell resistance to targeted therapies and in designing more effective, cancer type-specific combination treatments.",

    "abstract": "An emerging hallmark across human diseases - such as cancer, autoimmune and neurodegenerative disorders - is the aberrant transcription of typically silenced repetitive elements. Once active, a subset of repeats may be capable of \"viral mimicry\": the display of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that can, in principle, bind pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) of the innate immune system and trigger inflammation. Yet how to quantify the landscape of viral mimicry and how it is shaped by natural selection remains a critical gap in our understanding of both genome evolution and the immunological basis of disease. We propose a theoretical framework to quantify selective forces on virus-like features as the entropic cost a sequence pays to hold a non-self PAMP and show our approach can predict classes of viral-mimicry within the human genome and across eukaryotes. We quantify the breadth and conservation of viral mimicry across multiple species for the first time and integrate selective forces into predictive evolutionary models. We show HSATII and intact LINE-1 (L1) are under selection to maintain CpG motifs, and specific Alu families likewise maintain the proximal presence of inverted copies to form double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). We validate our approach by predicting high CpG L1 ligands of L1 proteins and the innate receptor ZCCHC3, and dsRNA present both intracellularly and as MDA5 ligands. We conclude viral mimicry is a general evolutionary mechanism whereby genomes co-opt pathogen-associated features generated by prone repetitive sequences, likely offering an advantage as a quality control system against transcriptional dysregulation.",

    "abstract": "Genetically encoded DNA recorders noninvasively convert transient biological events into durable mutations in a cells genome, allowing for the later reconstruction of cellular experiences using high-throughput DNA sequencing1. Existing DNA recorders have achieved high-information recording2-15, durable recording3,5-10,13,15-19, multiplexed recording of several cellular signals5-8,19,20, and temporally resolved signal recording5-8,19,20, but not all at the same time in mammalian cells. We present a DNA recorder called peCHYRON (prime editing21 Cell HistorY Recording by Ordered iNsertion) that does. In peCHYRON, mammalian cells are engineered to express prime editor and a collection of prime editing guide RNAs21 (pegRNAs) that facilitate iterative rounds of prime editing. In each round of editing, prime editor inserts a variable triplet DNA sequence alongside a constant propagator sequence that deactivates the previous and activates the next step of insertion. Editing can continue indefinitely because each insertion adds the complete sequence needed to initiate the next step. Because only one active target site is present at any given time, insertions accumulate sequentially, in a unidirectional order. Thus, temporal information is preserved in the order of insertions. Durability is achieved through the use of a prime editor that only nicks a single DNA strand, effectively avoiding deletion mutations that could otherwise corrupt the information stored at the recording locus. High-information content is established by co-expressing a variety of pegRNAs, each harboring unique triplet DNA sequences. We demonstrate that constitutive expression of such a library of pegRNAs generates insertion patterns that support straightforward reconstruction of cell lineage relationships. In an alternative pegRNA expression scheme, we also achieve multiplexed recording by manually pulsing expression of different pegRNAs, then reconstructing pulse sequences from the peCHYRON records. Additionally, we coupled the expression of specific pegRNAs to specific biological stimuli, which allowed temporally resolved, multiplexed recording of chemical exposures in populations of mammalian cells.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=96 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/467507v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (30K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3dcbb2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1081b72org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@141fed3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c0e8ef_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) promotes the intracellular assembly of protein complexes formed through phosphotyrosine-SH2 domain linkages. These interactions are weak and reversible, and the dephosphorylation of uncomplexed phosphorylated proteins can be rapid enough to reduce the time and length scales of protein complex persistence distal from the receptor. This limitation may be overcome by cytosolic kinases that rephosphorylate constituent complex proteins as they diffuse. To develop quantitative understanding of the spatiotemporal regulation of these processes, we generated a reaction-diffusion model describing how membrane-bound epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activates the SH2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 by assembling SHP2 complexes with the adaptor GRB2-associated binder 1 (GAB1). Src family kinases (SFKs) were included as a diffusible EGFR-activated intermediary kinase for GAB1. Contrary to the textbook picture of EGFR-mediated SHP2 activation, the model predicts that GAB1-SHP2 complexes can remain intact distal from membrane-retained EGFR at [~]80% of their plasma membrane concentration over the entire intracellular length scale. Parameter sensitivity analysis identified SFK inactivation as one of the most important kinetic processes controlling GAB1-SHP2 spatial persistence, revealing the key role of repeated adaptor phosphorylation in maintaining SHP2 activity. A simple order of magnitude analysis of the controlling rate processes supports the predictions of the coupled differential equation model. Furthermore, proximity ligation assays and immunofluorescence microscopy in carcinoma cells demonstrate that GAB1-SHP2 complexes are increasingly cytoplasmic and distal from EGFR as time proceeds after acute EGFR activation, consistent with model predictions. These results provide quantitative insight into a mechanism that may be alternately tuned for different receptors and downstream effector complexes to enable receptor control of signaling at a distance.\n\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEThe textbook understanding of receptor-mediated signaling involves the assembly of protein complexes at the receptor cytosolic tail and complex movement within the cell by protein trafficking. However, reaction-diffusion processes can also play an important role in distributing signaling proteins throughout the cell, potentially quite distal from signal-initiating receptors. Indeed, receptors can activate cytosolic kinases that may maintain the phosphorylation-dependent complexation of downstream effector complexes through many rounds of complex dissociation and protein dephosphorylation. Here, we develop quantitative understanding of this mode of signal regulation through development of a mechanistic computational model and demonstrate, with experimental validation, that membrane-bound receptors can regulate signaling through downstream effector complexes over the entire intracellular length scale.",

Using Pol II MASTER, we measure the efficiency of Pol II initiation at 1,000,000 individual TSS sequences in a defined promoter context. Pol II MASTER confirms proposed critical qualities of S. cerevisiae TSS -8, -1, and +1 positions quantitatively in a controlled promoter context. Pol II MASTER extends quantitative analysis to surrounding sequences and determines that they tune initiation over a wide range of efficiencies. These results enabled the development of a predictive model for initiation efficiency based on sequence. We show that genetic perturbation of Pol II catalytic activity alters initiation efficiency mostly independently of TSS sequence, but selectively modulates preference for initiating nucleotide. Intriguingly, we find that Pol II initiation efficiency is directly sensitive to GTP levels at the first five transcript positions and to CTP and UTP levels at the second position genome wide.

    "abstract": "Biomedical data is often distributed between a network of custodians, causing challenges for researchers wishing to securely compute aggregate statistics on those data without centralizing everything--the prototypical  count query asks how many patients match some multifaceted set of conditions across a network of hospitals. Difficulty arises from two sources: (1) the need to deduplicate patients who may be present in the records of multiple hospitals and (2) the need to unify partial records for the same patient which may be split across hospitals. Although cryptographic tools for secure computation promise to enable collaborative studies with formal privacy guarantees, existing approaches either are computationally impractical or support only simplified analysis pipelines. To the best of our knowledge, no existing practical secure method addresses both of these difficulties simultaneously.\n\nHere, we introduce secure federated Boolean count queries using a novel 2-stage probabilistic sketching and sampling protocol that can be efficiently implemented in off-the-shelf federated homomorphic encryption libraries (Palisade and Lattigo), provably ensuring data security. To this end, we needed several key technological innovations, including re-encoding the LogLog union-cardinality sketch and designing an appropriate sampling for intersection cardinalities. Our benchmarking shows that we can answer federated Boolean count queries in less than 2 CPU-minutes with absolute errors in the range of 6% of the total number of touched records, while revealing only the final answer and the total number of touched records. With modern core-parallelism, we can thus answer queries on the order of seconds. Our study demonstrates that by computing on compressed and encrypted data, it is possible to securely answer federated Boolean count queries in real-time.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCurrently, little is known about the mechanism(s) regulating global and specific protein translation during non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).\n\nMethodsWe used puromycin-labelling, polysome profiling, ChIPseq and ChIP-qPCR, and gene manipulation in vitro and in dietary mouse models of NASH in this study.\n\nResultsUsing unbiased label-free quantitative proteome, puromycin-labelling and polysome profiling, we observed a global decrease in protein translation during lipotoxicity in human primary hepatocytes, mouse hepatic AML12 cells, and livers from a dietary mouse model of NASH. Interestingly, proteomic analysis showed that Rplp1, which regulates ribosome and translation pathways, was one of the most downregulated proteins. Moreover, decreased Esrra expression and binding to the Rplp1 promoter, diminished Rplp1 gene expression during lipotoxicity. This, in turn, reduced global protein translation and Esrra/Rplp1-dependent translation of lysosome (Lamp2, Ctsd) and autophagy (sqstm1, Map1lc3b) proteins. Of note, Esrra did not increase its binding to these gene promoters or their gene transcription, confirming its regulation of their translation during lipotoxicity. Notably, hepatic Esrra-Rplp1-dependent translation of lysosomal and autophagy proteins also was impaired in NASH patients and liver-specific Esrra knockout mice.\n\nRemarkably, alternate day fasting induced Essra-Rplp1-dependent expression of lysosomal proteins, restored autophagy, and reduced lipotoxicity, inflammation, and fibrosis in hepatic cell culture and in vivo models of NASH.\n\nConclusionEsrra regulation of Rplp1-mediated translation of lysosome / autolysosome proteins was downregulated during NASH. Alternate day fasting activated this novel pathway and improved NASH, suggesting that Esrra and Rplp1 may serve as therapeutic targets for NASH. Our findings also provided the first example of a nuclear hormone receptor, Esrra, to not only regulate transcription but also protein translation, via induction of Rplp1.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a powerful technology to investigate the transcriptional programs in stromal, immune, and disease cells, like tumor cells or neurons within the Alzheimers Disease (AD) brain or tumor microenvironment (ME) or niche. Cell-cell communications within ME play important roles in disease progression and immunotherapy response and are novel and critical therapeutic targets. Though many tools of scRNA-seq analysis have been developed to investigate the heterogeneity and sub-populations of cells, few were designed for uncovering cell-cell communications of ME and predicting the potentially effective drugs to inhibit the communications. Moreover, the data analysis processes of discovering signaling communication networks and effective drugs using scRNA-seq data are complex and involve a set of critical analysis processes and external supportive data resources, which are difficult for researchers who have no strong computational background and training in scRNA-seq data analysis. To address these challenges, in this study, we developed a novel open-source computational tool, sc2MeNetDrug (https://fuhaililab.github.io/sc2MeNetDrug/). It was specifically designed using scRNA-seq data to identify cell types within disease MEs, uncover the dysfunctional signaling pathways within individual cell types and interactions among different cell types, and predict effective drugs that can potentially disrupt cell-cell signaling communications. sc2MeNetDrug provided a user-friendly graphical user interface to encapsulate the data analysis modules, which can facilitate the scRNA-seq data-based discovery of novel inter-cell signaling communications and novel therapeutic regimens.",

    "abstract": "Single cell RNAseq (scRNAseq) batches range from technical-replicates to multi-tissue atlases, thus requiring robust batch-correction methods that operate effectively across this spectrum of between-batch similarity. Commonly employed benchmarks quantify removal of batch effects and preservation of within-batch variation, the preservation of biologically meaningful differences between batches has been under-researched. Here, we address these gaps, quantifying batch effects at the level of cluster composition and along overlapping topologies through the introduction of two new measures. We discovered that standard approaches of scRNAseq batch-correction erase cell-type and cell-state variation in real-world biological datasets, single cell gene expression atlases, and in silico experiments. We highlight through examples showing that these issues may create the artefactual appearance of external validation/replication of findings. Our results demonstrate that either biological effects, if known, must be balanced between batches (like bulk-techniques), or technical effects that vary between batches must be explicitly modeled to prevent erasure of biological variation by unsupervised batch correction approaches.",

    "abstract": "Standing genetic variation is a major driver of fitness and resilience, and therefore of fundamental importance for threatened species such as stony corals. We analyzed RNA- seq data generated from 132 Montipora capitata and 119 Pocillopora acuta coral colonies collected from K[a]neohe Bay, Oahu, Hawaii. Our goals were to determine the extent of colony genetic variation and to study reproductive strategies in these two sympatric species. Surprisingly, we found that 63% of the P. acuta colonies were triploid, with putative independent origins of the different triploid clades. These corals have spread primarily via asexual reproduction and are descended from a small number of genotypes, whose diploid ancestor invaded the bay. In contrast, all M. capitata colonies are diploid, outbreeding, with almost all colonies genetically distinct. Only two cases of asexual reproduction, likely via fragmentation, were identified in this species. We report two distinct strategies in sympatric coral species that inhabit the largest sheltered body of water in the main Hawaiian Islands. These data highlight divergence in reproductive behavior and genome biology, both of which contribute to coral resilience and persistence.\n\nSignificance StatementGiven the threat posed to coral reef ecosystems by human caused climate change, there is a growing focus on developing strategies for the protection and restoration of these critical marine habitats. These efforts are however limited by our understanding of the diversity of coral survival and reproductive strategies. Our analysis of data from two coral species inhabiting the same Hawaiian bay found that one is a strict sexual outbreeder, whereas the other reproduces predominantly asexually (i.e., clonally) and includes both diploids and triploids. These results broaden our understanding of coral biology, adaptability, and evolution, and underpin future research into the mechanisms of coral resilience that can inform restoration activities.",

    "abstract": "To monitor the effect of nature restoration projects in North Sea ecosystems, accurate and intensive biodiversity assessments are vital. DNA based techniques and especially environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding is becoming a powerful monitoring tool. However, current approaches are based on genetic target regions <500 nucleotides, which offer limited taxonomic resolution. We developed a method for eDNA metabarcoding, based on nanopore sequencing of a longer amplicon, enabling improved identification of fish species. We designed a universal primer pair targeting a 2kb region of fish mitochondria, and compared it to the commonly used MiFish primer pair that targets only [~]170bp. In sillico and mock community testing showed that the 2kb fragments improved the accurate identification of genetically closely related species. eDNA was amplified, and sequenced using the Oxford Nanopore MinION in combination with the sequence read processing pipeline Decona. Analyzing eDNA from a North Sea aquarium showed that sequences from both primer pairs could be assigned to most species, but both approaches also identified unique species in the aquarium eDNA. Next, both primer pairs were used on multiple eDNA samples from the North Sea. Here, similar location specific fish communities were obtained from both approaches. More species were identified through the MiFish approach in the field samples. Interestingly, this difference was not observed in the aquarium, suggesting that 2kb fragment based metabarcoding potentially detects more recent occurrences of animals. This new method has the potential to improve and expand the molecular toolbox for eDNA based monitoring approaches.",

Skin pigmentation ranged from 20 to 80 melanin units, averaging 46. Three albino individuals were determined to be homozygous for a causative multi-nucleotide polymorphism OCA2NW273KV contained within a haplotype of African origin; its allele frequency was 0.03 and single allele effect size was -8 melanin units. Derived allele frequencies of SLC24A5A111T and SLC45A2L374F were 0.14 and 0.06, with single allele effect sizes of -6 and -4, respectively. Native American ancestry by itself reduced pigmentation by more than 20 melanin units (range 24 - 29).

    "abstract": "MotivationWith the wide availability of single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) technology, population-scale scRNA-seq datasets across multiple individuals and time points are emerging. While the initial investigations of these datasets tend to focus on standard analysis of clustering and differential expression, leveraging the power of scRNA-seq data at the personalized dynamic gene co-expression network level has the potential to unlock subject and/or time-specific network-level variation, which is critical for understanding phenotypic differences. Community detection from co-expression networks of multiple time points or conditions has been well-studied; however, none of the existing settings included networks from multiple subjects and multiple time points simultaneously. To address this, we develop MuDCoD for multi-subject community detection in personalized dynamic gene networks from scRNA-seq. MuDCoD builds on the spectral clustering framework and promotes information sharing among the networks of the subjects as well as networks at different time points. It clusters genes in the personalized dynamic gene networks and reveals gene communities that are variable or shared not only across time but also among subjects.\n\nResultsEvaluation and benchmarking of MuDCoD against existing approaches reveal that MuDCoD effectively leverages apparent shared signals among networks of the subjects at individual time points, and performs robustly when there is no or little information sharing among the networks. Applications to population-scale scRNA-seq datasets of human-induced pluripotent stem cells during dopaminergic neuron differentiation and CD4+ T cell activation indicate that MuDCoD enables robust inference for identifying time-varying personalized gene modules. Our results illustrate how personalized dynamic community detection can aid in the exploration of subject-specific biological processes that vary across time.\n\nAvailabilityMuDCoD is publicly available at https://github.com/bo1929/MuDCoD as a Python package.

    "abstract": "MotivationWith the wide availability of single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) technology, population-scale scRNA-seq datasets across multiple individuals and time points are emerging. While the initial investigations of these datasets tend to focus on standard analysis of clustering and differential expression, leveraging the power of scRNA-seq data at the personalized dynamic gene co-expression network level has the potential to unlock subject and/or time-specific network-level variation, which is critical for understanding phenotypic differences. Community detection from co-expression networks of multiple time points or conditions has been well-studied; however, none of the existing settings included networks from multiple subjects and multiple time points simultaneously. To address this, we develop MuDCoD for multi-subject community detection in personalized dynamic gene networks from scRNA-seq. MuDCoD builds on the spectral clustering framework and promotes information sharing among the networks of the subjects as well as networks at different time points. It clusters genes in the personalized dynamic gene networks and reveals gene communities that are variable or shared not only across time but also among subjects.\n\nResultsEvaluation and benchmarking of MuDCoD against existing approaches reveal that MuDCoD effectively leverages apparent shared signals among networks of the subjects at individual time points, and performs robustly when there is no or little information sharing among the networks. Applications to population-scale scRNA-seq datasets of human-induced pluripotent stem cells during dopaminergic neuron differentiation and CD4+ T cell activation indicate that MuDCoD enables robust inference for identifying time-varying personalized gene modules. Our results illustrate how personalized dynamic community detection can aid in the exploration of subject-specific biological processes that vary across time.\n\nAvailabilityMuDCoD is publicly available at https://github.com/bo1929/MuDCoD as a Python package. Implementation includes simulation and real-data experiments together with extensive documentation.\n\nContactkeles@stat.wisc.edu, otastan@sabanciuniv.edu\n\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

    "abstract": "Mass spectrometry-based proteomics allows to study all proteins of a sample on a molecular level. However, mass spectra are noisy and contain complex patterns, making them inherently challenging to analyze with purely algorithmic approaches. In terms of the protein sequence landscape, most recent bottom-up MS-based proteomics studies consider either a diverse pool of post-translational modifications, employ large databases - as in metaproteomics or proteogenomics, study multiple isoforms of proteins, include unspecific cleavage sites or even combinations thereof. All this makes peptide and protein identifications challenging due to sheer size of the search space. To cope with this two-sided challenge, i.e. the complexity of real spectra and the search space size, we present a foundation model, called yHydra, that jointly embeds spectra and peptides. This allows us to implement various downstream tasks and search modes in Euclidean space. In particular, we implement an open search which allows to query multiple ten-thousands of spectra against millions of peptides. Furthermore, we implement an error-tolerant search for identifying additional proteoforms that are not included in off-the-shelf reference proteomes. Our foundation model provides meaningful embeddings, as we interpret learned peptide embeddings in comparison to the peptides physico-chemical properties. yHydras open search, assigns delta masses to each identification which allows to unrestrictedly characterize post-translational modifications. The error-tolerant mode of yHydra can be used as post-processing to existing search engines or as a standalone. yHydra is evaluated on several real life data sets for the identification of modified protein sequences and shows up to 25% increase in protein identification at constant false discovery rate compared to the current state-of-the-art.\n\nAvailability(under MIT license) https://gitlab.com/dacs-hpi/yHydra\n\nContactbernhard.renard@hpi.de",

    "abstract": "Numerous studies have been devoted to individual cases of horizontally acquired genes in fungi. It has been shown that such genes expand the hosts metabolic capabilities and contribute to their adaptations as parasites or symbionts. Some studies have provided an extensive characterization of the horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in Dikarya. However, in the early diverging fungi (EDF), a similar characterization is still missing. In order to fill this gap, we have designed a computational pipeline to obtain a statistical sample of reliable HGT events with a possibly minimal number of false detections. We have analyzed 44 EDF proteomes and identified 829 xenologs in fungi ranging from Chytridiomycota and Blastocladiomycota to Mucoromycota. We have identified several patterns and statistical properties of EDF HGT. Ancestrally aquatic fungi are generally more likely to acquire foreign genetic material than terrestrial ones. Endosymbiotic bacteria can be a source of useful xenologs, as exemplified by NOD-like receptors transferred to Mortierellomycota. Closely related fungi have similar rates of intronization of xenologs. The number of post-transfer paralogs of a protein can be described by a heavy-tailed Yule-Simons distribution. Post-transfer gene fusions complicate the landscape of HGT. We have designed a methodology to obtain a reliable, statistical sample of inter-kingdom xenologs across the tree of life of EDF to give a preliminary characterization of their general properties and patterns. We show that HGT is driven by bursts of gene exchange and duplication, resulting in highly divergent numbers and molecular properties of xenologs between fungal lineages. A close ecological relationship with another organism seems to be a predisposing condition for HGT, but does not always result in an extensive gene exchange. We argue that there is no universal approach for HGT identification and inter- and intra kingdom transfers require tailored identification methods. Our results help to better understand how and to what extent HGT has shaped the metabolic, adaptive, and immune capabilities of fungi.",

While multimodal single-cell and single-nucleus genomics offers the potential to better understand how distinct cellular processes are coordinated, there can be technical and cost tradeoffs associated with increasing the number of measurement modes. To assess some of the tradeoffs inherent in multimodal assays, we have developed snATAK for preprocessing sequencing-based high-throughput assays that measure single-nucleus chromatin accessibility. Coupled with kallisto bustools for single-nucleus RNA-seq preprocessing, the snATAK workflow can be used for uniform preprocessing of 10x Genomics Multiome and single-nucleus ATAC-seq, SHARE-seq, ISSAAC-seq, spatial ATAC-seq and other chromatin-related assays. Using snATAK, we are able to perform cross-platform comparisons and quantify some of the tradeoffs between Multiome and unregistered single-nucleus RNA-seq/ATAC-seq experiments. We also show that snATAK can be used to assess allele concordance between paired RNAseq and ATACseq. snATAK is available at https://github.com/pachterlab/snATAK/.",

Although much has been learned about their physiology and their Madagascar ecology and phylogeny, little is known about their cellular and molecular biology. Here we used droplet- and plate-based single cell RNA-sequencing to profile 226,000 cells from 27 mouse lemur organs and tissues opportunistically procured from four donors clinically and histologically characterized. Using computational cell clustering, integration, and expert cell annotation, we defined and biologically organized over 750 mouse lemur molecular cell types and their full gene expression profiles. These include cognates of most classical human cell types, including stem and progenitor cells, and the developmental programs for spermatogenesis, hematopoiesis, and other adult tissues. We also described dozens of previously unidentified or sparsely characterized cell types and subtypes. We globally compared cell type expression profiles to define the molecular relationships of cell types across the body, and explored primate cell and gene expression evolution by comparing mouse lemur cell transcriptomes to those of human, mouse, and macaque. This revealed cell type specific patterns of primate specialization, as well as many cell types and genes for which lemur provides a better human model than mouse. The atlas provides a cellular and molecular foundation for studying this primate model organism, and establishes a general approach for other emerging model organisms.",

    "abstract": "Hormones mediate long-range cell communication in multicellular organisms and play vital roles in normal physiology, metabolism, and health. Using the newly-completed organism-wide single cell transcriptional atlas of a non-human primate, the mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus), we have systematically identified hormone-producing and -target cells for 84 classes of hormones, and have created a browsable atlas for hormone signaling that reveals previously unreported sites of hormone regulation and species-specific rewiring. Hormone ligands and receptors exhibited cell-type-dependent, stereotypical expression patterns, and their transcriptional profiles faithfully classified the molecular cell type identities, despite their comprising less than 1% of the transcriptome. Cells of similar cell types further display stage, subtype or organ-dependent specification of hormonal signaling, reflecting the precise control of global hormonal regulation. By linking ligand-expressing cells to the cells expressing the corresponding receptor, we constructed an organism-wide map of the hormonal cell communication network. This network was remarkably densely and robustly connected and included a myriad of feedback circuits. Although it includes classical hierarchical circuits (e.g. pituitary [-&gt;] peripheral endocrine gland [-&gt;] diverse cell types), the hormonal network is overall highly distributed without obvious network hubs or axes. Cross-species comparisons among humans, lemurs, and mice suggest that the mouse lemur better models human hormonal signaling, than does the mouse. Hormonal genes show a higher evolutionary conservation between human and lemur vs. human and mouse at both the genomic level (orthology-mapping and sequence identity) and the transcriptional level (cell type expression patterns). This primate hormone atlas provides a powerful resource to facilitate discovery of regulation on an organism-wide scale and at single-cell resolution, complementing the single-site-focused strategy of classical endocrine studies. The network nature of hormone regulation and the principles discovered here further emphasize the importance of a systems approach to understanding hormone regulation.",

To understand if autophagy-related proteins influence genome stability, we examined a cohort of 35 autophagy mutants in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We observed cells lacking Atg11 show poor mitotic stability of minichromosomes. Atg11 molecules dynamically localize to the spindle pole bodies (SPBs). Loss of Atg11 leads to a delayed cell cycle progression. Such cells accumulate at metaphase at an elevated temperature that is relieved when the spindle assembly checkpoint is inactivated. Indeed, atg11{Delta} cells have stabilized securin levels, that prevent anaphase onset, confirming chromosome biorientation defects associated with the mutant. Atg11 functions in the Kar9-dependent spindle positioning pathway and maintains Kar9 asymmetry by facilitating proper dynamic instability of astral microtubules (aMTs). Taken together, this study uncovers a non-canonical role of Atg11 in facilitating MT dynamics crucial for chromosome segregation.",

Challenges to modeling and inference in this setting include the large number of species present, and data sparsity/noise characteristics.

We model microbial dynamics as stochastic processes driven by inferred interaction modules, or groups of microbes with similar interaction structure and responses to perturbations. Additionally, we model the noise characteristics of sequencing and qPCR measurements to provide uncertainty quantification for all outputs. To evaluate MDSINE2, and provide a benchmarking resource for the community, we generated the most densely sampled microbiome time-series to date, which consists of a cohort of mice that received fecal transplants from a human donor and were then subjected to dietary and antibiotic perturbations. Benchmarking on simulated and real data demonstrate that MDSINE2 significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and moreover identifies interaction modules that shed new light on ecosystems-scale interactions in the gut microbiome.

Although numerous tools for dimension reduction and clustering are available for single-cell data analyses, these methods often fail to simultaneously preserve local cluster structure and global data geometry. To address these challenges, we developed a novel analyses framework, Single-Cell Path Metrics Profiling (scPMP), using power-weighted path metrics, which measure distances between cells in a data-driven way. Unlike Euclidean distance and other commonly used distance metrics, path metrics are density sensitive and respect the underlying data geometry. By combining path metrics with multidimensional scaling, a low dimensional embedding of the data is obtained which preserves both the global data geometry and cluster structure. We evaluate the method both for clustering quality and geometric fidelity, and it outperforms current scRNAseq clustering algorithms on a wide range of benchmarking data sets.",

    "abstract": "Cellular responses to stress can cause a similar change in some facets of fitness even if the stresses are different. Lactose as a sole carbon source for Escherichia coli is an established example: too little causes starvation while excessive lactose import causes toxicity as a side-effect. In an E. coli strain that is robust to osmotic and ionic differences in growth media, B REL606, the rate of antibiotic-tolerant persister formation is elevated in both starvation-inducing and toxicity-inducing concentrations of lactose in comparison to less stressful intermediate concentrations. Such similarities between starvation and toxification raise the question of how much the global stress response stimulon differs between them. We hypothesized that a common stress response is conserved between the two conditions, but that a previously shown threshold driving growth rate heterogeneity in a lactose-toxifying medium would reveal that the growing fraction of cells in that medium to be missing key stress responses that curb growth. To test this, we performed RNA-seq in three representative conditions for differential expression analysis. In comparison to nominally unstressed cultures, both stress conditions showed global shifts in gene expression, with informative similarities and differences. Functional analysis of pathways, gene ontology terms, and clusters of orthogonal groups revealed signatures of overflow metabolism, membrane component shifts, and altered cytosolic and periplasmic contents in toxified cultures. Starving cultures showed an increased tendency toward stringent response-like regulatory signatures. Along with other emerging evidence, our results show multiple possible pathways to stress responses, persistence, and possibly other phenotypes. These results suggest a set of overlapping responses that drives emergence of stress-tolerant phenotypes in diverse conditions.",

    "abstract": "The extent to which the components of a biological system are (non)linearly regulated determines how amenable they are to therapy and control. To better understand this property termed  regulatory nonlinearity, we analyzed a suite of 137 published Boolean network models, containing a variety of complex nonlinear regulatory interactions, using a probabilistic generalization of Boolean logic that George Boole himself had proposed. Leveraging the continuous-nature of this formulation, we used Taylor decomposition to approximate the models with various levels of regulatory nonlinearity. A comparison of the resulting series of approximations of the biological models with appropriate random ensembles revealed that biological regulation tends to be less nonlinear than expected, meaning that higher-order interactions among the regulatory inputs tend to be less pronounced. A further categorical analysis of the biological models revealed that the regulatory nonlinearity of cancer and disease networks could not only be sometimes higher than expected but also relatively more variable. We show that this variation is caused by differences in the apportioning of information among the various orders of regulatory nonlinearity. Our results suggest that there may have been a weak but discernible selection pressure for biological systems to evolve linear regulation on average, but for certain systems such as cancer, on the other hand, to also evolve more nonlinear rules.",

    "abstract": "High-throughput technologies are increasingly important in discovering prognostic molecular signatures and identifying novel drug targets. Molecular signatures can be obtained as a subset of features that are important for the decisions of a Machine Learning (ML) method applied to high-dimensional gene expression data. However, feature selection is inherently unstable in this case. Several studies have identified gene sets that provide predictive success for patient prognosis, but these sets usually have only a few genes in common. The stability of feature selection (and reproducibility of identified gene sets) can be improved by including information on molecular networks in ML methods. Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCNN) is a contemporary deep learning approach applicable to gene expression data structured by a prior knowledge molecular network. Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) are techniques to explain individual decisions of deep learning models. We used both GCNN+LRP and GCNN+SHAP techniques to explain GCNNs and to construct feature sets that are relevant to models by aggregating their individual explanations. We also applied more classical ML-based feature selection approaches and analyzed the stability, impact on the classification performance, and interpretability of selected feature sets.\n\nAvailabilityhttps://gitlab.gwdg.de/UKEBpublic/graph-lrp\n\nContacttim.beissbarth@bioinf.med.uni-goettingen.de",

    "abstract": "Proteins analysis from an average cell population often overlooks the cellular heterogeneity of expressed effector molecules, and knowledge about the regulations of key biological processes may remain obscure. Therefore, the necessity of single-cell proteomics (SCP) technologies arises. Without microfluidic chip, expensive ultrasonic equipment, or reformed liquid chromatogram (LC) system, we established an Ultra-sensitive and Easy-to-use multiplexed Single-Cell Proteomic workflow (UE-SCP). Specifically, the flexible sorting system ensured outstanding cell activity, high accuracy, remarkable efficiency, and robustness during single-cell isolation. Multiplex isobaric labeling realized the high-throughput analysis in trapped ion mobility spectrometry coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (timsTOF MS). Using this pipeline, we achieved single-cell protein quantities to a depth of over 2,000 protein groups in two human cell lines, Hela and HEK-293T. A small batch experiment can identify and quantify more than 3200 protein groups in 32 single cells, while a large batch experiment can identify and quantify about 4000 protein groups in 96 single cells. All the 128 single cells from different cell lines could been unsupervised clustered based on their proteomes. After the integration of data quality control, data cleaning, and data analysis, we are confident that our UE-SCP platform will be easy-to-marketing popularization and will promote biological applications of single-cell proteomics.",

In this paper, we propose a bio-computational framework, Nm-Nano for predicting the existence of Nm sites in Nanopore direct RNA sequencing reads of human cell lines.

XGBoost is trained with the features extracted from the modified and unmodified Nanopore signals and their corresponding K-mers resulting from the reported underlying RNA sequence obtained by base-calling, while RF model is trained with the same set of features used to train XGBoost, in addition to a dense vector representation of RNA K-mers generated by word2vec technique.

Research on methods for identifying such similarities has lagged due to a lack of carefully designed and well-annotated image sets of cells treated with chemical and genetic perturbations. Here, we create such a Resource dataset, CPJUMP1, where each perturbed gene is a known target of at least two chemical compounds in the dataset. We systematically explore the directionality of correlations among perturbations that target the same gene, and we find that identifying matches between chemical perturbations and genetic perturbations is a challenging task. Our dataset and baseline analyses provide a benchmark for evaluating methods that measure perturbation similarities and impact, and more generally, learn effective representations of cellular state from microscopy images. Such advancements would accelerate the applications of image-based profiling, such as functional genomics and drug discovery.",

    "abstract": "Identifying genetic and chemical perturbations with similar impacts on cell morphology can reveal compounds mechanisms of action or novel regulators of genetic pathways. Research on methods for identifying such similarities has lagged due to a lack of carefully designed and well-annotated image sets of cells treated with chemical and genetic perturbations. Here, we create such a Resource dataset, CPJUMP1, where each perturbed gene is a known target of at least two chemical compounds in the dataset. We systematically explore the directionality of correlations among perturbations that target the same gene, and we find that identifying matches between chemical perturbations and genetic perturbations is a challenging task. Our dataset and baseline analyses provide a benchmark for evaluating methods that measure perturbation similarities and impact, and more generally, learn effective representations of cellular state from microscopy images. Such advancements would accelerate the applications of image-based profiling, such as functional genomics and drug discovery.",

    "abstract": "Reconstructing the history of somatic DNA alterations can help understand the evolution of a tumor and predict its resistance to treatment. Single-cell DNA sequencing (scDNAseq) can be used to investigate clonal heterogeneity and to inform phylogeny reconstruction. However, most existing phylogenetic methods for scDNAseq data are designed either for single nucleotide variants (SNVs) or for large copy number alterations (CNAs), or are not applicable to targeted sequencing. Here, we develop COMPASS, a computational method for inferring the joint phylogeny of SNVs and CNAs from targeted scDNAseq data. We evaluate COMPASS on simulated data and apply it to several datasets including a cohort of 123 patients with acute myeloid leukemia. COMPASS detected clonal CNAs that could be orthogonally validated with bulk data, in addition to subclonal ones that require single-cell resolution, some of which point toward convergent evolution.",

We formulate a model incorporating this idea whose predictions agree very well with the observed data. In the model, human lifetimes are theoretically unbounded, but the probability of an individual living to an extreme age is negligible, so lifetimes are effectively limited. Our model incorporates a mortality hazard rate plateau and a late-life mortality deceleration effect in conjunction with a newly observed advanced age mortality acceleration. This reconciles many previously observed effects. The model is temporally stable: consistent with observation, parameters do not change over time. As an application, assuming no major medical advances, we predict the emergence of many individuals living past 120, but due to accelerating mortality find it unlikely that any will subsequently survive to an age of 125.",

We illustrate our hybrid models with growth rate predictions of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida grown in different media and with phenotype predictions of gene knocked-out Escherichia coli mutants. Our neural-mechanistic models systematically outperform constraint-based models and require training set sizes orders of magnitude smaller than classical machine learning methods. Our hybrid approach opens a doorway to enhancing constraint-based modeling: instead of constraining mechanistic models with additional experimental measurements, our hybrid models grasp the power of machine learning while fulfilling mechanistic constrains, thus saving time and resources in typical systems biology or biological engineering projects.",

    "abstract": "Sketching methods offer computational biologists scalable techniques to analyze data sets that continue to grow in size. MinHash is one such technique to estimate set similarity that has enjoyed recent broad application. However, traditional MinHash has previously been shown to perform poorly when applied to sets of very dissimilar sizes. FracMinHash was recently introduced as a modification of MinHash to compensate for this lack of performance when set sizes differ. This approach has been successfully applied to metagenomic taxonomic profiling in the widely used tool sourmash gather. While experimental evidence has been encouraging, FracMinHash has not yet been analyzed from a theoretical perspective. In this paper, we perform such an analysis to derive various statistics of FracMinHash, and prove that while FracMinHash is not unbiased (in the sense that its expected value is not equal to the quantity it attempts to estimate), this bias is easily corrected for both the containment and Jaccard index versions. Next, we show how FracMinHash can be used to compute point estimates as well as confidence intervals for evolutionary mutation distance between a pair of sequences by assuming a simple mutation model. We also investigate edge cases where these analyses may fail, to effectively warn the users of FracMinHash indicating the likelihood of such cases. Our analyses show that FracMinHash estimates the containment of a genome in a large metagenome more accurately and more precisely when compared to traditional MinHash, and the point estimates and confidence intervals perform significantly better in estimating mutation distances.",

    "abstract": "We propose MT-MAG, a novel machine learning-based software tool for the complete or partial hierarchically-structured taxonomic classification of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). MT-MAG is alignment-free, with k-mer frequencies being the only feature used to distinguish a DNA sequence from another (herein k = 7). MT-MAG is capable of classifying large and diverse metagenomic datasets: a total of 245.68 Gbp in the training sets, and 9.6 Gbp in the test sets analyzed in this study. In addition to complete classifications, MT-MAG offers a \"partial classification\" option, whereby a classification at a higher taxonomic level is provided for MAGs that cannot be classified to the Species level. MT-MAG outputs complete or partial classification paths, and interpretable numerical classification confidences of its classifications, at all taxonomic ranks. To assess the performance of MT-MAG, we define a \"weighted classification accuracy,\" with a weighting scheme reflecting the fact that partial classifications at different ranks are not equally informative. For the two benchmarking datasets analyzed (genomes from human gut microbiome species, and bacterial and archaeal genomes assembled from cow rumen metagenomic sequences), MT-MAG achieves an average of 87.32% in weighted classification accuracy. At the Species level, MT-MAG outperforms DeepMicrobes, the only other comparable software tool, by an average of 34.79% in weighted classification accuracy. In addition, MT-MAG is able to completely classify an average of 67.70% of the sequences at the Species level, compared with DeepMicrobes which only classifies 47.45%. Moreover, MT-MAG provides additional information for sequences that it could not classify at the Species level, resulting in the partial or complete classification of 95.13%, of the genomes in the datasets analyzed. Lastly, unlike other taxonomic assignment tools (e.g., GDTB-Tk), MT-MAG is an alignment-free and genetic marker-free tool, able to provide additional bioinformatics analysis to confirm existing or tentative taxonomic assignments.",

    "abstract": "The study of pattern formation has greatly benefited from our ability to reverse-engineer gene regulatory network (GRN) structure from spatio-temporal quantitative gene expression data. Traditional approaches omit tissue morphogenesis, and focus on systems where the timescales of pattern formation and morphogenesis can be separated. In such systems, pattern forms as an emergent property of the underlying GRN and mechanistic insight can be obtained from the GRNs alone. However, this is not the case in most animal patterning systems, where patterning and morphogenesis are co-occurring and tightly linked. To address the mechanisms driving pattern formation in such systems we need to adapt our GRN inference methodologies to explicitly accommodate cell movements and tissue shape changes. In this work we present a novel framework to reverse-engineer GRNs underlying pattern formation in tissues undergoing morphogenetic changes and cell rearrangements. By integrating quantitative data from live and fixed embryos, we approximate gene expression trajectories (AGETs) in single cells and use a subset to reverse-engineer candidate GRNs using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach. GRN fit is assessed by simulating on cell tracks (live-modelling) and comparing the output to quantitative data-sets. This framework generates candidate GRNs that recapitulate pattern formation at the level of the tissue and the single cell. To our knowledge, this inference methodology is the first to integrate cell movements and gene expression data, making it possible to reverse-engineer GRNs patterning tissues undergoing morphogenetic changes.",

Missense mutations in XPD are putative drivers in around 10% of bladder cancers (BLCA), but the associated mutational process remains poorly understood. Here, we examine the somatic mutational landscape of XPD wild-type (n=343) and mutant (n=39) BLCA whole genomes. The genome-wide distribution of somatic mutations is significantly altered in XPD mutants, affecting both APOBEC and non-APOBEC associated mutational processes. Specifically, XPD mutants are enriched in T[C>T]N mutations (SBS2) with altered correlation with replication timing. At a locoregional genomic level, mutant XPD BLCA had striking T>G mutation hotspots at CTCF-cohesin binding sites (CBS) with evidence linking XPD to genomic uracil repair. Leveraging differential distribution of somatic mutations, we developed a machine-learning model for predicting pathogenic XPD mutations, which we validated in an independent TCGA cohort with 100% accuracy. Our model enabled the discovery of missed XPD mutation calls and uncovered pathogenic non-hotspot XPD mutations in bladder cancer.

    "abstract": "BackgroundBecause of the rapid generation of data, the study of compression algorithms to reduce storage and transmission costs is important to bioinformaticians. Much of the focus has been on sequence data, including both genomes and protein amino acid sequences stored in FASTA files. Current standard practice is to use an ordinary lossless compressor such as gzip on a sequential list of atomic coordinates, but this approach expends bits on saving an arbitrary ordering of atoms, and it also prevents reordering the atoms for compressibility. The standard MMTF and BCIF file formats extend this approach with custom encoding of the coordinates. However, the brand new Foldcomp tool introduces a new paradigm of compressing local angles, to great effect. In this article, we explore a different paradigm, showing for the first time that image-based compression using global angles can also significantly improve compression ratios. To this end, we implement a prototype compressor  PIC, specialized for point clouds of atom coordinates contained in PDB and mmCIF files. PIC maps the 3D data to a 2D 8-bit greyscale image and leverages the well developed PNG image compressor to minimize the size of the resulting image, forming the compressed file.\n\nResultsPIC outperforms gzip in terms of compression ratio on proteins over 20,000 atoms in size, with a savings over gzip of up to 37.4% on the proteins compressed. In addition, PICs compression ratio increases with protein size.\n\nConclusionImage-centric compression as demonstrated by our prototype PIC provides a potential means of constructing 3D structure-aware protein compression software, though future work would be necessary to make this practical.",

The annotation of non-canonical translation events in these cellular factories remains incomplete, limiting not only our ability to study CHO cell biology but also detect host cell protein (HCP) contaminants in the final mAb drug product. We utilised ribosome footprint profiling (Ribo-seq) to identify novel open reading frames (ORFs) including N-terminal extensions and thousands of short ORFs (sORFs) predicted to encode microproteins. Mass spectrometry-based HCP analysis of four commercial mAb drug products using the extended protein sequence database revealed the presence of microprotein impurities for the first time. We also show that microprotein abundance varies with growth phase and can be affected by the cell culture environment.

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWO_ST_ABSProblemC_ST_ABSSystems theory applied to biology and medicine assumes that the complexity of a system can be described by quasi-generic models to predict the behavior of many other similar systems. To this end, the aim of various research works in systems theory is to develop inductive modeling (based on data-intensive analysis) or deductive modeling (based on the deduction of mechanistic principles) to discover patterns and identify plausible correlations between past and present events, or to connect different causal relationships of interacting elements at different scales and compute mathematical predictions. Mathematical principles assume that there are constant and observable universal causal principles that apply to all biological systems. Nowadays, there are no suitable tools to assess the soundness of these universal causal principles, especially considering that organisms not only respond to environmental stimuli (and inherent processes) across multiple scales but also integrate information about and within these scales. This implies an uncontrollable degree of uncertainty.\n\nMethodologyA method has been developed to detect the stability of causal processes by evaluating the information contained in the trajectories identified in a phase space. Time series patterns are analyzed using concepts from geometric information theory and persistent homology. In essence, recognizing these patterns in different time periods and evaluating their geometrically integrated information leads to the assessment of causal relationships. With this method, and together with the evaluation of persistent entropy in trajectories in relation to different individual systems, we have developed a method called{Phi} -S diagram as a complexity measure to recognize when organisms follow causal pathways leading to mechanistic responses.\n\nResultsWe calculated the {Phi}-S diagram of a deterministic dataset available in the ICU repository to test the methods interpretability. We also calculated the {Phi}-S diagram of time series from health data available in the same repository. This includes patients physiological response to sport measured with wearables outside laboratory conditions. We confirmed the mechanistic nature of both datasets in both calculations. In addition, there is evidence that some individuals show a high degree of autonomous response and variability. Therefore, persistent individual variability may limit the ability to observe the cardiac response. In this study, we present the first demonstration of the concept of developing a more robust framework for representing complex biological systems.",

Most of these studies were performed on race horses and before 2010, on data accumulated before. The cumulative effects of age and nulliparity/nursing with improved reproductive technologies and practices, often observed in sport horses, has not been investigated yet.\n\nObjectivesTo investigate the effect of age, parity and nursing, as well as reproductive management, on post-insemination inflammation and fertility in sports mares.\n\nStudy designAge, parity, nursing status, follicular size before ovulation, estrus and/or ovulation induction, artificial insemination (AI) protocol, post-breeding inflammation and treatment, Day 14 pregnancies rates (PR) and number of embryos, as well as subsequent foaling the next year were recorded for 277 mares (506 cycles) over one breeding season in two French commercial studs.\n\nMethodsMultivariate logistic regression models were used.\n\nResultsPR was 41.9% per cycle and 76.5% at the end of the season. Post-insemination fluid accumulation risk was increased in >10-year-old, barren or July or August inseminated mares (p<0.0001, OR=3.29, 5.389 and 3.329, respectively). PR were reduced in mares >10-year-old vs younger or inseminated with frozen vs fresh or refrigerated semen (p<0.05, OR=0.622 and 0.582, respectively). More pregnancy on Day 14 were observed in mares with multiple ovulations compared to mono- ovulation (p<0.05, OR=1.791). Regardless the age, PR only tended to be improved in multiparous (p=0.07, OR=1.434 in parous vs nulliparous) but in >10-year-old mares, multiparity greatly increased PR (44.09% in parous vs 30.89% in nulliparous, p<0.05).\n\nMain limitationsLimited number of mares.\n\nConclusionIn sport horse, maternal age was more important than parity and lactating status for reproductive success but cumulative effects of nulliparity and aging was deleterious on PR, demonstrating their importance in the management of sport mares.",

    "abstract": "Given the important role food plays in health and well-being, the past decades have seen considerable experimental efforts dedicated to mapping the chemical composition of food ingredients. As the composition of raw food is genetically predetermined, here we ask, to what degree can we rely on genome-associated metabolic annotations to predict the chemical composition of natural ingredients? To that end, we developed an approach to unveil the chemical composition of 75 edible plants genomes, finding that genome-associated functional annotations substantially increase the number of compounds linked to specific plants. To account for the gap between the metabolic potential represented by functional annotations and the compounds likely to be accumulated and detected experimentally, we employed a predictive thermodynamic feasibility approach to systematically identify compounds that are likely to accumulate in plants. To quantify the accuracy of our predictions, we performed untargeted metabolomics on 13 plants, allowing us to experimentally confirm the detectability of the predicted compounds. For example, we observed 59 potentially novel compounds predicted and experimentally detected in corn. Our study shows that the application of genome-associated functional annotations can lead to an integrated metabologenomics platform capable of unveiling the chemical composition of edible plants and the biochemical pathways responsible for the observed compounds.\n\nAuthor SummaryNutrition and well-being take a central role in todays high pace life, but how much do we really know about the food we eat? Here, we harness existing metabolic knowledge encrypted in staple food ingredients genome to help us explore the composition of raw edible plants. We first show the benefit and value of looking into genome-associated functional annotations on a wide scale. Next, we rely on new experimental data to develop a framework that helps us reveal new, potentially bioactive compounds in staple food ingredients. This has significance in, first, extending current food composition knowledge and second in discovering newly detected bioactive compounds, shedding light on the potential impacts of common food ingredients beyond their nutritional value as described in food labels. Finally, we show that staple foods that are already included in our daily diets might have the potential to contribute to our well-being.",

While most of the eQTLs are near the associated genes, some can be far away or on different chromosomes, with the regulatory mechanisms largely unknown. Here, we study cis- and trans-regulation by eQTLs on protein-coding genes and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) across nearly 50 tissues and cell types. Specifically, we constructed trios consisting of an eQTL, its cis-gene and trans-gene and inferred the regulatory relationships with causal network inference. We identify multiple types of regulatory networks for trios: across all the tissues, more than half of the trios are inferred to be conditionally independent, where the two genes are conditionally independent given the genotype of the eQTL (gene 1 [&lt;-] eQTL [-&gt;] gene 2). Around 1.5% of the trios are inferred to be mediation (eQTL [-&gt;] mediator [-&gt;] target), around 1.3% fully connected among the three nodes, and just a handful v-structures (eQTL [-&gt;] gene 1 [&lt;-] gene 2). Unexpectedly, across the tissues, on average more than half of the mediation trios have the trans-gene as the mediator. Most of the mediators (cis and trans) are tissue specific, and cis-gene mediators are significantly enriched for protein-coding genes, whereas trans-gene mediators have a similar distribution of protein-coding genes and lncRNAs to the whole genome.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, high-throughput perturbational datasets have become an important tool for rapidly characterizing the function of large collections of chemical compounds. To overcome the biological and technical noise in these experiments, researchers have used consensus signatures - averages of multiple experiments - to summarize the effects of perturbations. In this work, we demonstrate that consensus signatures on the L1000 Connectivity Map show a pervasive similarity bias: as more signatures are averaged, the resulting consensus signatures are increasingly similar to each other, regardless of whether the signatures are related. We show that the distribution of Pearsons correlation changes as a function of the number of signatures averaged. The artifactual similarity bias is caused by skewness in the data and a consequence of using median normalization on non-normal distributions. Furthermore, we show that mean normalization can partly remedy this similarity bias and improve power to identify associations. The similarity bias introduced by consensus signatures is an important potential confounder of analysis of perturbational datasets, and our practical solution could easily be applied by practitioners in the field to improve the analysis of the L1000 Connectivity Map.",

    "abstract": "In disciplines from biology to climate science, a routine task is to compute a correlation between a pair of time series, and determine whether the correlation is statistically significant (i.e. unlikely under the null hypothesis that the time series are independent). This problem is challenging because time series typically exhibit autocorrelation, which cannot be properly analyzed with the standard iid-oriented statistical tests. Although there are well-known parametric tests for time series, these are designed for linear correlation statistics and thus not suitable for the increasingly popular nonlinear correlation statistics. Among nonparametric tests, the conditions that guarantee correct false positive rates are either restrictive or unclear. Here we describe the truncated time-shift (TTS) test, a nonparametric procedure to test for dependence between two time series. We prove that this test is valid as long as one of the time series is stationary, a minimally restrictive requirement among current tests. The TTS test is versatile because it can be used with any correlation statistic. Using synthetic data, we demonstrate that this test performs correctly even while other tests suffer high false positive rates. In simulation examples, simple guidelines for parameter choices allow high statistical power to be achieved with sufficient data. We apply the test to data sets from climatology, animal behavior and microbiome science, verifying previously discovered dependence relationships and detecting additional relationships.",

    "abstract": "MotivationHi-C is a widely used technique to study the 3D organization of the genome. Due to its high sequencing cost, most of the generated datasets are of coarse resolution, which makes it impractical to study finer chromatin features such as Topologically Associating Domains (TADs) and chromatin loops. Multiple deep-learning-based methods have recently been proposed to increase the resolution of these data sets by imputing Hi-C reads (typically called upscaling). However, the existing works evaluate these methods on either synthetically downsampled or a small subset of experimentally generated sparse Hi-C datasets, making it hard to establish their generalizability in the real-world use case. We present our framework - Hi-CY - that compares existing Hi-C resolution upscaling methods on seven experimentally generated low-resolution Hi-C datasets belonging to various levels of read sparsities originating from three cell lines on a comprehensive set of evaluation metrics. Hi-CY also includes four downstream analysis tasks, such as TAD and chromatin loops recall, to provide a thorough report on the generalizability of these methods.\n\nResultsWe observe that existing deep-learning methods fail to generalize to experimentally generated sparse Hi-C datasets showing a performance reduction of up to 57 %. As a potential solution, we find that retraining deep-learning based methods with experimentally generated Hi-C datasets improves performance by up to 31%. More importantly, Hi-CY shows that even with retraining, the existing deep-learning based methods struggle to recover biological features such as chromatin loops and TADs when provided with sparse Hi-C datasets. Our study, through Hi-CY framework, highlights the need for rigorous evaluation in future. We identify specific avenues for improvements in the current deep learning-based Hi-C upscaling methods, including but not limited to using experimentally generated datasets for training.\n\nAvailabilityhttps://github.com/rsinghlab/Hi-CY\n\nAuthor SummaryWe evaluate deep learning-based Hi-C upscaling methods with our framework Hi-CY using seven datasets originating from three cell lines evaluated using three correlation metrics, four Hi-C similarity metrics, and four downstream analysis tasks, including TAD and chromatin loop recovery. We identify a distributional shift between Hi-C contact matrices generated from downsampled and experimentally generated sparse Hi-C datasets. We use Hi-CY to establish that the existing methods trained with downsampled Hi-C datasets tend to perform significantly worse on experimentally generated Hi-C datasets. We explore potential strategies to alleviate the drop in performance such as retraining models with experimentally generated datasets. Our results suggest that retraining improves performance up to 31 % on five sparse GM12878 datsets but provides marginal improvement in cross cell-type setting. Moreover, we observe that regardless of the training scheme, all deep-learning based methods struggle to recover biological features such as TADs and chromatin loops when provided with very sparse experimentally generated datasets as inputs.",

    "abstract": "The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has made a serious public health threat globally. To discover key molecular changes in COVID-19 and its secondary complications, we analyzed next-generation sequencing (NGS) data of COVID-19. NGS data (GSE163151) was screened and downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database (GEO). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in the present study, using DESeq2 package in R programming software. Gene ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analysis were performed, and the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, module analysis, miRNA-hub gene regulatory network and TF-hub gene regulatory network were established. Subsequently, receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis was used to validate the diagonostics valuesof the hub genes. Firstly, 954 DEGs (477 up regulated and 477 down regulated) were identified from the four NGS dataset. GO enrichment analysis revealed enrichment of DEGs in genes related to the immune system process and multicellular organismal process, and REACTOME pathway enrichment analysis showed enrichment of DEGs in the immune system and formation of the cornified envelope. Hub genes were identified from the PPI network, module analysis, miRNA-hub gene regulatory network and TF-hub gene regulatory network. Furthermore, the ROC analysis indicate that COVID-19 and its secondary complications with following hub genes, namely, RPL10, FYN, FLNA, EEF1A1, UBA52, BMI1, ACTN2, CRMP1, TRIM42 and PTCH1, had good diagnostics values. This study identified several genes associated with COVID-19 and its secondary complications, which improves our knowledge of the disease mechanism.",

    "abstract": "European genetic ancestry originates from three main ancestral populations - Western hunter-gatherers, early European farmers and Yamnaya Eurasian herders - whose edges geographically met in present-day France. Despite its central role to our understanding of how the ancestral populations interacted and gave rise to modern population structure, the population history of France has remained largely understudied. Here, we analysed the high-coverage whole-genome sequences and genome-wide genotype profiles of respectively 856 and 3,234 present-day individuals from the northern half of France, and merged them with publicly available present-day and ancient Europe-wide genotype datasets. We also explored, for the first time, the whole-genome sequences of six mediaeval individuals (300-1100 CE) from Western France to gain insights into the genetic impact of what is commonly known as the Migration Period in Europe. We found extensive fine-scale population structure across Brittany and the downstream Loire basin, emphasising the need for investigating local populations to better understand the distribution of rare and putatively deleterious variants across space. Overall, we observed an increased population differentiation between the northern and southern sides of the river Loire, which are characterised by different proportions of steppe vs. Neolithic-related ancestry. Samples from Western Brittany carry the largest levels of steppe ancestry and show high levels of allele sharing with individuals associated with the Bell Beaker complex, levels that are only comparable with those found in populations lying on the northwestern edges of Europe. Together, our results imply that present-day individuals from Western Brittany retain substantial legacy of the genetic changes that occurred in Northwestern Europe following the arrival of the Bell Beaker people c. 2500 BCE. Such genetic legacy may explain the sharing of disease-related alleles with other present-day populations from Western Britain and Ireland.",

    "abstract": "In this study we report 21 ancient shotgun genomes from present-day Western Hungary, from previously understudied Late Copper Age Baden, and Bronze Age Somogyvar-Vinkovci, Kisapostag, and Encrusted Pottery archaeological cultures (3530 - 1620 cal BCE). Our results indicate the presence of high steppe ancestry in the Somogyvar-Vinkovci culture. They were then replaced by the Kisapostag group, who exhibit an outstandingly high (up to [~]47%) Mesolithic hunter-gatherer ancestry, despite this component being thought to be highly diluted by the time of the Early Bronze Age. The Kisapostag population contributed the genetic basis for the succeeding community of the Encrusted pottery culture. We also found an elevated hunter-gatherer component in a local Baden culture associated individual, but no connections were proven to the Bronze Age individuals. The hunter-gatherer ancestry in Kisapostag is likely derived from two main sources, one from a Funnelbeaker or Globular Amphora culture related population and one from a previously unrecognised source in Eastern Europe. We show that this ancestry not only appeared in various groups in Bronze Age Central Europe, but also made contributions to Baltic populations. The social structure of Kisapostag and Encrusted pottery cultures is patrilocal, similarly to most contemporaneous groups. Furthermore, we developed new methods and method standards for computational analyses of ancient DNA, implemented to our newly developed and freely available bioinformatic package. By analysing clinical traits, we found carriers of aneuploidy and inheritable genetic diseases. Finally, based on genetic and anthropological data, we present here the first female facial reconstruction from the Bronze Age Carpathian Basin.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning was shown to be effective at identifying distinctive genomic signatures among viral sequences. These signatures are defined as pervasive motifs in the viral genome that allow discrimination between species or variants. In the context of SARS-CoV-2, the identification of these signatures can assist in taxonomic and phylogenetic studies, improve in the recognition and definition of emerging variants, and aid in the characterization of functional properties of polymorphic gene products. In this paper, we assess KEVOLVE, an approach based on a genetic algorithm with a machine-learning kernel, to identify multiple genomic signatures based on minimal sets of k-mers. In a comparative study, in which we analyzed large SARS-CoV-2 genome dataset, KEVOLVE was more effective at identifying variant-discriminative signatures than several gold-standard statistical tools. Subsequently, these signatures were characterized using a new extension of KEVOLVE (KANALYZER) to highlight variations of the discriminative signatures among different classes of variants, their genomic location, and the mutations involved. The majority of identified signatures were associated with known mutations among the different variants, in terms of functional and pathological impact based on available literature. Here we showed that KEVOLVE is a robust machine learning approach to identify discriminative signatures among SARS-CoV-2 variants, which are frequently also biologically relevant, while bypassing multiple sequence alignments.

    "abstract": "Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are essential to understanding biological pathways as well as their roles in development and disease. Computational tools, based on classic machine learning, have been successful at predicting PPIs in silico, but the lack of consistent and reliable frameworks for this task has led to network models that are difficult to compare and discrepancies between algorithms that remain unexplained. To better understand the underlying inference mechanisms that underpin these models, we designed an open-source framework for benchmarking that accounts for a range of biological and statistical pitfalls while facilitating reproducibility. We use it to shed light on the impact of network topology and how different algorithms deal with highly connected proteins. By studying functional genomics-based and sequence-based models on human PPIs, we show their complementarity as the former performs best on lone proteins while the latter specialises in interactions involving hubs. We also show that algorithm design has little impact on performance with functional genomic data. We replicate our results between both human and S. cerevisiae data and demonstrate that models using functional genomics are better suited to PPI prediction across species. With rapidly increasing amounts of sequence and functional genomics data, our study provides a principled foundation for future construction, comparison and application of PPI networks.",

    "abstract": "Viral infection of farmed fish and shellfish represents a major issue within the aquaculture industry. One potential control strategy involves RNA interference of viral gene expression through the oral delivery of specific double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). In previous work we have shown that recombinant dsRNA can be produced in the chloroplast of the edible microalga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and used to control disease in shrimp. Here we report a significant improvement in antiviral dsRNA production and its use to protect shrimp against white spot syndrome virus (WSSV). A new strategy for dsRNA synthesis was developed that uses two convergent copies of the endogenous rrnS promoter to drive high level transcription of both strands of the WSSV gene element in the chloroplast. New vectors were designed that allow rapid Golden Gate-mediated assembly of a transformation plasmid in which the  dual promoter-WSSV DNA cassette is targeted into the chloroplast genome, with selection based on the restoration of photosynthesis. PCR analysis of transformant lines confirmed the integration of the cassette and homoplasmy of the polyploid genome. Transcribed sense and antisense VP28-RNA were hypothesised to form an RNA duplex in the chloroplast stroma, and quantitative RT-PCR indicated that [~]100 g dsRNA is produced per litre of transgenic microalgae culture. This represents an [~]10,000-fold increase in dsRNA relative to previous reports using convergent psaA promoters. The engineered alga was assessed for its ability to prevent WSSV infection when fed to shrimp larvae prior to a challenge with the virus. Survival of shrimp fed with dsRNA-expressing C. reinhardtii was significantly enhanced (68.3%) relative to the negative control. The study suggests that this new dsRNA production platform is significantly more efficient than that reported previously, and merits further scale-up and downstream processing studies.",

It directly models spatial transcriptome raw count without assuming a parametric model.

    "abstract": "Long non-coding ribonucleic acids (lncRNAs) have been shown to play an important role in plant gene regulation, involving both epigenetic and transcript regulation. LncRNAs are transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides that are not translated into functional proteins but can be translated into small peptides. Machine learning models have predominantly used transcriptome data with manually defined features to detect lncRNAs, however, they often underrepresent the abundance of lncRNAs and can be biased in their detection. Here we present a study using Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to identify plant lncRNAs from genomic sequences rather than transcriptomic data. The NLP models were trained to predict lncRNAs for seven model and crop species (Zea mays, Arabidopsis thaliana, Brassica napus, Brassica oleracea, Brassica rapa, Glycine max and Oryza sativa) using publicly available genomic references. We demonstrated that lncRNAs can be accurately predicted from genomic sequences with the highest accuracy of 83.4% for Z. mays and the lowest accuracy of 57.9% for B. rapa, revealing that genome assembly quality might affect the accuracy of lncRNA identification. Furthermore, we demonstrated the potential of using NLP models for cross-species prediction with an average of 63.1% accuracy using target species not previously seen by the model. As more species are incorporated into the training datasets, we expect the accuracy to increase, becoming a more reliable tool for uncovering novel lncRNAs. Finally, we show that the models can be interpreted using explainable artificial intelligence to identify motifs important to lncRNA prediction and that these motifs frequently flanked the lncRNA sequence.\n\nHighlightsO_LIWe demonstrate for the first time the identification of lncRNAs from genomic sequences, instead of transcriptome sequences, allowing the identification of lowly expressed lncRNAs.\nC_LIO_LIA deep learning model (natural language processing) was employed to predict lncRNAs in two monocot and five dicot plant species.\nC_LIO_LIWe used explainable machine learning to extract the genomic motifs associated with lncRNA identification and highlighted potentially conserved structures.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The Sequence Read Archive public database has reached 45 Peta-bytes of raw sequences and doubles its nucleotide content every two years. Although BLAST-like methods can routinely search for a sequence in a small collection of genomes, making searchable immense public resources accessible is beyond the reach of alignment-based strategies. In recent years, abundant literature tackled the task of finding a sequence in extensive sequence collections using k-mer-based strategies. At present, the most scalable methods are approximate membership query data structures that combine the ability to query small signatures or variants while being scalable to collections up to 10,000 eukaryotic samples. Here, we present PAC, a novel approximate membership query data structure for querying collections of sequence datasets. PAC index construction works in a streaming fashion without any disk footprint besides the index itself. It shows a 3 to 6 fold improvement in construction time compared to other compressed methods for comparable index size. A PAC query can need single random access and be performed in constant time in favorable instances. Using limited computation resources, we built PAC for very large collections. They include 32,000 human RNA-seq samples in five days, the entire Genbank bacterial genome collection in a single day for an index size of 3.5TB. The latter is, to our knowledge, the largest sequence collection ever indexed using an approximate membership query structure. We also showed that PACs ability to query 500,000 transcript sequences in less than an hour. PACs open-source software is available at https://github.com/Malfoy/PAC.",

    "abstract": "Individual cells exhibit substantial heterogeneity in protein abundance and activity, which is frequently reflected in broad distributions of fluorescently labeled reporters. Since all cellular components are intrinsically fluorescent to some extent, the observed distributions contain background noise that masks the natural heterogeneity of cellular populations. This limits our ability to characterize cell-fate decision processes that are key for development, immune response, tissue homeostasis, and many other biological functions. It is therefore important to separate the contributions from signal and noise in single-cell measurements. Addressing this issue rigorously requires deconvolving the noise distribution from the signal, but approaches in that direction are still limited. Here we present a non-parametric Bayesian formalism that performs such a deconvolution efficiently on multidimensional measurements, in a way that allows us to estimate confidence intervals. We use the approach to study the expression of the mesodermal transcription factor Brachyury in mouse embryonic stem cells undergoing differentiation.",

    "abstract": "AbstractSelective pressures on DNA sequences often result in departures from neutral evolution that can be captured by the McDonald-Kreitman (MK) test. However, the nature of such selective forces often remains unknown to experimentalists. Amino acid fixations driven by natural selection in protein coding genes are commonly associated with a genetic arms race or changing biological purposes, leading to proteins with new functionality. Here, we evaluate the expectations of a buffering mechanism driving selective amino acids to fixation, which is motivated by an observed phenotypic rescue of otherwise deleterious nonsynonymous substitutions at bag of marbles (bam) and Sex lethal (Sxl). These two important genes in Drosophila melanogaster were shown to experience strong episodic bursts of natural selection potentially due to infections of the endosymbiotic bacteria Wolbachia observed among multiple Drosophila species. Using simulations to implement and evaluate the evolutionary dynamics of a Wolbachia buffering model, we demonstrate that selectively fixed amino acid replacements will occur, but that proportion of adaptive amino acid fixations and the statistical power of the MK test to detect the departure from an equilibrium neutral model are both significantly lower than seen for an arms race/change-in-function model that favors proteins with diversified amino acids.",

    "abstract": "Tissue- and organism-level biological processes often involve coordinated action of multiple distinct cell types. Current computational methods for the analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, however, are not designed to capture co-variation of cell states across samples, in part due to the low number of biological samples in most scRNA-seq datasets. Recent advances in sample multiplexing have enabled population-scale scRNA-seq measurements of tens to hundreds of samples. To take advantage of such datasets, here we introduce a computational approach called single-cell Interpretable Tensor Decomposition (scITD). This method extracts \"multicellular gene expression patterns\" that capture how sample-specific expression states of a cell type are correlated with the expression states of other cell types. Such multicellular patterns can reveal molecular mechanisms underlying coordinated changes of different cell types within the tissue, and can be used to stratify individuals in a clinically-relevant and reproducible manner. We first validated the performance of scITD using in vitro experimental data and simulations. We then applied scITD to scRNA-seq data on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 115 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and 56 healthy controls. We recapitulated a well-established pan-cell-type signature of interferon-signaling that was associated with the presence of anti-dsDNA autoantibodies and a disease activity index. We further identified a novel multicellular pattern linked to nephritis, which was characterized by an expansion of activated memory B cells along with helper T cell activation. Our approach also sheds light on ligand-receptor interactions potentially mediating these multicellular patterns. As validation, we demonstrated that these expression patterns also stratified donors from a pediatric SLE dataset by the same phenotypic attributes. Lastly, we found the interferon multicellular pattern and others to be conserved in a COVID-19 dataset, pointing to the presence of both general and disease-specific patterns of inter-individual immune variation. Overall, scITD is a flexible method for exploring co-variation of cell states in multi-sample single-cell datasets, which can yield new insights into complex non-cell-autonomous dependencies that define and stratify disease.",

    "abstract": "Cells have evolved communication methods to sense their microenvironments and send biological signals. In addition to the communication using ligands and receptors, cells use diverse channels including gap junctions to communicate with their immediate neighbors. Current approaches, however, cannot effectively capture the influence of various microenvironments. Here, we propose a novel approach that identifies cell neighbor-dependent gene expression (CellNeighborEX). After categorizing cells based on their microenvironment from spatial transcriptomics (ST) data, CellNeighborEX identifies diverse gene sets associated with partnering cell types, providing further insight. To categorize cells along with their environment, CellNeighborEX uses direct cell location or the mixture of transcriptome from multiple cells depending on the ST technology. We show that cells express different gene sets depending on the neighboring cell types in various tissues including mouse embryos, brain, and liver cancer. These genes were associated with development (in embryos) or metastases (liver cancer). We further validate that gene expression can be induced by neighboring partners. The neighbor-dependent gene expression suggests new potential genes involved in cell-cell interactions beyond what ligand-receptor co-expression can discover.",

Clonotyping, which groups Ig sequences into B cell clones, is crucial in investigating the diversity of repertoires and changes in antigen exposure. Despite its importance, there is no widely accepted method for clonotyping, and existing methods are computationally intensive for large sequencing datasets.\n\nResultsTo address this challenge, we introduce YClon, a fast and efficient approach for clonotyping Ig repertoire data. YClon uses a hierarchical clustering approach, similar to other methods, to group Ig sequences into B cell clones in a highly sensitive and specific manner. Notably, our approach outperforms other methods by being more than 30 to 5000 times faster in processing the repertoires analyzed. Astonishingly, YClon can effortlessly handle up to 2 million Ig sequences on a standard laptop computer. This enables in-depth analysis of large and numerous antibody repertoires.\n\nAvailability and implementationYClon was implemented in Python3 and is freely available on GitHub\n\n(https://github.com/jao321/YClon.git)\n\nContact: joaodgervasio@gmail.com, liza@icb.ufmg.br",

These data were analyzed using a dedicated approach to detect selection signatures linked to phenotypic traits in order to uncover potential candidate genes that may be under adaptation to specific environments.\n\nResultsGenetic data analysis of European pig breeds revealed four main axes of genetic variation represented by Iberian and modern breeds (i.e. Large White, Landrace, and Duroc). In addition, breeds clustered according to their geographical origin, for example French Gascon and Basque breeds, Italian Apulo Calabrese and Casertana breeds, Spanish Iberian and Portuguese Alentejano breeds. Principal component analysis of phenotypic data distinguished between larger and leaner breeds with better growth potential and reproductive performance on one hand and breeds that were smaller, fatter, and had low growth and reproductive efficiency on the other hand. Linking selection signatures with phenotype identified 16 significant genomic regions associated with stature, 24 with fatness, 2 with growth and 192 with reproduction. Among them, several regions contained candidate genes with possible biological effect on stature, fatness, growth and reproduction performance traits. For example, strong associations were found for stature in two regions containing the ANXA4 and ANTXR1 genes, for fatness containing the DNMT3A and POMC genes and for reproductive performance containing the HSD17B7 gene.\n\nConclusionsThe present study on European local pig breeds used a dedicated approach for searching selection signatures supported by phenotypic data at the breed level to identify potential candidate genes that may have adapted to different living environments and production systems. Results can be useful to define conservation programs of local pig breeds.",

    "abstract": "The Dam1 complex is essential for mitotic progression across evolutionarily divergent fungi. Upon analyzing amino acid (aa) sequences of Dad2, a Dam1 complex subunit, we identified a conserved 10-aa-long Dad2 signature sequence (DSS). An arginine residue (R126) in the DSS is essential for viability in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that possesses point centromeres. The corresponding arginine residues are functionally important but not essential for viability in Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans, both carry several kilobases long regional centromeres. The purified recombinant Dam1 complex containing either Dad2{Delta}DSS or Dad2R126A failed to bind microtubules (MTs) or form any visible rings like the wild-type complex. Intriguingly, functional analysis revealed that the requirement of the conserved arginine residue for chromosome biorientation and mitotic progression reduced with increasing centromere length. We propose that plasticity of the invariant arginine of Dad2 in organisms with regional centromeres is achieved by conditional elevation of the kinetochore protein(s) to enable multiple kinetochore MTs (kMTs) to bind to each chromosome. The capacity of a chromosome to bind multiple kMTs may mask deleterious effects of such lethal mutations.",

    "abstract": "Muscle degeneration is the most prevalent cause for frailty and dependency in inherited diseases and ageing, affecting hundreds of millions of people. Elucidation of pathophysiological mechanisms, as well as effective treatments for muscle diseases represents an important goal in improving human health. Here, we show that phosphatidylethanolamine cytidyltransferase (PCYT2/ECT), the critical enzyme of the Kennedy branch of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) synthesis pathway, has an essential role in muscle health. Human genetic deficiency in PCYT2 causes a severe disease with failure to thrive and progressive muscle weakness. Pcyt2 mutant zebrafish recapitulate the patient phenotypes, indicating that the role of PCYT2/PE in muscle is evolutionary conserved. Muscle specific Pcyt2 knockout mice exhibited failure to thrive, impaired muscle development, progressive muscle weakness, muscle loss, accelerated ageing, and reduced lifespan. Mechanistically, Pcyt2 deficiency affects mitochondrial bioenergetics and physicochemical properties of the myofiber membrane lipid bilayer, in particular under exercise strain. We also show that PCYT2 activity declines in the aging muscles of humans and mice. AAV-based delivery of PCYT2 rescued muscle weakness in Pcyt2 knock-out mice and, importantly, improved muscle strength in old mice, offering a novel therapeutic avenue for rare disease patients and muscle aging. Thus, PCYT2 plays a fundamental, specific, and conserved role in vertebrate muscle health, linking PCYT2 and PCYT2 synthesized PE lipids to severe muscle dystrophy, exercise intolerance and aging.",

    "abstract": "Single cell profiling techniques including multi-omics and spatial-omics technologies allow researchers to study cell-cell variation within a cell population. These variations extend to biological networks within cells, in particular, the gene regulatory networks (GRNs). GRNs rewire as the cells evolve, and different cells can have different governing GRNs. However, existing GRN inference methods usually infer a single GRN for a population of cells, without exploring the cell-cell variation in terms of their regulatory mechanisms. Recently, jointly profiled single cell transcriptomics and chromatin accessibility data have been used to infer GRNs. Although methods based on such multi-omics data were shown to improve over the accuracy of methods using only single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data, they do not take full advantage of the single cell resolution chromatin accessibility data.\n\nWe propose CeSpGRN (Cell Specific Gene Regulatory Network inference), which infers cell-specific GRNs from scRNA-seq, single cell multi-omics, or single cell spatial-omics data. CeSpGRN uses a Gaussian weighted kernel that allows the GRN of a given cell to be learned from the sequencing profile of itself and its neighboring cells in the developmental process. The kernel is constructed from the similarity of gene expressions or spatial locations between cells. When the chromatin accessibility data is available, CeSpGRN constructs cell-specific prior networks which are used to further improve the inference accuracy.\n\nWe applied CeSpGRN to various types of real-world datasets and inferred various regulation changes that were shown to be important in cell development. We also quantitatively measured the performance of CeSpGRN on simulated datasets and compared with baseline methods. The results show that CeSpGRN has a superior performance in reconstructing the GRN for each cell, as well as in detecting the regulatory interactions that differ between cells.

    "abstract": "Effective public health strategies for preventing infectious diseases require a deep understanding of transmission dynamics. However, epidemiological data alone is often insufficient for guiding public health action, as transmission patterns emerge from complex human-environment interactions. Additionally, collecting empirical data is frequently limited by cost and logistical challenges, especially in low-resource settings. Consequently, health policy increasingly relies on inference models that account for spatial and temporal dimensions, confounding factors, and uncertainty.\n\nIn this work, we introduce a novel hierarchical mechanistic Bayesian model based on ecological diffusion to improve epidemiological inference for spreading pathogens. This model is specifically designed to reveal underlying spatiotemporal dynamics from empirical data, explicitly accounting for sampling bias and uncertainty. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we apply the model to simulated data of a drug-resistant pathogen and formally compare its performance to state-of-the-art epidemiological regression models.\n\nOur findings show that the model accurately identifies transmission patterns and is particularly effective at pinpointing transmission hotspots and predicting spread pathways--critical capabilities for controlling drug-resistant pathogens. While reliable monitoring remains challenging in low-resource environments, this model addresses demographic sampling bias and spatiotemporal complexities, though concentrated sampling in presumed high-risk areas can sometimes distort transmission insights.\n\nThe proposed framework can inform targeted public health interventions in the early stages of resistance emergence, offering valuable guidance for resource-constrained settings.",

    "abstract": "Recombination is an essential process in bacterial drug resistance evolution. Fluoroquinolones, an important class of antibiotics, are known to stimulate recombination in Escherichia coli. When bacteria are exposed to antibiotics other than fluoroquinolones, including strong up-regulators of recombination pathways, there is no detectable change in the recombination level. Here we explore why fluoroquinolones, but not other antimicrobials, increase recombination rates. Fluoroquinolones, in contrast to other antibiotics, generate DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). We tested whether other drugs that also cause double-strand breaks, such as mitomycin C and bleomycin, also affect bacterial recombination rates with consistent increases in recombination. A positive correlation between the number of DSBs and the recombination frequency was found. The manipulation of the level of DSBs directly impacted the recombination frequency. Our results highlight that only antibiotics that induce DNA double-strand breaks are more probable to increase genetic diversity via recombination. The stimulation of recombination by DSB-causing antimicrobials is an additional factor leading to the risk of antibiotic resistance evolution.",

    "abstract": "The reshaping of the DNA methylome landscape after prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) has been well-documented in the adult brain, therefore a long time after the end of the exposure. However, the question of the immediate deposition or loss of DNA methylation marks in the prenatal neocortex, just after the end of PAE has not yet been directly addressed, genome widely.\n\nUsing a binge-drinking-like model of PAE and capture of the DNA methylome, we have identified differentially methylated regions (DMRs) that are established immediately, within two hours after the end of PAE. Remarkably, these DMRs are prominently and statistically associated with: (i) enhancers that are active in the brain, associated with GO terms of importance for neurogenesis, neurodevelopment, and neuronal differentiation; (ii) genes that, in physiological conditions show dynamic gain in chromatin accessibility and/or upregulation of their expression in the time-window of exposure; (iii) imprinted genes and members of protocadherin genes clusters, two gene families playing key roles in neurodevelopment, whose mono-allelically expression is regulated by DNA methylation and impaired upon PAE. We observed that DMR-containing mono-allelically expressed genes, as well as other genes important for neurodevelopment, are also immediately upregulated upon PAE, suggesting that these early DNA methylation perturbations are thus highly susceptible to rapidly alter gene expression after PAE. DMRs in imprinted and protocadherin genes have been previously identified, both in the adult rodent brain prior-exposed to alcohol prenatally, and in cohorts of children diagnosed with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Our study thus strongly suggests that the DNA methylation profiles of key regulatory regions of these gene families are very quickly disturbed after the PAE and that these immediate altered regions could be persistently affected long after the stress. This strongly reinforces their potential as future biomarkers of PAE. In addition, binge-drinking-like PAE provokes immediate rewiring of the transcriptome with potentially dual consequences: 1) beneficial impacts that could support the recovery of cells from alcohol exposure, through slowing down of protein synthesis and energy-consuming respiratory pathways; 2) detrimental effects, through the inappropriate activation of critical pathways may directly perturb neurodevelopment.\n\nEthical issuesThe breeding and treatments of wild type C57BL/6N mice, used for the experimental protocols described in this study have been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Ethical Committee of the Paris Cite University (registration number CEEA-40).

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWMolecular phylogenies are a cornerstone of modern comparative biology and are commonly employed to investigate a range of biological phenomena, such as diversification rates, patterns in trait evolution, biogeography, and community assembly. Recent work has demonstrated that significant biases may be introduced into downstream phylogenetic analyses from processing genomic data; however, it remains unclear whether there are interactions among bioinformatic parameters or biases introduced through the choice of reference genome for sequence alignment and variant-calling. We address these knowledge gaps by employing a combination of simulated and empirical data sets to investigate to what extent the choice of reference genome in upstream bioinformatic processing of genomic data influences phylogenetic inference, as well as the way that reference genome choice interacts with bioinformatic filtering choices and phylogenetic inference method. We demonstrate that more stringent minor allele filters bias inferred trees away from the true species tree topology, and that these biased trees tend to be more imbalanced and have a higher center of gravity than the true trees. We find greatest topological accuracy when filtering sites for minor allele count >3-4 in our 51-taxa data sets, while tree center of gravity was closest to the true value when filtering for sites with minor allele count >1-2. In contrast, filtering for missing data increased accuracy in the inferred topologies; however, this effect was small in comparison to the effect of minor allele filters and may be undesirable due to a subsequent mutation spectrum distortion. The bias introduced by these filters differs based on the reference genome used in short read alignment, providing further support that choosing a reference genome for alignment is an important bioinformatic decision with implications for downstream analyses. These results demonstrate that attributes of the study system and dataset (and their interaction) add important nuance for how best to assemble and filter short read genomic data for phylogenetic inference.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWMolecular phylogenies are a cornerstone of modern comparative biology and are commonly employed to investigate a range of biological phenomena, such as diversification rates, patterns in trait evolution, biogeography, and community assembly. Recent work has demonstrated that significant biases may be introduced into downstream phylogenetic analyses from processing genomic data; however, it remains unclear whether there are interactions among bioinformatic parameters or biases introduced through the choice of reference genome for sequence alignment and variant-calling. We address these knowledge gaps by employing a combination of simulated and empirical data sets to investigate to what extent the choice of reference genome in upstream bioinformatic processing of genomic data influences phylogenetic inference, as well as the way that reference genome choice interacts with bioinformatic filtering choices and phylogenetic inference method. We demonstrate that more stringent minor allele filters bias inferred trees away from the true species tree topology, and that these biased trees tend to be more imbalanced and have a higher center of gravity than the true trees. We find greatest topological accuracy when filtering sites for minor allele count >3-4 in our 51-taxa data sets, while tree center of gravity was closest to the true value when filtering for sites with minor allele count >1-2. In contrast, filtering for missing data increased accuracy in the inferred topologies; however, this effect was small in comparison to the effect of minor allele filters and may be undesirable due to a subsequent mutation spectrum distortion. The bias introduced by these filters differs based on the reference genome used in short read alignment, providing further support that choosing a reference genome for alignment is an important bioinformatic decision with implications for downstream analyses. These results demonstrate that attributes of the study system and dataset (and their interaction) add important nuance for how best to assemble and filter short read genomic data for phylogenetic inference.",

    "abstract": "Post-translational methylation of proteins, which occurs in arginines and lysines, modulates several biological processes at different levels of cell signaling. Recently, methylation has been demonstrated in the regulation beyond histones, for example, in the dynamics of protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions. However, the presence and role of non-histone methylation in Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiologic agent of Chagas disease, has not yet been elucidated. Here, we applied mass spectrometry-based-proteomics (LC-MS/MS) to describe the methylproteome of T. cruzi epimastigotes. A total of 1253 methyl sites in 824 methylated proteins were identified, of these, 712 (86.4%) proteins were identified in two or more biological replicates. Our results of functional enrichment analysis, protein-protein interaction, and co-occurrence with other PTMs, show that protein methylation impacts different levels of biological processes, such translation, RNA and DNA binding, amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism. In addition, 171 methylated proteins were previously reported with phosphorylation sites in T. cruzi, including flagellar proteins and RNA binding proteins, indicating that there may be an interplay between these different modifications in non-histone proteins. Our results show that a broad spectrum of functions are affected by methylation indicating its potential to impact important processes in the biology of the parasite and other trypanosomes.\n\nStatement of the significanceTrypanosoma cruzi is a protozoan parasite that causes Chagas disease in humans and faces different environmental changes throughout its life cycle. Protein methylation is an important post-translational modification by which cells respond and adapt to the environment. We applied mass spectrometry-based proteomics and reported the first proteomic analysis of arginine and lysine methylation in T. cruzi. Our data demonstrate that protein methylation is broad and impacts different cellular processes in T. cruzi. This study represents a significant advance in the investigation of the importance of protein methylation in trypanosomes.",

We present Single-cell TOtal RNA-seq Miniaturized (STORM-seq), a random- hexamer primed, ribo-reduced single-cell total RNA sequencing (sc-total-RNA-seq) protocol using standard laboratory equipment. Adapted as a kit, STORM-seq constructs sequence-ready libraries in one working day, producing the highest complexity scRNA- seq libraries to-date, robustly measuring transcript isoforms and clinically relevant gene fusions in single cells. STORM-seq faithfully reconstructs expression profiles of locus- level transposable elements (TEs), and provides high-resolution profiling of transient, low- abundance enhancer RNAs (eRNAs), offering a powerful tool to dissect single-cell gene regulatory networks in unprecedented detail. Applied to human fallopian tube epithelium, the improved transcriptional resolution reveals a putative progenitor-like population and intermediate cell states, shaped by TEs and non-coding RNAs.",

    "abstract": "The recent growth of single-cell transcriptomics has turned single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) into a near-routine experiment. Breakthroughs in improving scalability have led to the creation of organism-wide transcriptomic datasets, aiming to comprehensively profile the cell types and states within an organism throughout its lifecycle. To date, however, the skeleton remains a majorly underrepresented organ system in organism-wide atlases. Considering how the skeleton not only serves as the central framework of the vertebrate body but is also the home of the hematopoietic niche and a central player in major metabolic and homeostatic processes, this presents a major deficit in current reference atlas projects. To address this issue, we integrated ten separate scRNA-seq datasets containing limb skeletal cells and their developmental precursors, generating an atlas of 133 332 cells. This limb skeletal cell atlas describes cells across the mesenchymal lineage from the induction of the limb to the adult bone and encompasses 39 different cell states. Furthermore, expanding the repertoire of available time points and cell types within a single dataset allowed for more complete analyses of cell-cell communication or in silico perturbation studies. Taken together, we present a missing piece in the current atlas mapping efforts, which will be of value to researchers in the fields of skeletal biology, hematopoiesis, metabolism and regenerative medicine.",

    "abstract": "MSclassifR is an R package that has been specifically designed to improve the classification of mass spectra obtained from MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. It offers a comprehensive range of functions that are focused on processing mass spectra, identifying discriminant m/z values, and making accurate predictions. The package introduces innovative algorithms for selecting discriminating m/z values and making predictions. To assess the effectiveness of these methods, extensive tests were conducted using challenging real datasets, including bacterial subspecies of the Mycobacterium abscessus complex, virulent and avirulent phenotypes of Escherichia coli, different species of Streptococci and nasal swabs from individuals infected and uninfected with SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, multiple datasets of varying sizes were created from these real datasets to evaluate the robustness of the algorithms. The results demonstrated that the Machine Learning-based pipelines in MSclassifR achieved high levels of accuracy and Kappa values. On an in-house dataset, some pipelines even achieved more than 95% mean accuracy, whereas commercial system only achieved 62% mean accuracy. Certain methods showed greater resilience to changes in dataset sizes when constructing Machine Learning-based pipelines. These simulations also helped determine the minimum sizes of training sets required to obtain reliable results. The package is freely available online, and its open-source nature encourages collaborative development, customization, and fosters innovation within the community focused on improving diagnosis based on MALDI-TOF spectra.\n\nKey pointsO_LIMSclassifR is a comprehensive R package enabling the construction of data analysis pipelines for the precise classification of mass spectra.\nC_LIO_LIOur R package contains an innovative method for variable selection from random forests, which delivered excellent results on real data.\nC_LIO_LIIn-depth analysis of various machine learning-based pipelines using our package allowed us to make conclusions about the optimal m/z selection and prediction methods depending on the size of the training dataset.\nC_LIO_LIUsing a publicly available dataset of mass spectra obtained from various MALDI-TOF instruments across different countries, MSclassifR is able to build robust pipelines capable of adapting to different instruments in an automatic way.\nC_LIO_LIWhen tested on an in-house dataset, MSclassifR pipelines consistently outperformed a commercial software in terms of prediction accuracy.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Constructing joint representations from multimodal single-cell datasets is crucial for understanding cellular heterogeneity and function. Traditional methods, such as factor analysis and kNN-based approaches, face computational limitations with scalability across large datasets and multiple modalities. In this work, we demonstrate the product-of-experts VAE-based model, which offers a flexible, scalable solution for integrating multimodal data, allowing for the seamless mapping of both unimodal and multimodal queries onto a reference atlas. We evaluate how different strategies for combining modalities in the VAE framework impact query-to-reference mapping across diverse datasets, including CITE-seq and spatial metabolomics. Our benchmarks assess batch effect correction, biological signal preservation, and imputation of missing modalities. We showcase our approach in a mosaic setting, integrating CITE-seq and multiome data to accurately map unimodal and multimodal queries into the joint latent space. We extend this to spatial data by integrating gene expression and metabolomics from paired Visium and MALDI-MSI slides, achieving a high correlation in metabolite predictions from spatial gene expression. Our results demonstrate that this VAE-based framework is scalable, robust, and easily applicable across multiple modalities, providing a powerful tool for data imputation, querying, and biological discovery.",

    "abstract": "PurposeMetabarcoding, and metagenomic sequencing have enabled the characterization of highly diverse environmental communities. The challenge of estimating the metabolic functions carried out by these communities has led to the development of several state-of-the-art methods, most of which are tailored to a specific gene marker. However, the increasing diversity of approaches resulting from advances in sequencing technologies drives the need for methods capable of handling heterogeneous microbial community data. Moreover, predictions often depend on their internal analysis pipelines and are influenced by the underlying databases, which link marker genes to specific functional annotations. This limits users ability to evaluate the quality of predictions by tracing internal data and processes. Finally, users are constrained by the specific annotations provided by these methods (e.g. EC numbers), limiting their ability to conduct further specialized analyses based on intermediate results.\n\nMethodsEsMeCaTa predicts consensus proteomes and their associated functions from taxonomic affiliations. A key feature of EsMeCaTa is its explainability and flexibility. To support the flexible integration of heterogeneous sequencing data, EsMeCaTa utilizes taxonomic affiliations obtained through analyses of diverse sequencing datasets. To provide insight into the knowledge available for each taxonomic affliation and to interpret the relevance of predicted functions, EsMeCaTa identifies a taxonomic rank within a given affliation that is suffciently represented by documented proteomes in the UniProt database. The proteins of the UniProt proteomes are clustered and filtered according to a threshold to create consensus proteomes. These consensus proteomes are automatically annotated with functional information (e.g., EC numbers, GO terms) but they are also designed to be used in further customized annotation workflows. Functional annotations are reported in a functional table, which can be enriched with taxon abundances to generate comprehensive functional profiles.\n\nResultsEsMeCaTa predictions have been validated using multiple datasets and compared to a state-of-the-art method. Additionally, it was applied to a novel metabarcoding dataset from a methanogenic reactor, characterizing the microbial community and biogas production across different time points and intake condition. Our results demonstrate the link between biogas production, intake condition and the dynamics of the metabolic functions predicted by EsMeCaTa in the microbial communities.",

Some SUMOylated substrates are modified by both SUMO1 and SUMO2/3, while others show biased modifications towards SUMO1 or SUMO2/3. How preferential SUMO protein conjugation is coordinated is poorly understood.\n\nHere, we examine a modification of the catalytic component of the human SUMO Activation Enzyme, SAE2. We observe that lysine 164 of SAE2 is deacetylated during mitosis in an HDAC6-dependent manner. We find that an acetyl-analogue mutant, SAE2-K164Q, biases the activation and conjugation of SUMO2>SUMO1 and discriminates SUMO1 and SUMO2/3 through their C-terminal tails.\n\nComplementation of SAE2-depleted or inhibited cells with SAE2-K164Q restricts mitotic SUMO1-conjugates and increases multipolar spindle formation. We confirm the SUMO E1-dependent modification of the nuclear mitotic apparatus, NuMA, and find that the mitotic defects of both SAE2-K164Q complemented cells and HDAC6-inhibitor-treated cells are corrected by either over-expression of SUMO1 or by expression of a GFP-SUMO1-NuMA-K1766R fusion protein.\n\nOur observations suggest a model in which the SAE1:SAE2 enzyme is deacetylated on early mitosis to encourage the conjugation of SUMO1 to support mitotic fidelity. These surprising data reveal that the SUMO-activating enzyme can bias SUMO variant conjugation.",

    "abstract": "DNA methylation (DNAm) is influenced by genetic and environmental factors, and can be used to understand interindividual variability in genomic regulation. Co-methylation between DNAm sites is a known phenomenon, but the architecture of relationships between the approximately 450,000 (450k) sites commonly measured in epidemiological studies has not been described. We investigate whether interindividual co-methylation structure amongst the 450k sites changes with age, whether it differs between UK-born White (n=849, 910, 921 and 424) and Pakistani ancestry (n=439) individuals, and how it relates to genome regulation.\n\nWe find stability between birth and adolescence, across cohorts, and between two ethnic groups. Highly correlated DNAm sites in close proximity are heritable, but these relationships are weakly influenced by nearby genetic variants, and are enriched for transcription factor (TF) binding sites related to regulation of short RNAs transcribed by RNA polymerase III. Highly correlated sites that are distant, or on different chromosomes (in trans), are driven by common and unique environmental factors, with methylation at these sites less likely to be driven by genotype. Trans co-methylated DNAm sites are enriched for multiple TF binding sites and for inter-chromosomal chromatin contact sites, suggesting DNA co-methylation of distant sites may relate to long-range cooperative TF interactions.\n\nWe conclude that DNA co-methylation has a stable structure from birth to adolescence, and between UK-born White and Pakistani individuals. This stable structure might have implications for future design and interpretation of epigenetic studies. We hypothesise that co-methylation may have roles in genome regulation in humans, including 3D chromatin architecture.",

    "abstract": "Living cells utilize signaling pathways to sense, transduce, and process information. As the extracellular stimulation often has rich temporal characteristics which may govern dynamic cellular responses, it is important to quantify the rate of information flow through the signaling pathways. In this study, we used an epithelial cell line expressing a light-activatable FGF receptor and an ERK activity reporter to assess the ability of the MAPK/ERK pathway to transduce signal encoded in a sequence of pulses. By stimulating the cells with random light pulse trains, we demonstrated that the MAPK/ERK channel capacity is at least 6 bits per hour. The input reconstruction algorithm detects the light pulses with 1-min accuracy 5 min after their occurrence. The high information transmission rate may enable the pathway to coordinate multiple processes including cell movement and respond to rapidly varying stimuli such as chemoattracting gradients created by other cells.\n\nAuthor summaryTo respond to external stimulation, living cells need to transfer information from membrane receptors to downstream proteins that regulate physiological outcomes. In this study we used cells expressing a light-activatable receptor that transmits signals to MAPK/ERK transduction pathway, which regulates numerous physiological processes including proliferation, differentiation and cell motility. By stimulating these cells with various sequences of short light pulses we found that ERK, the last component of the considered signal transduction pathway, may receive at least 6 bits per hour. This bitrate allows 6 binary decisions per hour, enabling rapid responses to varied extracellular stimuli.",

    "abstract": "Retrotransposons are a reservoir of cis-regulatory innovation1-3. Developmental programs that activate these elements could, in principle, manifest in lineage-specific retrotransposition. Somatic LINE-1 (L1) retrotransposon insertions have been detected in human and non-human primate neurons4-7. It is however unknown whether L1 is mobile in only some neuronal lineages, or therein regulates neurodevelopmental genes. Here, we report programmed L1 activation by SOX6, a transcription factor critical for parvalbumin (PV) interneuron development8-10. PV+ neurons permit L1 mobilization in vitro and in vivo, harbor unmethylated L1 promoters, and express full-length L1 mRNAs and proteins. Via nanopore long-read sequencing, we identify unmethylated L1 promoters proximal to PV+ neuron genes. One such L1, which promotes transcription of a novel CAPS2 gene isoform, significantly enhances neuron morphological complexity when phenotyped in vitro. These data highlight the contribution made by L1 cis-regulatory elements to PV+ neuron development and transcriptome diversity, uncovered due to L1 mobility in this milieu.",

    "abstract": "Sweet orange (SWO) has one of the largest numbers of cultivar groups in Citrus with diverse horticultural traits just through asexual breeding. However, the molecular mechanism driving its fast selection and diversification is unclear. In this study, we completely surveyed the transposon activities in SWO genomes and unraveled six transposon families with up to 8,974.2-fold activity increase in modern SWO cultivars. Based on the transposon insertion phylogenetic tree, we inferred that modern SWOs date back to a common ancestor [~]500 years ago and reconstructed three major spread events in SWO cultivation history. Activation, acceleration, and silencing of the six families have recurred in distinct lineages. Their insertions are presented as tag mutations for all SWO cultivar groups and can distinguish over 99% of all analyzed SWO accessions. The insertions are enriched in impacting plant development and hormone signaling. This study demonstrated the importance of transposon activities in asexual breeding.",

While such resources are often treated as ground truth, we find that in widely used reference datasets such as the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD), some variants pass gold standard filters yet are systematically different in their genotype calls across genotype discovery approaches. The inclusion of such discordant sites in study designs involving multiple genotype discovery strategies could bias results and lead to false-positive hits in association studies due to technological artifacts rather than a true relationship to the phenotype. Here, we describe this phenomenon of discordant genotype calls across genotype discovery approaches, characterize the error mode of wrong calls, provide a blacklist of discordant sites identified in gnomAD that should be treated with caution in analyses, and present a metric and machine learning classifier trained on gnomAD data to identify likely discordant variants in other datasets. We find that different genotype discovery approaches have different sets of variants at which this problem occurs but that there are characteristic variant features that can be used to predict discordant behavior. Discordant sites are largely shared across ancestry groups, though different populations are powered for discovery of different variants. We find that the most common error mode is that of a variant being heterozygous for one approach and homozygous for the other, with heterozygous in the genomes and homozygous reference in the exomes making up the majority of miscalls.",

    "abstract": "Modern machine learning models towards various tasks with omic data analysis give rise to threats of privacy leakage of patients involved in those datasets. Despite the advances in different privacy technologies, existing methods tend to introduce too much computational cost (e.g. cryptographic methods) or noise (e.g. differential privacy), which hampers either model usefulness or accuracy in protecting privacy in biological data. Here, we proposed a secure and privacy-preserving machine learning method (PPML-Omics) by designing a decentralized version of the differential private federated learning algorithm. We applied PPML-Omics to analyze data from three sequencing technologies, and addressed the privacy concern in three major tasks of omic data, namely cancer classification with bulk RNA-seq, clustering with single-cell RNA-seq, and the integration of spatial gene expression and tumour morphology with spatial transcriptomics, under three representative deep learning models. We also examined privacy breaches in depth through privacy attack experiments and demonstrated that PPML-Omics could protect patients privacy. In each of these applications, PPML-Omics was able to outperform methods of comparison under the same level of privacy guarantee, demonstrating the versatility of the method in simultaneously balancing the privacy-preserving capability and utility in practical omic data analysis. Furthermore, we gave the theoretical proof of the privacy-preserving capability of PPML-Omics, suggesting the first mathematically guaranteed method with robust and generalizable empirical performance in protecting patients privacy in omic data.",

Previous PCA-LMM comparisons give mixed results, unclear guidance, and have several limitations, including not varying the number of principal components (PCs), simulating simple population structures, and inconsistent use of real data and power evaluations. We evaluate PCA and LMM both varying number of PCs in realistic genotype and complex trait simulations including admixed families, subpopulation trees, and real multiethnic human datasets with simulated traits. We find that LMM without PCs usually performs best, with the largest effects in family simulations and real human datasets and traits without environment effects. Poor PCA performance on human datasets is driven by large numbers of distant relatives more than the smaller number of closer relatives. While PCA was known to fail on family data, we report strong effects of family relatedness in genetically diverse human datasets, not avoided by pruning close relatives. Environment effects driven by geography and ethnicity are better modeled with LMM including those labels instead of PCs. This work better characterizes the severe limitations of PCA compared to LMM in modeling the complex relatedness structures of multiethnic human data for association studies.",

    "abstract": "Most human complex traits are enormously polygenic, with thousands of contributing variants with small effects, spread across much of the genome. These observations raise questions about why so many variants-and so many genes-impact any given phenotype. Here we consider a possible model in which variant effects are due to competition among genes for pools of shared intracellular resources such as RNA polymerases. To this end, we describe a simple theoretical model of resource competition for polymerases during transcription. We show that as long as a gene uses only a small fraction of the overall supply of polymerases, competition with other genes for this supply will only have a negligible effect on variation in the genes expression. In particular, although resource competition increases the proportion of heritability explained by trans-eQTLs, this effect is far too small to account for the roughly 70% of expression heritability thought to be due to trans-regulation. Similarly, we find that competition will only have an appreciable effect on complex traits under very limited conditions: that core genes collectively use a large fraction of the cellular pool of polymerases and their overall expression level is strongly correlated (or anti-correlated) with trait values. Our qualitative results should hold for a wide family of models relating to cellular resource limitations. We conclude that, for most traits, resource competition is not a major source of complex trait heritability.",

    "abstract": "The mu opioid receptor (OR), a prototypic member of the large G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, represents an important target of therapeutic and abused drugs. To date, most of our understanding of OR activity has focused on signal transducers and regulatory molecules including G proteins, GPCR kinases, and beta-arrestins. Yet it is clear that signaling through the OR is coordinated by additional proteins recruited into the proximal interaction network of the activated receptor, which have largely remained invisible given the lack of technologies to interrogate these networks systematically.\n\nHere, we implement a quantitative proteomics pipeline leveraging the chemical diversity of OR agonists and APEX-based proximity labeling to investigate the protein networks that underlie OR signaling. We leverage a novel computational framework to extract subcellular location, trafficking, and functional partners of GPCR activity from the proximity labeling datasets. Applying this unbiased, systematic approach to the OR, we demonstrate that opioid agonists exert differences in the OR proximal proteome mediated by endocytosis and subsequent endosomal sorting, exemplified by VPS35 and COMMD3. Moreover, we identify two novel OR network components, EYA4 and KCTD12, that are recruited into the receptor proximal network irrespective of the activating ligand and independent of receptor trafficking but based on receptor-triggered G protein activation. We provide functional evidence that these network components form a previously unrecognized buffering system for G protein activity which broadly modulates cellular GPCR signaling.",

However, the exact localization of the FluPol on the genome or the timing of its snatching activity remains poorly characterized. Here, we have monitored IAV infection from the perspective of the FluPol interaction with the host chromatin template. Quantification of chromatin-bound RNAs shows a significant perturbation in host transcription that correlates with a relocalization of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) from the gene bodies to downstream intergenic regions. This extended transcription leading to the production of RNA downstream of genes (DoGs) was previously linked to the NS1-mediated inhibition of the transcriptional termination. However, immunoprecipitation of FluPol-bound RNA in the chromatin fraction revealed that FluPol remains linked to nascent host transcripts during phases of transcriptional elongation and termination, thereby extending the window of opportunity in which cap-snatching may occur. In addition, chromatin-associated FluPol was enriched at transcription termination sites, suggesting that it may participate in the virus-induced termination defects. Finally, we observed that, rather than targeting just highly expressed genes, the FluPol was preferentially recruited to promoters activated by the viral infection and enhancers. Together, these observations suggest the FluPol uses the early immune response to target regulatory elements of defense-related genes at which it interferes with the fate of the transcripts, and possibly also limits RNAPII re-initiation by impairing the termination process.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe influenza A virus (IAV) exploits the transcriptional machinery of the infected cells to generate its own RNAs with the viral polymerase (FluPol) hijacking cap structures from host mRNAs. This \"cap snatching\" requires an interaction between FluPol and the cellular RNA polymerase (RNAPII) accumulating at transcription start sites (TSS) of genes. In parallel, another IAV factor interferes the termination of gene transcription, resulting in frequent transcription downstream of genes and reduced recycling of the RNAPII. Here, employing genome-wide ChIP assays, we show that FluPol selectively targets the TSS of infection-activated genes often associated with cellular defense mechanisms, and thereby contributing to their downregulation. In addition, we show that FluPol is not only recruited to promoters and enhancers, but also within genes, where it interacts with nascent RNAs during transcription and splicing. It is further detected beyond the 3 end of the genes, suggesting that FluPol exerts a broad influence on host transcription by affecting both transcription initiation through cap-snatching and transcription re-initiation via its involvement in the virus-induced transcription-termination defect at the end of genes.",

    "abstract": "Techniques for genome-wide epigenetic profiling have been undergoing accelerated development toward recovery of high-quality data from bulk and single cell samples. DNA-protein interactions have traditionally been profiled via chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by next generation sequencing (ChIP-seq), which has become the gold standard for studying histone modifications or transcription factor binding. Cleavage Under Targets & Tagmentation (CUT&Tag) is a rapidly expanding new technique that enables profiling of such interactions in situ at high sensitivity and is adaptable to single cell applications. However, thorough evaluation and benchmarking against established ChIP-seq datasets are lacking. Here, we comprehensively benchmarked CUT&Tag for H3K27ac and H3K27me3 against published ChIP-seq profiles from ENCODE in K562 cells. Combining multiple new and published CUT&Tag datasets, there was an average recall of 54% known ENCODE peaks for both histone modifications. To optimize data analysis steps, we tested peak callers MACS2 and SEACR and identified optimal peak calling parameters. Considering both precision and recall of known ENCODE peaks, the peak callers were comparable in their performance, although peaks produced by MACS2 match ENCODE peak width distributions more closely. We found that reducing PCR cycles during library preparation lowered duplication rates at the expense of ENCODE peak recovery. Despite the moderate ENCODE peak recovery, peaks identified by CUT&Tag represent the strongest ENCODE peaks and show the same functional and biological enrichments as ChIP-seq peaks identified by ENCODE. Our workflow systematically evaluates the merits of methodological adjustments, providing a benchmarking framework for the experimental design and analysis of CUT&Tag studies, and will facilitate future efforts to apply CUT&Tag in human tissues and single cells.",

To address this issue, we have developed a statistical method called CSeQTL that allows for ct-eQTL mapping using bulk RNA-seq count data while taking advantage of allele-specific expression. We validated the results of CSeQTL through simulations and real data analysis, comparing CSeQTL results to those obtained from purified bulk RNA-seq data or single cell RNA-seq data. Using our ct-eQTL findings, we were able to identify cell types relevant to 21 categories of human traits.",

    "abstract": "Unicellular organisms adapt to their changing environments by gene regulatory switches that sense chemical cues and induce specific target genes when the inducing signal is over a critical threshold. Using mathematical modeling we here show that, because growth rate sets the dilution rate of intracellular molecules, the sensitivity of gene regulatory switches automatically couples to growth rate, in a way that can be exploited by natural selection. We confirm the modeling predictions by experimentally demonstrating that, as nutrient quality is varied, the concentration of inducer required for activating the lac operon in E. coli increases quadratically with the populations growth rate. Our theory further predicts that, when growth rate is instead modulated by translation inhibition, critical inducer levels are invariant, and we experimentally validate this prediction as well. Moreover, we establish that this growth-coupled sensitivity allows bacteria to implement concentration-dependent sugar preferences, in which a new carbon source is used only if its concentration is high enough to improve upon the current growth rate of the cells. Using microfluidics in combination with time-lapse microscopy, we validate experimentally that this strategy governs how mixtures of glucose and lactose are used in E. coli at single-cell level. Overall, growth-coupled sensitivity provides a general mechanism through which cells can  mute external signals in beneficial conditions when growth is fast, and become highly sensitive to alternative nutrients or stresses when growth is slow or arrested.",

    "abstract": "Retinitis pigmentosa (RP), is the most common inherited retinal degeneration (IRD), leading to vision loss via dysfunction and death of photoreceptor cells and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Mutations in the pre-mRNA processing factor 31 (PRPF31) gene are associated with autosomal dominant RP, impairing RPE function. While adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated gene therapy shows promise for treating IRDs, the slow progression of these diseases often makes timely measurement of clinical efficacy challenging. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are lipid enclosed vesicles secreted by cells and their RNA contents are being explored as circulating biomarkers of cancer and other diseases. We hypothesize that EV RNAs could serve as biomarkers of the health status of the neural retina and RPE health. To test this, we used PRPF31+/+ and PRPF31+/- human-induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived RPE (hi-RPE) to investigate the RNAs contained in RPE-derived EVs, and how they change in disease. We also compared the RNA contents of RPE-EVs with the RNAs contained in the hi-RPE cells themselves. We found that EVs from mutant PRPF31+/- hi-RPE cells have distinct RNA profiles compared to those from control cells, suggesting EV RNA contents change during disease and could serve as biomarkers for retinal degeneration.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundRandom Forests (RF) are a widely used modelling tool, enabling feature-selection via a variable importance measure. For this, a threshold is required that separates label-associated features from false positives. In the absence of a good understanding of the characteristics of the variable importance measures, current approaches attempt to select features by training multiple RFs to generate statistical power via a permutation null, employ recursive feature elimination or a combination of both. However, for high-dimensional datasets, such as genome data with millions of variables, this is computationally infeasible.\n\nMethodWe present RFlocalfdr, a statistical approach for thresholding that identifies which features are significantly associated with the prediction label and reduces false positives. It builds on the empirical Bayes argument of Efron (2005) and models the variable importance as mixture of two distributions - null and non-null \"genes.\"\n\nResultWe demonstrate on synthetic data that RFlocalfdr has an equivalent accuracy to computationally more intensive approaches, while being up to 100 times faster. RFlocalfdr is the only tested method able to successfully threshold a dataset with 6 Million features and 10,000 samples. RFlocalfdr performs analysis in real-time and is compatible with any RF implementation that returns variable importance and counts, such as ranger or VariantSpark.\n\nConclusionRFlocalfdr allows for robust feature selection by placing a confidence value on the predicted importance score. It does so without repeated fitting of the RF or the use of additional shadow variables and is thus usable for data sets with very large numbers of variables.",

    "abstract": "In mitosis, sister chromatids are preferred repair templates for homologous recombination, whereas in meiosis interhomolog-based repair is promoted. How this switch, which is a defining event in sexual reproduction, is accomplished remains poorly understood. In budding yeast, a meiosis-specific complex consisting of Red1, Hop1 and Mek1 (RHMc) enforces meiotic interhomolog bias, potentially through inhibition of intersister-based repair. The current data points to a linear assembly governing RHMc formation: the HORMA protein Hop1 associates with Red1 via a closure-motif-HORMA domain interaction, and Mek1 kinase is recruited through phospho-mediated interactions with Hop1. Here, via expression in mitotic cells we autonomously establish the RHM complex. In vivo analysis complemented with in vitro biochemical reconstitution shows that Mek1 associates with Red1, in a manner that might resemble binding of other kinases with scaffolding activators. The NH2-terminus of Red1 contributes to Hop1 binding, suggesting cooperative binding between Red1 and the HORMA domain of Hop1, beyond closure motif-based interactions. Meiotic activation of Mek1 kinase is dictated by complex formation and upstream DNA break-dependent signaling. We find Mek1 can be activated under DNA damaging conditions in mitotically dividing cells, where activation depends on upstream Mec1 kinase function and RHMc integrity. We perform a structure-function analysis of RHMc formation and Mek1 activation. Finally, we show that activation of Mek1 in mitosis leads to rad51{Delta}-like DNA break sensitivity, providing evidence for the model that RHMc instates meiotic interhomolog-based repair by inhibiting  mitotic homologous recombination. Our analysis enables querying downstream effects of RHMc action on DNA repair. Because aberrant re-expression of homologs of Red1 and Hop1 leads to DNA repair defects in human cancer, our system can be used to study roles of these genes during tumorigenesis.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMorphological and traditional genetic studies of the young Pliocene genus Hyles have led to the understanding that despite its importance for taxonomy, phenotypic similarity of wing patterns does not correlate with phylogenetic relationship. To gain insights into various aspects of speciation in the Spurge Hawkmoth (Hyles euphorbiae), we assembled a chromosome-level genome and investigated some of its characteristics.\n\nResultsThe genome of a male H. euphorbiae was sequenced using PacBio and Hi-C data, yielding a 504 Mb assembly (scaffold N50 of 18.2 Mb) with 99.9% of data represented by the 29 largest scaffolds forming the haploid chromosome set. Consistent with this, FISH analysis of the karyotype revealed n = 29 chromosomes and a WZ/ZZ (female/male) sex chromosome system. Estimates of chromosome length based on the karyotype image provided an additional quality metric of assembled chromosome size. Rescaffolding the published male H. vespertilio genome resulted in a high-quality assembly (651 Mb, scaffold N50 of 22 Mb) with 98% of sequence data in the 29 chromosomes. The larger genome size of H. vespertilio (average 1C DNA value of 562 Mb) was accompanied by a proportional increase in repeats from 45% in H. euphorbiae (measured as 472 Mb) to almost 55% in H. vespertilio. Several wing pattern genes were found on the same chromosomes in the two species, with varying amounts and positions of repetitive elements and inversions possibly corrupting their function.\n\nConclusionsOur two-fold comparative genomics approach revealed high gene synteny of the Hyles genomes to other Sphingidae and high correspondence to intact Merian elements, the ancestral linkage groups of Lepidoptera, with the exception of three simple fusion events. We propose a standardized approach for genome taxonomy using nucleotide homology via scaffold chaining as the primary tool combined with Oxford plots based on Merian elements to infer and visualize directionality of chromosomal rearrangements. The identification of wing pattern genes promises future understanding of the evolution of forewing patterns in the genus Hyles, although further sequencing data from more individuals are needed. The genomic data obtained provide additional reliable references for further comparative studies in hawkmoths (Sphingidae).",

To gain insights into various aspects of speciation in the Spurge Hawkmoth (Hyles euphorbiae), we assembled a chromosome-level genome and investigated some of its characteristics.\n\nResultsThe genome of a male H. euphorbiae was sequenced using PacBio and Hi-C data, yielding a 504 Mb assembly (scaffold N50 of 18.2 Mb) with 99.9% of data represented by the 29 largest scaffolds forming the haploid chromosome set. Consistent with this, FISH analysis of the karyotype revealed n = 29 chromosomes and a WZ/ZZ (female/male) sex chromosome system. Estimates of chromosome length based on the karyotype image provided an additional quality metric of assembled chromosome size. Rescaffolding the published male H. vespertilio genome resulted in a high-quality assembly (651 Mb, scaffold N50 of 22 Mb) with 98% of sequence data in the 29 chromosomes. The larger genome size of H. vespertilio (average 1C DNA value of 562 Mb) was accompanied by a proportional increase in repeats from 45% in H. euphorbiae (measured as 472 Mb) to almost 55% in H. vespertilio. Several wing pattern genes were found on the same chromosomes in the two species, with varying amounts and positions of repetitive elements and inversions possibly corrupting their function.\n\nConclusionsOur two-fold comparative genomics approach revealed high gene synteny of the Hyles genomes to other Sphingidae and high correspondence to intact Merian elements, the ancestral linkage groups of Lepidoptera, with the exception of three simple fusion events. We propose a standardized approach for genome taxonomy using nucleotide homology via scaffold chaining as the primary tool combined with Oxford plots based on Merian elements to infer and visualize directionality of chromosomal rearrangements. The identification of wing pattern genes promises future understanding of the evolution of forewing patterns in the genus Hyles, although further sequencing data from more individuals are needed. The genomic data obtained provide additional reliable references for further comparative studies in hawkmoths (Sphingidae).",

    "abstract": "Neuronal activity-dependent transcription directs molecular processes that regulate synaptic plasticity, brain circuit development, behavioral adaptation, and long-term memory. Single cell RNA-sequencing technologies (scRNAseq) are rapidly developing and allow for the interrogation of activity-dependent transcription at cellular resolution. Here, we present NEUROeSTIMator, a deep learning model that integrates transcriptomic signals to estimate neuronal activation in a way that we demonstrate is associated with Patch-seq electrophysiological features and that is robust against differences in species, cell type, and brain region. We demonstrate this methods ability to accurately detect neuronal activity in previously published studies of single cell activity-induced gene expression. Further, we applied our model in a spatial transcriptomic study to identify unique patterns of learning-induced activity across different brain regions. Altogether, our findings establish NEUROeSTIMator as a powerful and broadly applicable tool for measuring neuronal activation, whether as a critical covariate or a primary readout of interest.",
