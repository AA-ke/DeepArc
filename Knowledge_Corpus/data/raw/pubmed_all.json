    "title": "Genome-Wide Identification and Expression Analysis of HD-ZIP I Gene Subfamily in Nicotiana tabacum.",
    "abstract": "The homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-Zip) gene family, whose members play vital roles in plant growth and development, and participate in responding to various stresses, is an important class of transcription factors currently only found in plants. Although the HD-Zip gene family, especially the HD-Zip I subfamily, has been extensively studied in many plant species, the systematic report on HD-Zip I subfamily in cultivated tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) is lacking. In this study, 39 HD-Zip I genes were systematically identified in N. tabacum (Nt). Interestingly, that 64.5% of the 31 genes with definite chromosome location information were found to originate from N. tomentosoformis, one of the two ancestral species of allotetraploid N. tabacum. Phylogenetic analysis divided the NtHD-Zip I subfamily into eight clades. Analysis of gene structures showed that NtHD-Zip I proteins contained conserved homeodomain and leucine-zipper domains. Three-dimensional structure analysis revealed that most NtHD-Zip I proteins in each clade, except for those in clade eta, share a similar structure to their counterparts in Arabidopsis. Prediction of cis-regulatory elements showed that a number of elements responding to abscisic acid and different abiotic stresses, including low temperature, drought, and salinity, existed in the promoter region of NtHD-Zip I genes. The prediction of Arabidopsis ortholog-based protein-protein interaction network implied that NtHD-Zip I proteins have complex connections. The expression profile of these genes showed that different NtHD-Zip I genes were highly expressed in different tissues and could respond to abscisic acid and low-temperature treatments. Our study provides insights into the evolution and expression patterns of NtHD-Zip I genes in N. tabacum and will be useful for further functional characterization of NtHD-Zip I genes in the future.",

    "title": "Divergent expression patterns of miR164 and CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON genes in palms and other monocots: implication for the evolution of meristem function in angiosperms.",
    "abstract": "In order to understand how the morphology of plant species has diversified over time, it is necessary to decipher how the underlying developmental programs have evolved. The regulatory network controlling shoot meristem activity is likely to have played an important role in morphological diversification and useful insights can be gained by comparing monocots and eudicots. These two distinct monophyletic groups of angiosperms diverged 130 Ma and are characterized by important differences in their morphology. Several studies of eudicot species have revealed a conserved role for NAM and CUC3 genes in meristem functioning and pattern formation through the definition of morphogenetic boundaries during development. In this study, we show that NAM- and CUC3-related genes are conserved in palms and grasses, their diversification having predated the radiation of monocots and eudicots. Moreover, the NAM-miR164 posttranscriptional regulatory module is also conserved in palm species. However, in contrast to the CUC3-related genes, which share a similar expression pattern between the two angiosperm groups, the expression domain of the NAM-miR164 module differs between monocot and eudicot species. In our studies of spatial expression patterns, we compared existing eudicot data with novel results from our work using two palm species (date palm and oil palm) and two members of the Poaceae (rice and millet). In addition to contrasting results obtained at the gene expression level, major differences were also observed between eudicot and monocot NAM-related genes in the occurrence of putative cis-regulatory elements in their promoter sequences. Overall, our results suggest that although NAM- and CUC3-related proteins are functionally equivalent between monocots and eudicots, evolutionary radiation has resulted in heterotopy through alterations in the expression domain of the NAM-miR164 regulatory module.",

    "abstract": "Hybrid internal-terminal exons function as either internal or terminal exons. Their evolutionary origins remain unclear. Here, we investigate the phylogenetic origin and regulation of a hybrid exon, 9A9', in the TPM1 gene encoding tropomyosin alpha-1. We demonstrate that exon 9A9' was originally terminal in non-vertebrate deuterostomes and switched to internal in vertebrates through the exonization of a downstream exon, 9B. While the terminal nature of exon 9A9' was lost in most vertebrates, it was conserved in amphibians and coelacanths where it behaves as a hybrid internal-terminal exon. Using Xenopus laevis as a model, we show that the preservation of terminal exon 9A9' in the tpm1 gene likely arose from evolutionary pressures to mitigate the developmental toxicity linked to exon 9B inclusion during neurulation. We identify two peculiarities of terminal exon 9A9': it lies downstream of an AG-independent intron, and its definition is supported by an intronic cis-regulatory element, the UTE, which enhances recognition of the weak cleavage-polyadenylation site. Our findings characterize the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of hybrid internal-terminal exons and reveal how evolutionary pressures can reactivate vestigial traits to resolve developmental challenges. This work broadens our understanding of alternative splicing evolution and its significance in vertebrate development.",

    "title": "The gypsy insulator can function as a promoter-specific silencer in the Drosophila embryo.",
    "abstract": "The Drosophila gypsy retrotransposon disrupts gene activity by blocking the interactions of distal enhancers with target promoters. This enhancer-blocking activity is mediated by a 340 bp insulator DNA within gypsy. The insulator contains a cluster of binding sites for a zinc finger protein, suppressor of Hairy wing [su(Hw)]. Recent studies have shown that a second protein, mod(mdg4), is also important for normal insulator function. Mutations in mod(mdg4) exert paradoxical effects on different gypsy-induced phenotypes. For example, it enhances yellow2 but suppresses cut6. Here, we employ a stripe expression assay in transgenic embryos to investigate the role of mod(mdg4) in gypsy insulator activity. The insulator was inserted between defined enhancers and placed among divergently transcribed reporter genes (white and lacZ) containing distinct core promoter sequences. These assays indicate that mod(mdg4) is essential for the enhancer-blocking activity of the insulator DNA. Moreover, reductions in mod(mdg4)+ activity cause the insulator to function as a promoter-specific silencer that selectively represses white, but not lacZ. The repression of white does not affect the expression of the closely linked lacZ gene, suggesting that the insulator does not propagate changes in chromatin structure. These results provide an explanation for why mod(mdg4) exerts differential effects on different gypsy-induced mutations.",

    "abstract": "The precise spatiotemporal expression of the hematopoietic ETS transcription factor PU.1, a key determinant of hematopoietic cell fates, is tightly regulated at the chromatin level. However, how chromatin signatures are linked to this dynamic expression pattern across different blood cell lineages remains uncharacterized. Here, we performed an in-depth analysis of the relationships between gene expression, chromatin structure, 3D architecture, and trans-acting factors at PU.1 cis-regulatory elements (PCREs). By identifying phylogenetically conserved DNA elements within chromatin-accessible regions in primary human blood lineages, we discovered multiple novel candidate PCREs within the upstream region of the human PU.1 locus. A subset of these elements localizes within an 8-kb-wide cluster exhibiting enhancer features, including open chromatin, demethylated DNA, enriched enhancer histone marks, present enhancer RNAs, and PU.1 occupation, presumably mediating PU.1 autoregulation. Importantly, we revealed the presence of a common 35-kb-wide CTCF-flanked insulated neighborhood that contains the PCRE cluster (PCREC), forming a chromatin territory for lineage-specific and PCRE-mediated chromatin interactions. These include functional PCRE-promoter interactions in myeloid and B cells that are absent in erythroid and T cells. By correlating chromatin structure and 3D architecture with PU.1 expression in various lineages, we were able to attribute enhancer versus silencer functions to individual elements. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into the interplay between dynamic chromatin structure and 3D architecture in the chromatin regulation of PU.1 expression. This study lays crucial groundwork for additional experimental studies that validate and dissect the role of PCREs in epigenetic regulation of normal and malignant hematopoiesis.",

    "abstract": "Topologically associating domains (TADs) and chromatin architectural loops impact promoter-enhancer interactions, with CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) defining TAD borders and loop anchors. TAD boundaries and loops progressively strengthen upon embryonic stem (ES) cell differentiation, underscoring the importance of chromatin topology in ontogeny. However, the mechanisms driving this process remain unclear. Here we show a widespread increase in CTCF-RNA-binding protein (RBP) interactions upon ES to neural stem (NS) cell differentiation. While dispensable in ES cells, RBPs reinforce CTCF-anchored chromatin topology in NS cells. We identify Pantr1, a non-coding RNA, as a key facilitator of CTCF-RBP interactions, promoting chromatin maturation. Using acute CTCF degradation, we find that, through its insulator function, CTCF helps maintain neuronal gene silencing in NS cells by acting as a barrier to untimely gene activation during development. Altogether, we reveal a fundamental mechanism driving developmentally linked chromatin structural consolidation and the contribution of this process to the control of gene expression in differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Boundary or insulator elements set up independent territories of gene activity by establishing higher order domains of chromatin structure. The gypsy retrotransposon of Drosophila contains an insulator element that represses enhancer-promoter interactions and is responsible for the mutant phenotypes caused by insertion of this element. The gypsy insulator inhibits the interaction of promoter-distal enhancers with the transcription complex without affecting the functionality of promoter-proximal enhancers; in addition, these sequences can buffer a transgene from chromosomal position effects. Two proteins have been identified that bind gypsy insulator sequences and are responsible for their effects on transcription. The suppressor of Hairy-wing [su(Hw)] protein affects enhancer function both upstream and downstream of its binding site by causing a silencing effect similar to that of heterochromatin. The modifier of mdg4 [mod(mdg4)] protein interacts with su(Hw) to transform this bi-directional repression into the polar effect characteristic of insulators. These effects seem to be modulated by changes in chromatin structure.",

This broad range of activities poses questions about how a single protein can perform so many seemingly different and unrelated functions. Current studies argue that GAF acts as a \"pioneer\" factor, generating nucleosome-free regions of chromatin for different classes of regulatory elements. The removal of nucleosomes from regulatory elements in turn enables other factors to bind to these elements and carry out their specialized functions. Consistent with this view, GAF associates with a collection of chromatin remodelers and also interacts with proteins implicated in different regulatory functions. In this review, we summarize the known activities of GAF and the functions of its protein partners.",

    "abstract": "In this review, we look at the most recent studies of DNA elements that function over long genomic distances to regulate gene transcription and will discuss the mechanisms genes employ to overcome the positive and negative influences of their genomic neighbourhood in order to achieve accurate programmes of expression. Enhancer elements activate high levels of transcription of linked genes from distal locations. Recent technological advances have demonstrated chromatin loop interactions between enhancers and their target promoters. Moreover, there is increasing evidence that these dynamic interactions regulate the repositioning of genes to foci of active transcription within the nucleus. Enhancers have the potential to activate a number of neighbouring genes over a large chromosomal region, hence, their action must be restricted in order to prevent activation of non-target genes. This is achieved by specialized DNA sequences, termed enhancer blockers (or insulators), that interfere with an enhancer's ability to communicate with a target promoter when positioned between the two. Here, we summarize current models of enhancer blocking activity and discuss recent findings of how it can be dynamically regulated. It has become clear that enhancer blocking elements should not be considered only as structural elements on the periphery of gene loci, but as regulatory elements that are crucial to the outcome of gene expression. The transcription potential of a gene can also be susceptible to heterochromatic silencing originating from its chromatin environment. Insulator elements can act as barriers to the spread of heterochromatin. We discuss recent evidence supporting a number of non-exclusive mechanisms of barrier action, which mostly describe the modulation of chromatin structure or modification.",

    "abstract": "Developmentally regulated genes are often controlled by distant enhancers, silencers and insulators, to implement their correct transcriptional programs. In recent years, the development of 3C and derived techniques (4C, 5C, HiC, ChIA-PET, etc.) has confirmed that chromatin looping is an important mechanism for the transfer of regulatory information in mammalian cells. At many developmentally regulated gene loci, transcriptional activation is indeed accompanied by the formation of chromatin loops between genes and distant enhancers. Similarly, dynamic looping between insulator elements and changes in local 3D organization may be observed upon variation in transcriptional activity. Chromatin looping also occurs at silent gene loci, where its function remains less understood. In lineage-committed cells, partial 3D configurations are detected at loci that are activated at later stages. However, these partial configurations usually lack promoter-enhancer loops that accompany transcriptional activation, suggesting they have structural functions. Definitive evidence for a repressive role of chromatin looping is still lacking. Chromatin loops have been reported at repressed loci but, alternatively, they may act as a distraction for active loops. Together, these mechanisms allow fine-tuning of regulatory programs, thus providing further diversity in the transcriptional control of developmentally regulated gene loci.",

    "abstract": "Insulator DNAs, or boundary elements, functionally isolate neighbouring genes by blocking interactions between distal enhancers and inappropriate target promoters. The best-characterized insulators in Drosophila correspond to a 340-base-pair (bp) fragment from the gypsy retrotransposon, and the scs and scs' sequences flanking the 87A1 hsp70 locus. Here we demonstrate that both insulators block the interaction of defined even-skipped (eve) stripe enhancers when positioned between the enhancer and the target promoter. The simultaneous use of two stripe enhancers (eve stripes 2 and 3) provides evidence that enhancers lying distal to the insulator are selectively blocked. The insertion of stripe-insulator-stripe sequences between two divergently transcribed promoters indicates that enhancers barred from acting on one basal promoter are fully accessible to appropriate regulatory factors for activating the other promoter. These results suggest that insulators do not propagate changes in chromatin structure. Finally, we present evidence that the gypsy insulator does not block interactions between a silencer element and a basal promoter. Taken together, these results suggest that insulators might not be restricted to the functional isolation of neighbouring genetic loci. Rather, they might function as flexible regulatory elements that modulate enhancer-promoter interactions within complex promoters and complex genetic loci.",

    "abstract": "Endothelial cells (ECs) are constantly subjected to an array of mechanical cues, especially shear stress, due to their luminal placement in the blood vessels. Blood flow can regulate various aspects of endothelial biology and pathophysiology by regulating the endothelial processes at the transcriptomic, proteomic, miRNomic, metabolomics, and epigenomic levels. ECs sense, respond, and adapt to altered blood flow patterns and shear profiles by specialized mechanisms of mechanosensing and mechanotransduction, resulting in qualitative and quantitative differences in their gene expression. Chromatin-regulatory proteins can regulate transcriptional activation by modifying the organization of nucleosomes at promoters, enhancers, silencers, insulators, and locus control regions. Recent research efforts have illustrated that SWI/SNF (SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable) or BRG1/BRM-associated factor (BAF) complex regulates DNA accessibility and chromatin structure. Since the discovery, the gene-regulatory mechanisms of the BAF complex associated with chromatin remodeling have been intensively studied to investigate its role in diverse disease phenotypes. Thus far, it is evident that (1) the SWI/SNF complex broadly regulates the activity of transcriptional enhancers to control lineage-specific differentiation and (2) mutations in the BAF complex proteins lead to developmental disorders and cancers. It is unclear if blood flow can modulate the activity of SWI/SNF complex to regulate EC differentiation and reprogramming. This review emphasizes the integrative role of SWI/SNF complex from a structural and functional standpoint with a special reference to cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). The review also highlights how regulation of this complex by blood flow can lead to the discovery of new therapeutic interventions for the treatment of endothelial dysfunction in vascular diseases.",

The assay for transposase-accessible chromatin coupled with next generation sequencing (ATAC-seq) is a fast and easy technique to track epigenetic changes that result in different opening of the chromatin in regulatory regions genome-wide. The transposase cuts DNA in regions that are open and therefore accessible for transcription factors, regulatory RNAs and proteins that alter the architectural structure of the DNA and drive or inhibit transcription through the RNA polymerase.

Although a large number of insulators have been isolated, it is unclear whether these elements function by shared molecular mechanisms. Novel applications of FLP recombinase technology were used to dissect and compare the function of the Drosophila: gypsy and scs insulators. Inter actions between FLP monomers bound to chromosomally integrated FRT sites were unimpeded by either insulator, demonstrating that these insulators do not establish a chromosomal environment capable of disrupting all types of protein-protein interactions. The gypsy insulator blocked enhancer-activated transcription on FLP-generated extra-chromosomal episomes, whereas the scs insulator displayed silencing effects. These data indicate that these insulators differ in the mechanisms used to prevent enhancer function. That the gypsy insulator blocked enhancer-promoter communication within small episomes suggests that these effects may be accomplished without a global reorganization of chromatin structure. Instead, the gypsy insulator may disrupt enhancer-activated transcription by direct interference with transmission of the enhancer signal to the promoter.",

    "abstract": "The imprinting control region (ICR) located far upstream of the H19 gene, in conjunction with enhancers, modulates the transcription of Igf2 and H19 genes in an allele-specific manner. On paternal inheritance, the methylated ICR silences the H19 gene and indirectly facilitates transcription from the distant Igf2 promoter, whereas on the maternal chromosome the unmethylated ICR, together with enhancers, activates transcription of the H19 gene and thereby contributes to the repression of Igf2. This repression of maternal Igf2 has recently been postulated to be due to a chromatin boundary or insulator function of the unmethylated ICR. Central to the insulator model is the site-specific binding of a ubiquitous nuclear factor CTCF which exhibits remarkable flexibility in functioning as transcriptional activator or silencer. We suggest that the ICR positioned close to the enhancers in an episomal context might function as a transcriptional silencer by virtue of interaction of CTCF with its modifiers such as SIN3A and histone deacetylases. Furthermore, a localised folded chromatin structure resulting from juxtaposition of two disparate regulatory sequences (enhancer ICR) could be the mechanistic basis of ICR-mediated position-dependent (ICR-promoter) transcriptional repression in transgenic Drosophila.",

Here we performed an unbiased and in-depth analysis of the relationship between human PU.1 expression, the presence of trans-acting factors, and 3D architecture at various cis-regulatory elements (CRE) proximal to the PU.1 locus. We identified multiple novel CREs at the upstream region of the gene following an integrative inspection for conserved DNA elements at the chromatin-accessible regions in primary human blood lineages. We showed that a subset of CREs localize within a 10 kb-wide cluster that exhibits that exhibit molecular features of a myeloid-specific super-enhancer involved in mediating PU.1 autoregulation, including open chromatin, unmethylated DNA, histone enhancer marks, transcription of enhancer RNAs, and occupancy of the PU.1 protein itself. Importantly, we revealed the presence of common 35-kb-wide CTCF-bound insulated neighborhood that contains the CRE cluster, forming the chromatin territory for lineage-specific and CRE-mediated chromatin interactions. These include functional CRE-promoter interactions in myeloid and B cells but not in erythroid and T cells. Our findings also provide mechanistic insights into the interplay between dynamic chromatin structure and 3D architecture in defining certain CREs as enhancers or silencers in chromatin regulation of PU.1 expression.

    "abstract": "Stably integrated transgenes flanked by the chicken beta-globin HS4 insulator are protected against chromosomal position effects and gradual extinction of expression during long-term propagation in culture. To investigate the mechanism of action of this insulator, we used bisulfite genomic sequencing to examine the methylation of individual CpG sites within insulated transgenes, and compared this with patterns of histone acetylation. Surprisingly, although the histones of the entire insulated transgene are highly acetylated, only a specific region in the promoter, containing binding sites for erythroid-specific transcription factors, is highly protected from DNA methylation. This critical region is methylated in noninsulated and inactive lines. MBD3 and Mi-2, subunits of the Mi-2/NuRD repressor complex, are bound in vivo to these silenced noninsulated transgenes. In contrast, insulated cell lines do not show any enrichment of Mi-2/NuRD proteins very late in culture. In addition to the high levels of histone acetylation observed across the entire insulated transgene, significant peaks of H3 acetylation are present over the HS4 insulator elements. Targeted histone acetylation by the chicken beta-globin insulator occurs independently of gene transcription and does not require the presence of a functional enhancer. We suggest that this acetylation is in turn responsible for the maintenance of a region of unmethylated DNA over the promoter. Whereas DNA methylation often leads to histone deacetylation, here acetylation appears to prevent methylation.",

    "abstract": "We have found that the thyroid hormone receptor (T3R) functionally synergizes with the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF). CTCF is a highly conserved zinc-finger protein that has been connected with multiple functions in gene regulation including chromatin insulator activity, transcriptional enhancement and silencing as well as tumour suppression. A specific property of CTCF is that some of the binding sites are found in the vicinity of T3R-binding sites. Interestingly, both factors synergize in repression as well as in activation. T3R-mediated repression has been shown to involve co-repressors such as the silencing mediator for retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptor (SMRT), N-CoR or Alien. These co-repressors in turn have been found to interact with Sin3A. Until now, the mechanisms by which CTCF synergizes with T3R in transcriptional repression has not been determined. Here we show that CTCF comprises autonomous silencing domains that mediate transcriptional repression when tethered to a promoter sequence. At least one of these domains, the zinc-finger region of CTCF, binds Sin3A without binding to SMRT or N-CoR and recruits histone deacetylation activity. For Sin3A we identified two different domains interacting independently with the CTCF zinc-finger cluster. The ability of regions of CTCF to retain deacetylase activity is correlated with the ability to bind to Sin3A and to repress transcription. Taking these results together, the synergy in repression mediated by T3R and CTCF might be achieved by the binding of multiple molecules of Sin3A to the T3R/CTCF-DNA complex, thus providing a large platform for the recruitment of histone deacetylases.",

    "abstract": "The correct deployment of genetic programs for development and differentiation relies on finely coordinated regulation of specific gene sets. Genomic regulatory elements play an exceptional role in this process. There are few types of gene regulatory elements, including promoters, enhancers, insulators and silencers. Alterations of gene regulatory elements may cause various pathologies, including cancer, congenital disorders and autoimmune diseases. The development of high-throughput genomic assays has made it possible to significantly accelerate the accumulation of information about the characteristic epigenetic properties of regulatory elements. In combination with high-throughput studies focused on the genome-wide distribution of epigenetic marks, regulatory proteins and the spatial structure of chromatin, this significantly expands the understanding of the principles of epigenetic regulation of genes and allows potential regulatory elements to be searched for in silico. However, common experimental approaches used to study the local characteristics of chromatin have a number of technical limitations that may reduce the reliability of computational identification of genomic regulatory sequences. Taking into account the variability of the functions of epigenetic determinants and complex multicomponent regulation of genomic elements activity, their functional verification is often required. A plethora of methods have been developed to study the functional role of regulatory elements on the genome scale. Common experimental approaches for in silico identification of regulatory elements and their inherent technical limitations will be described. The present review is focused on original high-throughput methods of enhancer activity reporter analysis that are currently used to validate predicted regulatory elements and to perform de novo searches. The methods described allow assessing the functional role of the nucleotide sequence of a regulatory element, to determine its exact boundaries and to assess the influence of the local state of chromatin on the activity of enhancers and gene expression. These approaches have contributed substantially to the understanding of the fundamental principles of gene regulation.",

    "abstract": "Chromatin boundaries regulate gene expression by modulating enhancer-promoter interactions and insulating transcriptional influences from organized chromatin. However, mechanistic distinctions between these two aspects of boundary function are not well understood. Here we show that SF1, a chromatin boundary located in the Drosophila Antennapedia complex (ANT-C), can insulate the transgenic miniwhite reporter from both enhancing and silencing effects of surrounding genome, a phenomenon known as chromosomal position effect or CPE. We found that the CPE-blocking activity associates with different SF1 sub-regions from a previously characterized insulator that blocks enhancers in transgenic embryos, and is independent of GAF-binding sites essential for the embryonic insulator activity. We further provide evidence that the CPE-blocking activity cannot be attributed to an enhancer-blocking activity in the developing eye. Our results suggest that SF1 contains multiple non-overlapping activities that block diverse transcriptional influences from embryonic or adult enhancers, and from positive and negative chromatin structure. Such diverse insulating capabilities are consistent with the proposed roles of SF1 to functionally separate fushi tarazu (ftz), a non-Hox gene, from the enhancers and the organized chromatin of the neighboring Hox genes.",

These phenomena hamper the use of recombinant retroviruses as stable gene delivery vectors. As insulators are able to block promoter-enhancer interactions and reduce position effects in some transgenic animals, we examined the effect of an insulator on the expression and structure of randomly integrated recombinant retroviruses. We used the cHS4 element, an insulator from the chicken beta-like globin gene cluster, which has been shown to reduce position effects in transgenic Drosophila. A large panel of mouse erythroleukemia cells that bear a single copy of integrated recombinant retroviruses was generated without using drug selection. We show that the cHS4 increases the probability that integrated proviruses will express and dramatically decreases the level of de novo methylation of the 5' long terminal repeat. These findings support a primary role of methylation in the silencing of retroviruses and suggest that cHS4 could be useful in gene therapy applications to overcome silencing of retroviral vectors.",

    "abstract": "Eukaryotic genomic DNA is organized into loop structures by attachments to the nuclear matrix. These attachments to the nuclear matrix have been supposed to form the boundaries of chromosomal DNA. Insulators or boundary elements are defined by two characteristics: they interrupt promoter-enhancer communications when inserted between them, and they suppress the silencing of transgenes stably integrated into inactive chromosomal domains. We recently identified an insulator element in the upstream region of the sea urchin arylsulfatase (HpArs) gene that shows both enhancer blocking and suppression of position effects. Here, we report that Unichrom, originally identified by its G-stretch DNA binding capability, is a nuclear matrix protein that binds to the Ars insulator and canonical nuclear matrix attachment regions (MARs). We also show that Unichrom recognizes the minor groove of the AT-rich region within the Ars insulator, which may have a base-unpairing property, as well as the G-stretch DNA. Furthermore, Unichrom selectively interacts with poly(dG).poly(dC), poly(dA).poly(dT) and poly(dAT).poly(dAT), but not with poly(dGC).poly(dGC). Unichrom also shows high affinity for single-stranded G- and C-stretches. We discuss the DNA binding motif of Unichrom and the function of Unichrom in the nuclear matrix.",

The promoters, in conjunction with enhancers, silencers and insulators, define the combinatorial codes that specify gene expression patterns. Our ability to analyse the control logic encoded in the human genome is currently limited by a lack of accurate information regarding the promoters for most genes. Here we describe a genome-wide map of active promoters in human fibroblast cells, determined by experimentally locating the sites of PIC binding throughout the human genome. This map defines 10,567 active promoters corresponding to 6,763 known genes and at least 1,196 un-annotated transcriptional units. Features of the map suggest extensive use of multiple promoters by the human genes and widespread clustering of active promoters in the genome. In addition, examination of the genome-wide expression profile reveals four general classes of promoters that define the transcriptome of the cell. These results provide a global view of the functional relationships among transcriptional machinery, chromatin structure and gene expression in human cells.",

    "title": "Polycomb domain formation depends on short and long distance regulatory cues.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Polycomb group (PcG) proteins dynamically define cellular identities through the epigenetic repression of key developmental genes. In Drosophila, cis-regulatory regions termed PcG response elements (PREs) act as nucleation sites for PcG proteins to create large repressive PcG domains that are marked by trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me3). In addition to an action in cis, PREs can interact over long distances, thereby enhancing PcG dependent silencing. How PcG domains are established, which factors limit their propagation in cis, and how long range interactions of PREs in trans affect the chromatin structure is largely unknown. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We demonstrate that the insertion of a PRE-containing transgene in the Drosophila genome generates an artificial PcG domain and we analyze its organization by quantitative ChIP and ChIP-on-chip experiments. Intriguingly, a boundary element and known insulator proteins do not necessarily interfere with spreading of H3K27me3. Instead, domain borders correlate with the presence of promoter regions bound by RNA Polymerase II and active chromatin marks. In contrast, genes that are silent during early fly development get included within the PcG domain and this incorporation interferes with gene activation at later developmental stages. Moreover, trans-interaction of the transgenic PRE with its homologous endogenous PRE results in increased PcG binding, correlating with reinforced silencing of genes within the domain borders. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that higher-order organization of PcG-bound chromatin can stabilize gene silencing within PcG domains. Further we propose that multi-protein complexes associated with active promoters are able to define the limits of PcG domains. Future work aimed to pinpoint the factors providing this barrier function will be required to understand the precise molecular mechanism by which active promoter regions can act as boundaries to stop spreading of H3K27me3.",

Combining these two technologies, we have created a comprehensive and accurate genome-wide open chromatin map. Surprisingly, only 16%-21% of the identified 94,925 DNase I HS sites are found in promoters or first exons of known genes, but nearly half of the most open sites are in these regions.

A less well understood level of gene regulation is governed by the various structural and functional states of chromatin, which have been ascribed to changes in covalent modification of core histone proteins. And, much on how topological domains in the genome take part in establishing and maintaining distinct gene expression patterns is still unknown. Here we present a set of regulatory proteins that allow to reversibly alter the DNA structure in vivo and in vitro by adding low molecular weight effectors that control their oligomerization and DNA binding. Using this approach, we completely regulate the activity of an SV40 enhancer in HeLa cells by reversible loop formation to topologically separate it from the promoter. This result establishes a new mechanism for DNA-structure-dependent gene regulation in vivo and provides evidence supporting the structural model of insulator function.",

    "abstract": "We have examined the expression of cloned genes following their stable integration into the genome of pluripotent embryonal carcinoma stem cells. Transfected genes integrate into the genome as tandem arrays. Expression of reporter genes from these tandem arrays in embryonal carcinoma cells is inefficient probably because genes are subject to repeat-induced gene silencing. We found that expression of reporter genes was significantly enhanced if co-transfected with cloned fragments derived from the murine Pgk-1 gene. The enhanced expression required (a) that the Pgk-1 fragment carries an active promoter, (b) that the promoter drives transcription through a region of more than 12 kbp, and (c) that this transcribed region contains both introns and exons. Reporter gene activity did not require specific Pgk-1 DNA sequences suggesting that the coupled processes of transcription and RNA processing conferred activity on neighboring genes probably by influencing local chromatin structure. Consistent with this idea, the effect of the Pgk-1 gene could be mimicked by exposing cells to butyrate or trichostatin A, inhibitors of histone deacetylase. Thus, the effect of the co-transfected Pgk-1 gene is to inhibit the process of gene inactivation possibly by functioning like an insulator or boundary element in the chromatin.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the suppressor of Hairy-wing [su(Hw)] locus reverse the phenotype of a number of tissue-specific mutations caused by insertion of a gypsy retrotransposon. The su(Hw) gene encodes a zinc finger protein which binds to a 430 bp region of gypsy shown to be both necessary and sufficient for its mutagenic effects. su(Hw) protein causes mutations by inactivation of enhancer elements only when a su(Hw) binding region is located between these regulatory sequences and a promoter. To understand the molecular basis of enhancer inactivation, we tested the effects of su(Hw) protein on expression of the mini-white gene. We find that su(Hw) protein stabilizes mini-white gene expression from chromosomal position-effects in euchromatic locations by inactivating negative and positive regulatory elements present in flanking DNA. Furthermore, the su(Hw) protein partially protects transposon insertions from the negative effects of heterochromatin. To explain our current results, we propose that su(Hw) protein alters the organization of chromatin by creating a new boundary in a pre-existing domain of higher order chromatin structure. This separates enhancers and silencers distal to the su(Hw) binding region into an independent unit of gene activity, thereby causing their inactivation.",

    "abstract": "Expression vectors (EVs) are artificial nucleic acid molecules with a modular structure that allows for the transcription of DNA sequences of interest in either cellular or cell-free environments. These vectors have emerged as cross-disciplinary tools with multiple applications in an expanding Life Sciences market. The cis-regulatory sequences (CRSs) that control the transcription in EVs are typically sourced from either viruses or from characterized genes. However, the recent advancement in transposable elements (TEs) technology provides attractive alternatives that may enable a significant improvement in the design of EVs. Commonly known as \"jumping genes,\" due to their ability to move between genetic loci, TEs are constitutive components of both eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomes. TEs harbor native CRSs that allow the regulated transcription of transposition-related genes. However, some TE-related CRSs display striking characteristics, which provides the opportunity to reconsider TEs as lead actors in the design of EVs. In this article, we provide a synopsis of the transcriptional control elements commonly found in EVs together with an extensive discussion of their advantages and limitations. We also highlight the latest findings that may allow for the implementation of TE-derived sequences in the EVs feasible, possibly improving existing vectors. By introducing this new concept of TEs as a source of regulatory sequences, we aim to stimulate a profitable discussion of the potential advantages and benefits of developing a new generation of EVs based on the use of TE-derived control sequences.",

    "abstract": "A three-dimensional chromatin state underpins the structural and functional basis of the genome by bringing regulatory elements and genes into close spatial proximity to ensure proper, cell-type-specific gene expression profiles. Here, we performed Hi-C chromosome conformation capture sequencing to investigate how three-dimensional chromatin organization is disrupted in the context of copy-number variation, long-range epigenetic remodeling, and atypical gene expression programs in prostate cancer. We find that cancer cells retain the ability to segment their genomes into megabase-sized topologically associated domains (TADs); however, these domains are generally smaller due to establishment of additional domain boundaries. Interestingly, a large proportion of the new cancer-specific domain boundaries occur at regions that display copy-number variation. Notably, a common deletion on 17p13.1 in prostate cancer spanning the TP53 tumor suppressor locus results in bifurcation of a single TAD into two distinct smaller TADs. Change in domain structure is also accompanied by novel cancer-specific chromatin interactions within the TADs that are enriched at regulatory elements such as enhancers, promoters, and insulators, and associated with alterations in gene expression. We also show that differential chromatin interactions across regulatory regions occur within long-range epigenetically activated or silenced regions of concordant gene activation or repression in prostate cancer. Finally, we present a novel visualization tool that enables integrated exploration of Hi-C interaction data, the transcriptome, and epigenome. This study provides new insights into the relationship between long-range epigenetic and genomic dysregulation and changes in higher-order chromatin interactions in cancer.",

    "abstract": "It is thought that the H19 imprinting control region (ICR) directs the silencing of the maternally inherited Igf2 allele through a CTCF-dependent chromatin insulator. The ICR has been shown to interact physically with a silencer region in Igf2, differentially methylated region (DMR)1, but the role of CTCF in this chromatin loop and whether it restricts the physical access of distal enhancers to Igf2 is not known. We performed systematic chromosome conformation capture analyses in the Igf2/H19 region over >160 kb, identifying sequences that interact physically with the distal enhancers and the ICR. We found that, on the paternal chromosome, enhancers interact with the Igf2 promoters but that, on the maternal allele, this is prevented by CTCF binding within the H19 ICR. CTCF binding in the maternal ICR regulates its interaction with matrix attachment region (MAR)3 and DMR1 at Igf2, thus forming a tight loop around the maternal Igf2 locus, which may contribute to its silencing. Mutation of CTCF binding sites in the H19 ICR leads to loss of CTCF binding and de novo methylation of a CTCF target site within Igf2 DMR1, showing that CTCF can coordinate regional epigenetic marks. This systematic chromosome conformation capture analysis of an imprinting cluster reveals that CTCF has a critical role in the epigenetic regulation of higher-order chromatin structure and gene silencing over considerable distances in the genome.",

This information will no doubt be extended by identifying expanded regulatory circuitry using the microchip oligonucleotide array technology. In addition to elucidating the regulatory consequences of these intricate connections, another frontier will be to analyze gene expression within chromosomes. This requires deciphering the mechanism of action of a variety of DNA elements that create a genetic domain such as locus control regions, distal enhancers, insulators, silencers, and matrix attachment regions. Hopefully, with the development of new assays these elements can be as rigorously defined as promoters have been. We can also look forward to capturing critical transcriptional processes by increasingly refined structural analyses.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Binding of transcription factors to transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) is key to the mediation of transcriptional regulation. Information on experimentally validated functional TFBSs is limited and consequently there is a need for accurate prediction of TFBSs for gene annotation and in applications such as evaluating the effects of single nucleotide variations in causing disease. TFBSs are generally recognized by scanning a position weight matrix (PWM) against DNA using one of a number of available computer programs. Thus we set out to evaluate the best tools that can be used locally (and are therefore suitable for large-scale analyses) for creating PWMs from high-throughput ChIP-Seq data and for scanning them against DNA. RESULTS: We evaluated a set of de novo motif discovery tools that could be downloaded and installed locally using ENCODE-ChIP-Seq data and showed that rGADEM was the best-performing tool. TFBS prediction tools used to scan PWMs against DNA fall into two classes - those that predict individual TFBSs and those that identify clusters. Our evaluation showed that FIMO and MCAST performed best respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Selection of the best-performing tools for generating PWMs from ChIP-Seq data and for scanning PWMs against DNA has the potential to improve prediction of precise transcription factor binding sites within regions identified by ChIP-Seq experiments for gene finding, understanding regulation and in evaluating the effects of single nucleotide variations in causing disease.",

    "abstract": "The DNA binding specificity of transcription factors (TFs) is typically represented in the form of a position weight matrix (PWM), also known as a DNA motif. A PWM is a matrix that specifies, for each position in the DNA binding site of a TF, the \"weight\" or contribution of each possible nucleotide. DNA motifs can be derived from various types of TF-DNA binding data, from small collections of known TF binding sites to large data sets generated using high-throughput technologies. One drawback of this simple model of DNA binding specificity is that it makes the implicit assumption that individual base pairs within a TF binding site contribute independently to the TF-DNA binding affinity. Although this assumption does not always hold, PWM models have been shown to provide reasonable approximations to the DNA binding specificity, and they are still widely used in practice. DNA motifs are currently available for more than 150 Saccharomyces cerevisiae TFs. Here, we briefly describe how these models are built, we provide information on databases containing DNA motifs for S. cerevisiae TFs, and we introduce guidelines on how to interpret the motifs and use them in practice to generate hypotheses about transcriptional regulatory regions.",

We observe that the best performing PWM for a given TF often belongs to another TF, usually from the same family. Occasionally, binding specificity is correlated with the structural class of the DNA binding domain, indicated by good cross-family performance measures. Benchmarking-based selection of family-representative motifs is more effective than motif clustering-based approaches. Overall, there is good agreement between in vitro and in vivo performance measures. However, for some in vivo experiments, the best performing PWM is assigned to an unrelated TF, indicating a binding mode involving protein-protein cooperativity. CONCLUSIONS: In an all-against-all setting, we compute more than 18 million performance measure values for different PWM-experiment combinations and offer these results as a public resource to the research community. The benchmarking protocols are provided via a web interface and as docker images. The methods and results from this study may help others make better use of public TF specificity models, as well as public TF binding data sets.",

    "abstract": "Models of transcription factor (TF) binding sites provide a basis for a wide spectrum of studies in regulatory genomics, from reconstruction of regulatory networks to functional annotation of transcripts and sequence variants. While TFs may recognize different sequence patterns in different conditions, it is pragmatic to have a single generic model for each particular TF as a baseline for practical applications. Here we present the expanded and enhanced version of HOCOMOCO (http://hocomoco.autosome.ru and http://www.cbrc.kaust.edu.sa/hocomoco10), the collection of models of DNA patterns, recognized by transcription factors. HOCOMOCO now provides position weight matrix (PWM) models for binding sites of 601 human TFs and, in addition, PWMs for 396 mouse TFs. Furthermore, we introduce the largest up to date collection of dinucleotide PWM models for 86 (52) human (mouse) TFs. The update is based on the analysis of massive ChIP-Seq and HT-SELEX datasets, with the validation of the resulting models on in vivo data. To facilitate a practical application, all HOCOMOCO models are linked to gene and protein databases (Entrez Gene, HGNC, UniProt) and accompanied by precomputed score thresholds. Finally, we provide command-line tools for PWM and diPWM threshold estimation and motif finding in nucleotide sequences.",

    "title": "Modeling binding specificities of transcription factor pairs with random forests.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Transcription factors (TFs) bind regulatory DNA regions with sequence specificity, form complexes and regulate gene expression. In cooperative TF-TF binding, two transcription factors bind onto a shared DNA binding site as a pair. Previous work has demonstrated pairwise TF-TF-DNA interactions with position weight matrices (PWMs), which may however not sufficiently take into account the complexity and flexibility of pairwise binding. RESULTS: We propose two random forest (RF) methods for joint TF-TF binding site prediction: ComBind and JointRF. We train models with previously published large-scale CAP-SELEX DNA libraries, which comprise DNA sequences enriched for binding of a selected TF pair. JointRF builds a random forest with sub-sequences selected from CAP-SELEX DNA reads with previously proposed pairwise PWM. JointRF outperforms (area under receiver operating characteristics curve, AUROC, 0.75) the current state-of-the-art method i.e. orientation and spacing specific pairwise PWMs (AUROC 0.59). Thus, JointRF may be utilized to improve prediction accuracy for pre-determined binding preferences. However, pairwise TF binding is currently considered flexible; a pair may bind DNA with different orientations and amounts of dinucleotide gaps or overlap between the two motifs. Thus, we developed ComBind, which utilizes random forests by considering simultaneously multiple orientations and spacings of the two factors. Our approach outperforms (AUROC 0.78) PWMs, as well as JointRF (p<0.00195). ComBind provides an approach for predicting TF-TF binding sites without prior knowledge on pairwise binding preferences. However, more research is needed to assess ComBind eligibility for practical applications. CONCLUSIONS: Random forest is well suited for modeling pairwise TF-TF-DNA binding specificities, and ComBind provides an improvement to pairwise binding site prediction accuracy.",

    "abstract": "MOTIVATION: Prediction of transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) is crucial for promoter modeling and network inference. Quality of the predictions is spoiled by numerous false positives, which persist as the main problem for all presently available TFBS search methods. RESULTS: We suggest a novel approach, which is alternative to widely used position weight matrices (PWMs) and Hidden Markov Models. Each motif of the input set is used as a search template to scan a query sequence. Found motifs are assigned scores depending on the non-randomness of the motif's occurrence, the number of matching searching motifs and the number of mismatches. The non-randomness is estimated by comparison of observed numbers of matching motifs with those predicted to occur by chance. The latter can be calculated given the base compositions of the motif and the query sequence. The method does not require preliminary alignment of the input motifs, hence avoiding uncertainties introduced by the alignment procedure. In comparison with PWM-based tools, our method demonstrates higher precision by the same sensitivity and specificity. It also tends to outperform methods combining pattern and PWM search. Most important, it allows reducing the number of false positive predictions significantly.

    "abstract": "A DNA sequence pattern, or \"motif\", is an essential representation of DNA-binding specificity of a transcription factor (TF). Any particular motif model has potential flaws due to shortcomings of the underlying experimental data and computational motif discovery algorithm. As a part of the Codebook/GRECO-BIT initiative, here we evaluated at large scale the cross-platform recognition performance of positional weight matrices (PWMs), which remain popular motif models in many practical applications. We applied ten different DNA motif discovery tools to generate PWMs from the \"Codebook\" data comprised of 4,237 experiments from five different platforms profiling the DNA-binding specificity of 394 human proteins, focusing on understudied transcription factors of different structural families. For many of the proteins, there was no prior knowledge of a genuine motif. By benchmarking-supported human curation, we constructed an approved subset of experiments comprising about 30% of all experiments and 50% of tested TFs which displayed consistent motifs across platforms and replicates. We present the Codebook Motif Explorer (https://mex.autosome.org), a detailed online catalog of DNA motifs, including the top-ranked PWMs, and the underlying source and benchmarking data. We demonstrate that in the case of high-quality experimental data, most of the popular motif discovery tools detect valid motifs and generate PWMs, which perform well both on genomic and synthetic data. Yet, for each of the algorithms, there were problematic combinations of proteins and platforms, and the basic motif properties such as nucleotide composition and information content offered little help in detecting such pitfalls. By combining multiple PMWs in decision trees, we demonstrate how our setup can be readily adapted to train and test binding specificity models more complex than PWMs. Overall, our study provides a rich motif catalog as a solid baseline for advanced models and highlights the power of the multi-platform multi-tool approach for reliable mapping of DNA binding specificities.",

    "abstract": "Transcription factors (TFs) are essential regulatory proteins controlling the cellular transcriptional states by binding to specific DNA sequences known as transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) or motifs. Accurate TFBS identification is crucial for unraveling regulatory mechanisms driving cellular dynamics. Over the years, various computational approaches have been developed to model TFBSs, with position weight matrices (PWMs) being one of the most widely adopted methods. PWMs provide a probabilistic framework by representing nucleotide frequencies at every position within the binding site. While effective and interpretable, PWMs face significant limitations, such as their inability to capture positional dependencies or model complex interactions. To address these, advanced methods, like support vector machine (SVM)-based, and deep learning (DL)-based models, have been introduced. Leveraging human ChIP-seq data from ENCODE, we systematically benchmarked the predictive performance of PWM, SVM-, and DL-based models across different scenarios. We evaluate the impact of key factors such as training dataset size, sequence length, and kernel functions (for SVMs) on models' performance. Additionally, we explore the impact of synthetic versus real biological background data during model training. Our analysis highlights strengths and limitations of each approach under different conditions, providing practical guidance for selecting and tailoring models to specific biological datasets. To complement our analysis, we present a comprehensive database of pretrained SVM models for TFBS detection, trained on human ChIP-seq data from diverse cell lines and tissues. This resource aims to facilitate broader adoption of SVM-based methods in TFBS prediction and enhance their practical utility in regulatory genomics research.",

    "abstract": "All the cell types are under strict control of how their genes are transcribed into expressed transcripts by the temporally dynamic orchestration of the transcription factor binding activities. Given a set of known binding sites (BSs) of a given transcription factor (TF), computational TFBS screening technique represents a cost efficient and large scale strategy to complement the experimental ones. There are two major classes of computational TFBS prediction algorithms based on the tertiary and primary structures, respectively. A tertiary structure based algorithm tries to calculate the binding affinity between a query DNA fragment and the tertiary structure of the given TF. Due to the limited number of available TF tertiary structures, primary structure based TFBS prediction algorithm is a necessary complementary technique for large scale TFBS screening. This study proposes a novel evolutionary algorithm to randomly mutate the weights of different positions in the binding motif of a TF, so that the overall TFBS prediction accuracy is optimized. The comparison with the most widely used algorithm, Position Weight Matrix (PWM), suggests that our algorithm performs better or the same level in all the performance measurements, including sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and Matthews correlation coefficient. Our data also suggests that it is necessary to remove the widely used assumption of independence between motif positions.

    "abstract": "Position weight matrix (PWM) is the traditional motif model representing the transcription factor (TF) binding sites. It proposes that the positions contribute independently to TFs binding affinity, although this hypothesis does not fit the data perfectly. This explains why PWM hits are missing in a substantial fraction of ChIP-seq peaks. To study various modes of the direct binding of plant TFs, we compiled the benchmark collection of 111 ChIP-seq datasets for Arabidopsis thaliana, and applied the traditional PWM, and two alternative motif models BaMM and SiteGA, proposing the dependencies of the positions. The variation in the stringency of the recognition thresholds for the models proposed that the hits of PWM, BaMM, and SiteGA models are associated with the sites of high/medium, any, and low affinity, respectively. At the medium recognition threshold, about 60% of ChIP-seq peaks contain PWM hits consisting of conserved core consensuses, while BaMM and SiteGA provide hits for an additional 15% of peaks in which a weaker core consensus is compensated through intra-motif dependencies. The presence/absence of these dependencies in the motifs of alternative/traditional models was confirmed by the dependency logo DepLogo visualizing the position-wise partitioning of the alignments of predicted sites. We exemplify the detailed analysis of ChIP-seq profiles for plant TFs CCA1, MYC2, and SEP3. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis revealed that among the three motif models, the SiteGA had the highest portions of genes with the significantly enriched GO terms among all predicted genes. We showed that both alternative motif models provide for traditional PWM greater extensions in predicted sites for TFs MYC2/SEP3 with condition/tissue specific functions, compared to those for TF CCA1 with housekeeping functions. Overall, the combined application of standard and alternative motif models is beneficial to detect various modes of the direct TF-DNA interactions in the maximal portion of ChIP-seq loci.",

    "abstract": "Modelling the regulatory mechanisms that determine cell fate, response to external perturbation, and disease state depends on measuring many factors, a task made more difficult by the plasticity of the epigenome. Scanning the genome for the sequence patterns defined by Position Weight Matrices (PWM) can be used to estimate transcription factor (TF) binding locations. However, this approach does not incorporate information regarding the epigenetic context necessary for TF binding. CpG methylation is an epigenetic mark influenced by environmental factors that is commonly assayed in human cohort studies. We developed a framework to score inferred TF binding locations using methylation data. We intersected motif locations identified using PWMs with methylation information captured in both whole-genome bisulfite sequencing and Illumina EPIC array data for six cell lines, scored motif locations based on these data, and compared with experimental data characterizing TF binding (ChIP-seq). We found that for most TFs, binding prediction improves using methylation-based scoring compared to standard PWM-scores. We also illustrate that our approach can be generalized to infer TF binding when methylation information is only proximally available, i.e. measured for nearby CpGs that do not directly overlap with a motif location. Overall, our approach provides a framework for inferring context-specific TF binding using methylation data. Importantly, the availability of DNA methylation data in existing patient populations provides an opportunity to use our approach to understand the impact of methylation on gene regulatory processes in the context of human disease.",

Here, we describe the update of our MANTA database that stores: 1) TFBS predictions in the human genome, and 2) the potential impact on TF binding for all possible single nucleotide variants (SNVs) at these TFBSs. TFBSs were predicted by combining experimental ChIP-seq data from ReMap and computational position weight matrices (PWMs) derived from JASPAR. Impact of SNVs at these TFBSs was assessed by means of PWM scores computed on the alternate alleles.

Recent biological experiments, however, suggest that there exists interdependence among positions in the binding sites. In order to exploit this interdependence to aid motif discovery, we extend the PWM model to include pairs of correlated positions and design a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to sample in the model space. We then combine the model sampling step with the Gibbs sampling framework for de novo motif discoveries. RESULTS: Testing on experimentally validated binding sites, we find that about 25% of the transcription factor binding motifs show significant within-site position correlations, and 80% of these motif models can be improved by considering the correlated positions. Using both simulated data and real promoter sequences, we show that the new de novo motif-finding algorithm can infer the true correlated position pairs accurately and is more precise in finding putative transcription factor binding sites than the standard Gibbs sampling algorithms.",

They can activate or block transcription of downstream genes in a manner of binding to specific genomic sequences. Therefore, motif discovery of these binding preference patterns is of central significance in the understanding of molecular regulation mechanism. Many algorithms have been proposed for the identification of transcription factor binding sites. However, it remains a challengeable problem. RESULTS: Here, we proposed a novel motif discovery algorithm based on support vector machine (MD-SVM) to learn a discriminative model for TF binding sites. MD-SVM firstly obtains position weight matrix (PWM) from a set of training datasets. Then it translates the MD problem into a computational framework of multiple instance learning (MIL). It was applied to several real biological datasets. Results show that our algorithm outperforms MI-SVM in terms of both accuracy and specificity. CONCLUSIONS: In this paper, we modeled the TF motif discovery problem as a MIL optimization problem. The SVM algorithm was adapted to discriminate positive and negative bags of instances. Compared to other svm-based algorithms, MD-SVM show its superiority over its competitors in term of ROC AUC. Hopefully, it could be of benefit to the research community in the understanding of molecular functions of DNA functional elements and transcription factors.",

Most models for predicting TFBSs are based on position weight matrices (PWMs), which require a specific motif to be present in the DNA sequence and do not consider interdependencies of nucleotides. Novel approaches such as Transcription Factor Flexible Models or recurrent neural networks consequently provide higher accuracies. However, it is unclear whether such approaches can uncover novel non-canonical, hitherto unexpected TFBSs relevant to human transcriptional regulation. RESULTS: In this study, we trained a convolutional recurrent neural network with HT-SELEX data for GRHL1 binding and applied it to a set of GRHL1 binding sites obtained from ChIP-Seq experiments from human cells. We identified 46 non-canonical GRHL1 binding sites, which were not found by a conventional PWM approach. Unexpectedly, some of the newly predicted binding sequences lacked the CNNG core motif, so far considered obligatory for GRHL1 binding. Using isothermal titration calorimetry, we experimentally confirmed binding between the GRHL1-DNA binding domain and predicted GRHL1 binding sites, including a non-canonical GRHL1 binding site. Mutagenesis of individual nucleotides revealed a correlation between predicted binding strength and experimentally validated binding affinity across representative sequences. This correlation was neither observed with a PWM-based nor another deep learning approach.

    "abstract": "The most popular model for the search of ChIP-seq data for transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) is the positional weight matrix (PWM). However, this model does not take into account dependencies between nucleotide occurrences in different site positions. Currently, two recently proposed models, BaMM and InMoDe, can do as much. However, application of these models was usually limited only to comparing their recognition accuracies with that of PWMs, while none of the analyses of the co-prediction and relative positioning of hits of different models in peaks has yet been performed. To close this gap, we propose the pipeline called MultiDeNA. This pipeline includes stages of model training, assessing their recognition accuracy, scanning ChIP-seq peaks and their classification based on scan results. We applied our pipeline to 22 ChIP-seq datasets of TF FOXA2 and considered PWM, dinucleotide PWM (diPWM), BaMM and InMoDe models. The combination of these four models allowed a significant increase in the fraction of recognized peaks compared to that for the sole PWM model: the increase was 26.3 %. The BaMM model provided the main contribution to the recognition of sites. Although the major fraction of predicted peaks contained TFBS of different models with coincided positions, the medians of the fraction of peaks containing the predictions of sole models were 1.08, 0.49, 4.15 and 1.73 % for PWM, diPWM, BaMM and InMoDe, respectively. Thus, FOXA2 BSs were not fully described by only a sole model, which indicates theirs heterogeneity. We assume that the BaMM model is the most successful in describing the structure of the FOXA2 BS in ChIP-seq datasets under study.",

The data highlight the extensive contribution of transposable elements to TF evolution, both in cis and trans, and identify tens of thousands of conserved, base-level binding sites in the human genome. The use of multiple assays provides an unprecedented opportunity to benchmark and analyze TF sequence specificity, function, and evolution, as further explored in accompanying manuscripts. 1,421 human TFs are now associated with a DNA binding motif. Extrapolation from the Codebook benchmarking, however, suggests that many of the currently known binding motifs for well-studied TFs may inaccurately describe the TF's true sequence preferences.",

    "abstract": "Most of the position weight matrix (PWM) based bioinformatics methods developed to predict transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) assume each nucleotide in the sequence motif contributes independently to the interaction between protein and DNA sequence, usually producing high false positive predictions. The increasing availability of TF enrichment profiles from recent ChIP-Seq methodology facilitates the investigation of dependent structure and accurate prediction of TFBSs. We develop a novel Tree-based PWM (TPWM) approach to accurately model the interaction between TF and its binding site. The whole tree-structured PWM could be considered as a mixture of different conditional-PWMs. We propose a discriminative approach, called TPD (TPWM based Discriminative Approach), to construct the TPWM from the ChIP-Seq data with a pre-existing PWM. To achieve the maximum discriminative power between the positive and negative datasets, the cutoff value is determined based on the Matthew Correlation Coefficient (MCC). The resulting TPWMs are evaluated with respect to accuracy on extensive synthetic datasets. We then apply our TPWM discriminative approach on several real ChIP-Seq datasets to refine the current TFBS models stored in the TRANSFAC database. Experiments on both the simulated and real ChIP-Seq data show that the proposed method starting from existing PWM has consistently better performance than existing tools in detecting the TFBSs. The improved accuracy is the result of modelling the complete dependent structure of the motifs and better prediction of true positive rate. The findings could lead to better understanding of the mechanisms of TF-DNA interactions.",

    "title": "Variable structure motifs for transcription factor binding sites.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Classically, models of DNA-transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) have been based on relatively few known instances and have treated them as sites of fixed length using position weight matrices (PWMs). Various extensions to this model have been proposed, most of which take account of dependencies between the bases in the binding sites. However, some transcription factors are known to exhibit some flexibility and bind to DNA in more than one possible physical configuration. In some cases this variation is known to affect the function of binding sites. With the increasing volume of ChIP-seq data available it is now possible to investigate models that incorporate this flexibility. Previous work on variable length models has been constrained by: a focus on specific zinc finger proteins in yeast using restrictive models; a reliance on hand-crafted models for just one transcription factor at a time; and a lack of evaluation on realistically sized data sets. RESULTS: We re-analysed binding sites from the TRANSFAC database and found motivating examples where our new variable length model provides a better fit. We analysed several ChIP-seq data sets with a novel motif search algorithm and compared the results to one of the best standard PWM finders and a recently developed alternative method for finding motifs of variable structure. All the methods performed comparably in held-out cross validation tests. Known motifs of variable structure were recovered for p53, Stat5a and Stat5b. In addition our method recovered a novel generalised version of an existing PWM for Sp1 that allows for variable length binding. This motif improved classification performance. CONCLUSIONS: We have presented a new gapped PWM model for variable length DNA binding sites that is not too restrictive nor over-parameterised. Our comparison with existing tools shows that on average it does not have better predictive accuracy than existing methods. However, it does provide more interpretable models of motifs of variable structure that are suitable for follow-up structural studies. To our knowledge, we are the first to apply variable length motif models to eukaryotic ChIP-seq data sets and consequently the first to show their value in this domain. The results include a novel motif for the ubiquitous transcription factor Sp1.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gene expression is regulated by transcription factors binding to specific target DNA sites. Understanding how and where transcription factors bind at genome scale represents an essential step toward our understanding of gene regulation networks. Previously we developed a structure-based method for prediction of transcription factor binding sites using an integrative energy function that combines a knowledge-based multibody potential and two atomic energy terms. While the method performs well, it is not computationally efficient due to the exponential increase in the number of binding sequences to be evaluated for longer binding sites. In this paper, we present an efficient pentamer algorithm by splitting DNA binding sequences into overlapping fragments along with a simplified integrative energy function for transcription factor binding site prediction. RESULTS: A DNA binding sequence is split into overlapping pentamers (5 base pairs) for calculating transcription factor-pentamer interaction energy. To combine the results from overlapping pentamer scores, we developed two methods, Kmer-Sum and PWM (Position Weight Matrix) stacking, for full-length binding motif prediction. Our results show that both Kmer-Sum and PWM stacking in the new pentamer approach along with a simplified integrative energy function improved transcription factor binding site prediction accuracy and dramatically reduced computation time, especially for longer binding sites. CONCLUSION: Our new fragment-based pentamer algorithm and simplified energy function improve both efficiency and accuracy. To our knowledge, this is the first fragment-based method for structure-based transcription factor binding sites prediction.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Transcription factors bind DNA in specific sequence contexts. In addition to distinguishing one nucleobase from another, some transcription factors can distinguish between unmodified and modified bases. Current models of transcription factor binding tend not to take DNA modifications into account, while the recent few that do often have limitations. This makes a comprehensive and accurate profiling of transcription factor affinities difficult. RESULTS: Here, we develop methods to identify transcription factor binding sites in modified DNA. Our models expand the standard A/C/G/T DNA alphabet to include cytosine modifications. We develop Cytomod to create modified genomic sequences and we also enhance the MEME Suite, adding the capacity to handle custom alphabets. We adapt the well-established position weight matrix (PWM) model of transcription factor binding affinity to this expanded DNA alphabet. Using these methods, we identify modification-sensitive transcription factor binding motifs. We confirm established binding preferences, such as the preference of ZFP57 and C/EBPbeta for methylated motifs and the preference of c-Myc for unmethylated E-box motifs. CONCLUSIONS: Using known binding preferences to tune model parameters, we discover novel modified motifs for a wide array of transcription factors. Finally, we validate our binding preference predictions for OCT4 using cleavage under targets and release using nuclease (CUT&RUN) experiments across conventional, methylation-, and hydroxymethylation-enriched sequences. Our approach readily extends to other DNA modifications. As more genome-wide single-base resolution modification data becomes available, we expect that our method will yield insights into altered transcription factor binding affinities across many different modifications.",

Using the NCBI API, TFinder extracts either promoter or gene terminal regulatory regions, through a simple query of NCBI gene name or ID. It enables simultaneous analysis across five different species for an unlimited number of genes. TFinder searches for Individual Motifs in different formats, including IUPAC codes and JASPAR entries. Moreover, TFinder also allows de novo generations of a Position Weight Matrix (PWM) and the use of already established PWM. Finally, the data are provided in a tabular and a graph format showing the relevance and the P-value of the Individual Motifs found as well as their location relative to the Transcription Start Site (TSS) or the terminal region of the gene. The results are then sent by email to users facilitating the subsequent data analysis and sharing.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: ChIP-Seq is widely used to detect genomic segments bound by transcription factors (TF), either directly at DNA binding sites (BSs) or indirectly via other proteins. Currently, there are many software tools implementing different approaches to identify TFBSs within ChIP-Seq peaks. However, their use for the interpretation of ChIP-Seq data is usually complicated by the absence of direct experimental verification, making it difficult both to set a threshold to avoid recognition of too many false-positive BSs, and to compare the actual performance of different models. RESULTS: Using ChIP-Seq data for FoxA2 binding loci in mouse adult liver and human HepG2 cells we compared FoxA binding-site predictions for four computational models of two fundamental classes: pattern matching based on existing training set of experimentally confirmed TFBSs (oPWM and SiteGA) and de novo motif discovery (ChIPMunk and diChIPMunk). To properly select prediction thresholds for the models, we experimentally evaluated affinity of 64 predicted FoxA BSs using EMSA that allows safely distinguishing sequences able to bind TF. As a result we identified thousands of reliable FoxA BSs within ChIP-Seq loci from mouse liver and human HepG2 cells. It was found that the performance of conventional position weight matrix (PWM) models was inferior with the highest false positive rate. On the contrary, the best recognition efficiency was achieved by the combination of SiteGA & diChIPMunk/ChIPMunk models, properly identifying FoxA BSs in up to 90% of loci for both mouse and human ChIP-Seq datasets. CONCLUSIONS: The experimental study of TF binding to oligonucleotides corresponding to predicted sites increases the reliability of computational methods for TFBS-recognition in ChIP-Seq data analysis. Regarding ChIP-Seq data interpretation, basic PWMs have inferior TFBS recognition quality compared to the more sophisticated SiteGA and de novo motif discovery methods. A combination of models from different principles allowed identification of proper TFBSs.",

    "title": "Optimally choosing PWM motif databases and sequence scanning approaches based on ChIP-seq data.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: For many years now, binding preferences of Transcription Factors have been described by so called motifs, usually mathematically defined by position weight matrices or similar models, for the purpose of predicting potential binding sites. However, despite the availability of thousands of motif models in public and commercial databases, a researcher who wants to use them is left with many competing methods of identifying potential binding sites in a genome of interest and there is little published information regarding the optimality of different choices. Thanks to the availability of large number of different motif models as well as a number of experimental datasets describing actual binding of TFs in hundreds of TF-ChIP-seq pairs, we set out to perform a comprehensive analysis of this matter. RESULTS: We focus on the task of identifying potential transcription factor binding sites in the human genome. Firstly, we provide a comprehensive comparison of the coverage and quality of models available in different databases, showing that the public databases have comparable TFs coverage and better motif performance than commercial databases. Secondly, we compare different motif scanners showing that, regardless of the database used, the tools developed by the scientific community outperform the commercial tools. Thirdly, we calculate for each motif a detection threshold optimizing the accuracy of prediction. Finally, we provide an in-depth comparison of different methods of choosing thresholds for all motifs a priori. Surprisingly, we show that selecting a common false-positive rate gives results that are the least biased by the information content of the motif and therefore most uniformly accurate. CONCLUSION: We provide a guide for researchers working with transcription factor motifs.

    "title": "Probing transcription factor combinatorics in different promoter classes and in enhancers.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In eukaryotic cells, transcription factors (TFs) are thought to act in a combinatorial way, by competing and collaborating to regulate common target genes. However, several questions remain regarding the conservation of these combinations among different gene classes, regulatory regions and cell types. RESULTS: We propose a new approach named TFcoop to infer the TF combinations involved in the binding of a target TF in a particular cell type. TFcoop aims to predict the binding sites of the target TF upon the nucleotide content of the sequences and of the binding affinity of all identified cooperating TFs. The set of cooperating TFs and model parameters are learned from ChIP-seq data of the target TF. We used TFcoop to investigate the TF combinations involved in the binding of 106 TFs on 41 cell types and in four regulatory regions: promoters of mRNAs, lncRNAs and pri-miRNAs, and enhancers. We first assess that TFcoop is accurate and outperforms simple PWM methods for predicting TF binding sites. Next, analysis of the learned models sheds light on important properties of TF combinations in different promoter classes and in enhancers. First, we show that combinations governing TF binding on enhancers are more cell-type specific than that governing binding in promoters. Second, for a given TF and cell type, we observe that TF combinations are different between promoters and enhancers, but similar for promoters of mRNAs, lncRNAs and pri-miRNAs. Analysis of the TFs cooperating with the different targets show over-representation of pioneer TFs and a clear preference for TFs with binding motif composition similar to that of the target. Lastly, our models accurately distinguish promoters associated with specific biological processes. CONCLUSIONS: TFcoop appears as an accurate approach for studying TF combinations. Its use on ENCODE and FANTOM data allowed us to discover important properties of human TF combinations in different promoter classes and in enhancers.

    "title": "Dinucleotide weight matrices for predicting transcription factor binding sites: generalizing the position weight matrix.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Identifying transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) in silico is key in understanding gene regulation. TFBS are string patterns that exhibit some variability, commonly modelled as \"position weight matrices\" (PWMs). Though convenient, the PWM has significant limitations, in particular the assumed independence of positions within the binding motif; and predictions based on PWMs are usually not very specific to known functional sites. Analysis here on binding sites in yeast suggests that correlation of dinucleotides is not limited to near-neighbours, but can extend over considerable gaps. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: I describe a straightforward generalization of the PWM model, that considers frequencies of dinucleotides instead of individual nucleotides. Unlike previous efforts, this method considers all dinucleotides within an extended binding region, and does not make an attempt to determine a priori the significance of particular dinucleotide correlations. I describe how to use a \"dinucleotide weight matrix\" (DWM) to predict binding sites, dealing in particular with the complication that its entries are not independent probabilities. Benchmarks show, for many factors, a dramatic improvement over PWMs in precision of predicting known targets. In most cases, significant further improvement arises by extending the commonly defined \"core motifs\" by about 10 bp on either side. Though this flanking sequence shows no strong motif at the nucleotide level, the predictive power of the dinucleotide model suggests that the \"signature\" in DNA sequence of protein-binding affinity extends beyond the core protein-DNA contact region. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: While computationally more demanding and slower than PWM-based approaches, this dinucleotide method is straightforward, both conceptually and in implementation, and can serve as a basis for future improvements.",

One of the key advancements in this release is the segregation of TF-binding motifs based on their cofactors and DNA methylation status.

MethMotif provides precomputed GO annotations for each human TF of interest, as well as for TF-co-TF complexes, enabling a comprehensive analysis of TF functions in the context of their co-factors.

    "abstract": "A long-standing challenge in human regulatory genomics is that transcription factor (TF) DNA-binding motifs are short and degenerate, while the genome is large. Motif scans therefore produce many false-positive binding site predictions. By surveying 179 TFs across 25 families using >1,500 cyclic in vitro selection experiments with fragmented, naked, and unmodified genomic DNA - a method we term GHT-SELEX (Genomic HT-SELEX) - we find that many human TFs possess much higher sequence specificity than anticipated. Moreover, genomic binding regions from GHT-SELEX are often surprisingly similar to those obtained in vivo (i.e. ChIP-seq peaks). We find that comparable specificity can also be obtained from motif scans, but performance is highly dependent on derivation and use of the motifs, including accounting for multiple local matches in the scans. We also observe alternative engagement of multiple DNA-binding domains within the same protein: long C2H2 zinc finger proteins often utilize modular DNA recognition, engaging different subsets of their DNA binding domain (DBD) arrays to recognize multiple types of distinct target sites, frequently evolving via internal duplication and divergence of one or more DBDs. Thus, contrary to conventional wisdom, it is common for TFs to possess sufficient intrinsic specificity to independently delineate cellular targets.",

Nearly half of them associated strongly with known regulatory regions such as promoters and enhancers, often at conserved motif matches and co-localizing with each other. Surprisingly, the other half often associated with genomic dark matter, at largely unique sites, via intrinsic sequence recognition. Dozens of these, which we term \"Dark TFs\", mainly bind within regions of closed chromatin. Dark TF binding sites are enriched for transposable elements, and are rarely under purifying selection. Some Dark TFs are KZNFs, which contain the repressive KRAB domain, but many are not: the Dark TFs also include known or potential pioneer TFs. Compiled literature information supports that the Dark TFs exert diverse functions ranging from early development to tumor suppression. Thus, our results sheds light on a large fraction of previously uncharacterized human TFs and their unappreciated activities within the dark matter genome.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Transcription factor (TF) binding site specificity is commonly represented by some form of matrix model in which the positions in the binding site are assumed to contribute independently to the site's activity. The independence assumption is known to be an approximation, often a good one but sometimes poor. Alternative approaches have been developed that use k-mers (DNA \"words\" of length k) to account for the non-independence, and more recently DNA structural parameters have been incorporated into the models. ChIP-seq data are often used to assess the discriminatory power of motifs and to compare different models. However, to measure the improvement due to using more complex models, one must compare to optimized matrix models. RESULTS: We describe a program \"Discriminative Additive Model Optimization\" (DAMO) that uses positive and negative examples, as in ChIP-seq data, and finds the additive position weight matrix (PWM) that maximizes the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC). We compare to a recent study where structural parameters, serving as features in a gradient boosting classifier algorithm, are shown to improve the AUROC over JASPAR position frequency matrices (PFMs). In agreement with the previous results, we find that adding structural parameters gives the largest improvement, but most of the gain can be obtained by an optimized PWM and nearly all of the gain can be obtained with a di-nucleotide extension to the PWM. CONCLUSION: To appropriately compare different models for TF bind sites, optimized models must be used. PWMs and their extensions are good representations of binding specificity for most TFs, and more complex models, including the incorporation of DNA shape features and gradient boosting classifiers, provide only moderate improvements for a few TFs.",

    "abstract": "MOTIVATION: Our understanding of how genes are regulated in a concerted fashion is still limited. Especially, complex phenomena like cell cycle regulation in multicellular organisms are poorly understood. Therefore, we investigated conserved predicted transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) in man-mouse upstream regions of genes that can be associated to a particular cell cycle phase in HeLa cells. TFBSs were predicted from selected binding site motifs (represented by position weight matrices, PWMs) based on a statistical approach. A regulatory role for a transcription factor is more probable if its predicted TFBSs are enriched in upstream regions of genes, that are associated with a subset of cell cycle phases. We tested for this association by computing exact P-values for the observed phase distributions under the null distribution defined by the relative amount of conserved upstream sequence of genes per cell cycle phase. We considered non-exonic and 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) binding sites separately and corrected for multiple testing by taking the false discovery rate into account. RESULTS: We identified 22 non-exonic and 11 5'-UTR significant PWM phase distributions although expecting one false discovery. Many of the corresponding transcription factors (e.g. members of the thyroid hormone/retinoid receptor subfamily) have already been associated with cell cycle regulation, proliferation and development. It appears that our method is a suitable tool for detecting putative cell cycle regulators in the realm of known human transcription factors.

    "abstract": "Sequence analysis frequently requires intuitive understanding and convenient representation of motifs. Typically, motifs are represented as position weight matrices (PWMs) and visualized using sequence logos. However, in many scenarios, in order to interpret the motif information or search for motif matches, it is compact and sufficient to represent motifs by wildcard-style consensus sequences (such as [GC][AT]GATAAG[GAC]). Based on mutual information theory and Jensen-Shannon divergence, we propose a mathematical framework to minimize the information loss in converting PWMs to consensus sequences. We name this representation as sequence Motto and have implemented an efficient algorithm with flexible options for converting motif PWMs into Motto from nucleotides, amino acids, and customized characters. We show that this representation provides a simple and efficient way to identify the binding sites of 1156 common transcription factors (TFs) in the human genome. The effectiveness of the method was benchmarked by comparing sequence matches found by Motto with PWM scanning results found by FIMO. On average, our method achieves a 0.81 area under the precision-recall curve, significantly (P-value < 0.01) outperforming all existing methods, including maximal positional weight, Cavener's method, and minimal mean square error. We believe this representation provides a distilled summary of a motif, as well as the statistical justification.",

    "title": "GRAFIMO: Variant and haplotype aware motif scanning on pangenome graphs.",
    "abstract": "Transcription factors (TFs) are proteins that promote or reduce the expression of genes by binding short genomic DNA sequences known as transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). While several tools have been developed to scan for potential occurrences of TFBS in linear DNA sequences or reference genomes, no tool exists to find them in pangenome variation graphs (VGs). VGs are sequence-labelled graphs that can efficiently encode collections of genomes and their variants in a single, compact data structure. Because VGs can losslessly compress large pangenomes, TFBS scanning in VGs can efficiently capture how genomic variation affects the potential binding landscape of TFs in a population of individuals. Here we present GRAFIMO (GRAph-based Finding of Individual Motif Occurrences), a command-line tool for the scanning of known TF DNA motifs represented as Position Weight Matrices (PWMs) in VGs. GRAFIMO extends the standard PWM scanning procedure by considering variations and alternative haplotypes encoded in a VG. Using GRAFIMO on a VG based on individuals from the 1000 Genomes project we recover several potential binding sites that are enhanced, weakened or missed when scanning only the reference genome, and which could constitute individual-specific binding events. GRAFIMO is available as an open-source tool, under the MIT license, at https://github.com/pinellolab/GRAFIMO and https://github.com/InfOmics/GRAFIMO.",

    "abstract": "SUMMARY: The state of the art in promoter modeling for higher eukaryotes is predicting not single transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs), but their combinations. The new tool utilizes a previously developed method of distance distributions of TFBS pairs. We model the random distribution of distances and compare it with the distribution observed in the query sequences. Comparison of the profiles allows filtering out the 'noise' and retaining the potentially functional combinations. This approach has proved its usefulness as a filtering technique for the selection of TFBS pairs for promoter modeling and is now implemented as a tool in R. As an input, it can use the outputs of three different TFBS- and motif-predictive tools (Gibbs Sampler for motifs, Match and MEME/FIMO for PWM-based search). The output is a list of predicted pairs on overrepresented distances with assigned scores, P-values and plots showing the distribution of pairs in the input sequences.

    "abstract": "Scanning through genomes for potential transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) is becoming increasingly important in this post-genomic era. The position weight matrix (PWM) is the standard representation of TFBSs utilized when scanning through sequences for potential binding sites. However, many transcription factor (TF) motifs are short and highly degenerate, and methods utilizing PWMs to scan for sites are plagued by false positives. Furthermore, many important TFs do not have well-characterized PWMs, making identification of potential binding sites even more difficult. One approach to the identification of sites for these TFs has been to use the 3D structure of the TF to predict the DNA structure around the TF and then to generate a PWM from the predicted 3D complex structure. However, this approach is dependent on the similarity of the predicted structure to the native structure. We introduce here a novel approach to identify TFBSs utilizing structure information that can be applied to TFs without characterized PWMs, as long as a 3D complex structure (TF/DNA) exists. This approach utilizes an energy function that is uniquely trained on each structure. Our approach leads to increased prediction accuracy and robustness compared with those using a more general energy function. The software is freely available upon request.",

    "title": "Inferring intra-motif dependencies of DNA binding sites from ChIP-seq data.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Statistical modeling of transcription factor binding sites is one of the classical fields in bioinformatics. The position weight matrix (PWM) model, which assumes statistical independence among all nucleotides in a binding site, used to be the standard model for this task for more than three decades but its simple assumptions are increasingly put into question. Recent high-throughput sequencing methods have provided data sets of sufficient size and quality for studying the benefits of more complex models. However, learning more complex models typically entails the danger of overfitting, and while model classes that dynamically adapt the model complexity to data have been developed, effective model selection is to date only possible for fully observable data, but not, e.g., within de novo motif discovery. RESULTS: To address this issue, we propose a stochastic algorithm for performing robust model selection in a latent variable setting. This algorithm yields a solution without relying on hyperparameter-tuning via massive cross-validation or other computationally expensive resampling techniques. Using this algorithm for learning inhomogeneous parsimonious Markov models, we study the degree of putative higher-order intra-motif dependencies for transcription factor binding sites inferred via de novo motif discovery from ChIP-seq data. We find that intra-motif dependencies are prevalent and not limited to first-order dependencies among directly adjacent nucleotides, but that second-order models appear to be the significantly better choice. CONCLUSIONS: The traditional PWM model appears to be indeed insufficient to infer realistic sequence motifs, as it is on average outperformed by more complex models that take into account intra-motif dependencies. Moreover, using such models together with an appropriate model selection procedure does not lead to a significant performance loss in comparison with the PWM model for any of the studied transcription factors. Hence, we find it worthwhile to recommend that any modern motif discovery algorithm should attempt to take into account intra-motif dependencies.",

We present a novel TF binding motif representation, the k-mer set memory (KSM), which consists of a set of aligned k-mers that are overrepresented at TF binding sites, and a new method called KMAC for de novo discovery of KSMs. We find that KSMs more accurately predict in vivo binding sites than position weight matrix (PWM) models and other more complex motif models across a large set of ChIP-seq experiments. Furthermore, KSMs outperform PWMs and more complex motif models in predicting in vitro binding sites. KMAC also identifies correct motifs in more experiments than five state-of-the-art motif discovery methods. In addition, KSM-derived features outperform both PWM and deep learning model derived sequence features in predicting differential regulatory activities of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) alleles. Finally, we have applied KMAC to 1600 ENCODE TF ChIP-seq data sets and created a public resource of KSM and PWM motifs. We expect that the KSM representation and KMAC method will be valuable in characterizing TF binding specificities and in interpreting the effects of noncoding genetic variations.",

Sequence logo - a graphical representation of PWM, has been widely used in scientific publications and reports, due to its easiness of human perception, rich information, and simple format. Different from sequence logo, PWM works great as a precise and compact digitalized form, which can be easily used by a variety of motif analysis software. There are a few available tools to generate sequence logos from PWM; however, no tool does the reverse. Such tool to convert sequence logo back to PWM is needed to scan a TFBS represented in logo format in a publication where the PWM is not provided or hard to be acquired. A major difficulty in developing such tool to convert sequence logo to PWM is to deal with the diversity of sequence logo images. RESULTS: We propose logo2PWM for reconstructing PWM from a large variety of sequence logo images. Evaluation results on over one thousand logos from three sources of different logo format show that the correlation between the reconstructed PWMs and the original PWMs are constantly high, where median correlation is greater than 0.97. CONCLUSION: Because of the high recognition accuracy, the easiness of usage, and, the availability of both web-based service and stand-alone application, we believe that logo2PWM can readily benefit the study of transcription by filling the gap between sequence logo and PWM.",

    "title": "A general pairwise interaction model provides an accurate description of in vivo transcription factor binding sites.",
    "abstract": "The identification of transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) on genomic DNA is of crucial importance for understanding and predicting regulatory elements in gene networks. TFBS motifs are commonly described by Position Weight Matrices (PWMs), in which each DNA base pair contributes independently to the transcription factor (TF) binding. However, this description ignores correlations between nucleotides at different positions, and is generally inaccurate: analysing fly and mouse in vivo ChIPseq data, we show that in most cases the PWM model fails to reproduce the observed statistics of TFBSs. To overcome this issue, we introduce the pairwise interaction model (PIM), a generalization of the PWM model. The model is based on the principle of maximum entropy and explicitly describes pairwise correlations between nucleotides at different positions, while being otherwise as unconstrained as possible. It is mathematically equivalent to considering a TF-DNA binding energy that depends additively on each nucleotide identity at all positions in the TFBS, like the PWM model, but also additively on pairs of nucleotides. We find that the PIM significantly improves over the PWM model, and even provides an optimal description of TFBS statistics within statistical noise. The PIM generalizes previous approaches to interdependent positions: it accounts for co-variation of two or more base pairs, and predicts secondary motifs, while outperforming multiple-motif models consisting of mixtures of PWMs. We analyse the structure of pairwise interactions between nucleotides, and find that they are sparse and dominantly located between consecutive base pairs in the flanking region of TFBS. Nonetheless, interactions between pairs of non-consecutive nucleotides are found to play a significant role in the obtained accurate description of TFBS statistics. The PIM is computationally tractable, and provides a general framework that should be useful for describing and predicting TFBSs beyond PWMs.",

    "abstract": "New high-throughput technique ChIP-seq, coupling chromatin immunoprecipitation experiment with high-throughput sequencing technologies, has extended the identification of binding locations of a transcription factor to the genome-wide regions. However, the most existing motif discovery algorithms are time-consuming and limited to identify binding motifs in ChIP-seq data which normally has the significant characteristics of large scale data. In order to improve the efficiency, we propose a fast cluster motif finding algorithm, named as FCmotif, to identify the (l,  d) motifs in large scale ChIP-seq data set. It is inspired by the emerging substrings mining strategy to find the enriched substrings and then searching the neighborhood instances to construct PWM and cluster motifs in different length. FCmotif is not following the OOPS model constraint and can find long motifs. The effectiveness of proposed algorithm has been proved by experiments on the ChIP-seq data sets from mouse ES cells. The whole detection of the real binding motifs and processing of the full size data of several megabytes finished in a few minutes. The experimental results show that FCmotif has advantageous to deal with the (l,  d) motif finding in the ChIP-seq data; meanwhile it also demonstrates better performance than other current widely-used algorithms such as MEME, Weeder, ChIPMunk, and DREME.",

    "abstract": "MOTIVATION: Existing computational methods that identify transcription factor (TF) binding sites on a gene's promoter are plagued by significant inaccuracies. Binding of a TF to a particular sequence is assessed by comparing its similarity score, obtained from the TF's known position weight matrix (PWM), to a threshold. If the similarity score is above the threshold, the sequence is considered a putative binding site. Determining this threshold is a central part of the problem, for which no satisfactory biologically based solution exists. RESULTS: We present here a method that integrates gene expression data with sequence-based scoring of TF binding sites, for determining a global score threshold for each TF. We validate our method, STOP (Searching TFs Of Promoters), in several ways: (1) we calculate the average expression values of groups of human putative target genes of each TF, and compare them to similar averages derived for random gene groups. The groups of putative targets show significantly higher relative average expression. (2) We find high consistency between the induced lists of putative targets in human and in mouse. (3) The expression patterns associated with human and mouse genes (ordered by PWM scores for each TF) exhibit high similarity between human and mouse, indicating that our method has firm biological basis. (4) Comparison of results obtained by STOP and PRIMA (Elkon et al., 2003) suggests that determining the score threshold using gene expression, as is done in STOP, is more biologically tuned.

    "abstract": "Typical approaches for predicting transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) involve use of a position-specific weight matrix (PWM) to statistically characterize the sequences of the known sites. Recently, an alternative physicochemical approach, called SiteSleuth, was proposed. In this approach, a linear support vector machine (SVM) classifier is trained to distinguish TFBSs from background sequences based on local chemical and structural features of DNA. SiteSleuth appears to generally perform better than PWM-based methods. Here, we improve the SiteSleuth approach by considering both new physicochemical features and algorithmic modifications. New features are derived from Gibbs energies of amino acid-DNA interactions and hydroxyl radical cleavage profiles of DNA. Algorithmic modifications consist of inclusion of a feature selection step, use of a nonlinear kernel in the SVM classifier, and use of a consensus-based post-processing step for predictions. We also considered SVM classification based on letter features alone to distinguish performance gains from use of SVM-based models versus use of physicochemical features.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Transcription factor (TF) binding motifs are identified by high throughput sequencing technologies as means to capture Protein-DNA interactions. These motifs are often represented by consensus sequences in form of position weight matrices (PWMs). With ever-increasing pool of TF binding motifs from multiple sources, redundancy issues are difficult to avoid, especially when every source maintains its own database for collection. One solution can be to cluster biologically relevant or similar PWMs, whether coming from experimental detection or in silico predictions. However, there is a lack of efficient tools to cluster PWMs. Assessing quality of PWM clusters is yet another challenge. Therefore, new methods and tools are required to efficiently cluster PWMs and assess quality of clusters. RESULTS: A new Python package Affinity Based Clustering for Position Weight Matrices (abc4pwm) was developed. It efficiently clustered PWMs from multiple sources with or without using DNA-Binding Domain (DBD) information, generated a representative motif for each cluster, evaluated the clustering quality automatically, and filtered out incorrectly clustered PWMs. Additionally, it was able to update human DBD family database automatically, classified known human TF PWMs to the respective DBD family, and performed TF motif searching and motif discovery by a new ensemble learning approach. CONCLUSION: This work demonstrates applications of abc4pwm in the DNA sequence analysis for various high throughput sequencing data using ~ 1770 human TF PWMs. It recovered known TF motifs at gene promoters based on gene expression profiles (RNA-seq) and identified true TF binding targets for motifs predicted from ChIP-seq experiments. Abc4pwm is a useful tool for TF motif searching, clustering, quality assessment and integration in multiple types of sequence data analysis including RNA-seq, ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq.",

    "abstract": "MOTIVATION: The sequence specificity of DNA-binding proteins is typically represented as a position weight matrix in which each base position contributes independently to relative affinity. Assessment of the accuracy and broad applicability of this representation has been limited by the lack of extensive DNA-binding data. However, new microarray techniques, in which preferences for all possible K-mers are measured, enable a broad comparison of both motif representation and methods for motif discovery. Here, we consider the problem of accounting for all of the binding data in such experiments, rather than the highest affinity binding data. We introduce the RankMotif++, an algorithm designed for finding motifs whenever sequences are associated with a semi-quantitative measure of protein-DNA-binding affinity. RankMotif++ learns motif models by maximizing the likelihood of a set of binding preferences under a probabilistic model of how sequence binding affinity translates into binding preference observations. Because RankMotif++ makes few assumptions about the relationship between binding affinity and the semi-quantitative readout, it is applicable to a wide variety of experimental assays of DNA-binding preference. RESULTS: By several criteria, RankMotif++ predicts binding affinity better than two widely used motif finding algorithms (MDScan, MatrixREDUCE) or more recently developed algorithms (PREGO, Seed and Wobble), and its performance is comparable to a motif model that separately assigns affinities to 8-mers. Our results validate the PWM model and provide an approximation of the precision and recall that can be expected in a genomic scan. AVAILABILITY: RankMotif++ is available upon request.

    "abstract": "A sufficient supply molecular oxygen is essential for the maintenance of physiologic metabolism and bioenergetic homeostasis for most metazoans. For this reason, mechanisms have evolved for eukaryotic cells to adapt to conditions where oxygen demand exceeds supply (hypoxia). These mechanisms rely on the modification of pre-existing proteins, translational arrest and transcriptional changes. The hypoxia inducible factor (HIF; a master regulator of gene induction in response to hypoxia) is responsible for the majority of induced gene expression in hypoxia. However, much less is known about the mechanism(s) responsible for gene repression, an essential part of the adaptive transcriptional response. Hypoxia-induced gene repression leads to a reduction in energy demanding processes and the redirection of limited energetic resources to essential housekeeping functions. Recent developments have underscored the importance of transcriptional repressors in cellular adaptation to hypoxia. To date, at least ten distinct transcriptional repressors have been reported to demonstrate sensitivity to hypoxia. Central among these is the Repressor Element-1 Silencing Transcription factor (REST), which regulates over 200 genes. In this review, written to honor the memory and outstanding scientific legacy of Lorenz Poellinger, we provide an overview of our existing knowledge with respect to transcriptional repressors and their target genes in hypoxia.",

In this chapter, we review the regulatory roles of CueR in the model organism Escherichia coli and the mechanisms for CueR in copper binding, DNA recognition, and interplay with RNA polymerase in regulating transcription. In light of biochemical and structural analyses, we provide molecular details for how CueR represses transcription in the absence of copper ions, how copper ions mediate CueR conformational change to form holo CueR, and how CueR bends and twists promoter DNA to activate transcription. We also characterize the functional domains and key residues involved in these processes.

Nuclear factor-1 proteins and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4, which bind to the L-II element, may also be involved in carbohydrate and polyunsaturated fatty acid regulation of the L-PK gene respectively. However, the L-III-element-binding protein that is involved in carbohydrate regulation remains to be clarified, although involvement by an upstream stimulating factor has been proposed. Available evidence suggests that the carbohydrate signalling pathway to the L-PK gene includes a glucose metabolite, possibly glucose 6-phosphate or xylulose 5-phosphate, as well as phosphorylation and dephosphorylation mechanisms. In addition, at least five regulatory elements have been identified in the 5' flanking region of the PKM gene up to position -279. Sp1-family proteins bind to two proximal elements, but the binding of proteins to other elements have not yet been clarified. Glucose may stimulate the transcription of the PKM gene via hexosamine derivatives. Sp1 may be involved in this regulation via its dephosphorylation, although the carbohydrate response element has not been determined precisely in the PKM gene. Thus glucose stimulates transcription of the PKM gene by the mechanism which is probably different from the L-PK gene.",

    "title": "Proteolysis and sterol regulation.",
    "abstract": "The mammalian cell continuously adjusts its sterol content by regulating levels of key sterol synthetic enzymes and levels of LDL receptors that mediate uptake of cholesterol-laden particles. Control is brought about by sterol-regulated transcription of relevant genes and by regulated degradation of the committed step enzyme HMG-CoA reductase (HMGR). Current work has revealed that proteolysis is at the heart of each of these mechanistically distinct axes. Transcriptional control is effected by regulated cleavage of the membrane-bound transcription factor sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP), and HMGR degradation is brought about by ubiquitin-mediated degradation. In each case, ongoing cell biological processes are being harnessed to bring about regulation. The secretory pathway plays a central role in allowing sterol-mediated control of transcription. The constitutively active endoplasmic reticulum (ER) quality control apparatus is employed to bring about regulated destruction of HMGR. This review describes the methods and results of various studies to understand the mechanisms and molecules involved in these distinct but interrelated aspects of sterol regulation and the intriguing similarities that appear to exist at the levels of protein sequence and cell biology.",

    "abstract": "Protein signaling and regulation of gene expression are the two major mechanisms that regulate cellular proliferation in leukemia. Discerning the function of these processes is essential for understanding the pathogenesis of leukemia and for developing the targeted therapies. Here, we provide an overview of one of the mechanisms that regulates gene transcription in leukemia. This mechanism involves the direct interaction between Casein Kinase II (CK2) and the Ikaros transcription factor. Ikaros (IKZF1) functions as a master regulator of hematopoiesis and a tumor suppressor in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Impaired Ikaros function results in the development of high-risk leukemia. Ikaros binds to the upstream regulatory elements of its target genes and regulates their transcription via chromatin remodeling. In vivo, Ikaros is a target for CK2, a pro-oncogenic kinase. CK2 directly phosphorylates Ikaros at multiple amino acids. Functional experiments showed that CK2-mediated phosphorylation of Ikaros, regulates Ikaros' DNA binding affinity, subcellular localization and protein stability. Recent studies revealed that phosphorylation of Ikaros by CK2 regulates Ikaros binding and repression of the terminal deoxytransferase (TdT) gene in normal thymocytes and in T-cell ALL. Available data suggest that the oncogenic activity of CK2 in leukemia involves functional inactivation of Ikaros and provide a rationale for CK2 inhibitors as a potential treatment for ALL.",

In embryonic cells and tissues, TNAP expression was driven preferentially by the exon 1A (E1A) promoter, one of the two promoters previously defined. Transcriptional activity of E1A promoter was up-regulated by retinoic acid (RA) through a putative RA-responsive element. Transgenic mice analysis with lacZ reporter constructs revealed negative regulatory elements within 8.5 kb of E1A promoter. Promoter sequences of endogenous TNAP in non-expressing tissues and those carried by the 8.5 kb-lacZ transgene were found to be highly methylated. A 1 kb fragment of E1A promoter increased the methylation level of lacZ and promoter sequences. The role of RA and DNA methylation in defining the embryonic expression pattern of TNAP is discussed.",

    "abstract": "To understand most cellular processes, one must understand how genetic information is processed. A formidable challenge is the dissection of gene regulatory networks to delineate how eukaryotic cells coordinate and govern patterns of gene expression that ultimately lead to a phenotype. In this paper, we review several approaches for modeling eukaryotic gene regulatory networks and for reverse engineering such networks from experimental observations. Since we are interested in elucidating the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms of colon cancer progression, we use this important biological problem to illustrate various aspects of modeling gene regulation. We discuss four important models: gene networks, transcriptional regulatory systems, Boolean networks, and dynamical Bayesian networks. We review state-of-the-art functional genomics techniques, such as gene expression profiling, cis-regulatory element identification, TF target gene identification, and gene silencing by RNA interference, which can be used to extract information about gene regulation. We can employ this information, in conjunction with appropriately designed reverse engineering algorithms, to construct a computational model of gene regulation that sufficiently predicts experimental observations. In the last part of this review, we focus on the problem of reverse engineering transcriptional regulatory networks by gene perturbations. We mathematically formulate this problem and discuss the role of experimental resolution in our ability to reconstruct accurate models of gene regulation. We conclude, by discussing a promising approach for inferring a transcriptional regulatory system from microarray data obtained by gene perturbations.",

    "abstract": "Sodium valproate (VPA) is a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, widely prescribed in the treatment of bipolar disorder, and yet the precise modes of therapeutic action for this drug are not fully understood. After exposure of the rat serotonergic cell line RN46A to VPA, RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis showed widespread changes in gene expression. Analysis by four bioinformatic pipelines revealed as many as 230 genes were significantly upregulated and 72 genes were significantly downregulated. A subset of 23 differentially expressed genes was selected for validation using the nCounter(R) platform, and of these we obtained robust validation for ADAM23, LSP1, MAOB, MMP13, PAK3, SERPINB2, SNAP91, WNT6, and ZCCHC12. We investigated the effect of lithium on this subset and found four genes, CDKN1C, LSP1, SERPINB2, and WNT6 co-regulated by lithium and VPA. We also explored the effects of other HDAC inhibitors and the VPA analogue valpromide on the subset of 23 selected genes. Expression of eight of these genes, CDKN1C, MAOB, MMP13, NGFR, SHANK3, VGF, WNT6 and ZCCHC12, was modified by HDAC inhibition, whereas others did not appear to respond to several HDAC inhibitors tested. These results suggest VPA may regulate genes through both HDAC-dependent and independent mechanisms. Understanding the broader gene regulatory effects of VPA in this serotonergic cell model should provide insights into how this drug works and whether other HDAC inhibitor compounds may have similar gene regulatory effects, as well as highlighting molecular processes that may underlie regulation of mood.",

    "abstract": "We recently cloned cDNAs encoding three subtypes of human alpha1-adrenergic receptors (alpha1ARs), alpha1a, alpha1b, and alpha1d (Schwinn, D. A., Johnston, G. L., Page, S. O., Mosley, M. J., Wilson, K. H., Worman, N. P., Campbell, S., Fidock, M. D., Furness, L. M., Parry-Smith, D. J., Peter, B., and Bailey, D. S. (1995) J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 272, 134-142) and demonstrated predominance of alpha1aARs in many human tissues (Price, D. T., Lefkowitz, R. J., Caron, M. G., Berkowitz, D., and Schwinn, D. A. (1994) Mol. Pharmacol. 45, 171-175). Several lines of evidence indicate that alpha1aARs are important in clinical diseases such as myocardial hypertrophy and benign prostatic hyperplasia. Therefore, we initiated studies to understand mechanisms underlying regulation of alpha1aAR gene transcription. A genomic clone containing 6.2 kb of 5'-untranslated region of the human alpha1aAR gene was recently isolated. Ribonuclease protection and primer extension assays indicate that alpha1aAR gene transcription occurs at multiple initiation sites with the major site located 696 base pairs upstream of the ATG, where a classic initiator sequence is located. Transfection of luciferase reporter constructs containing varying amounts of 5'-untranslated region into human SK-N-MC neuroblastoma cells indicate that a region extending 125 base pairs upstream from the main transcription initiation site contains full alpha1aAR promoter activity. Furthermore, distinct activator and suppressor elements lie 2-3 and 3-5 kilobase pairs upstream, respectively. Although the alpha1aAR promoter contains neither TATA or CAAT elements, gel shift mobility assays targeting three GC boxes immediately upstream of the main transcription initiation site confirm binding of Sp1. Activity of the alpha1aAR promoter is cell-specific, demonstrating highest activity in cells endogenously expressing alpha1aARs. The human alpha1aAR gene also contains several cis regulatory elements, including several insulin and cAMP response elements. Consistent with these observations, we provide the first evidence that treatment of SK-N-MC cells with insulin and cAMP elevating agents leads to an increase in alpha1aAR expression. In conclusion, these data represent the first characterization of the alpha1aAR gene; our findings should facilitate further studies designed to understand mechanisms regulating alpha1AR subtype-specific expression in healthy and diseased human tissue.",

    "abstract": "Cysteine donates sulfur to macromolecules and occurs naturally in many proteins. Because low concentrations of cysteine are cytotoxic, its intracellular concentration is stringently controlled. In bacteria, cysteine biosynthesis is regulated by feedback inhibition of the activities of serine acetyltransferase (SAT) and 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (3-PGDH) and is also regulated at the transcriptional level by inducing the cysteine regulon using the master regulator CysB. Here, we describe two novel cysteine-inducible systems that regulate the cysteine resistance of Pantoea ananatis, a member of the family Enterobacteriaceae that shows great potential for producing substances useful for biotechnological, medical, and industrial purposes. One locus, designated ccdA(formerly PAJ_0331), encodes a novel cysteine-inducible cysteine desulfhydrase (CD) that degrades cysteine, and its expression is controlled by the transcriptional regulator encoded byccdR(formerly PAJ_0332 orybaO), located just upstream of ccdA The other locus, designated cefA (formerly PAJ_3026), encodes a novel cysteine-inducible cysteine efflux pump that is controlled by the transcriptional regulator cefR(formerly PAJ_3027), located just upstream of cefA To our knowledge, this is the first example where the expression of CD and an efflux pump is regulated in response to cysteine and is directly involved in imparting resistance to excess levels of cysteine. We propose that ccdA and cefA function as safety valves that maintain homeostasis when the intra- or extracellular cysteine concentration fluctuates. Our findings contribute important insights into optimizing the production of cysteine and related biomaterials by P. ananatis IMPORTANCE: Because of its toxicity, the bacterial intracellular cysteine level is stringently regulated at biosynthesis. This work describes the identification and characterization of two novel cysteine-inducible systems that regulate, through degradation and efflux, the cysteine resistance of Pantoea ananatis, a member of the family Enterobacteriaceae that shows great potential for producing substances useful for industrial purposes. We propose that this novel mechanism for sensing and regulating cysteine levels is a safety valve enabling adaptation to sudden changes in intra- or extracellular cysteine levels in bacteria. Our findings provide important insights into optimizing the production of cysteine and related biomaterials by P. ananatis and also a deep understanding of sulfur/cysteine metabolism and regulation in this plant pathogen and related bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Cobalt chloride has been used as a hypoxia mimetic because it stabilizes hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha (HIF1-alpha) and activates gene transcription through a hypoxia responsive element (HRE). However, differences between hypoxia and hypoxia mimetic cobalt chloride in gene regulation remain elusive. Expression of ferritin, the major iron storage protein, is regulated at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels through DNA and RNA regulatory elements. Here we demonstrate that hypoxia and cobalt chloride regulate ferritin heavy chain (ferritin H) expression by two distinct mechanisms. Both hypoxia and cobalt chloride increased HIF1-alpha but a putative HRE in the human ferritin H gene was not activated. Instead, cobalt chloride but not hypoxia activated ferritin H transcription through an antioxidant responsive element (ARE), to which Nrf2 was recruited. Intriguingly, cobalt chloride downregulated ferritin H protein expression while it upregulated other ARE-regulated antioxidant genes in K562 cells. Further characterization demonstrated that cobalt chloride increased interaction between iron regulatory proteins (IRP1 and IRP2) and iron responsive element (IRE) in the 5'UTR of ferritin H mRNA, resulting in translational block of the accumulated ferritin H mRNA. In contrast, hypoxia had marginal effect on ferritin H transcription but increased its translation through decreased IRP1-IRE interaction. These results suggest that hypoxia and hypoxia mimetic cobalt chloride employ distinct regulatory mechanisms through the interplay between DNA and mRNA elements at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels.",

Protein-protein association can modulate regulation by both signal transduction-regulated transcription factors and homeodomain proteins, as observed in Drosophila and other organisms. Enhancers or genes regulated by multiple transcription factors provide opportunities for protein-protein binding to modulate transcription factor function. Combinatorial regulation of several enhancers by homeodomain proteins and cell signaling-regulated transcription factors is discussed; detailed maps of the genetic interactions that pattern the embryonic midgut and the larval wing imaginal disc are used to illustrate the multiplicity of potential protein-protein interactions. These interactions potentially provide direct mechanisms for communication between transcription factors as well as for generating the requisite functional specificity.",

To study the mechanism of this induction, the 5'-flanking region of a mouse glutathione S-transferase Ya subunit gene was fused to the structural gene for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. The fusion gene was introduced into hepatoma cells for the assay of the expressed acetyltransferase activity. At least two cis-regulatory elements were identified in the 5'-flanking region of the Ya gene: one, responsible for the basal level of expression, is present in the sequence up to -0.2 kb; another, responsible for the inducible expression by aromatic compounds such as beta-naphthoflavone and 3-methylcholanthrene, is located in the sequence from -0.2 kb to -1.6 kb. The inducible element was functional only in cells with normal aromatic compound receptors, and it retained responsiveness to beta-naphthoflavone when transfected into homologous (mouse) or heterologous (rat, human) hepatoma cells. A 150-bp region upstream from the transcription initiation site of the mouse Ya gene was investigated for cis-acting transcriptional elements that are recognized by specific DNA-binding proteins. We show by DNase I foot-printing assays using extracts from liver nuclei that the Ya gene promoter contains, in addition to the TATA and CCAAT boxes, a more distal element that binds a protein which is probably related to the family of nuclear factor 1 (NF1).",

    "abstract": "Myelin basic proteins (MBPs) represent a major component of the myelin membrane which are exclusively expressed by glial cells in the nervous system. The cell type-specific expression of MBP is controlled preferentially at the level of RNA synthesis. To investigate the mechanisms by which the MBP gene is regulated, we analyzed transcriptional regulation of this gene in glial and non-glial cells. We have demonstrated that the 320 base pairs upstream of the MBP transcriptional start site contain regulatory elements that preferentially stimulate transcription of MBPs in glial cells. Using a test vector containing the simian virus 40 (SV40) early promoter placed upstream of the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene, we localized three major promoter elements within the 5'-upstream sequence. These elements, designated MB1, MB4, and MB7, spanning proximal (-14 to -50) and distal (-130 to -169 and -249 to -288) positions with respect to the RNA initiation site, activated SV40 promoter transcription more than 40-fold in glial cells. The promoter distal elements, MB4 and MB7, enhanced SV40 promoter activity 2- and 8-fold, respectively, in L cells. Using the gel mobility shift assay, we have demonstrated that the MBP activators (MB1, MB4, and MB7) interact with multiple proteins derived from glial and L cell extract and result in the formation of several complexes. Comparison of band intensity of these complexes implies that these cells contain both unique and ubiquitous DNA binding proteins that recognize the DNA sequences within these activators. These studies suggest that the MBP promoter consists of several regulatory sequences in which the proximal element, MB1, and one of the distal elements, MB4, are selectively more active in glial cells than in L cells. Thus, these novel regulatory elements, in concert with other sequences, appear to stimulate MBP promoter transcription in glial cells.",

    "abstract": "In this study, using a transposon-based strategy, two novel regulatory genes were identified as being involved in the biosynthesis of both pristinamycin I (PI) and II (PII) in Streptomyces pristinaespiralis, including a TetR-family regulatory gene atrA-p (SSDG_00466) and an orphan histidine kinase gene SSDG_02492. The mechanism by which AtrA-p exerted a positive role in pristinamycin production was elucidated. We showed that deletion of atrA-p resulted in a delayed production of both PI and PII as well as reduced PII production. Transcriptional analysis integrated with electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) demonstrated that AtrA-p played a positive role in pristinamycin production by directly activating the transcription of two cluster-situated regulatory genes, spbR and papR5, which encode a gamma-butyrolactone receptor protein and a TetR-family repressor, respectively. The precise AtrA-p-binding sites upstream of these two targets were determined, which allowed the identification of a relatively conserved binding motif comprising two 5-nt inverted repeats separated by a variable 5-nt sequence (5'-GGAAT-n5-ATTCC-3') possibly required for the regulation of AtrA-like regulators in Streptomyces. Base substitutions of the AtrA-p-binding sites on the genome caused similar decreases in spbR and papR5 transcription as those observed in ∆atrA-p. Taken together, herein, a novel mechanism for AtrA-dependent regulation of antibiotic biosynthesis was revealed in S. pristinaespiralis, which is distinct from those of its homologs, AtrA-c from Streptomyces coelicolor, AtrA-g from Streptomyces griseus, and AtrA from Streptomyces roseosporus that perform their effects in antibiotic biosynthesis directly via pathway-specific activator genes or the biosynthetic structural genes.",

    "abstract": "The signaling cascades triggered by neurotrophins such as BDNF and by several neurotransmitters and hormones lead to the rapid induction of gene transcription by increasing the intracellular concentration of cAMP and Ca2+. This review examines the mechanisms by which these second messengers control transcriptional initiation at CRE promoters via transcription factor CREB, as well as at DRE sites via transcriptional repressor DREAM. The regulation of the SLC8A3 gene encoding the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger 3 (NCX3) is taken as an example to illustrate both mechanisms since it includes a CRE site in the promoter and several DRE sites in the exon 1 sequence. The upregulation of the NCX3 by Ca2+ signals may be specifically required to establish the Ca2+ balance that regulates several physiological and pathological processes in neurons. The regulatory features and the expression pattern of SLC8A3 gene suggest that NCX3 activity could be crucial in neuronal functions such as memory formation and sensory processing.",

    "abstract": "The abnormal transcriptional regulation of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) and protein-coding genes (PCGs) is contributed to various biological processes and linked with human diseases, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. In this study, we developed ChIPBase v2.0 (http://rna.sysu.edu.cn/chipbase/) to explore the transcriptional regulatory networks of ncRNAs and PCGs. ChIPBase v2.0 has been expanded with  approximately 10 200 curated ChIP-seq datasets, which represent about 20 times expansion when comparing to the previous released version. We identified thousands of binding motif matrices and their binding sites from ChIP-seq data of DNA-binding proteins and predicted millions of transcriptional regulatory relationships between transcription factors (TFs) and genes. We constructed 'Regulator' module to predict hundreds of TFs and histone modifications that were involved in or affected transcription of ncRNAs and PCGs. Moreover, we built a web-based tool, Co-Expression, to explore the co-expression patterns between DNA-binding proteins and various types of genes by integrating the gene expression profiles of  approximately 10 000 tumor samples and  approximately 9100 normal tissues and cell lines. ChIPBase also provides a ChIP-Function tool and a genome browser to predict functions of diverse genes and visualize various ChIP-seq data. This study will greatly expand our understanding of the transcriptional regulations of ncRNAs and PCGs.",

    "abstract": "Like most bacteria, Shigella must maintain a precise balance between the necessity and toxicity of iron; a balance that is achieved, at least in part, by regulating the production of bacterial iron acquisition systems in response to specific environmental signals. Using the Shigella heme utilization (Shu) system, S. dysenteriae is able to acquire iron from heme, a potentially rich source of nutritional iron within the otherwise iron-limited environment of the human host. Investigations presented within reveal two distinct molecular mechanisms underlying previously uncharacterized transcriptional and translational regulation of shuT, a gene encoding the periplasmic-binding component of the Shu system. While shuT transcription is regulated in response to iron availability via a process dependent upon the global regulator Fur and a Fur-binding site located immediately downstream of the promoter, shuT translation is regulated in response to environmental temperature via the activity of an RNA thermometer located within the 5' untranslated region of the gene. Such complex regulation likely increases the fitness of S. dysenteriae by ensuring maximal ShuT production when the pathogen is within the iron-limited and relatively warm environment of the infected host, the only environment in which heme will be encountered as a potential source of essential iron.",

    "abstract": "The ferric uptake regulator (Fur) is a global regulator that influences the expression of virulence genes in Klebsiella pneumoniae. Bioinformatics analysis suggests Fur may involve in iron acquisition via the identified regulatory box upstream of the yersiniabactin receptor gene fyuA. To observe the impact of the gene fyuA on the virulence of K. pneumoniae, the gene fyuA knockout strain and complementation strain were constructed and then conducted a series of phenotypic experiments including chrome azurol S (CAS) detection, crystal violet staining, and wax moth virulence experiment. To examine the regulatory relationship between Fur and the gene fyuA, green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene fusion assay, real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), gel migration assay (EMSA), and DNase I footprinting assay were used to clarify the regulatory mechanism of Fur on fyuA. CAS detection revealed that the gene fyuA could affect the generation of iron carriers in K. pneumoniae. Crystal violet staining experiment showed that fyuA could positively influence biofilm formation. Wax moth virulence experiment indicated that the deletion of the fyuA could weaken bacterial virulence. GFP reporter gene fusion experiment and RT-qPCR analysis revealed that Fur negatively regulated the expression of fyuA in iron-sufficient environment. EMSA experiment demonstrated that Fur could directly bind to the promoter region of fyuA, and DNase I footprinting assay further identified the specific binding site sequences. The study showed that Fur negatively regulated the transcriptional expression of fyuA by binding to upstream of the gene promoter region, and then affected the virulence of K. pneumoniae.",

From transient chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene (cat) expression assays in SM cells, a DNA fragment from nt -123 to +49 containing two CArG boxes showed strong positive promoter activity, whereas a far upstream region from nt -253 to -124 showed a negative effect. The conserved region in the first intron also contains the CArG box and showed an enhancer activity. Therefore, the human SM alpha A gene is controlled under positive and negative mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "The information encoded in genomes supports the differentiation and function of the more than 200 unique cell types, which exist in various mammalian species. The major mechanism driving cellular differentiation and specification is differential gene expression regulation. Cis-acting enhancers and silencers appear to have key roles in regulating the expression of mammalian genes. However, these cis-acting elements are often located very far away from the regulated gene. Therefore, it is hard to find all of them and link them to the regulated gene. An intriguing and unresolved issue of the field is to identify all of the enhancers of a particular gene and link these short regulatory sequences to the genes they regulate and thus, reliably identify gene regulatory enhancer networks. Recent advances in molecular biological methods coupled with Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies have opened up new possibilities in this area of genomics. In this review we summarize the technological advances, bioinformatics challenges and the potential molecular mechanisms allowing the construction of enhancer networks operating in specific cell types and/or activated by various signals.",

    "abstract": "There has been exciting progress in the understanding of the mechanism of action of steroid hormones. The structures and functions of the various receptor protein domains as well as the various domains of steroid-regulated genes, including steroid response elements, are currently being elucidated. The roles of transcription factors in the steroid-altered regulation of gene transcription are just being defined. The nature of the nuclear acceptor sites, i.e. nuclear-binding sites, for steroid receptors are under investigation. The composition, location, and function of these nuclear acceptor sites for steroid receptors is crucial for understanding the mechanism of steroid regulation of gene expression. Possible roles of specific, DNA-binding, chromatin proteins in these acceptor sites have been suggested. A very rapid action of steroids on the expression of proto-oncogenes that code for nuclear regulatory proteins has recently been described. Using this information, we have proposed a novel steroid action model utilizing \"regulatory genes\" whereby the steroids would rapidly alter the expression of regulatory genes (early genes) whose protein products would return to the nucleus to regulate the expression of structural genes (late genes). The latter would occur via binding of these regulatory proteins (e.g. transcription factors) to the steroid-regulatory elements neighboring these late genes. This model would explain many of the characteristics reported from many laboratories on the action of steroid hormones on gene expression.",

    "title": "Regulation of the Bacillus subtilis pyrimidine biosynthetic (pyr) gene cluster by an autogenous transcriptional attenuation mechanism.",
    "abstract": "A complete transcript of the Bacillus subtilis pyr operon contains the following elements in 5' to 3' order: a 151-nucleotide (nt) untranslated leader; pyrR, encoding a 20-kDa protein; a 173-nt intercistronic region; pyrP, encoding a 46-kDa protein; a 145-nt intercistronic region; and eight overlapping cistrons encoding all of the six enzymes for de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis. Transcription is controlled by the availability of pyrimidines via an attenuation mechanism. There are three transcription terminators within the operon, each of which is preceded by another stem-loop structure, the antiterminator, whose formation would prevent formation of the terminator stem-loop. These are located in the leader, the pyrR-pyrP intercistronic region, and the pyrP-pyrB intercistronic region. Northern (RNA) blot analysis has identified transcripts of lengths which coincide with termination at these proposed attenuation sites and whose relative abundances vary in the expected pyrimidine-dependent manner. Each antiterminator contains a 50-base conserved sequence in its promoter-proximal half. Various transcriptional fusions of the pyr promoter and surrounding sequences to promoterless reporter genes support an attenuation mechanism whereby when pyrimidines are abundant, the PyrR protein binds to the conserved sequence in the pyr mRNA and disrupts the antiterminator, permitting terminator hairpin formation and promoting transcription termination. Deletion of pyrR from the chromosome resulted in the constitutive, elevated expression of aspartate transcarbamylase, which is encoded by pyrB, the third gene in the operon. Complementation of an E. coli upp mutant, as well as direct enzymatic assay, has demonstrated that pyrR also confers uracil phosphoribosyltransferase activity. Analysis of pyrR and upp deletion mutants demonstrated that upp, not pyrR, encodes the quantitatively important uracil phosphoribosyltransferase activity. The pyrP gene probably encodes an integral membrane uracil permease.",

    "abstract": "It is well established that core binding factor Runx2/Cbfa1 is required for osteoblast recruitment and differentiation from mesenchymal stem cells. Transcriptional regulation of the Runx2/Cbfa1 gene by osteogenic factors such as bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) plays an important role in the stimulation of bone formation by these cytokines. BMP7 (also termed OP-1) is a member of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) superfamily and induces osteoblast differentiation from mesenchymal precursor stem cells in vitro as well as bone formation in vivo. This study examines the effects of BMP7 on markers of osteoblast differentiation and specifically on human Runx2/Cbfa1 gene transcription in a mouse C2C12 myoblast cell line where it induces expression of both alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and endogenous Runx2/Cbfa1. To further understand the mechanisms of human Runx2/Cbfa1 transcriptional regulation by BMP7, we cloned 3.0 kb of the human Runx2/Cbfa1 gene 5'-upstream flanking region and created a series of promoter deletions cloned into luciferase-based reporter vectors (Runx2/Cbfa1/Luc). Sequence data revealed six copies of the osteoblastic cis-acting element (OSE2) in the proximal promoter region. In C2C12 cells transiently transfected with Runx2/Cbfa1/Luc deletion constructs, transcriptional activity of Runx2/Cbfa1 was upregulated up to 2-fold after 24 h of BMP7 treatment. Mutational analysis demonstrated that the minimal responsive promoter region for BMP7-regulated transcription maps to a proximal -74 OSE2 site. Electromobility shift assays with C2C12 cellular extracts indicate that BMP7 increases binding of OSE2 promoter sequences, and supershift assays with anti-Runx2/Cbfa1 antibodies demonstrate that Runx2/Cbfa1 is part of the nucleoprotein complex binding OSE2. Together, these data indicate BMP7 can upregulate Runx2/Cbfa1 gene expression in C2C12 myoblast cells, and suggest that Runx2/Cbfa1 may bind to OSE2 elements within its own promoter to autoregulate gene transcription in differentiating osteoblasts.",

    "abstract": "Mechanisms through which gene expression is regulated by zinc are central to cellular zinc homoeostasis. In this context, evidence for the involvement of zinc dyshomoeostasis in the aetiology of diseases, including Type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer's disease and cancer, highlights the importance of zinc-regulated gene expression. Mechanisms elucidated in bacteria and yeast provide examples of different possible modes of zinc-sensitive gene regulation, involving the zinc-regulated binding of transcriptional activators and repressors to gene promoter regions. A mammalian transcriptional regulatory mechanism that mediates zinc-induced transcriptional up-regulation, involving the transcription factor MTF1 (metal-response element-binding transcription factor 1), has been studied extensively. Gene responses in the opposite direction (reduced mRNA levels in response to increased zinc availability) have been observed in mammalian cells, but a specific transcriptional regulatory process responsible for such a response has yet to be identified. Examples of single zinc-sensitive transcription factors regulating gene expression in opposite directions are emerging. Although zinc-induced transcriptional repression by MTF1 is a possible explanation in some specific instances, such a mechanism cannot account for repression by zinc of all mammalian genes that show this mode of regulation, indicating the existence of as yet uncharacterized mechanisms of zinc-regulated transcription in mammalian cells. In addition, recent findings reveal a role for effects of zinc on mRNA stability in the regulation of specific zinc transporters. Our studies on the regulation of the human gene SLC30A5 (solute carrier 30A5), which codes for the zinc transporter ZnT5, have revealed that this gene provides a model system by which to study both zinc-induced transcriptional down-regulation and zinc-regulated mRNA stabilization.",

Post-genomics sciences such as transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics are expected to discover gene functions. This report outlines the elucidation of gene-to-gene and metabolite-to-gene networks via integration of metabolomics with transcriptomics and presents a strategy for the identification of novel gene functions. Metabolomics and transcriptomics data of Arabidopsis grown under sulfur deficiency were combined and analyzed by batch-learning self-organizing mapping. A group of metabolites/genes regulated by the same mechanism clustered together. The metabolism of glucosinolates was shown to be coordinately regulated. Three uncharacterized putative sulfotransferase genes clustering together with known glucosinolate biosynthesis genes were candidates for involvement in biosynthesis. In vitro enzymatic assays of the recombinant gene products confirmed their functions as desulfoglucosinolate sulfotransferases. Several genes involved in sulfur assimilation clustered with O-acetylserine, which is considered a positive regulator of these genes. The genes involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis clustered with the gene encoding a transcriptional factor that up-regulates specifically anthocyanin biosynthesis genes. These results suggested that regulatory metabolites and transcriptional factor genes can be identified by this approach, based on the assumption that they cluster with the downstream genes they regulate. This strategy is applicable not only to plant but also to other organisms for functional elucidation of unknown genes.",

    "abstract": "Methanotrophic bacteria show significant promise for methane bioconversion. Despite their ecological and biotechnological importance, the understanding of their transcriptional regulation and genetic regulatory elements remains limited. Here, we applied high-throughput sequencing to elucidate the transcriptional regulatory landscape of Methylosinus sporium 5, a type II methanotroph. With its genome sequence completion, we identified 1,983 transcription start sites (TSSs) and 1,483 transcript 3'-ends (TEPs), which collectively defined 1,431 transcription units (TUs). This comprehensive analysis revealed diverse regulatory elements, including promoters, untranslated regions (UTRs), terminators, and regulatory RNAs in M. sporium 5. A consensus promoter motif comprizing conserved -10 (TATAHT) and -35 (TYGMSV) elements, recognized by the housekeeping sigma factor RpoD, was predominant, particularly upstream of genes involved in methane and central carbon metabolism. We also uncovered diverse cis-regulatory motifs associated with nitrogen metabolism and cell division, including binding sites for RpoN (sigma(54)) and the transcription regulator CtrA. TEP analysis identified three classes of transcript ends with distinct sequence features and termination strengths. I-shaped intrinsic terminators were most prevalent, while L-shaped terminators were enriched in highly expressed genes, ensuring efficient transcription termination. Integration of TSSs and TEPs revealed functionally related genes within polycistronic TUs and identified previously unannotated small RNAs, including EcpR1 and alphar45. This study provides the first genome-scale map of transcriptional regulation in a methanotroph, offering foundational insights into regulatory architecture and enabling future strain engineering for enhanced methane bioconversion.IMPORTANCEMethanotrophic bacteria offer a sustainable solution for converting methane into valuable products. However, the molecular mechanisms governing gene expression regulation in methanotrophs remain poorly understood. In this study, we applied high-throughput sequencing approaches to elucidate gene organization and transcriptional regulation in Methylosinus sporium 5 during growth on methane. By identifying key regulatory features including promoter sequences, diverse cis-regulatory elements, and transcript boundaries, we revealed the coordinated gene expression mechanisms in this organism. This represents the first genome-wide transcriptome architecture in a methanotrophic bacterium. The regulatory elements provide a valuable resource for future genetic engineering of M. sporium 5 and related methanotrophs. Our findings significantly advance the understanding of gene regulation in methanotrophs and support their development as microbial platforms for methane-based biomanufacturing.",

    "abstract": "The cDNA of a new human mesangium-predominant gene, megsin, a novel member of the serpin superfamily, has recently been cloned. This study investigates the regulatory mechanisms of megsin gene expression. A genomic clone of the human megsin gene was obtained by screening bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library with the megsin cDNA. The analysis for exon-intron junctions of megsin genomic DNA demonstrated that the gene contained 8 exons and 7 introns, spanned 20 kbp, and that the genomic structure of the serpin superfamily was highly conserved. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) revealed that the megsin gene is localized in chromosome 18q21.3, close to the other serpin genes. The transcriptional start site, located by primer extension analysis, was 391 bp upstream from the start codon. The sequence and reporter analyses on 4021-bp-long 5'-flanking region of megsin gene demonstrated a consensus promoter segment within this region and a relatively strong promoter activity in human mesangial cells and A431, a human tumor cell line recently reported to express a novel serpin identical with megsin. Moreover, this study utilized site-directed and deletion mutagenesis analyses, and electrophoretic mobility shift assay identified one positive regulatory motif, an incomplete activator protein-1 (AP-1) binding motif (CTGATTCAC) within the -120 to -112 region. This cis-acting element in the 5'-flanking region of megsin is involved in the activation of the megsin gene in mesangial cells.",

    "abstract": "Transcribed conserved non-coding elements (TCNEs), which are non-coding genomic elements that can regulate vital gene expression, play an unclear role in the development of severe diseases mainly associated with carcinogenesis. Currently, there are no mature tools for the identification of TCNEs. To compensate for the lack of a systematic interpretation of the functional characterization and regulatory mechanisms of TCNE spatiotemporal activities, we developed a flexible pipeline, called captureTCNE, to depict the landscape of TCNEs and applied it to our breast cancer cohort (SEU-BRCA). Meanwhile, we investigated the genome-wide characteristics of TCNEs and unraveled that TCNEs harbor enhancer-like chromatin signatures as well as participate in the transcriptional machinery to regulate essential genes or architect biological regulatory networks of breast cancer. Specifically, the TCNE transcripts could recruit RBPs, such as ENOX1 and PTBP1, which are involved in gene expression regulation, to participate in the formation of regulatory networks and the association with altered splicing patterns. In particular, the presence of a non-classical secondary structure, called RNA G-quadruplex, on TCNE transcripts contributed to the recruitment of RBPs associated with subtype-specific transcriptional processes related to the estrogen response in breast cancer. Ultimately, we also analyzed the mutational signatures of variant-containing TCNEs and discerned twenty-one genes as essential components of the regulatory mechanism of TCNEs in breast cancer. Our study provides an effective TCNE identification pipeline and insights into the regulatory mechanisms of TCNEs in breast cancer, contributing to further knowledge of TCNEs and the emergence of innovative therapeutic strategies for breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "Genetically controlled variation in alpha2beta1 expression by human blood platelets was previously described. Sixty-two haplotype sequences corresponding to the proximal 5' regulatory region (-1096 to +1) of the alpha2 gene were compared, and a dimorphic sequence -52C>T was identified that is located precisely between 2 tandem Sp1/Sp3 binding elements previously shown to be absolutely required for transcriptional activity of this gene in epithelial cell lines and the erythroleukemic cell line K562. The gene frequency of -52T in a random Caucasian population is approximately 0.35, and the expression of -52T correlates directly with reduced densities of platelet alpha2beta1. In mobility shift analyses, the -52T substitution attenuates complex formation with both Sp1 and Sp3. When transfected into the erythroleukemia cell line Dami, promoter-luciferase constructs bearing the -52T sequence exhibit a 5-fold decrease in activity relative to the -52C construct. In transfected CHRF-288-11 megakaryocytic cells, the corresponding activity decreases by 10-fold. The -52T sequence appears to be in linkage disequilibrium with the previously defined allele A3 (807C; HPA-5b), known to be associated with diminished expression of platelet alpha2beta1. In summary, a natural dimorphism has been identified within the proximal 5' regulatory region of the human integrin alpha2 gene that is responsible for decreased expression levels of the integrin alpha2beta1 on blood platelets through a mechanism that is probably mediated by the nuclear regulatory proteins Sp1 and Sp3.",

    "title": "Long-range control of gene expression: emerging mechanisms and disruption in disease.",
    "abstract": "Transcriptional control is a major mechanism for regulating gene expression. The complex machinery required to effect this control is still emerging from functional and evolutionary analysis of genomic architecture. In addition to the promoter, many other regulatory elements are required for spatiotemporally and quantitatively correct gene expression. Enhancer and repressor elements may reside in introns or up- and downstream of the transcription unit. For some genes with highly complex expression patterns--often those that function as key developmental control genes--the cis-regulatory domain can extend long distances outside the transcription unit. Some of the earliest hints of this came from disease-associated chromosomal breaks positioned well outside the relevant gene. With the availability of wide-ranging genome sequence comparisons, strong conservation of many noncoding regions became obvious. Functional studies have shown many of these conserved sites to be transcriptional regulatory elements that sometimes reside inside unrelated neighboring genes. Such sequence-conserved elements generally harbor sites for tissue-specific DNA-binding proteins. Developmentally variable chromatin conformation can control protein access to these sites and can regulate transcription. Disruption of these finely tuned mechanisms can cause disease. Some regulatory element mutations will be associated with phenotypes distinct from any identified for coding-region mutations.",

    "title": "Regulation of the NPT gene by a naturally occurring antisense transcript.",
    "abstract": "The epithelial Na/Pi cotransporter (NaPi-II) is instrumental in maintaining phosphate (Pi) homeostasis in vertebrates. Hormones and metabolic factors (PTH, Pi availability) that acutely influence renal Pi excretion have been demonstrated to target NaPi-II expression. Upon stimulation, newly synthesized transporter molecules become integrated into the brush-border membrane to increase the Vmax of Pi uptake; reduction of Pi reabsorption is achieved by endocytosis of NaPi-II followed by lysosomal degradation of the protein. The long-term regulation of the protein is less well studied. Only recently, regulatory elements for vitamin D3 and Pi have been identified in the promoter region of the npt gene. However, signaling pathways leading to the activation of these regulatory sequences need to be established. Other reports suggested messenger RNA stability to play a role in the medium range regulation of NaPi-II expression. Recent findings in our laboratory added to the complex picture of npt gene regulation. We have identified npt-related endogenous antisense transcripts from mouse, zebrafish, and winter flounder. The two fish transcripts have been cloned and characterized; the mouse homolog has only very recently been detected. The transcripts are devoid of an open reading frame and appear in different splice forms. The evolutionary conservation of bidirectional transcription of the npt gene implies a regulatory function for the antisense transcript. In order to test the functional consequences of bidirectional transcription, we coexpressed sense and the antisense transcripts from zebrafish in Xenopus oocytes. Pi transport activity was reduced as a result of the presence of antisense RNA. Re-extraction of the RNA from injected oocytes followed by Northern blot revealed that the coexpression had no significant effect on the stability of either transcript. We concluded that the antisense mRNA interfered with the translation of the transporter if coexpressed in the Xenopus system. However, the regulatory mechanism(s) involving the npt-related antisense transcript is expected to be much more complicated in vivo, (i.e., requiring supplementary factors like double-stranded RNA recognizing proteins or specific RNases). It is planned to test this hypothesis by a transgenic zebrafish approach and/or knockout mice.",

    "title": "A single regulatory gene integrates control of vitamin B12 synthesis and propanediol degradation.",
    "abstract": "The cob operon of Salmonella typhimurium encodes enzymes required for synthesis of adenosyl-cobalamin (vitamin B12). The pdu operon encodes enzymes needed for use of propanediol as a carbon source, including an adenosyl-cobalamin-dependent enzyme, propanediol dehydratase. These two operons both map near min 41 of the S. typhimurium linkage map and are transcribed divergently. Here we report that the cob and pdu operons form a single regulon. Transcription of this regulon is induced by either glycerol or propanediol. The metabolism of these compounds is not required for induction. Propanediol induces the regulon either aerobically or anaerobically during growth on poor carbon sources. Aerobically glycerol induces only if its metabolism is prevented by a mutational block such as a glpK mutation. Under anaerobic conditions, glycerol induces in both glpK+ and glpK mutant strains during growth on poor carbon sources. A new class of mutations, pocR, prevents induction of the cob/pdu regulon by either propanediol or glycerol and causes a Cob- Pdu- phenotype. The pocR gene is located between the cob and pdu operons and appears to encode a trans-acting protein that acts as a positive regulator of both operons. Transcription of the pocR regulatory gene is induced, even without the PocR protein, during aerobic growth on poor carbon sources and during anaerobic respiration. With the functional PocR protein, transcription of the pocR gene is autoinduced by propanediol but not by glycerol. The growth conditions that increase pocR gene expression correlate with growth conditions that allow high induction of the cob/pdu regulon. A model for control of this regulon suggests that the PocR protein is a transcriptional activator of both the cob and pdu operons and that both glycerol and propanediol can individually serve as effectors of the PocR protein. We suggest that global control mechanisms cause variation in the level of the PocR protein; an increased level of the PocR protein permits higher induction by propanediol or glycerol.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptional modules of coregulated genes play a key role in regulatory networks. Comparative studies show that modules of coexpressed genes are conserved across taxa. However, little is known about the mechanisms underlying the evolution of module regulation. Here, we explore the evolution of cis-regulatory programs associated with conserved modules by integrating expression profiles for two yeast species and sequence data for a total of 17 fungal genomes. We show that although the cis-elements accompanying certain conserved modules are strictly conserved, those of other conserved modules are remarkably diverged. In particular, we infer the evolutionary history of the regulatory program governing ribosomal modules. We show how a cis-element emerged concurrently in dozens of promoters of ribosomal protein genes, followed by the loss of a more ancient cis-element. We suggest that this formation of an intermediate redundant regulatory program allows conserved transcriptional modules to gradually switch from one regulatory mechanism to another while maintaining their functionality. Our work provides a general framework for the study of the dynamics of promoter evolution at the level of transcriptional modules and may help in understanding the evolvability and increased redundancy of transcriptional regulation in higher organisms.",

    "title": "Molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of gene expression during cell differentiation and development.",
    "abstract": "One general point to emerge from this review is that each step in the pathway for gene expression from DNA to final polypeptide via chromosome structure, primary transcript, mRNA processing, stability, and translation is exploited in some developmental context as a means of regulation. Moreover, there is little evidence that the regulation of different stages in this pathway is associated consistently with particular classes of genes or developmental processes: for example, homeotic and other regulatory genes, which are important in early development and in determining the overall structures of organisms, are regulated by both transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms, as are many other genes encoding cell-type-specific proteins expressed late during terminal differentiation. There are also instances in which transcription factors regulating tissue-specific transcription are present constitutively but are activated only in certain cell types by posttranslational events, and in yeast, coordinate regulation of amino-acid biosynthesis genes involves the translation control of a transcription factor. Second, as far as transcriptional control is concerned, it is now clear that in most instances cell-type specificity arises from the activities of multiple cis-control elements that can act either positively or negatively: The precise way in which the gene functions depends on what combination of cis-control elements it possesses. A third somewhat negative point is that in general the mechanisms responsible for the coordinate expression of genes during cell differentiation and development are not yet understood. In view of the complexities of possible mechanisms noted above, it may be that closely related genes (such as those encoding the alpha- and beta-globins, for example) in fact come to be coordinately expressed via a complex, indirect route. Indeed, it is quite possible that such mechanisms will not be revealed simply by a reductionist approach studying relatively short regions of DNA and that some form of overall \"systems analysis\" will be required. Finally, what we know relates mainly to expression of genes within particular cell types. How groups of cells are organized into complex structures remains a mystery at the molecular level, although progress into the genetic principles involved in the regulation of such \"compartments\" is being made, mainly in insects, reviewed recently by Brower, although to some extent also in the mouse [discussed by Hogan and co-workers].",

    "abstract": "Transcriptional control of carbon source preferences by Acinetobacter sp. strain ADP1 was assessed with a pobA::lacZ fusion during growth on alternative substrates. The pobA-encoded enzyme catalyzes the first step in the degradation of 4-hydroxybenzoate, a compound consumed rapidly as a sole carbon source. If additional aromatic carbon sources are available, 4-hydroxybenzoate consumption is inhibited by unknown mechanisms. As reported here, during growth on aromatic substrates, pobA was not expressed despite the presence of 4-hydroxybenzoate, an inducer that normally causes the PobR regulator to activate pobA transcription. Growth on organic acids such as succinate, fumarate, and acetate allowed higher levels of pobA expression. In each case, pobA expression increased at the end of the exponential growth phase. Complex transcriptional regulation controlled 4-hydroxybenzoate catabolism in multisubstrate environments. Additional studies focused on the wild-type preference for benzoate consumption prior to 4-hydroxybenzoate consumption. These compounds are degraded via the catechol and protocatechuate branches of the beta-ketoadipate pathway, respectively. Here, mutants were characterized that degraded benzoate and 4-hydroxybenzoate concurrently. These mutants lacked the BenM and CatM transcriptional regulators that normally activate genes for benzoate catabolism. A model is presented in which BenM and CatM prevent pobA expression indirectly during growth on benzoate. These regulators may affect pobA expression by lowering the PcaK-mediated uptake of 4-hydroxybenzoate. Consistent with this model, BenM and CatM bound in vitro to an operator-promoter fragment controlling the expression of several pca genes, including pcaK. These studies provide the first direct evidence of transcriptional cross-regulation between the distinct but analogous branches of the beta-ketoadipate pathway.",

    "abstract": "In plants, tolerance to drought stress is a result of numerous minor effect loci in which transcriptional regulation contributes significantly to the observed phenotypes. Under severe drought conditions, a major expression quantitative trait loci hotspot was identified on chromosome five in potato. A putative Nuclear factor y subunit C4 was identified as key candidate in the regulatory cascade in response to drought. Further investigation of the eQTL hotspots suggests a role for a putative Homeobox leucine zipper protein 12 in relation to drought in potato. Genes strongly co-expressed with Homeobox leucine zipper protein 12 were plant growth regulators responsive to water deficit stress in Arabidopsis thaliana, implying a possible conserved mechanism. Integrative analysis of genetic, genomic, phenotypic and transcriptomic data provided insights in the downstream functional components of the drought response. The abscisic acid- and environmental stress-inducible protein TAS14 was highly induced by severe drought in potato and acts as a reliable biomarker for the level of stress perceived by the plant. The systems genetics approach supported a role for multiple genes responsive to severe drought stress of Solanum tuberosum. The combination of gene regulatory networks, expression quantitative trait loci mapping and phenotypic analysis proved useful for candidate gene selection.",

    "abstract": "Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), which enzymatically depletes tryptophan, is an important antimicrobial defense mechanism against susceptible pathogens. In human epithelial cells, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-induced IDO expression is transcriptionally enhanced by tumor necrosis factor-alpha(TNF-alpha). The purpose of this study was to identify those regulatory mechanisms responsible for this synergistic transcriptional activation of IDO. Nuclear concentrations of signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 (Stat1) and IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), transcription factors that bind gamma-activated sequences (GAS) and IFN-stimulated response elements (ISRE), respectively, were found to increase after stimulation with IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha relative to stimulation with individual cytokines. Additionally, CCAAT enhancer binding protein-beta (C/EBP-beta) bound to one of three consensus C/EBP-beta sites in the IDO regulatory region in response to TNF-alpha alone or combined with IFN-gamma. A transcriptional reporter containing green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of the IDO regulatory region was used to analyze the contribution of these enhancer elements to synergistic IDO gene expression in response to IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha. Transcriptional activity following mutation of individual enhancers or large deletions within the regulatory region indicates that increased binding of IFN-gamma-transactivated factors to GAS and ISRE sites alone is responsible for synergistic transcriptional activation of the IDO gene.",

    "abstract": "The dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH) gene is expressed selectively in noradrenergic and adrenergic neurons and neuroendocrine cells in the nervous system. A cAMP response element (CRE) residing at -181 to -174 bp from the transcription start site of the human DBH gene seems to be essential for DBH transcription. Potential cis-regulatory motifs such as AP1 and YY1 occur proximal to and overlap this CRE, endowing the area with a composite promoter structure. Using the DBH-expressing human neuroblastoma SK-N-BE(2)C and DBH-negative HeLa cell lines as model systems, we report here that this CRE/YY1/AP1 area interacts with multiple nuclear proteins, including CRE-binding protein (CREB) and transcription factor YY1 in a cell-specific manner. In support of the notion that multiple proteins bind to the CRE/YY1/AP1 area, DNase I foot-printing analysis has demonstrated that nuclear extracts protect an extended region (from -186 to -150 bp) relative to that protected by the purified CREB (from -186 to -171 bp). Site-directed mutational analysis has revealed differential roles of potential cis-regulatory motifs in regulation of DBH transcription. Strikingly, the YY1 element positively regulated basal DBH transcription while simultaneously regulating cAMP-mediated induction negatively, which is a novel mechanism of promoter function. Furthermore, three additional DNA-binding sites have been identified by DNase I footprint analysis in the upstream 260 bp promotor region of the human DBH gene, of which two sites are cell-specific. These results support a model whereby multiple proteins bind to the 5'-proximal area in a cell-specific manner and coordinately regulate the cell type-specific transcriptional activation of the DBH gene.",

Extensive benchmarks show that ChromBPNet, despite its lightweight design, is competitive with much larger contemporary models at predicting variant effects on chromatin accessibility, pioneer TF binding and reporter activity across assays, cell contexts and ancestry, while providing interpretation of disrupted regulatory syntax. ChromBPNet also helps prioritize and interpret regulatory variants that influence complex traits and rare diseases, thereby providing a powerful lens to decode regulatory DNA and genetic variation.",

These highly connected genes adopted an active chromatin state in early differentiating cells, consistent with lineage commitment.

    "abstract": "Massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) test the capacity of putative gene regulatory elements to drive transcription on a genome-wide scale. Most gene regulatory activity occurs within accessible chromatin, and recently described methods have combined assays that capture these regions-such as assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq)-with self-transcribing active regulatory region sequencing (STARR-seq) to selectively assay the regulatory potential of accessible DNA (ATAC-STARR-seq). Here, we report an integrated approach that quantifies activating and silencing regulatory activity, chromatin accessibility, and transcription factor (TF) occupancy with one assay using ATAC-STARR-seq. Our strategy, including important updates to the ATAC-STARR-seq assay and workflow, enabled high-resolution testing of  approximately 50 million unique DNA fragments tiling  approximately 101,000 accessible chromatin regions in human lymphoblastoid cells. We discovered that 30% of all accessible regions contain an activator, a silencer, or both. Although few MPRA studies have explored silencing activity, we demonstrate that silencers occur at similar frequencies to activators, and they represent a distinct functional group enriched for unique TF motifs and repressive histone modifications. We further show that Tn5 cut-site frequencies are retained in the ATAC-STARR plasmid library compared to standard ATAC-seq, enabling TF occupancy to be ascertained from ATAC-STARR data. With this approach, we found that activators and silencers cluster by distinct TF footprint combinations, and these groups of activity represent different gene regulatory networks of immune cell function. Altogether, these data highlight the multilayered capabilities of ATAC-STARR-seq to comprehensively investigate the regulatory landscape of the human genome all from a single DNA fragment source.",

During lineage commitment, chromatin accessibility at DORCs precedes gene expression, suggesting that changes in chromatin accessibility may prime cells for lineage commitment.

Here we reveal the landscape and principles of mammalian DNA regulatory variation by developing a robust method for mapping the accessible genome of individual cells by assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) integrated into a programmable microfluidics platform. Single-cell ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq) maps from hundreds of single cells in aggregate closely resemble accessibility profiles from tens of millions of cells and provide insights into cell-to-cell variation. Accessibility variance is systematically associated with specific trans-factors and cis-elements, and we discover combinations of trans-factors associated with either induction or suppression of cell-to-cell variability. We further identify sets of trans-factors associated with cell-type-specific accessibility variance across eight cell types. Targeted perturbations of cell cycle or transcription factor signalling evoke stimulus-specific changes in this observed variability. The pattern of accessibility variation in cis across the genome recapitulates chromosome compartments de novo, linking single-cell accessibility variation to three-dimensional genome organization. Single-cell analysis of DNA accessibility provides new insight into cellular variation of the 'regulome'.",

We further show that many germ-layer-specific cis-elements and TFs in E7.5 embryos are maintained in the cell types derived from the corresponding germ layers at later stages, suggesting that these cis-elements and TFs are important during cell differentiation. We also find a potential progenitor for Sertoli and granulosa cells in gonads. Interestingly, both Sertoli and granulosa cells exist in male gonads and female gonads during gonad development. Collectively, we provide a valuable resource to understand organogenesis in mammals.",

    "abstract": "Successful pregnancy relies directly on the placenta's complex, dynamic, gene-regulatory networks. Disruption of this vast collection of intercellular and intracellular programs leads to pregnancy complications and developmental defects. In the present study, we generated a comprehensive, spatially resolved, multimodal cell census elucidating the molecular architecture of the first trimester human placenta. We utilized paired single-nucleus (sn)ATAC (assay for transposase accessible chromatin) sequencing and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), spatial snATAC-seq and RNA-seq, and in situ sequencing and hybridization mapping of transcriptomes at molecular resolution to spatially reconstruct the joint epigenomic and transcriptomic regulatory landscape. Paired analyses unraveled intricate tumor-like gene expression and transcription factor motif programs potentially sustaining the placenta in a hostile uterine environment; further investigation of gene-linked cis-regulatory elements revealed heightened regulatory complexity that may govern trophoblast differentiation and placental disease risk. Complementary spatial mapping techniques decoded these programs within the placental villous core and extravillous trophoblast cell column architecture while simultaneously revealing niche-establishing transcriptional elements and cell-cell communication. Finally, we computationally imputed genome-wide, multiomic single-cell profiles and spatially characterized the placental chromatin accessibility landscape. This spatially resolved, single-cell multiomic framework of the first trimester human placenta serves as a blueprint for future studies on early placental development and pregnancy.",

    "abstract": "Linking regulatory DNA elements to their target genes, which may be located hundreds of kilobases away, remains challenging. Here, we introduce Cicero, an algorithm that identifies co-accessible pairs of DNA elements using single-cell chromatin accessibility data and so connects regulatory elements to their putative target genes. We apply Cicero to investigate how dynamically accessible elements orchestrate gene regulation in differentiating myoblasts. Groups of Cicero-linked regulatory elements meet criteria of \"chromatin hubs\"-they are enriched for physical proximity, interact with a common set of transcription factors, and undergo coordinated changes in histone marks that are predictive of changes in gene expression. Pseudotemporal analysis revealed that most DNA elements remain in chromatin hubs throughout differentiation. A subset of elements bound by MYOD1 in myoblasts exhibit early opening in a PBX1- and MEIS1-dependent manner. Our strategy can be applied to dissect the architecture, sequence determinants, and mechanisms of cis-regulation on a genome-wide scale.",

    "abstract": "Cellular senescence is a complex multifactorial biological phenomenon that plays essential roles in aging, and aging-related diseases. During this process, the senescent cells undergo gene expression altering and chromatin structure remodeling. However, studies on the epigenetic landscape of senescence using integrated multi-omics approaches are limited. In this research, we performed ATAC-seq, RNA-seq and ChIP-seq on different senescent types to reveal the landscape of senescence and identify the prime regulatory elements. We also obtained 34 key genes and deduced that NAT1, PBX1 and RRM2, which interacted with each other, could be the potential markers of aging and aging-related diseases. In summary, our work provides the landscape to study accessibility dynamics and transcriptional regulations in cellular senescence. The application of this technique in different types of senescence allows us to identify the regulatory elements responsible for the substantial regulation of transcription, providing the insights into molecular mechanisms of senescence.",

    "abstract": "Nucleosome-free open chromatin often harbors transcription factor (TF)-binding sites that are associated with active cis-regulatory elements. However, analysis of open chromatin regions has rarely been applied to oomycete or fungal plant pathogens. In this study, we performed the assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) to identify open chromatin and cis-regulatory elements in Phytophthora sojae at the mycelial stage. We identified 10,389 peaks representing nucleosome-free regions (NFRs). The peaks were enriched in gene-promoter regions and associated with 40% of P. sojae genes; transcription levels were higher for genes with multiple peaks than genes with a single peak and were higher for genes with a single peak than genes without peak. Chromatin accessibility was positively correlated with gene transcription level. Through motif discovery based on NFR peaks in core promoter regions, 25 candidate cis-regulatory motifs with evidence of TF-binding footprints were identified. These motifs exhibited various preferences for location in the promoter region and associations with the transcription level of their target genes, which included some putative pathogenicity-related genes. As the first study revealing the landscape of open chromatin and the correlation between chromatin accessibility and gene transcription level in oomycetes, the results provide a technical reference and data resources for future studies on the regulatory mechanisms of gene transcription.[Formula: see text] Copyright (c) 2022 The Author(s).

In basal cell carcinoma, application of scATAC-seq reveals regulatory networks in malignant, stromal and immune cells in the tumor microenvironment. Analysis of scATAC-seq profiles from serial tumor biopsies before and after programmed cell death protein 1 blockade identifies chromatin regulators of therapy-responsive T cell subsets and reveals a shared regulatory program that governs intratumoral CD8(+) T cell exhaustion and CD4(+) T follicular helper cell development.

Further, we interpreted sequence based deep learning models of cell-type-resolved chromatin accessibility profiles to decipher underlying TF motif lexicons. De novo mutations predicted to affect chromatin accessibility in arterial endothelium were enriched in congenital heart disease (CHD) cases vs. controls.

Here we report a genome-wide map of accessible chromatin in mouse preimplantation embryos using an improved assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) approach with CRISPR/Cas9-assisted mitochondrial DNA depletion. We show that despite extensive parental asymmetry in DNA methylomes, the chromatin accessibility between the parental genomes is globally comparable after major zygotic genome activation (ZGA). Accessible chromatin in early embryos is widely shaped by transposable elements and overlaps extensively with putative cis-regulatory sequences. Unexpectedly, accessible chromatin is also found near the transcription end sites of active genes. By integrating the maps of cis-regulatory elements and single-cell transcriptomes, we construct the regulatory network of early development, which helps to identify the key modulators for lineage specification. Finally, we find that the activities of cis-regulatory elements and their associated open chromatin diminished before major ZGA. Surprisingly, we observed many loci showing non-canonical, large open chromatin domains over the entire transcribed units in minor ZGA, supporting the presence of an unusually permissive chromatin state. Together, these data reveal a unique spatiotemporal chromatin configuration that accompanies early mammalian development.",

Analysis of such data can be utilised to identify functional cis-regulatory elements (CRE) and transcription factor binding sites and, when combined with transcriptomics, can reveal gene regulatory networks (GRNs) of expressed genes. Chromatin accessibility mapping is a powerful approach and can be performed using ATAC-sequencing (ATAC-seq), whereby Tn5 transposase inserts sequencing adaptors into genomic DNA to identify differentially accessible regions of chromatin in different cell populations. It requires low sample input and can be performed and analysed relatively quickly compared with other methods. The data generated from ATAC-seq, along with other genomic approaches, can help uncover chromatin packaging and potential cis-regulatory elements that may be responsible for gene expression.

Here we investigate chromatin states in human preimplantation development using an improved assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) (2) . We find widespread accessible chromatin regions in early human embryos that overlap extensively with putative cis-regulatory sequences and transposable elements. Integrative analyses show both conservation and divergence in regulatory circuitry between human and mouse early development, and between human pluripotency in vivo and human embryonic stem cells. In addition, we find widespread open chromatin regions before zygotic genome activation (ZGA). The accessible chromatin loci are readily found at CpG-rich promoters. Unexpectedly, many others reside in distal regions that overlap with DNA hypomethylated domains in human oocytes and are enriched for transcription factor-binding sites. A large portion of these regions then become inaccessible after ZGA in a transcription-dependent manner. Notably, such extensive chromatin reorganization during ZGA is conserved in mice and correlates with the reprogramming of the non-canonical histone mark H3K4me3, which is uniquely linked to genome silencing(3-5). Taken together, these data not only reveal a conserved principle that underlies the chromatin transition during mammalian ZGA, but also help to advance our understanding of epigenetic reprogramming during human early development and in vitro fertilization.",

By coupling rapid protein degradation with the analysis of nascent transcription over short time courses and integrating CUT&RUN, ATAC-seq, and eRNA analysis with deep proteomic analysis, we defined PAX3-FOXO1 function at a small network of direct transcriptional targets. PAX3-FOXO1 degradation impaired RNA polymerase pause release and transcription elongation at most regulated gene targets. Moreover, the activity of PAX3-FOXO1 at enhancers controlling this core network was surprisingly selective, affecting single elements in super-enhancers. This combinatorial analysis indicated that PAX3-FOXO1 was continuously required to maintain chromatin accessibility and enhancer architecture at regulated enhancers.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Spatiotemporal changes in the chromatin accessibility landscape are essential to cell differentiation, development, health, and disease. The quest of identifying regulatory elements in open chromatin regions across different tissues and developmental stages is led by large international collaborative efforts mostly focusing on model organisms, such as ENCODE. Recently, the Functional Annotation of Animal Genomes (FAANG) has been established to unravel the regulatory elements in non-model organisms, including cattle. Now, we can transition from prediction to validation by experimentally identifying the regulatory elements in tropical indicine cattle. The identification of regulatory elements, their annotation and comparison with the taurine counterpart, holds high promise to link regulatory regions to adaptability traits and improve animal productivity and welfare. RESULTS: We generate open chromatin profiles for liver, muscle, and hypothalamus of indicine cattle through ATAC-seq. Using robust methods for motif discovery, motif enrichment and transcription factor binding sites, we identify potential master regulators of the epigenomic profile in these three tissues, namely HNF4, MEF2, and SOX factors, respectively. Integration with transcriptomic data allows us to confirm some of their target genes. Finally, by comparing our results with Bos taurus data we identify potential indicine-specific open chromatin regions and overlaps with indicine selective sweeps. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide insights into the identification and analysis of regulatory elements in non-model organisms, the evolution of regulatory elements within two cattle subspecies as well as having an immediate impact on the animal genetics community in particular for a relevant productive species such as tropical cattle.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Transcriptional reconfiguration is central to heart failure, the most common cause of which is dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). The effect of 3-dimensional chromatin topology on transcriptional dysregulation and pathogenesis in human DCM remains elusive. METHODS: We generated a compendium of 3-dimensional epigenome and transcriptome maps from 101 biobanked human DCM and nonfailing heart tissues through highly integrative chromatin immunoprecipitation (H3K27ac [acetylation of lysine 27 on histone H3]), in situ high-throughput chromosome conformation capture, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing, and RNA sequencing. We used human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes and mouse models to interrogate the key transcription factor implicated in 3-dimensional chromatin organization and transcriptional regulation in DCM pathogenesis. RESULTS: We discovered that the active regulatory elements (H3K27ac peaks) and their connectome (H3K27ac loops) were extensively reprogrammed in DCM hearts and contributed to transcriptional dysregulation implicated in DCM development. For example, we identified that nontranscribing NPPA-AS1 (natriuretic peptide A antisense RNA 1) promoter functions as an enhancer and physically interacts with the NPPA (natriuretic peptide A) and NPPB (natriuretic peptide B) promoters, leading to the cotranscription of NPPA and NPPB in DCM hearts. We revealed that DCM-enriched H3K27ac loops largely resided in conserved high-order chromatin architectures (compartments, topologically associating domains) and their anchors unexpectedly had equivalent chromatin accessibility. We discovered that the DCM-enriched H3K27ac loop anchors exhibited a strong enrichment for HAND1 (heart and neural crest derivatives expressed 1), a key transcription factor involved in early cardiogenesis. In line with this, its protein expression was upregulated in human DCM and mouse failing hearts. To further validate whether HAND1 is a causal driver for the reprogramming of enhancer-promoter connectome in DCM hearts, we performed comprehensive 3-dimensional epigenome mappings in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes. We found that forced overexpression of HAND1 in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes induced a distinct gain of enhancer-promoter connectivity and correspondingly increased the expression of their connected genes implicated in DCM pathogenesis, thus recapitulating the transcriptional signature in human DCM hearts. Electrophysiology analysis demonstrated that forced overexpression of HAND1 in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes induced abnormal calcium handling. Furthermore, cardiomyocyte-specific overexpression of Hand1 in the mouse hearts resulted in dilated cardiac remodeling with impaired contractility/Ca(2+) handling in cardiomyocytes, increased ratio of heart weight/body weight, and compromised cardiac function, which were ascribed to recapitulation of transcriptional reprogramming in DCM. CONCLUSIONS: This study provided novel chromatin topology insights into DCM pathogenesis and illustrated a model whereby a single transcription factor (HAND1) reprograms the genome-wide enhancer-promoter connectome to drive DCM pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Cis-regulatory elements (CREs) and transcription factors (TFs) associated with them determine temporal and spatial domains of gene expression. Therefore, identification of these CREs and TFs is crucial to elucidating transcriptional programs across taxa. With chromatin accessibility facilitating transcription factor access to DNA, the identification of regions of open chromatin sheds light both on the function of the regulatory elements and their evolution, thus allowing the recognition of potential CREs. Buenrostro and colleagues have developed a novel method for exploring chromatin accessibility: assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq), which can be used for the purpose of identifying putative CREs. This method was shown to have considerable advantages when compared to traditional methods such as sequence conservation analyses or functional assays. Here we present the adaptation of the ATAC-seq method to echinoderm species and discuss how it can be used for CRE discovery.",

By integrating scATAC censuses of humans, monkeys, and mice, we systematically identified 152 distinct main cell types and around 0.8 million cell-type-specific cCREs. Our analysis provided insights into the conservation of neural, muscle, and immune lineages across species, while epithelial cells exhibited a higher organ-origin heterogeneity. Additionally, a large-scale gene regulatory network (GRN) was constructed in four vertebrates by integrating scRNA-seq censuses. Overall, our study provides a valuable resource for comparative epigenomics, identifying the evolutionary conservation and divergence of gene regulation across different species.",

    "abstract": "Renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs) can initiate an adaptive response to completely recover from mild acute kidney injury (AKI), whereas severe injury often leads to persistence of maladaptive repair and progression to kidney fibrosis. Through profiling of active DNA regulatory elements by ATAC-seq, we reveal widespread, dynamic changes in the chromatin accessibility of TECs after ischemia-reperfusion injury. We show that injury-specific domains of regulatory chromatin become accessible prior to gene activation, creating poised chromatin states to activate the consequent gene expression program and injury response. We further identify RXRalpha as a key transcription factor in promoting adaptive repair. Activation of RXRalpha by bexarotene, an FDA-approved RXRalpha agonist, restores the chromatin state and gene expression program to protect TECs against severe kidney injury. Together, our findings elucidate a chromatin-mediated mechanism underlying differential responses of TECs to varying injuries and identify RXRalpha as a therapeutic target of acute kidney injury.",

Herein, we perform a combined analysis of ATAC-Seq and RNA-Seq in cold-sensitive cultivated tomato and cold-tolerant wild tomato (S. habrochaites). We identify that WRKY34 has the most significant association with differential chromatin accessibility and expression patterns under cold stress. We find that a 60 bp InDel in the WRKY34 promoter causes differences in its transcription and cold tolerance among 376 tomato accessions. This 60 bp fragment contains a GATA cis-regulatory element that binds to SWIBs and GATA29, which synergistically suppress WRKY34 expression under cold stress. Moreover, WRKY34 interferes with the CBF cold response pathway through regulating transcription and protein levels. Our findings emphasize the importance of polymorphisms in cis-regulatory regions and their effects on chromatin structure and gene expression during crop evolution.",

However, methods for measuring the organization of effector proteins at CREs across the genome are limited, hampering efforts to connect CRE structure to their function in cell fate and disease. Here we developed PRINT, a computational method that identifies footprints of DNA-protein interactions from bulk and single-cell chromatin accessibility data across multiple scales of protein size. Using these multiscale footprints, we created the seq2PRINT framework, which uses deep learning to allow precise inference of transcription factor and nucleosome binding and interprets regulatory logic at CREs. Applying seq2PRINT to single-cell chromatin accessibility data from human bone marrow, we observe sequential establishment and widening of CREs centred on pioneer factors across haematopoiesis. We further discover age-associated alterations in the structure of CREs in murine haematopoietic stem cells, including widespread reduction of nucleosome footprints and gain of de novo identified Ets composite motifs. Collectively, we establish a method for obtaining rich insights into DNA-binding protein dynamics from chromatin accessibility data, and reveal the architecture of regulatory elements across differentiation and ageing.",

We further develop a variant interpretation methodology (vPECA) to identify active selected REs (ASREs) and associated regulatory network. We discover three causal SNPs of EPAS1, the key adaptive gene for Tibetans. These SNPs decrease the accessibility of ASREs with weakened binding strength of relevant TFs, and cooperatively down-regulate EPAS1 expression. We further construct the downstream network of EPAS1, elucidating its roles in hypoxic response and angiogenesis.

    "abstract": "Cis-regulatory elements (CREs) are non-coding DNA regions involved in the spatio-temporal regulation of gene expression. Gene regulatory changes drive animal development and play major roles during evolution of animal body plans. Therefore, we believe that determining CREs at different developmental stages and across animal lineages is critical to understand how evolution operates through development. The Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin followed by high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) is a powerful technique for the study of CREs that takes advantage of Tn5 transposase activity. Starting from fewer than 10(5) cells, in a 1-day procedure, it is possible to detect, at a genome-wide level, CREs located in open chromatin regions with high resolution. Here, we describe a detailed step-by-step ATAC-seq protocol for invertebrate chordate marine embryos. We have successfully applied this technique to amphioxus and two species of tunicate embryos. We also show an easy workflow to analyze data generated with this technique. Moreover, we point out that this method and our bioinformatic pipeline are efficient to detect CREs associated with Wnt signaling pathway by simply using embryos treated with a drug that perturbs this pathway. This approach can be extended to other signaling pathways and also to embryo mutants for critical genes. Our results therefore demonstrate the power of ATAC-seq for the identification of CREs that play essential functions during animal development in a wide range of invertebrate or vertebrate animals.",

The present review will explore epigenomic profiling and bioinformatics techniques for the study of kidney development and disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Reversible DNA and histone modifications influence chromatin accessibility and can be measured by a variety of recent techniques including DNase-seq, ATAC-seq, and single cell ATAC-seq. These approaches have been used to demonstrate that DNA methylation is critical for nephron progenitor maturation, for example. New bioinformatics techniques allow the prediction of chromatin loops that connect regulatory elements to target genes. Recent studies have demonstrated that DNA elements regulate transcription in the kidney via long-range physical interactions and create a new framework for understanding how genome wide association studies risk loci contribute to kidney disease. Increasingly, epigenomic approaches are being combined with transcriptomic analyses to generate multimodal datasets. SUMMARY: Epigenomics has expanded our knowledge of gene architecture and regulation. Novel tools and techniques have led to the emergence of 'multiomics' in which epigenomic profiling, transcriptomics, and additional methods complement each other to improve our understanding of kidney disease and development.",

A comparison of zebrafish, human and mouse regulatory elements enabled the identification of both evolutionarily conserved and species-specific regulatory sequences and networks. We observed enrichment of evolutionary breakpoints at topologically associating domain boundaries, which were correlated with strong histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) and CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) signals. We performed single-cell ATAC-seq in zebrafish brain, which delineated 25 different clusters of cell types.

We regroup these regulatory elements in 16 components by nonnegative matrix factorization. Correlation between the genome-wide density of peaks and transcription start sites, correlation between peak accessibility and expression of neighboring genes, and enrichment in transcription factor binding motifs support their regulatory potential. Using a previously established catalog of 12,736,643 variants, we show that the proportion of single-nucleotide polymorphisms mapping to ATAC-seq peaks is higher than expected and that this is owing to an approximately 1.3-fold higher mutation rate within peaks. Their site frequency spectrum indicates that variants in ATAC-seq peaks are subject to purifying selection. We generate eQTL data sets for liver and blood and show that variants that drive eQTL fall into liver- and blood-specific ATAC-seq peaks more often than expected by chance. We combine ATAC-seq and eQTL data to estimate that the proportion of regulatory variants mapping to ATAC-seq peaks is approximately one in three and that the proportion of variants mapping to ATAC-seq peaks that are regulatory is approximately one in 25. We discuss the implication of these findings on the utility of ATAC-seq information to improve the accuracy of genomic selection.",

    "abstract": "Eukaryotic gene regulation is a combinatorial, dynamic, and quantitative process that plays a vital role in development and disease and can be modeled at a systems level in gene regulatory networks (GRNs). The wealth of multi-omics data measured on the same samples and even on the same cells has lifted the field of GRN inference to the next stage. Combinations of (single-cell) transcriptomics and chromatin accessibility allow the prediction of fine-grained regulatory programs that go beyond mere correlation of transcription factor and target gene expression, with enhancer GRNs (eGRNs) modeling molecular interactions between transcription factors, regulatory elements, and target genes. In this review, we highlight the key components for successful (e)GRN inference from (sc)RNA-seq and (sc)ATAC-seq data exemplified by state-of-the-art methods as well as open challenges and future developments. Moreover, we address preprocessing strategies, metacell generation and computational omics pairing, transcription factor binding site detection, and linear and three-dimensional approaches to identify chromatin interactions as well as dynamic and causal eGRN inference. We believe that the integration of transcriptomics together with epigenomics data at a single-cell level is the new standard for mechanistic network inference, and that it can be further advanced with integrating additional omics layers and spatiotemporal data, as well as with shifting the focus towards more quantitative and causal modeling strategies.",

In this study, we develop Kethoxal-Assisted Single-stranded DNA Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin with Sequencing (KAS-ATAC-seq) to quantitatively analyze the transcriptional activity of CREs. A main advantage of KAS-ATAC-seq lies in its precise measurement of ssDNA levels within both proximal and distal ATAC-seq peaks, enabling the identification of transcriptional regulatory sequences. This feature is particularly adept at defining Single-Stranded Transcribing Enhancers (SSTEs). SSTEs are highly enriched with nascent RNAs and specific transcription factors (TFs) binding sites that define cellular identity. Moreover, KAS-ATAC-seq provides a detailed characterization and functional implications of various SSTE subtypes. Our analysis of CREs during mouse neural differentiation demonstrates that KAS-ATAC-seq can effectively identify immediate-early activated CREs in response to retinoic acid (RA) treatment. Our findings indicate that KAS-ATAC-seq provides more precise annotation of functional CREs in transcription. Future applications of KAS-ATAC-seq would help elucidate the intricate dynamics of gene regulation in diverse biological processes.",

    "abstract": "A hallmark feature of active cis-regulatory elements (CREs) in eukaryotes is their nucleosomal depletion and, accordingly, higher accessibility to enzymatic treatment. This property has been the basis of a number of sequencing-based assays for genome-wide identification and tracking the activity of CREs across different biological conditions, such as DNAse-seq, ATAC-seq , NOMeseq, and others. However, the fragmentation of DNA inherent to many of these assays and the limited read length of short-read sequencing platforms have so far not allowed the simultaneous measurement of the chromatin accessibility state of CREs located distally from each other. The combination of labeling accessible DNA with DNA modifications and nanopore sequencing has made it possible to develop such assays. Here, we provide a detailed protocol for carrying out the SMAC-seq assay (Single-Molecule long-read Accessible Chromatin mapping sequencing), in its m6A-SMAC-seq and m6A-CpG-GpC-SMAC-seq variants, together with methods for data processing and analysis, and discuss key experimental and analytical considerations for working with SMAC-seq datasets.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chromatin accessibility plays a crucial role in mediating transcriptional dysregulation and heterogeneity in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma (ESCC). Examining the chromatin accessibility of ESCC at single-cell level is imperative to understand how it activates oncogenes and contributes to the onset and metastasis of ESCC. METHODS: We performed single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (scATAC-seq) on cancerous and adjacent noncancerous tissues from four ESCC patients who were pathological staged as T1a, T2b, T3b, or T4a, to investigate whether regulatory elements are pivotal in instigating cellular heterogeneity during ESCC metastasis. In conjunction, we integrated these data with 55 scRNA-seq datasets, ChIP-seq or CUT&Tag sequencing data, Hi-C sequencing data, bulk RNA-seq data, and bulk ATAC-seq data from ESCC cell lines to dissect the mechanisms underlying the heterogeneity of ESCC and tumor microenvironment (TME). RESULTS: Our study identified enhancer-specific activation within epithelial cells orchestrated by the three-dimensional structure of chromatin that regulates SERPINH1 transcription, and promotes the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis of ESCC. Additionally, chromatin element activation facilitated the expression of TNFSF4 in CD8 + exhausted T cells, thereby activating Tregs. Furthermore, we observed that chromatin accessibility promoted the differentiation of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs). CONCLUSIONS: In summary, utilizing multiomics analyses, we have revealed chromatin accessibility maps and illuminated the intricate molecular mechanisms that underlie cellular heterogeneity during ESCC metastasis, offering valuable insights to further advance research on tumor progression and deterioration.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Inflammation resolution and cardiac repair initiation after myocardial infarction (MI) require timely activation of reparative signals. Histone lactylation confers macrophage homeostatic gene expression signatures via transcriptional regulation. However, the role of histone lactylation in the repair response post-MI remains unclear. We aimed to investigate whether histone lactylation induces reparative gene expression in monocytes early and remotely post-MI. METHODS: Single-cell transcriptome data indicated that reparative genes were activated early and remotely in bone marrow and circulating monocytes before cardiac recruitment. Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining revealed increases in histone lactylation levels, including the previously identified histone H3K18 lactylation in monocyte-macrophages early post-MI. Through joint CUT&Tag and RNA-sequencing analyses, we identified Lrg1, Vegf-a, and IL-10 as histone H3K18 lactylation target genes. The increased modification and expression levels of these target genes post-MI were verified by chromatin immunoprecipitation-qPCR and reverse transcription-qPCR. RESULTS: We demonstrated that histone lactylation regulates the anti-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic dual activities of monocyte-macrophages by facilitating reparative gene transcription and confirmed that histone lactylation favors a reparative environment and improves cardiac function post-MI. Furthermore, we explored the potential positive role of monocyte histone lactylation in reperfused MI. Mechanistically, we provided new evidence that monocytes undergo metabolic reprogramming in the early stage of MI and demonstrated that dysregulated glycolysis and MCT1 (monocarboxylate transporter 1)-mediated lactate transport promote histone lactylation. Finally, we revealed the catalytic effect of IL (interleukin)-1beta-dependent GCN5 (general control non-depressible 5) recruitment on histone H3K18 lactylation and elucidated its potential role as an upstream regulatory element in the regulation of monocyte histone lactylation and downstream reparative gene expression post-MI. CONCLUSIONS: Histone lactylation promotes early remote activation of the reparative transcriptional response in monocytes, which is essential for the establishment of immune homeostasis and timely activation of the cardiac repair process post-MI.",

We apply an integrated epigenomic approach to characterize the molecular events involved in LPS-induced tolerance in a time-dependent manner. Mechanistically, LPS-treated monocytes fail to accumulate active histone marks at promoter and enhancers of genes in the lipid metabolism and phagocytic pathways. Transcriptional inactivity in response to a second LPS exposure in tolerized macrophages is accompanied by failure to deposit active histone marks at promoters of tolerized genes. In contrast, beta-glucan partially reverses the LPS-induced tolerance in vitro. Importantly, ex vivo beta-glucan treatment of monocytes from volunteers with experimental endotoxemia re-instates their capacity for cytokine production. Tolerance is reversed at the level of distal element histone modification and transcriptional reactivation of otherwise unresponsive genes. VIDEO ABSTRACT.",

During the development of the pre-implantation embryo, precise reprogramming progress is a prerequisite for avoiding developmental defects or embryonic lethality, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. For the past few years, unprecedented breakthroughs have been made in mapping the regulatory network of dynamic epigenomes during mammalian early embryo development, taking advantage of multiple advances and innovations in low-input genome-wide chromatin analysis technologies. The aim of this review is to highlight the most recent progress in understanding the mechanisms of epigenetic remodeling during early embryogenesis in mammals, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, chromatin accessibility and 3D chromatin organization.",

    "abstract": "Substantial epigenetic resetting during early embryo development from fertilization to blastocyst formation ensures zygotic genome activation and leads to progressive cellular heterogeneities(1-3). Mapping single-cell epigenomic profiles of core histone modifications that cover each individual cell is a fundamental goal in developmental biology. Here we develop target chromatin indexing and tagmentation (TACIT), a method that enabled genome-coverage single-cell profiling of seven histone modifications across mouse early embryos. We integrated these single-cell histone modifications with single-cell RNA sequencing data to chart a single-cell resolution epigenetic landscape. Multimodal chromatin-state annotations showed that the onset of zygotic genome activation at the early two-cell stage already primes heterogeneities in totipotency. We used machine learning to identify totipotency gene regulatory networks, including stage-specific transposable elements and putative transcription factors. CRISPR activation of a combination of these identified transcription factors induced totipotency activation in mouse embryonic stem cells. Together with single-cell co-profiles of multiple histone modifications, we developed a model that predicts the earliest cell branching towards the inner cell mass and the trophectoderm in latent multimodal space and identifies regulatory elements and previously unknown lineage-specifying transcription factors. Our work provides insights into single-cell epigenetic reprogramming, multimodal regulation of cellular lineages and cell-fate priming during mouse pre-implantation development.",

    "abstract": "The most highly conserved noncoding elements (HCNEs) in mammalian genomes cluster within regions enriched for genes encoding developmentally important transcription factors (TFs). This suggests that HCNE-rich regions may contain key regulatory controls involved in development. We explored this by examining histone methylation in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells across 56 large HCNE-rich loci. We identified a specific modification pattern, termed \"bivalent domains,\" consisting of large regions of H3 lysine 27 methylation harboring smaller regions of H3 lysine 4 methylation. Bivalent domains tend to coincide with TF genes expressed at low levels. We propose that bivalent domains silence developmental genes in ES cells while keeping them poised for activation. We also found striking correspondences between genome sequence and histone methylation in ES cells, which become notably weaker in differentiated cells. These results highlight the importance of DNA sequence in defining the initial epigenetic landscape and suggest a novel chromatin-based mechanism for maintaining pluripotency.",

To better understand the function of these modifications, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing to map the genome-wide location of four short-chain acyl histone marks, H3K18pr, H3K18bu, H4K12pr and H4K12bu, in treated and untreated colorectal cancer (CRC) and normal cells as well as in mouse intestines in vivo. We correlate these marks with open chromatin regions and gene expression to access the function of the target regions. Our data demonstrate that propionate and butyrate bind and act as promoters of genes involved in growth, differentiation and ion transport. We propose a mechanism involving direct modification of specific genomic regions by SCFAs resulting in increased chromatin accessibility and, in the case of butyrate, opposing effects on the proliferation of normal versus CRC cells.",

Here we interrogate the epigenetic landscape of enhancer elements in embryonic stem cells and several adult tissues in the mouse. We find that histone H3K27ac distinguishes active enhancers from inactive/poised enhancer elements containing H3K4me1 alone.

    "abstract": "Post-translational modifications (PTMs) on histones are a key source of regulation on chromatin through impacting cellular processes, including gene expression(1). These PTMs often arise from metabolites and are thus impacted by metabolism and environmental cues(2-7). One class of metabolically regulated PTMs are histone acylations, which include histone acetylation, butyrylation, crotonylation and propionylation(3,8). As these PTMs can be derived from short-chain fatty acids, which are generated by the commensal microbiota in the intestinal lumen(9-11), we aimed to define how microbes impact the host intestinal chromatin landscape, mainly in female mice. Here we show that in addition to acetylation, intestinal epithelial cells from the caecum and distal mouse intestine also harbour high levels of butyrylation and propionylation on lysines 9 and 27 of histone H3. We demonstrate that these acylations are regulated by the microbiota and that histone butyrylation is additionally regulated by the metabolite tributyrin. Tributyrin-regulated gene programmes are correlated with histone butyrylation, which is associated with active gene-regulatory elements and levels of gene expression. Together, our study uncovers a regulatory layer of how the microbiota and metabolites influence the intestinal epithelium through chromatin, demonstrating a physiological setting in which histone acylations are dynamically regulated and associated with gene regulation.",

Therefore, it is important to understand how histone crotonylation is regulated and how it, in turn, regulates the expression of its target genes.

The present review will explore epigenomic profiling and bioinformatics techniques for the study of kidney development and disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Reversible DNA and histone modifications influence chromatin accessibility and can be measured by a variety of recent techniques including DNase-seq, ATAC-seq, and single cell ATAC-seq. These approaches have been used to demonstrate that DNA methylation is critical for nephron progenitor maturation, for example. New bioinformatics techniques allow the prediction of chromatin loops that connect regulatory elements to target genes. Recent studies have demonstrated that DNA elements regulate transcription in the kidney via long-range physical interactions and create a new framework for understanding how genome wide association studies risk loci contribute to kidney disease. Increasingly, epigenomic approaches are being combined with transcriptomic analyses to generate multimodal datasets. SUMMARY: Epigenomics has expanded our knowledge of gene architecture and regulation. Novel tools and techniques have led to the emergence of 'multiomics' in which epigenomic profiling, transcriptomics, and additional methods complement each other to improve our understanding of kidney disease and development.",

    "title": "The arginine methyltransferase PRMT7 promotes extravasation of monocytes resulting in tissue injury in COPD.",
    "abstract": "Extravasation of monocytes into tissue and to the site of injury is a fundamental immunological process, which requires rapid responses via post translational modifications (PTM) of proteins. Protein arginine methyltransferase 7 (PRMT7) is an epigenetic factor that has the capacity to mono-methylate histones on arginine residues. Here we show that in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients, PRMT7 expression is elevated in the lung tissue and localized to the macrophages. In mouse models of COPD, lung fibrosis and skin injury, reduced expression of PRMT7 associates with decreased recruitment of monocytes to the site of injury and hence less severe symptoms. Mechanistically, activation of NF-kappaB/RelA in monocytes induces PRMT7 transcription and consequential mono-methylation of histones at the regulatory elements of RAP1A, which leads to increased transcription of this gene that is responsible for adhesion and migration of monocytes. Persistent monocyte-derived macrophage accumulation leads to ALOX5 over-expression and accumulation of its metabolite LTB4, which triggers expression of ACSL4 a ferroptosis promoting gene in lung epithelial cells. Conclusively, inhibition of arginine mono-methylation might offer targeted intervention in monocyte-driven inflammatory conditions that lead to extensive tissue damage if left untreated.",

    "abstract": "Transposable elements (TEs) are the most prevalent elements in mammalian genomes. Although potential risks for genome stability, they are a pool of potential regulatory sequences, chromatin control elements, protein-coding genes, and substrates for evolutionary processes. Consequently, a delicate balance is maintained between the potential benefits and deleterious aspects of TEs, and this balance is mediated by the epigenetic regulatory system. In this review, we introduce the role of heterochromatin associated epigentic modifications such as histone 3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) and DNA methylation in the silencing of TEs as well as epigenetic modifications such as histone 3 lysine 4 monomethylation (H3K4me1) and histone 3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) in activation of TEs. Further, we elaborate the functions of TEs as binding sites of transcription factors and as anchors of chromosomal conformation in regulation of gene expression. We introduce the impact of TEs on the process of cell fate determination including natural embryonic development in vivo and artificial cell fate transition in vitro. We discuss the main challenges associated with computational TEs analysis and TEs functions exploration, as well as the different experimental and computational strategies in studying these processes. In all, this article provides a comprehensive review of the research advances and existing problems in study of transposable elements in epigenetic regulatory mechanisms, gene transcriptional regulation, and cell fate determination, thereby providing some references for researchers in the fields.",

    "abstract": "Widespread aberrant gene expression is a pathological hallmark of polycystic kidney disease (PKD). Numerous pathogenic signaling cascades, including c-Myc, Fos, and Jun, are transactivated. However, the underlying epigenetic regulators are poorly defined. Here we show that H3K27ac, an acetylated modification of DNA packing protein histone H3 that marks active enhancers, is elevated in mouse and human samples of autosomal dominant PKD. Using comparative H3K27ac ChIP-Seq analysis, we mapped over 16000 active intronic and intergenic enhancer elements in Pkd1-mutant mouse kidneys. We found that the cystic kidney epigenetic landscape resembles that of a developing kidney, and over 90% of upregulated genes in Pkd1-mutant kidneys are co-housed with activated enhancers in the same topologically associated domains. Furthermore, we identified an evolutionarily conserved enhancer cluster downstream of the c-Myc gene and super-enhancers flanking both Jun and Fos loci in mouse and human models of autosomal dominant PKD. Deleting these regulatory elements reduced c-Myc, Jun, or Fos abundance and suppressed proliferation and 3D cyst growth of Pkd1-mutant cells. Finally, inhibiting glycolysis and glutaminolysis or activating Ppara in Pkd1-mutant cells lowerd global H3K27ac levels and its abundance on c-Myc enhancers. Thus, our work suggests that epigenetic rewiring mediates the transcriptomic dysregulation in PKD, and the regulatory elements can be targeted to slow cyst growth.",

Here, we studied epigenetic changes associated with maternal smoking at base pair resolution by mapping DNA methylation, histone modifications, and transcription in expectant mothers and their newborn children. We found extensive global differential methylation and carefully evaluated these changes to separate environment associated from genotype-related DNA methylation changes. Differential methylation is enriched in enhancer elements and targets in particular \"commuting\" enhancers having multiple, regulatory interactions with distal genes. Longitudinal whole-genome bisulfite sequencing revealed that DNA methylation changes associated with maternal smoking persist over years of life. Particularly in children prenatal environmental exposure leads to chromatin transitions into a hyperactive state. Combined DNA methylation, histone modification, and gene expression analyses indicate that differential methylation in enhancer regions is more often functionally translated than methylation changes in promoters or non-regulatory elements. Finally, we show that epigenetic deregulation of a commuting enhancer targeting c-Jun N-terminal kinase 2 (JNK2) is linked to impaired lung function in early childhood.",

    "title": "Aging as an Epigenetic Phenomenon.",
    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Hypermethylation of genes associated with promoter CpG islands, and hypomethylation of CpG poor genes, repeat sequences, transposable elements and intergenic genome sections occur during aging in mammals. Methylation levels of certain CpG sites display strict correlation to age and could be used as \"epigenetic clock\" to predict biological age. Multi-substrate deacetylases SIRT1 and SIRT6 affect aging via locus-specific modulations of chromatin structure and activity of multiple regulatory proteins involved in aging. Random errors in DNA methylation and other epigenetic marks during aging increase the transcriptional noise, and thus lead to enhanced phenotypic variation between cells of the same tissue. Such variation could cause progressive organ dysfunction observed in aged individuals. Multiple experimental data show that induction of NF-kappaB regulated gene sets occurs in various tissues of aged mammals. Upregulation of multiple miRNAs occurs at mid age leading to downregulation of enzymes and regulatory proteins involved in basic cellular functions, such as DNA repair, oxidative phosphorylation, intermediate metabolism, and others. CONCLUSION: Strong evidence shows that all epigenetic systems contribute to the lifespan control in various organisms. Similar to other cell systems, epigenome is prone to gradual degradation due to the genome damage, stressful agents, and other aging factors. But unlike mutations and other kinds of the genome damage, age-related epigenetic changes could be fully or partially reversed to a \"young\" state.",

    "abstract": "The function of one-carbon metabolism is that of regulating the provision of methyl groups for biological methylation reactions including that of DNA and histone proteins. Methylation at specific sites into the DNA sequence and at histone tails are among the major epigenetic feature of mammalian genome for the regulation of gene expression. The enzymes within one-carbon metabolism are dependent from a number of vitamins or nutrients that serve either as co-factors or methyl acceptors or donors among which folate, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, betaine, choline and methionine have a major role. Several evidences show that there is a strict inter-relationship between one-carbon metabolism nutrients and epigenetic phenomena. Epigenetics is closely involved in gene transcriptional regulation through modifications super-imposed to the nucleotide sequence of DNA, such as DNA methylation, through chromatin remodeling systems that involves post-translational modifications of histones or through non-coding RNAs-based mechanisms. The epigenetic features of the genome are potentially modifiable by the action of several environmental factors among which nutrients cover a special place and interest considering their potential of influencing regulatory pathways at a molecular level by specific nutritional intervention and eventually influence disease prevention and outcomes. The present review will focus on the link between one-carbon nutrients and epigenetic phenomena based on the current knowledge from findings in cell culture, animal models and human studies.",

    "abstract": "In eukaryotic cells, transgene expression levels may be limited by an unfavourable chromatin structure at the integration site. Epigenetic regulators are DNA sequences which may protect transgenes from such position effect. We evaluated different epigenetic regulators for their ability to protect transgene expression at telomeres, which are commonly associated to low or inconsistent expression because of their repressive chromatin environment. Although to variable extents, matrix attachment regions (MARs), ubiquitous chromatin opening element (UCOE) and the chicken cHS4 insulator acted as barrier elements, protecting a telomeric-distal transgene from silencing. MARs also increased the probability of silent gene reactivation in time-course experiments. Additionally, all MARs improved the level of expression in non-silenced cells, unlike other elements. MARs were associated to histone marks usually linked to actively expressed genes, especially acetylation of histone H3 and H4, suggesting that they may prevent the spread of silencing chromatin by imposing acetylation marks on nearby nucleosomes. Alternatively, an UCOE was found to act by preventing deposition of repressive chromatin marks. We conclude that epigenetic DNA elements used to enhance and stabilize transgene expression all have specific epigenetic signature that might be at the basis of their mode of action.",

Epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation, post-translational modifications to histone tails, and nucleosome positioning all potentially contribute to the changes in higher order chromatin structure during differentiation. The mammary gland is a particularly useful model to study these complex epigenetic processes since the majority of its development is postnatal, the gland is easily accessible, and development occurs in a highly reproducible manner. Inappropriate epigenetic remodelling can also drive tumourigenesis; thus, insights into epigenetic remodelling during mammary gland development advance our understanding of breast cancer aetiology. We review the current literature surrounding DNA methylation and histone modifications in the developing mammary gland and its implications for breast cancer.",

The molecular mechanisms associated with FRDA are still poorly understood and most studies on FXN gene regulation have been focused on the region around the minimal promoter and the region in which triplet expansion occurs. Nevertheless, since there could be more epigenetic changes involved in the reduced levels of FXN transcripts, the aim of this study was to obtain a more detailed view of the possible regulatory elements by analyzing data from ENCODE and Roadmap consortia databases. This bioinformatic analysis indicated new putative regulatory regions within the FXN genomic locus, including exons, introns, and upstream and downstream regions. Moreover, the region next to the end of intron 4 is of special interest, since the enhancer signals in FRDA-affected tissues are weak or absent in this region, whilst they are strong in the rest of the analyzed tissues. Therefore, these results suggest that there could be a direct relationship between the absence of enhancer sequences in this specific region and their predisposition to be affected in this pathology.",

    "abstract": "Lineage plasticity, the ability of a cell to alter its identity, is an increasingly common mechanism of adaptive resistance to targeted therapy in cancer. An archetypal example is the development of neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) after treatment of prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD) with inhibitors of androgen signaling. NEPC is an aggressive variant of prostate cancer that aberrantly expresses genes characteristic of neuroendocrine (NE) tissues and no longer depends on androgens. Here, we investigate the epigenomic basis of this resistance mechanism by profiling histone modifications in NEPC and PRAD patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) using chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (ChIP-seq). We identify a vast network of cis-regulatory elements (N~15,000) that are recurrently activated in NEPC. The FOXA1 transcription factor (TF), which pioneers androgen receptor (AR) chromatin binding in the prostate epithelium, is reprogrammed to NE-specific regulatory elements in NEPC. Despite loss of dependence upon AR, NEPC maintains FOXA1 expression and requires FOXA1 for proliferation and expression of NE lineage-defining genes. Ectopic expression of the NE lineage TFs ASCL1 and NKX2-1 in PRAD cells reprograms FOXA1 to bind to NE regulatory elements and induces enhancer activity as evidenced by histone modifications at these sites. Our data establish the importance of FOXA1 in NEPC and provide a principled approach to identifying cancer dependencies through epigenomic profiling.",

Despite recent advances in the characterization of the mouse adipocyte epigenome, epigenetic characterization of adipocytes in vivo has been challenging, particularly across different adipose depots and of several epigenetic modifications. METHODS: Here, we use specific reporter mice labelling brown, beige and white adipocytes, diphtheria toxin-mediated ablation of beige adipocytes, and Cleavage Under Targets and Tagmentation (CUT&Tag) to generate paired single mouse datasets of five histone marks. We perform an integrative multi-omics factor analysis (MOFA) of H3K4me3, H3K27me3, H3K4me1, H3K27ac and H3K9me3 in brown, white and beige adipocytes from three distinct mouse adipose tissue depots obtained during cold exposure and thermoneutrality. RESULTS: Our analysis reveals that enhancers distinguish adipocytes by their tissue of origin, with H3K4me1 deposition differentiating between beige and brown adipocytes. Beige adipocytes poised promoters associated to thermogenic genes during warming. Diphtheria toxin-mediated ablation of beige adipocytes shows that non-beigeing white adipocytes in inguinal adipose tissue and beige adipocytes are not inherently epigenetically different suggesting that they share a common developmental progenitor.

While the large and complex genome of pepper severely hampered the understanding of its functional genome, it also indicates a rich yet unexplored reservoir of regulatory elements (REs). In fact, variations in the REs represent a major driving force in evolution and domestication in both plants and animals. However, identification of the REs remains difficult especially for plants with complex genomes. RESULTS: Here, we present a comprehensive epigenomic landscape of Capsicum annuum, Zhangshugang (ST-8), including chromatin accessibility, histone modifications, DNA methylation, and transcriptome. We also develop comparative crosslinked immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry to reveal the proteome associated with certain chromatin features. Through integrated analysis of these epigenetic features, we profile promoters and enhancers involved in development, heat stress and cucumber mosaic virus challenges. We generate stress responsive expression networks composed of potential transcription activators and their target genes. Through population genetics analysis, we demonstrate that some regulatory elements show lower nucleotide diversity compare to other genomic regions during evolution. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that variations in the REs may contribute to more diversified and agronomically desired phenotypes. Our study provides a foundation not only for studying gene regulation, but also for targeted genetic and epigenetic manipulation for pepper improvement.",

    "abstract": "Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4A (HNF4A/NR2a1), a transcriptional regulator of hepatocyte identity, controls genes that are crucial for liver functions, primarily through binding to enhancers. In mammalian cells, active and primed enhancers are marked by monomethylation of histone 3 (H3) at lysine 4 (K4) (H3K4me1) in a cell type-specific manner. How this modification is established and maintained at enhancers in connection with transcription factors (TFs) remains unknown. Using analysis of genome-wide histone modifications, TF binding, chromatin accessibility and gene expression, we show that HNF4A is essential for an active chromatin state. Using HNF4A loss and gain of function experiments in vivo and in cell lines in vitro, we show that HNF4A affects H3K4me1, H3K27ac and chromatin accessibility, highlighting its contribution to the establishment and maintenance of a transcriptionally permissive epigenetic state. Mechanistically, HNF4A interacts with the mixed-lineage leukaemia 4 (MLL4) complex facilitating recruitment to HNF4A-bound regions. Our findings indicate that HNF4A enriches H3K4me1, H3K27ac and establishes chromatin opening at transcriptional regulatory regions.",

Here, we report regulatory mechanisms unveiling a central role of Alu elements (AEs) and RNA polymerase III transcription factor C (TFIIIC) in structurally and functionally modulating the genome via chromatin looping and histone acetylation. Upon serum deprivation, a subset of AEs pre-marked by the activity-dependent neuroprotector homeobox Protein (ADNP) and located near cell-cycle genes recruits TFIIIC, which alters their chromatin accessibility by direct acetylation of histone H3 lysine-18 (H3K18). This facilitates the contacts of AEs with distant CTCF sites near promoter of other cell-cycle genes, which also become hyperacetylated at H3K18. These changes ensure basal transcription of cell-cycle genes and are critical for their re-activation upon serum re-exposure. Our study reveals how direct manipulation of the epigenetic state of AEs by a general transcription factor regulates 3D genome folding and expression.",

Transcription factors, cofactors and mediators co-operate together and are required for enhancer functions. In turn, abnormalities in these trans-acting factors affect enhancer activity. Recent studies have revealed enhancer dysregulation as one of the important features for cancer. Variations in enhancer regions and mutations of enhancer regulatory genes are frequently observed in cancer cells, and altering the activity of onco-enhancers is able to repress oncogene expression, and suppress tumorigenesis and metastasis.

Environmental factors including mainly silica and solvents have been assumed to contribute to the development of SSc, together with genetic factors including gene variants implicated in innate immunity such as IRF5 and STAT4, and epigenetic factors including histone post-translational modifications, DNA hypomethylation, and microRNAs or long- non coding RNAs system were reported to participate in immune activation and fibrosis processes in patients with SSc. A number of animal models of SSc have been set up over the years, including genetic and induced SSc models. These models, together with data obtained from human SSc patients, contributed to better understand the mechanisms contributing to vasculopathy and fibrosis. Alongside the pathophysiological process of SSc, several cellular and molecular actors are involved, such as dysregulations in the innate and adaptive immune cells, of the fibroblast, the implication of pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrosing signaling pathways such as the Wnt, TGF-beta pathways or other cytokines, with a strong imprint of oxidative stress. The whole lead to the overactivity of the fibroblast with genetic dysregulation, apoptosis defect, hyperproduction of elements of extracellular matrix, and finally the phenomena of vasculopathy and fibrosis. These advances contribute to open new therapeutic areas through the design of biologics and small molecules.",

    "abstract": "Bone formation and homeostasis are controlled by environmental factors and endocrine regulatory cues that initiate intracellular signaling pathways capable of modulating gene expression in the nucleus. Bone-related gene expression is controlled by nucleosome-based chromatin architecture that limits the accessibility of lineage-specific gene regulatory DNA sequences and sequence-specific transcription factors. From a developmental perspective, bone-specific gene expression must be suppressed during the early stages of embryogenesis to prevent the premature mineralization of skeletal elements during fetal growth in utero. Hence, bone formation is initially inhibited by gene suppressive epigenetic regulators, while other epigenetic regulators actively support osteoblast differentiation. Prominent epigenetic regulators that stimulate or attenuate osteogenesis include lysine methyl transferases (e.g., EZH2, SMYD2, SUV420H2), lysine deacetylases (e.g., HDAC1, HDAC3, HDAC4, HDAC7, SIRT1, SIRT3), arginine methyl transferases (e.g., PRMT1, PRMT4/CARM1, PRMT5), dioxygenases (e.g., TET2), bromodomain proteins (e.g., BRD2, BRD4) and chromodomain proteins (e.g., CBX1, CBX2, CBX5). This narrative review provides a broad overview of the covalent modifications of DNA and histone proteins that involve hundreds of enzymes that add, read, or delete these epigenetic modifications that are relevant for self-renewal and differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells, skeletal stem cells and osteoblasts during osteogenesis.",

Unveiling the epigenetic mechanisms underlying human cell diversity has been difficult. In this study, we use human brain and retina organoid models and present single-cell profiling of H3K27ac, H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 histone modifications from progenitor to differentiated neural fates to reconstruct the epigenomic trajectories regulating cell identity acquisition. We capture transitions from pluripotency through neuroepithelium to retinal and brain region and cell type specification. Switching of repressive and activating epigenetic modifications can precede and predict cell fate decisions at each stage, providing a temporal census of gene regulatory elements and transcription factors. Removing H3K27me3 at the neuroectoderm stage disrupts fate restriction, resulting in aberrant cell identity acquisition. Our single-cell epigenome-wide map of human neural organoid development serves as a blueprint to explore human cell fate determination.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptional activators bind DNA and recruit cofactors to modify chromatin. The extent to which these two events are separable is unclear. Here, using a custom ChIP tiling array to map chromatin modifications, we show that interferon-gamma-induced DNA binding of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), typically associated with the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1), causes histone acetylation (H3ac, H4ac). In contrast, among IRF1 sites lacking concomitant STAT1 recruitment, only 25% underwent inducible histone acetylation, 31% exhibited constitutive histone acetylation, and 44% had no histone acetylation. These latter \"orphan sites\" also lacked other activating modifications (e.g. H3K4me1, H3K4me2) and were typically remote from transcription start sites. In these cases the closest gene was typically an IFNgamma-inducible locus that did not respond to IFNgamma in this setting. Orphan sites were detected in different cell types, suggesting broad relevance. Despite an atypical downstream response (i.e. no histone modifications), IRF1 binding depended on SWI/SNF-related, matrix-associated, actin-dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily A, member 4 (SMARCA4 or BRG1), as is typical of active IRF1 enhancers. Although SMARCA4 permitted IRF1 access to the orphan sites, there was no corecruitment of the histone acetyltransferases CREB-binding protein (CBP) and p300. Orphan sites were constitutively unacetylated, and several were marked with repressive chromatin modifications (e.g. H3K27me3). In conclusion, although IRF1 can trigger enhanceosome formation independently of STAT1, its ability to do so depends on local chromatin cues.",

    "abstract": "Experimental evidence indicates that shear stress (SS) exerts a morphogenetic function during cardiac development of mouse and zebrafish embryos. However, the molecular basis for this effect is still elusive. Our previous work described that in adult endothelial cells, SS regulates gene expression by inducing epigenetic modification of histones and activation of transcription complexes bearing acetyltransferase activity. In this study, we evaluated whether SS treatment could epigenetically modify histones and influence cell differentiation in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. Cells were exposed to a laminar SS of 10 dyne per cm2/s(-1), or kept in static conditions in the presence or absence of the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA). These experiments revealed that SS enhanced lysine acetylation of histone H3 at position 14 (K14), as well as serine phosphorylation at position 10 (S10) and lysine methylation at position 79 (K79), and cooperated with TSA, inducing acetylation of histone H4 and phosphoacetylation of S10 and K14 of histone H3. In addition, ES cells exposed to SS strongly activated transcription from the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor 2 promoter. This effect was paralleled by an early induction of cardiovascular markers, including smooth muscle actin, smooth muscle protein 22-alpha, platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1, VEGF receptor 2, myocyte enhancer factor-2C (MEF2C), and alpha-sarcomeric actin. In this condition, transcription factors MEF2C and Sma/MAD homolog protein 4 could be isolated from SS-treated ES cells complexed with the cAMP response element-binding protein acetyltransferase. These results provide molecular basis for the SS-dependent cardiovascular commitment of mouse ES cells and suggest that laminar flow may be successfully applied for the in vitro production of cardiovascular precursors.",

Developmental enhancers adopt a primed chromatin state prior to their activation. How this primed enhancer state is established and maintained and how it affects the regulation of developmental gene networks remains poorly understood. RESULTS: Here, we use comparative multi-omic analyses of human and mouse early embryonic development to identify subsets of postgastrulation lineage-specific enhancers which are epigenetically primed ahead of their activation, marked by the histone modification H3K4me1 within the epiblast. We show that epigenetic priming occurs at lineage-specific enhancers for all three germ layers and that epigenetic priming of enhancers confers lineage-specific regulation of key developmental gene networks. Surprisingly in some cases, lineage-specific enhancers are epigenetically marked already in the zygote, weeks before their activation during lineage specification. Moreover, we outline a generalizable strategy to use naturally occurring human genetic variation to delineate important sequence determinants of primed enhancer function. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings identify an evolutionarily conserved program of enhancer priming and begin to dissect the temporal dynamics and mechanisms of its establishment and maintenance during early mammalian development.",

    "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is complex neurobehavioral condition influenced by several cellular and molecular mechanisms that are often concerned with synaptogenesis and synaptic activity. Based on the excitation/inhibition (E/I) imbalance theory, ASD could be the result of disruption in excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission across the brain. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is the chief regulator of executive function and can be affected by altered neuronal excitation and inhibition in the course of ASD. The molecular mechanisms involved in E/I imbalance are subject to epigenetic regulation. In ASD, altered enrichment and spreading of histone H3 and H4 modifications such as the activation-linked H3K4me2/3, H3K9ac, and H3K27ac, and repression-linked H3K9me2, H3K27me3, and H4K20me2 in the PFC result in dysregulation of molecules mediating synaptic excitation (ARC, EGR1, mGluR2, mGluR3, GluN2A, and GluN2B) and synaptic inhibition (BSN, EphA7, SLC6A1). Histone modifications are a dynamic component of the epigenetic regulatory elements with a pronounced effect on patterns of gene expression with regards to any biological process. The excitation/inhibition imbalance associated with ASD is based on the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic activity in different regions of the brain, including the PFC, the ultimate outcome of which is highly influenced by transcriptional activity of relevant genes.",

These plenty resources leave us the opportunity about sufficiently utilizing those data to explore biological problems. RESULTS: Here we developed an integrative and comparative method, CsreHMM, which is based on a hidden Markov model, to systematically reveal cell type-specific regulatory elements (CSREs) along the whole genome, and simultaneously recognize the histone codes (mark combinations) charactering them. This method also reveals the subclasses of CSREs and explicitly label those shared by a few cell types. We applied this method to a data set of 9 cell types and 9 chromatin marks to demonstrate its effectiveness and found that the revealed CSREs relates to different kinds of functional regulatory regions significantly. Their proximal genes have consistent expression and are likely to participate in cell type-specific biological functions. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest CsreHMM has the potential to help understand cell identity and the diverse mechanisms of gene regulation.",

Here, we outline the studies that have addressed this question in yeast, Drosophila, and mammalian systems. We review evidence from histone residue mutation, histone modifier manipulation, and epigenetic editing, focusing on the relative roles of H3K4me1 and H3K4me3.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Cholangiocytes transit from quiescence to hyperproliferation during cystogenesis in polycystic liver disease (PLD), the severity of which displays prominent sex differences. Epigenetic regulation plays important roles in cell state transition. We aimed to investigate the sex-specific epigenetic basis of hepatic cystogenesis and to develop therapeutic strategies targeting epigenetic modifications for PLD treatment. METHODS: Normal and cystic primary cholangiocytes were isolated from wild-type and PLD mice of both sexes. Chromatin states were characterized by analyzing chromatin accessibility (ATAC sequencing) and multiple histone modifications (chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing). Differential gene expression was determined by transcriptomic analysis (RNA sequencing). Pharmacologic inhibition of epigenetic modifying enzymes was undertaken in PLD model mice. RESULTS: Through genome-wide profiling of chromatin dynamics, we revealed a profound increase of global chromatin accessibility during cystogenesis in both male and female PLD cholangiocytes. We identified a switch from H3K9me3 to H3K9ac on cis-regulatory DNA elements of cyst-associated genes and showed that inhibition of H3K9ac acetyltransferase or H3K9me3 demethylase slowed cyst growth in male, but not female, PLD mice. In contrast, we found that H3K27ac was specifically increased in female PLD mice and that genes associated with H3K27ac-gained regions were enriched for cyst-related pathways. In an integrated epigenomic and transcriptomic analysis, we identified an estrogen receptor alpha-centered transcription factor network associated with the H3K27ac-regulated cystogenic gene expression program in female PLD mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the multi-layered sex-specific epigenetic dynamics underlying cholangiocyte state transition and reveal a potential epigenetic therapeutic strategy for male PLD patients. IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS: In the present study, we elucidate a sex-specific epigenetic mechanism underlying the cholangiocyte state transition during hepatic cystogenesis and identify epigenetic drugs that effectively slow cyst growth in male PLD mice. These findings underscore the importance of sex difference in the pathogenesis of PLD and may guide researchers and physicians to develop sex-specific personalized approaches for PLD treatment.",

We apply scMTR-seq to uncover dynamic and coordinated changes in chromatin states and transcriptomes during human endoderm differentiation. We also use scMTR-seq to produce lineage-resolved chromatin maps and gene regulatory networks in mouse blastocysts, revealing epigenetic asymmetries at gene regulatory regions between the three embryo lineages and identifying Trps1 as a potential repressor in epiblast cells of trophectoderm-associated enhancer networks and their target genes.

    "abstract": "Cancer progression is strongly affected by epigenetic events in addition to genetic modifications. One of the key elements in the epigenetic control of gene expression is histone modification through acetylation, which is regulated by the synergy between histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs). HDACs are thought to offer considerable potential for the development of anticancer medications, particularly when used in conjunction with other anticancer medications and/or radiotherapy. Belinostat (Beleodaq, PXD101) is a pan-HDAC unsaturated hydroxamate inhibitor with a sulfonamide group that has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of refractory or relapsed peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) and solid malignancies or and other hematological tissues. This drug modifies histones and epigenetic pathways. Because HDAC and HAT imbalance can lead to downregulation of regulatory genes, resulting in tumorigenesis. Inhibition of HDACs by belinostat indirectly promotes anti-cancer therapeutic effect by provoking acetylated histone accumulation, re-establishing normal gene expressions in cancer cells and stimulating other routes such as the immune response, p27 signaling cascades, caspase 3 activation, nuclear protein poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) degradation, cyclin A (G2/M phase), cyclin E1 (G1/S phase) and other events. In addition, belinostat has already been discovered to increase p21(WAF1) in a number of cell lines (melanoma, prostate, breast, lung, colon, and ovary). This cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor actually has a role in processes that cause cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Belinostat's clinical effectiveness, comprising Phase I and II studies within the areas of solid and hematological cancers, has been evidenced through several investigative trials that have supported its potential to be a valuable anti-cancer drug. The purpose of this research was to provide insight on the specific molecular processes through which belinostat inhibits HDAC. The ability to investigate new therapeutic options employing targeted therapy and acquire a deeper understanding of cancer cell abnormalities may result from a better understanding of these particular routes.",

    "abstract": "Transitions in gene regulatory processes responsible for the emergence of specialized cell types and spatiotemporal regulation of developmental signaling prior to the divergence of Cnidaria and Bilateria are poorly understood. As a sister group of Bilateria, the phylum Cnidaria can provide significant insights into these processes. Among the cnidarians, hydrae have been studied for >250 years to comprehend the mechanisms underlying their unique immortality and robust regenerative capacity. Studies on Hydra spp. and other pre-bilaterians alike have advanced our understanding of the evolutionary underpinnings governing eumetazoan tissue development, homeostasis, and regeneration. In addition to its regenerative potential, Hydra exhibits continuously active axial patterning due to its peculiar tissue dynamics. These distinctive physiological processes necessitate large scale gene expression changes that are governed by the multitude of epigenetic mechanisms operating in cells. This review highlights the contemporary knowledge of epigenetic regulation in Hydra with contemporary studies from other members of Cnidaria, as well as the interplay between regulatory mechanisms wherever demonstrated. The studies covered in the scope of this review reveal both ancestral and divergent roles played by conserved epigenetic mechanisms with emphasis on transcriptional regulation. Additionally, single-cell transcriptomics data was mined to predict the physiological relevance of putative gene regulatory components, which is in agreement with published findings and yielded insights into the possible functions of the gene regulatory mechanisms that are yet to be deciphered in Hydra, such as DNA methylation. Finally, we delineate potentially rewarding epigenetics research avenues that can further leverage the unique biology of Hydra.",

    "abstract": "During organism development, a diversity of cell types emerges with disparate, yet stable profiles of gene expression with distinctive cellular functions. In addition to gene promoters, the genome contains enhancer regulatory sequences, which are implicated in cellular specialization by facilitating cell-type and tissue-specific gene expression. Enhancers are DNA binding elements characterized by highly sophisticated and various mechanisms of action allowing for the specific interaction of general and tissue-specific transcription factors (TFs). However, eukaryotic organisms package their genetic material into chromatin, generating a physical barrier for TFs to interact with their cognate sequences. The ability of TFs to bind DNA regulatory elements is also modulated by changes in the chromatin structure, including histone modifications, histone variants, ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling, and the methylation status of DNA. Furthermore, it has recently been revealed that enhancer sequences are also transcribed into a set of enhancer RNAs with regulatory potential. These interdependent processes act in the context of a complex network of chromatin interactions, which together contributes to a renewed vision of how gene activation is coordinated in a cell-type-dependent manner. In this review, we describe the interplay between genetic and epigenetic aspects associated with enhancers and discuss their possible roles on enhancer function.",

Pirfenidone (PFD) is an antifibrotic agent with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects recognized to decrease NASH symptoms. Herein, our aim was to investigate PFD-induced epigenetics mechanisms involving JMJD2B and histone modifications in experimental NASH. Male C57BL/6J mice were fed with normo-diet, or high fat/carbohydrate diet (HF) for 16 weeks. A HF-subgroup was treated with PFD 300 mg/kg/d from week 8th to the end of protocol. Insulin tolerance test and liver and fat histological and biochemical analyses were carried out. Hepatic transcriptome was examined. Liver proteins were studied by western blot (WB) and Chromatin immunoprecipitation. In vitro, lipotoxicity was induced in HepG2 cells and proteins were evaluated using WB. Molecular docking was used to explore binding of PFD to JMJD2B. Mice treated with PFD reduced weight gain, epididymal fat and inflammatory nodules, and steatosis in liver tissue, as well as, improved biochemical test. PFD modified the expression of Jmjd2b, Pparg, Fasn and Srebp1, and restored JMJD2B protein and H3K9me3 repressive mark, both in animal and cell models. PFD increased hepatic enrichment of H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 at the promoter region of Fasn and Srebp1, and Pparg. In HepG2 cells, PFD reduced lipid vacuole accumulation.

    "abstract": "T-cell development endows cells with a flexible range of effector differentiation options, superimposed on a stable core of lineage-specific gene expression that is maintained while access to alternative hematopoietic lineages is permanently renounced. This combination of features could be explained by environmentally responsive transcription factor mobilization overlaying an epigenetically stabilized base gene expression state. For example, \"poising\" of promoters could offer preferential access to T-cell genes, while repressive histone modifications and DNA methylation of non-T regulatory genes could be responsible for keeping non-T developmental options closed. Here, we critically review the evidence for the actual deployment of epigenetic marking to support the stable aspects of T-cell identity. Much of epigenetic marking is dynamically maintained or subject to rapid modification by local action of transcription factors. Repressive histone marks are used in gene-specific ways that do not fit a simple, developmental lineage-exclusion hierarchy. We argue that epigenetic analysis may achieve its greatest impact for illuminating regulatory biology when it is used to locate cis-regulatory elements by catching them in the act of mediating regulatory change.",

    "abstract": "Transcription of genes is regulated by DNA elements such as promoters and enhancers, the activity of which are in turn controlled by many transcription factors. Owing to the highly complex combinatorial logic involved, it has been difficult to construct computational models that predict gene activity from DNA sequence. Recent advances in deep learning techniques applied to data from epigenome mapping and high-throughput reporter assays have made substantial progress towards addressing this complexity. Such models can capture the regulatory grammar with remarkable accuracy and show great promise in predicting the effects of non-coding variants, uncovering detailed molecular mechanisms of gene regulation and designing synthetic regulatory elements for biotechnology. Here, we discuss the principles of these approaches, the types of training data sets that are available and the strengths and limitations of different approaches.",

    "abstract": "The enhancer is a DNA sequence that can increase the activity of promoters and thus speed up the frequency of gene transcription. The enhancer plays an essential role in activating gene expression. Currently, gene sequencing technology has been developed for 30 years from the first generation to the third generation, and a variety of biological sequence data have increased significantly every year. Due to the importance of enhancer functions, it is very expensive to identify enhancers through biochemical experiments. Therefore, we need to study new methods for the identification and classification of enhancers. Based on the K-mer principle this study proposed a feature extraction method that others have not used in convolutional neural networks. Then, we combined it with one-hot encoding to build an efficient one-dimensional convolutional neural network ensemble model for predicting enhancers and their strengths. Finally, we used five commonly used classification problem evaluation indicators to compare with the models proposed by other researchers. The model proposed in this paper has a better performance by using the same independent test dataset as other models.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Fermentation processes are essential for the production of small molecules, heterologous proteins and other commercially important products. Traditional bioprocess optimisation relies on phenomenological models that focus on macroscale variables like biomass growth and protein yield. However, these models often fail to consider the crucial link between macroscale dynamics and the intracellular activities that drive metabolism and proteins synthesis. RESULTS: We introduce a multiscale model that not only captures batch bioreactor dynamics but also incorporates a coarse-grained approach to key intracellular processes such as gene expression, ribosome allocation and growth. Our model accurately fits biomass and substrate data across various Escherichia coli strains, effectively predicts acetate dynamics and evaluates the expression of heterologous proteins. By integrating construct-specific parameters like promoter strength and ribosomal binding sites, our model reveals several key interdependencies between gene expression parameters and outputs such as protein yield and acetate secretion. CONCLUSIONS: This study presents a computational model that, with proper parameterisation, allows for the in silico analysis of genetic constructs. The focus is on combinations of ribosomal binding site (RBS) strength and promoters, assessing their impact on production. In this way, the ability to predict bioreactor dynamics from these genetic constructs can pave the way for more efficient design and optimisation of microbial fermentation processes, enhancing the production of valuable bioproducts.",

    "abstract": "Targeted engineering of plant gene expression holds great promise for ensuring food security and for producing biopharmaceuticals in plants. However, this engineering requires thorough knowledge of cis-regulatory elements to precisely control either endogenous or introduced genes. To generate this knowledge, we used a massively parallel reporter assay to measure the activity of nearly complete sets of promoters from Arabidopsis, maize and sorghum. We demonstrate that core promoter elements-notably the TATA box-as well as promoter GC content and promoter-proximal transcription factor binding sites influence promoter strength. By performing the experiments in two assay systems, leaves of the dicot tobacco and protoplasts of the monocot maize, we detect species-specific differences in the contributions of GC content and transcription factors to promoter strength. Using these observations, we built computational models to predict promoter strength in both assay systems, allowing us to design highly active promoters comparable in activity to the viral 35S minimal promoter. Our results establish a promising experimental approach to optimize native promoter elements and generate synthetic ones with desirable features.",

We applied single-molecule footprinting (SMF) to measure the simultaneous occupancy of TFs, nucleosomes, and components of the transcription machinery on engineered enhancer/promoter constructs with variable numbers of TF binding sites for both a synthetic and an endogenous TF. We find that activation domains enhance a TF's capacity to compete with nucleosomes for binding to DNA in a BAF-dependent manner, TF binding on nucleosome-free DNA is consistent with independent binding between TFs, and average TF occupancy linearly contributes to promoter activation rates. We also decompose TF strength into separable binding and activation terms, which can be tuned and perturbed independently. Finally, we develop thermodynamic and kinetic models that quantitatively predict both the binding microstates observed at the enhancer and subsequent time-dependent gene expression.

However, it is unclear what proportion of transcriptional activity is reflecting such organisation, how much can be informed by RNA expression alone and how this impacts disease. Here, we develop a computational transcriptional decomposition approach separating the proportion of expression associated with genome organisation from independent effects not directly related to genomic positioning. We show that positionally attributable expression accounts for a considerable proportion of total levels and is highly informative of topological associating domain activities and organisation, revealing boundaries and chromatin compartments. Furthermore, expression data alone accurately predict individual enhancer-promoter interactions, drawing features from expression strength, stabilities, insulation and distance. We characterise predictions in 76 human cell types, observing extensive sharing of domains, yet highly cell-type-specific enhancer-promoter interactions and strong enrichments in relevant trait-associated variants. Overall, our work demonstrates a close relationship between transcription and chromatin architecture.",

    "title": "Pathogenic LRRK2 variants are gain-of-function mutations that enhance LRRK2-mediated repression of beta-catenin signaling.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: LRRK2 mutations and risk variants increase susceptibility to inherited and idiopathic Parkinson's disease, while recent studies have identified potential protective variants. This, and the fact that LRRK2 mutation carriers develop symptoms and brain pathology almost indistinguishable from idiopathic Parkinson's disease, has led to enormous interest in this protein. LRRK2 has been implicated in a range of cellular events, but key among them is canonical Wnt signalling, which results in increased levels of transcriptionally active beta-catenin. This pathway is critical for the development and survival of the midbrain dopaminergic neurones typically lost in Parkinson's disease. METHODS: Here we use Lrrk2 knockout mice and fibroblasts to investigate the effect of loss of Lrrk2 on canonical Wnt signalling in vitro and in vivo. Micro-computed tomography was used to study predicted tibial strength, while pulldown assays were employed to measure brain beta-catenin levels. A combination of luciferase assays, immunofluorescence and co-immunoprecipitation were performed to measure canonical Wnt activity and investigate the relationship between LRRK2 and beta-catenin. TOPflash assays are also used to study the effects of LRRK2 kinase inhibition and pathogenic and protective LRRK2 mutations on Wnt signalling. Data were tested by Analysis of Variance. RESULTS: Loss of Lrrk2 causes a dose-dependent increase in the levels of transcriptionally active beta-catenin in the brain, and alters tibial bone architecture, decreasing the predicted risk of fracture. Lrrk2 knockout cells display increased TOPflash and Axin2 promoter activities, both basally and following Wnt activation. Consistently, over-expressed LRRK2 was found to bind beta-catenin and repress TOPflash activation. Some pathogenic LRRK2 mutations and risk variants further suppressed TOPflash, whereas the protective R1398H variant increased Wnt signalling activity. LRRK2 kinase inhibitors affected canonical Wnt signalling differently due to off-targeting; however, specific LRRK2 inhibition reduced canonical Wnt signalling similarly to pathogenic mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Loss of LRRK2 causes increased canonical Wnt activity in vitro and in vivo. In agreement, over-expressed LRRK2 binds and represses beta-catenin, suggesting LRRK2 may act as part of the beta-catenin destruction complex. Since some pathogenic LRRK2 mutations enhance this effect while the protective R1398H variant relieves it, our data strengthen the notion that decreased canonical Wnt activity is central to Parkinson's disease pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "The precise molecular mechanisms by which urate-associated genetic variants affect urate levels are unknown. Here, we tested for functional linkage of the maximally associated genetic variant rs1967017 at the PDZK1 locus to elevated PDZK1 expression. We performed expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and likelihood analyses and gene expression assays. Zebrafish were used to evaluate tissue-specific gene expression. Luciferase assays in HEK293 and HepG2 cells measured the effect of rs1967017 on transcription amplitude. Probabilistic Annotation Integrator analysis revealed rs1967017 as most likely to be causal and rs1967017 was an eQTL for PDZK1 in the intestine. The region harboring rs1967017 was capable of directly driving green fluorescent protein expression in the kidney, liver and intestine of zebrafish embryos, consistent with a conserved ability to confer tissue-specific expression. Small interfering RNA depletion of HNF4A reduced endogenous PDZK1 expression in HepG2 cells. Luciferase assays showed that the T allele of rs1967017 gains enhancer activity relative to the urate-decreasing C allele, with T allele enhancer activity abrogated by HNF4A depletion. HNF4A physically binds the rs1967017 region, suggesting direct transcriptional regulation of PDZK1 by HNF4A. Computational prediction of increased motif strength, together with our functional assays, suggests that the urate-increasing T allele of rs1967017 strengthens a binding site for the transcription factor HNF4A. Our and other data predict that the urate-raising T allele of rs1967017 enhances HNF4A binding to the PDZK1 promoter, thereby increasing PDZK1 expression. As PDZK1 is a scaffold protein for many ion channel transporters, increased expression can be predicted to increase activity of urate transporters and alter excretion of urate.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide chromatin annotations have permitted the mapping of putative regulatory elements across multiple human cell types. However, their experimental dissection by directed regulatory motif disruption has remained unfeasible at the genome scale. Here, we use a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to measure the transcriptional levels induced by 145-bp DNA segments centered on evolutionarily conserved regulatory motif instances within enhancer chromatin states. We select five predicted activators (HNF1, HNF4, FOXA, GATA, NFE2L2) and two predicted repressors (GFI1, ZFP161) and measure reporter expression in erythroleukemia (K562) and liver carcinoma (HepG2) cell lines. We test 2104 wild-type sequences and 3314 engineered enhancer variants containing targeted motif disruptions, each using 10 barcode tags and two replicates. The resulting data strongly confirm the enhancer activity and cell-type specificity of enhancer chromatin states, the ability of 145-bp segments to recapitulate both, the necessary role of regulatory motifs in enhancer function, and the complementary roles of activator and repressor motifs. We find statistically robust evidence that (1) disrupting the predicted activator motifs abolishes enhancer function, while silent or motif-improving changes maintain enhancer activity; (2) evolutionary conservation, nucleosome exclusion, binding of other factors, and strength of the motif match are predictive of enhancer activity; (3) scrambling repressor motifs leads to aberrant reporter expression in cell lines where the enhancers are usually inactive. Our results suggest a general strategy for deciphering cis-regulatory elements by systematic large-scale manipulation and provide quantitative enhancer activity measurements across thousands of constructs that can be mined to develop predictive models of gene expression.",

    "abstract": "MOTIVATION: NGS techniques have been widely applied in genetic and epigenetic studies. Multiple ChIP-seq and RNA-seq profiles can now be jointly used to infer functional regulatory networks (FRNs). However, existing methods suffer from either oversimplified assumption on transcription factor (TF) regulation or slow convergence of sampling for FRN inference from large-scale ChIP-seq and time-course RNA-seq data. RESULTS: We developed an efficient Bayesian integration method (CRNET) for FRN inference using a two-stage Gibbs sampler to estimate iteratively hidden TF activities and the posterior probabilities of binding events. A novel statistic measure that jointly considers regulation strength and regression error enables the sampling process of CRNET to converge quickly, thus making CRNET very efficient for large-scale FRN inference. Experiments on synthetic and benchmark data showed a significantly improved performance of CRNET when compared with existing methods. CRNET was applied to breast cancer data to identify FRNs functional at promoter or enhancer regions in breast cancer MCF-7 cells. Transcription factor MYC is predicted as a key functional factor in both promoter and enhancer FRNs. We experimentally validated the regulation effects of MYC on CRNET-predicted target genes using appropriate RNAi approaches in MCF-7 cells.

It is combined with a genetic algorithm to identify mutant regions/sites of the alcohol oxidase 1 promoter (P(AOX1)) from Pichia pastoris (P. pastoris). Consecutive fluorescent recognition and automatic sorting of the GFP-expressing library of core P(AOX1) were finished in a laboratory-designed microfluidic fluorescence-activated cell sorting (muFACS) system. The rigid muFACS chip was fabricated, achieving single-cell sorting and meeting the requirement of complicated sterilization with reduced volumes and improved cell throughput (7000 cells/s). After extensive exploration of the sorting parameters, P. pastoris with high-intensity P(AOX1) (5.3x improvement) was successfully screened and validated by a microplate reader. The mutant P(AOX1) was further applied for the biosynthesis of PD-L1-specific protein with a 30% increase in production, proving its effectiveness and feasibility.

Since promoters function as the switch for gene transcription, precisely identifying these regions is essential for fully annotating miRNA transcripts. Nonetheless, existing computational methods still have room for improvement in the characterization of promoter regions. Here, we present PmiProPred, an advanced tool designed for predicting plant miRNA promoters from a wide spectrum of genomes. It consists of two core components: multi-stream deep feature extraction (MsDFE) and multi-stream deep feature refinement (MsDFR). The MsDFE utilizes Transformer and CNN to gather multi-view features, while the MsDFR focuses on aligning and refining them using channel and spatial attention mechanisms. Ultimately, a multi-layer perceptron is employed to accomplish the miRNA promoter identification task. Across three independent testing datasets, PmiProPred achieves accuracies of 94.630%, 96.659%, and 92.480%, respectively, substantially surpassing the latest methods. Additionally, PmiProPred is employed to identify potential core promoters in the upstream 2-kb regions of intergenic miRNAs in five plant species. We further conduct cis-regulatory elements mining on the predicted promoters and perform an in-depth analysis of the identified motifs.

Through large-scale in vitro validation, we show that synthetic sequences are more effective at driving cell-type-specific expression in three cell lines compared with natural sequences from the human genome and achieve specificity in analogous tissues when tested in vivo. Synthetic sequences exhibit distinct motif vocabulary associated with activity in the on-target cell type and a simultaneous reduction in the activity of off-target cells.

Similarly, the effect of rare noncoding risk variants identified by whole genome sequencing on molecular traits is seldom known without functional assays. A massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) is an assay that can functionally validate thousands of regulatory elements simultaneously using high-throughput sequencing and barcode technology. MPRA has been adapted to various experimental designs that measure gene regulatory effects of genetic variants within cis- and trans-regulatory elements as well as posttranscriptional processes. This review discusses different MPRA designs that have been or could be used in the future to experimentally validate genetic variants associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. Though MPRA has limitations such as it does not model genomic context, this assay can help narrow down the underlying genetic causes of neurodevelopmental disorders by screening thousands of sequences in one experiment.

In the study of genomic cis-regulatory elements, generation of mice featuring transgenic reporters or cis-regulatory element knockout remains the standard approach. While the data obtained is of high quality, the approach is insufficient to keep pace with candidate identification and therefore results in biases introduced during the selection of candidates for validation. However, recent advances across a range of disciplines are converging to enable functional genomic assays that can be conducted in a high-throughput manner.

Massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) can measure regulatory activity of thousands of DNA sequences and their variants in a single experiment. With increasing number of publically available MPRA data sets, one can now develop data-driven models which, given a DNA sequence, predict its regulatory activity. Here, we performed a comprehensive meta-analysis of several MPRA data sets in a variety of cellular contexts. We first applied an ensemble of methods to predict MPRA output in each context and observed that the most predictive features are consistent across data sets. We then demonstrate that predictive models trained in one cellular context can be used to predict MPRA output in another, with loss of accuracy attributed to cell-type-specific features. Finally, we show that our approach achieves top performance in the Fifth Critical Assessment of Genome Interpretation \"Regulation Saturation\" Challenge for predicting effects of single-nucleotide variants. Overall, our analysis provides insights into how MPRA data can be leveraged to highlight functional regulatory regions throughout the genome and can guide effective design of future experiments by better prioritizing regions of interest.",

Nevertheless, designing high-throughput reporter assay experiments such as massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) and similar methods remains challenging. RESULTS: We introduce MPRAnator, a set of tools that facilitate rapid design of MPRA experiments. With MPRA Motif design, a set of variables provides fine control of how motifs are placed into sequences, thereby allowing the investigation of the rules that govern transcription factor (TF) occupancy. MPRA single-nucleotide polymorphism design can be used to systematically examine the functional effects of single or combinations of single-nucleotide polymorphisms at regulatory sequences. Finally, the Transmutation tool allows for the design of negative controls by permitting scrambling, reversing, complementing or introducing multiple random mutations in the input sequences or motifs.

    "abstract": "As researchers and clinicians seek to identify human genomic alterations relevant to traits and disorders, identifying and aggregating evidence providing mechanistic support for associations between alterations and phenotypes remains challenging. In particular, the study of non-coding genomic variation remains a major challenge due to the lack of accurate functional annotation for activity in a given context and across alleles. Experimental evidence is critical for prioritizing and interpreting functional effects of genetic alterations. Massively Parallel Reporter Assays (MPRAs) have emerged as a powerful high-throughput approach, enabling quantification of regulatory element activity and allelic effects, and systematic dissection of gene regulatory logic and variant effects across different contexts. However, the diversity of MPRA designs, lack of standardized formats, and many potential processing parameters hamper data integration, reproducibility, and meta-analyses across studies. To address these challenges, the Impact of Genomic Variation on Function (IGVF) Consortium established an MPRA focus group to develop community standards, including harmonized file formats, and robust analysis pipelines for a wide range of library types and experimental designs. Here, we present these formats and comprehensive computational tools, MPRAlib and MPRAsnakeflow, for uniform processing from raw sequencing reads to counts, processing and visualization. Using diverse MPRA datasets, we characterize technical variability sources including barcode sequence bias, outlier barcodes, and delivery method (episomal vs. lentiviral). Our results establish best practices for MPRA data generation and analysis, facilitating robust, reproducible research and large-scale integration. The presented tools and standards are publicly available, providing a foundation for future collaborative efforts in regulatory genomics.",

    "abstract": "Cis-regulatory elements (CREs) play a pivotal role in orchestrating interactions with trans-regulatory factors such as transcription factors, RNA-binding proteins, and noncoding RNAs. These interactions are fundamental to the molecular architecture underpinning complex and diverse biological functions in living organisms, facilitating a myriad of sophisticated and dynamic processes. The rapid advancement in the identification and characterization of these regulatory elements has been marked by initiatives such as the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project, which represents a significant milestone in the field. Concurrently, the development of CRE detection technologies, exemplified by massively parallel reporter assays, has progressed at an impressive pace, providing powerful tools for CRE discovery. The exponential growth of multimodal functional genomic data has necessitated the application of advanced analytical methods. Deep learning algorithms, particularly large language models, have emerged as invaluable tools for deconstructing the intricate nucleotide sequences governing CRE function. These advancements facilitate precise predictions of CRE activity and enable the de novo design of CREs. A deeper understanding of CRE operational dynamics is crucial for harnessing their versatile regulatory properties.

Consensus ARE motifs have been determined, but little is known about how differences in 3' UTR sequences that conform to these motifs affect their function. Here, we use functional annotation of sequences from 3' UTRs (fast-UTR), a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA), to investigate the effects of 41,288 3' UTR sequence fragments from 4653 transcripts on gene expression and mRNA stability in Jurkat and Beas2B cells. Our analyses demonstrate that the length of an ARE and its registration (the first and last nucleotides of the repeating ARE motif) have significant effects on gene expression and stability. Based on this finding, we propose improved ARE classification and concomitant methods to categorize and predict the effect of AREs on gene expression and stability. Finally, to investigate the advantages of our general experimental design we examine other motifs including constitutive decay elements (CDEs), where we show that the length of the CDE stem-loop has a significant impact on steady-state expression and mRNA stability. We conclude that fast-UTR, in conjunction with our analytical approach, can produce improved yet simple sequence-based rules for predicting the activity of human 3' UTRs.",

Massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs), which quantify the regulatory activity of large libraries of DNA sequences in parallel, are a powerful approach to characterize this relationship. We present MPRA-DragoNN, a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based framework to predict and interpret the regulatory activity of DNA sequences as measured by MPRAs. While our method is generally applicable to a variety of MPRA designs, here we trained our model on the Sharpr-MPRA dataset that measures the activity of  approximately 500,000 constructs tiling 15,720 regulatory regions in human K562 and HepG2 cell lines. MPRA-DragoNN predictions were moderately correlated (Spearman rho = 0.28) with measured activity and were within range of replicate concordance of the assay. State-of-the-art model interpretation methods revealed high-resolution predictive regulatory sequence features that overlapped transcription factor (TF) binding motifs. We used the model to investigate the cell type and chromatin state preferences of predictive TF motifs. We explored the ability of our model to predict the allelic effects of regulatory variants in an independent MPRA experiment and fine map putative functional SNPs in loci associated with lipid traits. Our results suggest that interpretable deep learning models trained on MPRA data have the potential to reveal meaningful patterns in regulatory DNA sequences and prioritize regulatory genetic variants, especially as larger, higher-quality datasets are produced.",

Despite their considerable importance, we currently lack simple tools to directly measure the activity of many TFs in parallel. Massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) allow the detection of TF activities in a multiplexed fashion; however, we lack basic understanding to rationally design sensitive reporters for many TFs. Here, we use an MPRA to systematically optimize transcriptional reporters for 86 TFs and evaluate the specificity of all reporters across a wide array of TF perturbation conditions. We thus identified critical TF reporter design features and obtained highly sensitive and specific reporters for 62 TFs, many of which outperform available reporters. The resulting collection of \"prime\" TF reporters can be used to uncover TF regulatory networks and to illuminate signaling pathways.

    "title": "Using individual barcodes to increase quantification power of massively parallel reporter assays.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) are an experimental technology for measuring the activity of thousands of candidate regulatory sequences or their variants in parallel, where the activity of individual sequences is measured from pools of sequence-tagged reporter genes. Activity is derived from the ratio of transcribed RNA to input DNA counts of associated tag sequences in each reporter construct, so-called barcodes. Recently, tools specifically designed to analyze MPRA data were developed that attempt to model the count data, accounting for its inherent variation. Of these tools, MPRAnalyze and mpralm are most widely used. MPRAnalyze models barcode counts to estimate the transcription rate of each sequence. While it has increased statistical power and robustness against outliers compared to mpralm, it is slow and has a high false discovery rate. Mpralm, a tool built on the R package Limma, estimates log fold-changes between different sequences. As opposed to MPRAnalyze, it is fast and has a low false discovery rate but is susceptible to outliers and has less statistical power. RESULTS: We propose BCalm, an MPRA analysis framework aimed at addressing the limitations of the existing tools. BCalm is an adaptation of mpralm, but models individual barcode counts instead of aggregating counts per sequence. Leaving out the aggregation step increases statistical power and improves robustness to outliers, while being fast and precise. We show the improved performance over existing methods on both simulated MPRA data and a lentiviral MPRA library of 166,508 target sequences, including 82,258 allelic variants. Further, BCalm adds functionality beyond the existing mpralm package, such as preparing count input files from MPRAsnakeflow, as well as an option to test for sequences with enhancing or repressing activity. Its built-in plotting functionalities allow for easy interpretation of the results. CONCLUSIONS: With BCalm, we provide a new tool for analyzing MPRA data which is robust and accurate on real MPRA datasets. The package is available at https://github.com/kircherlab/BCalm .",

Operational errors during these complex workflows can lead to substantial resource depletion and experimental delays. Thus robust and user-friendly quality control methods are essential to minimize experimental failures and ensure reproducibility between replicates. RESULTS: Here, we present esMPRA, an integrated quality control and analysis pipeline designed for MPRA experiments. Building on our experience in MPRA and its derivative techniques, coupled with systematic analysis of public MPRA datasets, we established standardized quality control metrics and developed a stepwise quality monitoring framework. esMPRA generates stage-specific diagnostic reports and provides experimental recommendations to avoid potential risks throughout the workflow. Designed for maximal accessibility, esMPRA features a one-line command-line interface and requires minimal bioinformatics expertise. Beyond quality assessment, the pipeline delivers processed data outputs, comprehensive analysis reports, and interface files compatible with downstream analyses, establishing an end-to-end solution for MPRA experimentation.

    "abstract": "The master tumor suppressor p53 controls transcription of a wide-ranging gene network involved in apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, DNA damage repair, and senescence. Recent studies revealed pervasive binding of p53 to cis-regulatory elements (CREs), which are non-coding segments of DNA that spatially and temporally control transcription through the combinatorial binding of local transcription factors. Although the role of p53 as a strong trans-activator of gene expression is well known, the co-regulatory factors and local sequences acting at p53-bound CREs are comparatively understudied. We designed and executed a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to investigate the effect of transcription factor binding motifs and local sequence context on p53-bound CRE activity. Our data indicate that p53-bound CREs are both positively and negatively affected by alterations in local sequence context and changes to co-regulatory TF motifs. Our data suggest p53 has the flexibility to cooperate with a variety of transcription factors in order to regulate CRE activity. By utilizing different sets of co-factors across CREs, we hypothesize that global p53 activity is guarded against loss of any one regulatory partner, allowing for dynamic and redundant control of p53-mediated transcription.",

However, computational efforts remain scant to evaluate and establish guidelines for sequence design strategies for perturbation MPRAs. In this study, we propose a framework for evaluating and comparing various perturbation strategies for MPRA experiments. Within this framework, we benchmark three different perturbation approaches from the perspectives of alteration in motif-based profiles, consistency of MPRA outputs, and robustness of models that predict the activities of putative regulatory motifs. While our analyses show very similar results across multiple benchmarking metrics, the predictive modeling for the approach involving random nucleotide shuffling shows significant robustness compared with the other two approaches. Thus, we recommend designing sequences by randomly shuffling the nucleotides of the perturbed site in perturbation-MPRA, followed by a coherence check to prevent the introduction of other variations of the target motifs. In summary, our evaluation framework and the benchmarking findings create a resource of computational pipelines and highlight the potential of perturbation-MPRA in predicting non-coding regulatory activities.",

    "abstract": "For the vast majority of genes in sequenced genomes, there is limited understanding of how they are regulated. Without such knowledge, it is not possible to perform a quantitative theory-experiment dialogue on how such genes give rise to physiological and evolutionary adaptation. One category of high-throughput experiments used to understand the sequence-phenotype relationship of the transcriptome is massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs). However, to improve the versatility and scalability of MPRAs, we need a \"theory of the experiment\" to help us better understand the impact of various biological and experimental parameters on the interpretation of experimental data. These parameters include binding site copy number, where a large number of specific binding sites may titrate away transcription factors, as well as the presence of overlapping binding sites, which may affect analysis of the degree of mutual dependence between mutations in the regulatory region and expression levels. To that end, in this paper we create tens of thousands of synthetic gene expression outputs for bacterial promoters using both equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium models. These models make it possible to imitate the summary statistics (information footprints and expression shift matrices) used to characterize the output of MPRAs and thus to infer the underlying regulatory architecture. Specifically, we use a more refined implementation of the so-called thermodynamic models in which the binding energies of each sequence variant are derived from energy matrices. Our simulations reveal important effects of the parameters on MPRA data and we demonstrate our ability to optimize MPRA experimental designs with the goal of generating thermodynamic models of the transcriptome with base-pair specificity. Further, this approach makes it possible to carefully examine the mapping between mutations in binding sites and their corresponding expression profiles, a tool useful not only for developing a theory of transcription, but also for exploring regulatory evolution.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: STARR-seq and other massively-parallel reporter assays are widely used to discover functional enhancers in transfected cell models, which can be confounded by plasmid vector-induced type-I interferon immune responses and lack the multicellular environment and endogenous chromatin state of complex mammalian tissues. RESULTS: We describe HDI-STARR-seq, which combines STARR-seq plasmid library delivery to the liver, by hydrodynamic tail vein injection (HDI), with reporter RNA transcriptional initiation driven by a minimal Albumin promoter, which we show is essential for mouse liver STARR-seq enhancer activity assayed 7 days after HDI. Importantly, little or no vector-induced innate type-I interferon responses were observed. Comparisons of HDI-STARR-seq activity between male and female mouse livers and in livers from males treated with an activating ligand of the transcription factor (TF) CAR (Nr1i3) identified many condition-dependent enhancers linked to condition-specific gene expression. Further, thousands of active liver enhancers were identified using a high complexity STARR-seq library comprised of ~ 50,000 genomic regions released by DNase-I digestion of mouse liver nuclei. When compared to stringently inactive library sequences, the active enhancer sequences identified were highly enriched for liver open chromatin regions with activating histone marks (H3K27ac, H3K4me1, H3K4me3), were significantly closer to gene transcriptional start sites, and were significantly depleted of repressive (H3K27me3, H3K9me3) and transcribed region histone marks (H3K36me3). CONCLUSION: HDI-STARR-seq offers substantial improvements over current methodologies for large scale, functional profiling of enhancers, including condition-dependent enhancers, in liver tissue in vivo, and can be adapted to characterize enhancer activities in a variety of species and tissues by selecting suitable tissue- and species-specific promoter sequences.",

    "abstract": "The integrative analysis of high-throughput reporter assays, machine learning, and profiles of epigenomic chromatin state in a broad array of cells and tissues has the potential to significantly improve our understanding of noncoding regulatory element function and its contribution to human disease. Here, we report results from the CAGI 5 regulation saturation challenge where participants were asked to predict the impact of nucleotide substitution at every base pair within five disease-associated human enhancers and nine disease-associated promoters. A library of mutations covering all bases was generated by saturation mutagenesis and altered activity was assessed in a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) in relevant cell lines. Reporter expression was measured relative to plasmid DNA to determine the impact of variants. The challenge was to predict the functional effects of variants on reporter expression. Comparative analysis of the full range of submitted prediction results identifies the most successful models of transcription factor binding sites, machine learning algorithms, and ways to choose among or incorporate diverse datatypes and cell-types for training computational models. These results have the potential to improve the design of future studies on more diverse sets of regulatory elements and aid the interpretation of disease-associated genetic variation.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Synthetic biology revolutionizes our ability to decode and recode genetic systems. The capability to reconstruct and flexibly manipulate multi-gene systems is critical for understanding cellular behaviors and has significant applications in therapeutics. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to construct a diverse library of synthetic tunable promoters (STPs) to enable flexible control of multi-gene expression in mammalian cells. METHODS: We designed and constructed synthetic tunable promoters (STPs) that incorporate both a universal activation site (UAS) and a specific activation site (SAS), enabling multi-level expression control via the CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) system. To evaluate promoter activity, we utilized Massively Parallel Reporter Assays (MPRA) to assess the basal strengths of the STPs and their activation responses. Next, we constructed a three-gene reporter system to assess the capacity of the synthetic promoters for achieving multilevel control of single-gene expression within multi-gene systems. RESULTS: The promoter library contains 24,960 unique non-redundant promoters with distinct sequence characteristics. MPRA revealed a wide range of promoter activities, showing different basal strengths and distinct activation levels when activated by the CRISPRa system. When regulated by targeting the SAS, the STPs exhibited orthogonality, allowing multilevel control of single-gene expression within multi-gene systems without cross-interference. Furthermore, the combinatorial activation of STPs in a multi-gene system enlarged the scope of expression levels achievable, providing fine-tuned control over gene expression. CONCLUSION: We provide a diverse collection of synthetic tunable promoters, offering a valuable toolkit for the construction and manipulation of multi-gene systems in mammalian cells, with applications in gene therapy and biotechnology.",

Mechanistic insight into the genetic factors moderating the impact of stress can increase our understanding of disease processes. Here, we test 3,662 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from preselected expression quantitative trait loci in massively parallel reporter assays to identify genetic variants that modulate the activity of regulatory elements sensitive to glucocorticoids, important mediators of the stress response. Of the tested SNP sequences, 547 were located in glucocorticoid-responsive regulatory elements of which 233 showed allele-dependent activity. Transcripts regulated by these functional variants were enriched for those differentially expressed in psychiatric disorders in the postmortem brain. Phenome-wide Mendelian randomization analysis in 4,439 phenotypes revealed potentially causal associations specifically in neurobehavioral traits, including major depression and other psychiatric disorders. Finally, a functional gene score derived from these variants was significantly associated with differences in the physiological stress response, suggesting that these variants may alter disease risk by moderating the individual set point of the stress response.",

    "abstract": "Most of the single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with insulin resistance (IR)-relevant phenotypes by genome-wide association studies (GWASs) are located in noncoding regions, complicating their functional interpretation. Here, we utilized an adapted STARR-seq to evaluate the regulatory activities of 5,987 noncoding SNPs associated with IR-relevant phenotypes. We identified 876 SNPs with biased allelic enhancer activity effects (baaSNPs) across 133 loci in three IR-relevant cell lines (HepG2, preadipocyte, and A673), which showed pervasive cell specificity and significant enrichment for cell-specific open chromatin regions or enhancer-indicative markers (H3K4me1, H3K27ac). Further functional characterization suggested several transcription factors (TFs) with preferential allelic binding to baaSNPs. We also incorporated multi-omics data to prioritize 102 candidate regulatory target genes for baaSNPs and revealed prevalent long-range regulatory effects and cell-specific IR-relevant biological functional enrichment on them. Specifically, we experimentally verified the distal regulatory mechanism at IRS1 locus, in which rs952227-A reinforces IRS1 expression by long-range chromatin interaction and preferential binding to the transcription factor HOXC6 to augment the enhancer activity. Finally, based on our STARR-seq screening data, we predicted the enhancer activity of 227,343 noncoding SNPs associated with IR-relevant phenotypes (fasting insulin adjusted for BMI, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides) from the largest available GWAS summary statistics. We further provided an open resource (http://www.bigc.online/fnSNP-IR) for better understanding genetic regulatory mechanisms of IR-relevant phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "The majority of the mouse genome is composed of non-coding regions, which harbor numerous regulatory sequences essential for gene regulation. While extensive research focuses on enhancers that activate gene expression, the role of silencers that repress gene expression remains less explored. In this study, the first genome-wide identification of silencers in the mouse genome is conducted. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and embryonic stem cells (mESCs), 89 596 and 115 165 silencers are identified, respectively. These silencers are ubiquitously distributed across the genome and are predominantly associated with low-expression genes. Additionally, these silencers are mainly cell-specific and function by binding to repressive transcription factors (TFs). Further, these silencers are notably enriched with the histone modification H3K9me3. It is observed that the transformation between dual-function silencers and enhancers is correlated with intracellular transcription factor concentrations, accompanied by changes in epigenetic modifications. In terms of biological effects, we have identified silencers that can enhance the induction efficiency of MEFs and influence the pluripotency of mESCs. Collectively, this work offers the first comprehensive silencer landscape in the mouse genome and provides strong evidence for the role of silencers in the induction of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs).",

However, few hormone-dependent enhancers have been characterized, and important aspects of their sequence architecture, cell-type-specific activating and repressing functions, or the regulatory roles of their chromatin structure have remained unclear. We used STARR-seq, a recently developed enhancer-screening assay, and ecdysone signaling in two different Drosophila cell types to derive genome-wide hormone-dependent enhancer-activity maps. We demonstrate that enhancer activation depends on cis-regulatory motif combinations that differ between cell types and can predict cell-type-specific ecdysone targeting. Activated enhancers are often not accessible prior to induction. Enhancer repression following hormone treatment seems independent of receptor motifs and receptor binding to the enhancer, as we show using ChIP-seq, but appears to rely on motifs for other factors, including Eip74. Our strategy is applicable to study signal-dependent enhancers for different pathways and across organisms.",

By coupling such approaches with a high-throughput enhancer screen (self-transcribing active regulatory region sequencing (STARR-seq)), we assembled a functional cis-regulome for lipopolysaccharide-activated B cells. Functional enhancers, in contrast with accessible chromatin regions that lack enhancer activity, were enriched for enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) and preferentially interacted in vivo with B cell lineage-determining transcription factors. Interestingly, preferential combinatorial binding by these transcription factors was not associated with differential enrichment of their sites. Instead, active enhancers were resolved by principal component analysis (PCA) from all accessible regions by co-varying transcription factor motif scores involving a distinct set of signaling-induced transcription factors. High-resolution chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) analysis revealed multiplex, activated enhancer-promoter configurations encompassing numerous multi-enhancer genes and multi-genic enhancers engaged in the control of divergent molecular pathways. Motif analysis of pathway-specific enhancers provides a catalog of diverse transcription factor codes for biological processes encompassing B cell activation, cycling and differentiation.",

The model learned relevant TF motifs and higher-order syntax rules, including functionally nonequivalent instances of the same TF motif that are determined by motif-flanking sequence and intermotif distances. We validated these rules experimentally and demonstrated that they can be generalized to humans by testing more than 40,000 wildtype and mutant Drosophila and human enhancers.

The rapid advancement in the identification and characterization of these regulatory elements has been marked by initiatives such as the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project, which represents a significant milestone in the field. Concurrently, the development of CRE detection technologies, exemplified by massively parallel reporter assays, has progressed at an impressive pace, providing powerful tools for CRE discovery. The exponential growth of multimodal functional genomic data has necessitated the application of advanced analytical methods. Deep learning algorithms, particularly large language models, have emerged as invaluable tools for deconstructing the intricate nucleotide sequences governing CRE function. These advancements facilitate precise predictions of CRE activity and enable the de novo design of CREs. A deeper understanding of CRE operational dynamics is crucial for harnessing their versatile regulatory properties.

The design and optimization of functional promoters is crucial for enhancing metabolic pathway construction and advancing gene therapy.

Here, we propose a novel promoter design method, PromoDGDE, to design promoters with desirable expression levels and apply it to the promoter design of Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It uses Diffusion-GAN to learn the feature distribution of natural sequences and generate new promoters. Then, reinforcement learning and evolutionary algorithms are combined to dynamically optimize the synthetic sequences. In silico analyze results demonstrate that PromoDGDE outperforms existing methods, generating promoters that not only possess biological significance but also achieve the intended function. In vivo experiment results demonstrate that the synthetic promoters exhibit expression activity, with over 60% of the sequences showing the expected regulatory effects. These results confirm the practical effectiveness of PromoDGDE and demonstrate its ability to provide an efficient and flexible solution for complex design needs in synthetic biology.",

Evaluation of maize HapMap3 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) by PhytoExpr demonstrates an enrichment of predicted high-impact SNPs in cis-eQTL. Additionally, we provided two algorithms that harnessed the power of PhytoExpr in designing functional cis-regulatory variants, and de novo creation of species-specific cis-regulatory sequences through in silico evolution of random DNA sequences.

    "abstract": "Engineered promoters are key components that allow engineered expression of genes in the cell-factory design. Promoters having exceptional strength are attractive candidates for designing metabolic engineering strategies for tailoring de novo production strategies that require directed evolution methods by engineering with de novo synthetic biology tools. Engineered promoter variants (EPVs) of naturally occurring promoters (NOPs) can be designed using metabolic engineering strategies and synthetic biology tools if the genes encoding the activating transcription factors (TFs) exist in the genome and are expressed and synthesized at non-limiting concentrations within the cell. The hybrid-architectured EPV design method targets an essential and predetermined part of the general transcription machinery. That is cis-acting DNA site(s) in coordination with the trans-acting factor(s) that must bind for the regulated transcription machinery activation. The method needs genomic and functional information that can lead to the discovery of the master TF(s) and synthetic cis-acting DNA elements, enabling the engineering of binding of master regulator TF(s). The method aims to generate EPVs that combine the advantages of being an exceptional stronger EPV(s) than the NOPs and permit \"green-and-clean production\" on a non-toxic carbon source, such as ethanol or glucose.

Microorganisms screened from their natural environment usually suffer from low productivity, low stress resistance, and accumulation of by-products. In order to overcome these disadvantages, rational engineering of microorganisms to achieve specific industrial goals has become routine. Rapid development of metabolic engineering and synthetic biology strategies provide novel methods to improve the performance of industrial microorganisms. Rational regulation of gene expression by specific promoters is essential to engineer industrial microorganisms for high-efficiency production of target chemicals. Identification, modification, and application of suitable promoters could provide powerful switches at the transcriptional level for fine-tuning of a single gene or a group of genes, which are essential for the reconstruction of pathways. In this review, the characteristics of promoters from eukaryotic, prokaryotic, and archaea microorganisms are briefly introduced. Identification of promoters based on both traditional biochemical and systems biology routes are summarized. Besides rational modification, de novo design of promoters to achieve gradient, dynamic, and logic gate regulation are also introduced. Furthermore, flexible application of static and dynamic promoters for the rational engineering of industrial microorganisms is highlighted.

To advance gene therapy as a viable treatment for AMD there is a need for technologies that enable controlled, RPE-specific expression of therapeutic genes. Here we describe design, construction and testing of compact synthetic promoters with a pre-defined transcriptional activity and RPE cell specificity. Initial comparative informatic analyses of RPE and photoreceptor (PR) cell transcriptomic data identified conserved and overrepresented transcription factor regulatory elements (TFREs, 8-19 bp) specifically associated with transcriptionally active RPE genes. Both RPE-specific TFREs and those derived from the generically active cytomegalovirus-immediate early (CMV-IE) promoter were then screened in vitro to identify sequence elements able to control recombinant gene transcription in model induced pluripotent stem (iPS)-derived and primary human RPE cells. Two libraries of heterotypic synthetic promoters varying in predicted RPE specificity and transcriptional activity were designed de novo using combinations of up to 20 discrete TFREs in series (323-602 bp) and their transcriptional activity in model RPE cells was compared to that of the endogenous BEST1 promoter (661 bp, plus an engineered derivative) and the highly active generic CMV-IE promoter (650 bp). Synthetic promoters with a highpredicted specificity, comprised predominantly of endogenous TFREs exhibited a range of activities up to 8-fold that of the RPE-specific BEST1 gene promoter. Moreover, albeit at a lower predicted specificity, synthetic promoter transcriptional activity in model RPE cells was enhanced beyond that of the CMV-IE promoter when viral elements were utilized in combination with endogenous RPE-specific TFREs, with a reduction in promoter size of 15%. Taken together, while our data reveal an inverse relationship between synthetic promoter activity and cell-type specificity, cell context-specific control of recombinant gene transcriptional activity may be achievable.",

MB-16, an 11 kDa de novo protein enriched in the essential amino acids (EAAs) methionine, threonine, lysine and leucine, was originally developed for expression in rumen bacteria. For efficient seed expression, constructs were designed using the soybean codon bias, with and without the KDEL ER retention sequence, and beta-conglycinin or cruciferin seed specific protein storage promoters. Homozygous lines, with single locus integrations, were identified for several transgenic events. Transgene transmission and MB-16 protein expression were confirmed to the T5 and T7 generations, respectively. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of developing seed showed that the transcript peaked in growing seed, 5-6 mm long, remained at this peak level to the full-sized green seed and then was significantly reduced in maturing yellow seed. Transformed events carrying constructs with the rumen bacteria codon preference showed the same transcription pattern as those with the soybean codon preference, but the transcript levels were lower at each developmental stage. MB-16 protein levels, as determined by immunoblots, were highest in full-sized green seed but the protein virtually disappeared in mature seed. However, amino acid analysis of mature seed, in the best transgenic line, showed a significant increase of 16.2 and 65.9 % in methionine and cysteine, respectively, as compared to the parent. This indicates that MB-16 elevated the sulfur amino acids, improved the EAA seed profile and confirms that a de novo synthetic gene can enhance the nutritional quality of soybean.",

    "abstract": "Enhancers serve as pivotal regulators of gene expression throughout various biological processes by interacting with transcription factors (TFs). While transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) are widely acknowledged as key determinants of TF binding and enhancer activity, the significant role of their surrounding context sequences remains to be quantitatively characterized. Here we propose the concept of transcription factor binding unit (TFBU) to modularly model enhancers by quantifying the impact of context sequences surrounding TFBSs using deep learning models. Based on this concept, we develop DeepTFBU, a comprehensive toolkit for enhancer design. We demonstrate that designing TFBS context sequences can significantly modulate enhancer activities and produce cell type-specific responses. DeepTFBU is also highly efficient in the de novo design of enhancers containing multiple TFBSs. Furthermore, DeepTFBU enables flexible decoupling and optimization of generalized enhancers. We prove that TFBU is a crucial concept, and DeepTFBU is highly effective for rational enhancer design.",

    "abstract": "Engineered promoters are key components in the cell-factory design, allowing precise and enhanced expression of genes. Promoters having exceptional strength are attractive candidates for designing metabolic engineering strategies for tailoring de novo production strategies that require directed evolution methods by engineering with de novo synthetic biology tools. Here, the custom-designed AOX1 hybrid-promoter architectures in coordination with targeted transcription factors are shown, transcriptionally rewired the expression over methanol-free substrate-utilization pathway(s) and converted methanol-dependent Pichia pastoris alcohol oxidase 1(AOX1) promoter (P(AOX1) ) expression into a non-toxic carbon-source-regulated system. AOX1 promoter variants are engineered by replacing specified cis-regulatory DNA elements with synthetic Adr1, Cat8, and Aca2 cis-acting DNA elements for Mxr1, Cat8, and Aca1 binding, respectively. Applications of the engineered-promoters are validated for eGFP expression and extracellular human serum albumin production. The hybrid-promoter architecture designed with single Cat8 cis-acting DNA element deregulates the expression on ethanol. Compared with P(AOX1) on methanol, the expression on ethanol is increased with i) P(AOX1/Cat8-L3) (designed with single Cat8 cis-acting element) to 74%, ii) P(AOX1/Adr1-L3/Cat8-L3) (designed with single- Cat8 and Adr1 cis-acting elements) to 85%, and for further consolidation of deregulated expression iii) P(eAOX1) (designed with triplet- Cat8 and Adr1 cis-acting elements) 1.30-fold, at t = 20 h of batch cultivations.",

Transcriptional activator-like effectors (TALEs) represent attractive components of synthetic gene regulatory circuits, as they can be designed de novo to target a given DNA sequence. We here demonstrate that TALEs can perform Boolean logic computation in mammalian cells. Using a split-intein protein-splicing strategy, we show that a functional TALE can be reconstituted from two inactive parts, thus generating two-input AND logic computation. We further demonstrate three-piece intein splicing in mammalian cells and use it to perform three-input AND computation. Using methods for random as well as targeted insertion of these relatively large genetic circuits, we show that TALE-based logic circuits are functional when integrated into the genome of mouse embryonic stem cells. Comparing construct variants in the same genomic context, we modulated the strength of the TALE-responsive promoter to improve the output of these circuits. Our work establishes split TALEs as a tool for building logic computation with the potential of controlling expression of endogenous genes or transgenes in response to a combination of cellular signals.",

However, the regulatory codes of enhancers that confer tissue-specific expression in plants remain largely unexplored. Using massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) in tomato tissues, we tested the enhancer activity of 11,180 promoter fragments derived from fruit-specific genes. We discovered 2,436 active fruit enhancer sequences, a subset of which showed differential activity between fruit and leaves, suggesting that they can drive fruit-specific gene expression in tomato. We dissected the sequence determinants of fruit enhancers using deep learning. Guided by the regulatory rules learned from our MPRA dataset, we designed synthetic enhancers and experimentally validated their ability to specifically target tomato fruit. Our study provides a comprehensive landscape of functional enhancers in tomato fruit, facilitating the de novo design of synthetic enhancers for tissue-specific gene expression in plants.",

Here, we designed synthetic TALEs that bind to the flanking regions of the TATA-box motif on the CaMV 35S promoter for the purpose of understanding the engineerable 'hot-spots' for increasing transgene expression. We demonstrated that transient expression of de novo-engineered TALEs using agroinfiltration could significantly increase reporter gene expression in stable transgenic tobacco expressing the orange fluorescent protein reporter gene pporRFP under the control of synthetic inducible, minimal or full-length 35S promoters. Moreover, the additive effects of a combination of two different synthetic TALEs could significantly enhance the activation effects of TALEs on reporter gene expression more than when each TALE was used individually. We also studied the effects of the C-terminal domain and the activation domain of synthetic TALEs, as well as the best 'hot-spots' on the 35S promoter on targeted transgene activation. Furthermore, TALE activation of the Arabidopsis MYB transcription factor AtPAP1 (PRODUCTION OF ANTHOCYANIN PIGMENT 1) in stable transgenic tobacco gave rise to a dark purple colour on infiltrated leaves when driven by four copies of cis-regulatory elements of pathogenesis-related gene (PR1) with enhancer motifs B and A1 from the 35S promoter. These results provide novel insights into the potential applications of synthetic TALEs for targeted gene activation of transgenes in plants.",

    "abstract": "Gene therapy is a promising emerging therapeutic modality for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases and hereditary diseases that afflict the heart. Hence, there is a need to develop robust cardiac-specific expression modules that allow for stable expression of the gene of interest in cardiomyocytes. We therefore explored a new approach based on a genome-wide bioinformatics strategy that revealed novel cardiac-specific cis-acting regulatory modules (CS-CRMs). These transcriptional modules contained evolutionary-conserved clusters of putative transcription factor binding sites that correspond to a \"molecular signature\" associated with robust gene expression in the heart. We then validated these CS-CRMs in vivo using an adeno-associated viral vector serotype 9 that drives a reporter gene from a quintessential cardiac-specific alpha-myosin heavy chain promoter. Most de novo designed CS-CRMs resulted in a >10-fold increase in cardiac gene expression. The most robust CRMs enhanced cardiac-specific transcription 70- to 100-fold. Expression was sustained and restricted to cardiomyocytes. We then combined the most potent CS-CRM4 with a synthetic heart and muscle-specific promoter (SPc5-12) and obtained a significant 20-fold increase in cardiac gene expression compared to the cytomegalovirus promoter. This study underscores the potential of rational vector design to improve the robustness of cardiac gene therapy.",

Here, to address this issue and improve the reusability of genetic elements, we developed a bicistronic expression cassette in Corynebacterium glutamicum based on a leaderless promoter lacking a 5'UTR. The created leaderless bicistronic design (BCD) significantly improved the orthogonality of expression elements across different genes of interest. We also explored the importance of the fore-cistron and SD motif in maintaining the strength of leaderless BCDs. Additionally, we established a library containing 55,901 fore-cistrons and demonstrated that the regulatory range of gene expression in leaderless BCDs can be broader by modifying the fore-cistron sequence. This study provides a novel synthetic biology tool based on leaderless BCD for fine-tuning gene expression in C. glutamicum using fore-cistrons. Moreover, the strategy developed here can also be applied to improve the performance of other leaderless promoters in other bacteria.",

Synthetic promoters are versatile and can drive gene expression accurately with smart responses; they show potential for enhancing desirable traits in crops, thereby improving crop yield, nutritional quality, and food security.

    "title": "Orthogonal control of gene expression in plants using synthetic promoters and CRISPR-based transcription factors.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The construction and application of synthetic genetic circuits is frequently improved if gene expression can be orthogonally controlled, relative to the host. In plants, orthogonality can be achieved via the use of CRISPR-based transcription factors that are programmed to act on natural or synthetic promoters. The construction of complex gene circuits can require multiple, orthogonal regulatory interactions, and this in turn requires that the full programmability of CRISPR elements be adapted to non-natural and non-standard promoters that have few constraints on their design. Therefore, we have developed synthetic promoter elements in which regions upstream of the minimal 35S CaMV promoter are designed from scratch to interact via programmed gRNAs with dCas9 fusions that allow activation of gene expression. RESULTS: A panel of three, mutually orthogonal promoters that can be acted on by artificial gRNAs bound by CRISPR regulators were designed. Guide RNA expression targeting these promoters was in turn controlled by either Pol III (U6) or ethylene-inducible Pol II promoters, implementing for the first time a fully artificial Orthogonal Control System (OCS). Following demonstration of the complete orthogonality of the designs, the OCS was tied to cellular metabolism by putting gRNA expression under the control of an endogenous plant signaling molecule, ethylene. The ability to form complex circuitry was demonstrated via the ethylene-driven, ratiometric expression of fluorescent proteins in single plants. CONCLUSIONS: The design of synthetic promoters is highly generalizable to large tracts of sequence space, allowing Orthogonal Control Systems of increasing complexity to potentially be generated at will. The ability to tie in several different basal features of plant molecular biology (Pol II and Pol III promoters, ethylene regulation) to the OCS demonstrates multiple opportunities for engineering at the system level. Moreover, given the fungibility of the core 35S CaMV promoter elements, the derived synthetic promoters can potentially be utilized across a variety of plant species.",

    "abstract": "Control of gene expression is crucial to optimize metabolic pathways and synthetic gene networks. Promoters and terminators are stretches of DNA upstream and downstream (respectively) of genes that control both the rate at which the gene is transcribed and the rate at which mRNA is degraded. As a result, both of these elements control net protein expression from a synthetic construct. Thus, it is highly important to discover and engineer promoters and terminators with desired characteristics. This chapter highlights various approaches taken to catalogue these important synthetic elements. Specifically, early strategies have focused largely on semi-rational techniques such as saturation mutagenesis to diversify native promoters and terminators. Next, in an effort to reduce the length of the synthetic biology design cycle, efforts in the field have turned towards the rational design of synthetic promoters and terminators. In this vein, we cover recently developed methods such as hybrid engineering, high throughput characterization, and thermodynamic modeling which allow finer control in the rational design of novel promoters and terminators. Emphasis is placed on the methodologies used and this chapter showcases the utility of these methods across multiple host organisms.",

    "abstract": "Promoter strength, or activity, is important in genetic engineering and synthetic biology. A constitutive promoter with a certain strength for one given RNA can often be reused for other RNAs. Therefore, the strength of one promoter is mainly determined by its nucleotide sequence. One of the main difficulties in genetic engineering and synthetic biology is how to control the expression of a certain protein at a given level. One usually used way to achieve this goal is to choose one promoter with a suitable strength which can be employed to regulate the rate of transcription, which then leads to the required level of protein expression. For this purpose, so far, many promoter libraries have been established experimentally. However, theoretical methods to predict the strength of one promoter from its nucleotide sequence are desirable. Such methods are not only valuable in the design of promoter with specified strength, but also meaningful to understand the mechanism of promoter in gene transcription. In this study, through various tests, a theoretical model is presented to describe the relationship between promoter strength and nucleotide sequence. Our analysis shows that promoter strength is greatly influenced by nucleotide groups with three adjacent nucleotides in their sequences. Meanwhile, nucleotides in different regions of promoter sequence have different effects on promoter strength. Based on experimental data for E. coli promoters, our calculations indicate that nucleotides in the -10 region, the -35 region, and the discriminator region of a promoter sequence are more important for determining promoter strength than those in the spacing region. With model parameter values obtained by fitting to experimental data, four promoter libraries are theoretically built for the corresponding experimental environments under which data for promoter strength in gene expression has been measured previously.",

Members of the Acetobacteraceae family of Gram-negative bacteria form an attractive class of nonmodel microorganisms that can be exploited to produce industrial chemicals, food and beverage, and biomaterials. One such biomaterial is bacterial cellulose, which is a strong and ultrapure natural polymer used in tissue engineering scaffolds, wound dressings, electronics, food additives, and other products. However, despite the potential of Acetobacteraceae in biotechnology, there has been considerably little effort to fundamentally reprogram the bacteria for enhanced performance. One limiting factor is the lack of a well-characterized, comprehensive toolkit to control expression of genes in biosynthetic pathways and regulatory networks to optimize production and cell viability. Here, we address this shortcoming by building an expanded genetic toolkit for synthetic biology applications in Acetobacteraceae. We characterized the performance of multiple natural and synthetic promoters, ribosome binding sites, terminators, and degradation tags in three different strains, namely, Gluconacetobacter xylinus ATCC 700178, Gluconacetobacter hansenii ATCC 53582, and Komagataeibacter rhaeticus iGEM. Our quantitative data revealed strain-specific and common design rules for the precise control of gene expression in these industrially relevant bacterial species. We further applied our tools to synthesize a biodegradable cellulose-chitin copolymer, adjust the structure of the cellulose film produced, and implement CRISPR interference for ready down-regulation of gene expression. Collectively, our genetic parts will enable the efficient engineering of Acetobacteraceae bacteria for the biomanufacturing of cellulose-based materials and other commercially valuable products.",

A review of the synthetic promoters developed in planta would help researchers utilize the available resources and design new promoters to benefit fundamental research and agricultural applications. The demand for promoters for the improvement and application of transgenic techniques in research and agricultural production is increasing. Native/naturally occurring promoters have some limitations in terms of their induction conditions, transcription efficiency and size. The strength and specificity of native promoter can be tailored by manipulating its 'cis-architecture' by the use of several recombinant DNA technologies. Newly derived chimeric promoters with specific attributes are emerging as an efficient tool for plant molecular biology. In the last three decades, synthetic promoters have been used to regulate plant gene expression. To better understand synthetic promoters, in this article, we reviewed promoter structure, the scope of cis-engineering, strategies for their development, their importance in plant biology and the total number of such promoters (188) developed in planta to date; we then categorized them under different functional regimes as biotic stress-inducible, abiotic stress-inducible, light-responsive, chemical-inducible, hormone-inducible, constitutive and tissue-specific. Furthermore, we identified a set of 36 synthetic promoters that control multiple types of expression in planta. Additionally, we illustrated the differences between native and synthetic promoters and among different synthetic promoter in each group, especially in terms of efficiency and induction conditions. As a prospective of this review, the use of ideal synthetic promoters is one of the prime requirements for generating transgenic plants suitable for promoting sustainable agriculture and plant molecular farming.",

Over the last years, the demand to expand the molecular toolbox for T. reesei to facilitate genetic engineering and improve the production of heterologous proteins grew. An important instrument to modify the expression of key genes are promoters to initiate and control their transcription. To date, the most commonly used promoter for T. reesei is the strong inducible promoter of the main cellobiohydrolase cel7a. Beside this one, there is a number of alternative inducible promoters derived from other cellulase- and xylanase encoding genes and a few constitutive promoters.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Synthetic biology revolutionizes our ability to decode and recode genetic systems. The capability to reconstruct and flexibly manipulate multi-gene systems is critical for understanding cellular behaviors and has significant applications in therapeutics. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to construct a diverse library of synthetic tunable promoters (STPs) to enable flexible control of multi-gene expression in mammalian cells. METHODS: We designed and constructed synthetic tunable promoters (STPs) that incorporate both a universal activation site (UAS) and a specific activation site (SAS), enabling multi-level expression control via the CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) system. To evaluate promoter activity, we utilized Massively Parallel Reporter Assays (MPRA) to assess the basal strengths of the STPs and their activation responses. Next, we constructed a three-gene reporter system to assess the capacity of the synthetic promoters for achieving multilevel control of single-gene expression within multi-gene systems. RESULTS: The promoter library contains 24,960 unique non-redundant promoters with distinct sequence characteristics. MPRA revealed a wide range of promoter activities, showing different basal strengths and distinct activation levels when activated by the CRISPRa system. When regulated by targeting the SAS, the STPs exhibited orthogonality, allowing multilevel control of single-gene expression within multi-gene systems without cross-interference. Furthermore, the combinatorial activation of STPs in a multi-gene system enlarged the scope of expression levels achievable, providing fine-tuned control over gene expression. CONCLUSION: We provide a diverse collection of synthetic tunable promoters, offering a valuable toolkit for the construction and manipulation of multi-gene systems in mammalian cells, with applications in gene therapy and biotechnology.",

We designed a simple control algorithm to automatically regulate the administration of inducer molecules to the cells by comparing the actual protein expression level in the cell population with the desired expression level. We then built an automated platform based on a microfluidic device, a time-lapse microscopy apparatus, and a set of motorized syringes, all controlled by a computer. We tested the platform to force yeast cells to express a desired fixed, or time-varying, amount of a reporter protein over thousands of minutes. The computer automatically switched the type of sugar administered to the cells, its concentration and its duration, according to the control algorithm. Our approach can be used to control expression of any protein, fused to a fluorescent reporter, provided that an external molecule known to (indirectly) affect its promoter activity is available.",

    "abstract": "Precise control of gene expression using an artificial gene circuit is a major challenge in the application of synthetic biology. Here, we designed a hypoxia-responsive transgene expression system by combining a hypoxia-inducible RTP801 promoter and a tetracycline-responsive transactivator fused with an oxygen-dependent degradation domain (TA-ODD). The reporter gene expression was highly induced by hypoxia when a transactivator-expression plasmid, pRTP801/TA-ODD, harboring a TA-ODD gene driven by the RTP801 promoter, was cotransfected with a reporter plasmid, pTRE/EGFP, harboring an EGFP gene controlled under the transactivator-responsive promoter. A stable cell line into which the expression units RTP801/TA-ODD and TRE/EGFP had been introduced responded to hypoxia and expressed the reporter gene in an oxygen-concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, the cells demonstrated potential as sensors to detect hypoxic conditions in a three-dimensional tissue culture in vitro. These results indicate that the hypoxia-responsive transgene expression system is useful for constructing cell-based hypoxia detection systems.",

    "abstract": "Design of de novo synthetic regulatory DNA is a promising avenue to control gene expression in biotechnology and medicine. Using mutagenesis typically requires screening sizable random DNA libraries, which limits the designs to span merely a short section of the promoter and restricts their control of gene expression. Here, we prototype a deep learning strategy based on generative adversarial networks (GAN) by learning directly from genomic and transcriptomic data. Our ExpressionGAN can traverse the entire regulatory sequence-expression landscape in a gene-specific manner, generating regulatory DNA with prespecified target mRNA levels spanning the whole gene regulatory structure including coding and adjacent non-coding regions. Despite high sequence divergence from natural DNA, in vivo measurements show that 57% of the highly-expressed synthetic sequences surpass the expression levels of highly-expressed natural controls. This demonstrates the applicability and relevance of deep generative design to expand our knowledge and control of gene expression regulation in any desired organism, condition or tissue.",

    "abstract": "Inducible promoters are essential for precise control of target gene expression in synthetic biological systems. However, engineering eukaryotic promoters is often more challenging than engineering prokaryotic promoters due to their greater mechanistic complexity. In this study, we describe a simple and reliable approach for constructing strongly inducible synthetic promoters with minimum leakiness in yeasts. The results indicate that the leakiness of yeast-inducible synthetic promoters is primarily the result of cryptic transcriptional activation of heterologous sequences that may be avoided by appropriate insulation and operator mutagenesis. Our promoter design approach has successfully generated robust, inducible promoters that achieve a > 10(3)-fold induction in reporter gene expression. The utility of these promoters is demonstrated by using them to produce various biologics with titers up to 2 g/L, including antigens designed to raise specific antibodies against a SARS-CoV-2 omicron variant through chicken immunization.",

Following an initial non-functional design, we optimize expression of pathway genes, enhance PCB production via a translational fusion of the biosynthetic enzymes, engineer a strong chimeric output promoter, and increase dynamic range with a miniaturized photosensor kinase. Our final design exhibits over 70-fold activation and rapid response dynamics, making it well-suited to studying a wide range of gene regulatory processes.

    "abstract": "The design and development of synthetic biology applications in a workflow often involve connecting modular components. Whereas computer-aided design tools are picking up in synthetic biology as in other areas of engineering, the methods for verifying the correct functioning of living technologies are still in their infancy. Especially, fine-tuning for the right promoter strength to match the design specifications is often a lengthy and expensive experimental process. In particular, the relationship between signal fidelity and noise in synthetic promoter design can be a key parameter that can affect the healthy functioning of the engineered organism. To this end, based on our previous work on synthetic promoters for the E. coli PhoBR two-component system, we make a case for using chemical reaction network models for computational verification of various promoter designs before a lab implementation. We provide an analysis of this system with extensive stochastic simulations at a single-cell level to assess the signal fidelity and noise relationship. We then show how quasi-steady-state analysis via ordinary differential equations can be used to navigate between models with different levels of detail. We compare stochastic simulations with our full and reduced models by using various metrics for assessing noise. Our analysis suggests that strong promoters with low unbinding rates can act as control tools for filtering out intrinsic noise in the PhoBR context. Our results confirm that even simpler models can be used to determine promoters with specific signal to noise characteristics.",

    "abstract": "When expressing complex biotherapeutic proteins, traditional expression plasmids and methods may not always yield sufficient levels of high-quality product. High-strength viral promoters commonly used for recombinant protein (rProtein) production in mammalian cells allow for maximal expression, but provide limited scope to alter their transcription dynamics. However, synthetic promoters designed to provide tunable transcriptional activity offer a plasmid engineering approach to more precisely regulate product quality, yield or to reduce product related contaminants. We substituted the viral promoter CMV with synthetic promoters that offer different transcriptional activities to express our gene of interest in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Stable pools were established and the benefits of regulating transgene transcription on the quality of biotherapeutics were examined in stable pool fed-batch overgrow experiments. Specific control of gene expression of the heavy chain (HC):light chain (LC) of a Fab, and the ratio between the two HCs in a Duet mAb reduced levels of aberrant protein contaminants; and the controlled expression of the helper gene XBP-1s improved expression of a difficult-to-express mAb. This synthetic promoter technology benefits applications that require custom activity. Our work highlights the advantages of employing synthetic promoters for production of more complex rProteins.",

Small-molecule drugs that induce high cGMP levels in specialized tissues by boosting GC activity or inhibiting PDE activity have become the predominant treatment strategy for a wide range of medical conditions, including congestive heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, atherosclerosis-based claudication and erectile dysfunction. By fusing the cGMP receptor protein (CRP) of Rhodospirillum centenum to the Herpes simplex-derived transactivation domain VP16, we created a novel synthetic mammalian cGMP-sensing transcription factor (GTA) that activates synthetic promoters (PGTA) containing newly identified GTA-specific operator sites in a concentration-dependent manner. In cell lines expressing endogenous natriuretic peptide receptor A (NPR-A) (HeLa), GTA/PGTA-driven transgene expression was induced by B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP; Nesiritide((R))) in a concentration-dependent manner, which activated NPR-A׳s intracellular GC domain and triggered a corresponding cGMP surge. Ectopic expression of NPR-A in NPR-A-negative cell lines (HEK-293T) produced high cGMP levels and mediated maximum GTA/PGTA-driven transgene expression, which was suppressed by co-expression of PDEs (PDE-3A, PDE-5A and PDE-9A) and was re-triggered by the corresponding PDE inhibitor drugs (Pletal((R)), Perfan((R)), Primacor((R)) (PDE-3A), Viagra((R)), Levitra((R)), Cialis((R)) (PDE-5A) and BAY73-6691 (PDE-9A)). Mice implanted with microencapsulated designer cells co-expressing the GTA/PGTA device with NPR-A and PDE-5A showed control of blood SEAP levels through administration of sildenafil (Viagra((R))).

    "abstract": "A grand challenge in synthetic biology is to push the design of biomolecular circuits from purely genetic constructs towards systems that interface different levels of the cellular machinery, including signalling networks and metabolic pathways. In this paper, we focus on a genetic circuit for feedback regulation of unbranched metabolic pathways. The objective of this feedback system is to dampen the effect of flux perturbations caused by changes in cellular demands or by engineered pathways consuming metabolic intermediates. We consider a mathematical model for a control circuit with an operon architecture, whereby the expression of all pathway enzymes is transcriptionally repressed by the metabolic product. We address the existence and stability of the steady state, the dynamic response of the network under perturbations, and their dependence on common tuneable knobs such as the promoter characteristic and ribosome binding site (RBS) strengths. Our analysis reveals trade-offs between the steady state of the enzymes and the intermediates, together with a separation principle between promoter and RBS design. We show that enzymatic saturation imposes limits on the parameter design space, which must be satisfied to prevent metabolite accumulation and guarantee the stability of the network. The use of promoters with a broad dynamic range and a small leaky expression enlarges the design space. Simulation results with realistic parameter values also suggest that the control circuit can effectively upregulate enzyme production to compensate flux perturbations.",

Ideally, this regulation brings about a competitive level of metabolic fitness. Understanding how cells can achieve a robust (close-to-optimal) functioning of metabolism by appropriate control of gene expression aids synthetic biology by providing design criteria of synthetic circuits for biotechnological purposes. It also extends our understanding of the designs of genetic circuitry found in nature such as metabolite control of transcription factor activity, promoter architectures and transcription factor dependencies, and operon composition (in bacteria). Here, we review, explain and illustrate an approach that allows for the inference and design of genetic circuitry that steers metabolic networks to achieve a maximal flux per unit invested protein across dynamic conditions. We discuss how this approach and its understanding can be used to rationalize Escherichia coli's strategy to regulate the expression of its ribosomes and infer the design of circuitry controlling gene expression of amino-acid biosynthesis enzymes. The inferred regulation indeed resembles E. coli's circuits, suggesting that these have evolved to maximize amino-acid production fluxes per unit invested protein.

We use the system to dissect, in freely moving animals, the individual contributions of the mechanosensory neurons PLML/PLMR to the C. elegans touch response circuit, revealing distinct and synergistic roles for these neurons.

    "abstract": "Gene expression plays a central role in the orchestration of cellular processes. The use of inducible promoters to change the expression level of a gene from its physiological level has significantly contributed to the understanding of the functioning of regulatory networks. However, from a quantitative point of view, their use is limited to short-term, population-scale studies to average out cell-to-cell variability and gene expression noise and limit the nonpredictable effects of internal feedback loops that may antagonize the inducer action. Here, we show that, by implementing an external feedback loop, one can tightly control the expression of a gene over many cell generations with quantitative accuracy. To reach this goal, we developed a platform for real-time, closed-loop control of gene expression in yeast that integrates microscopy for monitoring gene expression at the cell level, microfluidics to manipulate the cells' environment, and original software for automated imaging, quantification, and model predictive control. By using an endogenous osmostress responsive promoter and playing with the osmolarity of the cells environment, we show that long-term control can, indeed, be achieved for both time-constant and time-varying target profiles at the population and even the single-cell levels. Importantly, we provide evidence that real-time control can dynamically limit the effects of gene expression stochasticity. We anticipate that our method will be useful to quantitatively probe the dynamic properties of cellular processes and drive complex, synthetically engineered networks.",

Our approach entails selecting knockdown target genes resulting from in silico flux response analysis and those related to product biosynthesis then screening strains transformed with a library of synthetic sRNA-promoter combinations for enhanced production. We engineered two E. coli strains, both utilizing fine-tuned repression of argF and glnA through our approach; one produced putrescine (42.3 +/- 1.0 g/L) and the other L-proline (33.8 +/- 1.6 g/L) by fed-batch culture.

However, previous research mainly focused on the screening and characterization of some native promoters in Bacillus subtilis. To develop a broadly applicable promoter system for this important platform organism, we created a de novo synthetic promoter library (SPL) based on consensus sequences by analyzing the microarray transcriptome data of B. subtilis 168. A total of 214 potential promoters spanning a gradient of strengths was isolated and characterized by a green fluorescence assay. Among these, a detailed intensity analysis was conducted on nine promoters with different strengths by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Furthermore, reconstructed promoters and promoter cassettes (tandem promoter cluster) were designed via statistical model-based analysis and tandem dual promoters, which showed strength that was increased 1.2- and 2.77-fold compared to that of promoter P43, respectively. Finally, the SPL was employed in the production of inosine and acetoin by repressing and over-expressing the relevant metabolic pathways, yielding a 700% and 44% increase relative to the respective control strains. This is the first report of a de novo synthetic promoter library for B. subtilis, which is independent of any native promoter. The strategy of improving and fine-tuning promoter strengths will contribute to future metabolic engineering and synthetic biology projects in B. subtilis.",

Artificial transcriptional control of gene expression is one of the most well-developed methods for the design of novel synthetic regulatory networks.

Promoter sequence manipulation with cis-regulatory elements is a key approach to control gene expression transcriptionally. Here, we have designed a promoter that can be both activated and repressed, as a contribution to the library of synthetic biological 'parts'. Starting with the minimal cytochrome C (minCYC) promoter in yeast, we incorporated five steroid hormone responsive elements (SHREs) and one lac operator site, respectively, upstream and downstream of the TATA box. This allows activation through the testosterone-responsive androgen receptor, and repression through the LacI repressor. Exposure to varying concentrations of testosterone (to vary activation) and IPTG (to vary repression) demonstrated the ability to tune the promoter's output curve over a wide range. By integrating activating and repressing signals, the promoter permits a useful form of signal integration, and we are optimistic that it will serve as a component in future regulatory networks, including feedback controllers.",

    "abstract": "To successfully engineer mammalian cells for a desired purpose, multiple recombinant genes are required to be coexpressed at a specific and optimal ratio. In this study, we hypothesized that synthetic promoters varying in transcriptional activity could be used to create single multigene expression vectors coexpressing recombinant genes at a predictable relative stoichiometry. A library of 27 multigene constructs was created comprising three discrete fluorescent reporter gene transcriptional units in fixed series, each under the control of either a relatively low, medium, or high transcriptional strength synthetic promoter in every possible combination. Expression of each reporter gene was determined by absolute quantitation qRT-PCR in CHO cells. The synthetic promoters did generally function as designed within a multigene vector context; however, significant divergences from predicted promoter-mediated transcriptional activity were observed. First, expression of all three genes within a multigene vector was repressed at varying levels relative to coexpression of identical reporter genes on separate single gene vectors at equivalent gene copies. Second, gene positional effects were evident across all constructs where expression of the reporter genes in positions 2 and 3 was generally reduced relative to position 1. Finally, after accounting for general repression, synthetic promoter transcriptional activity within a local multigene vector format deviated from that expected. Taken together, our data reveal that mammalian synthetic promoters can be employed in vectors to mediate expression of multiple genes at predictable relative stoichiometries. However, empirical validation of functional performance is a necessary prerequisite, as vector and promoter design features can significantly impact performance.",

    "abstract": "A novel inducible gene expression system using p-isopropyl benzoate (cumate) as an inducer was developed for the industrial production hosts, Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus megaterium. Cumate is non-toxic to the host, inexpensive, and carbon source-independent inducer which provides an economical option for large-scale production of valuable proteins and chemicals from Bacillus strains. The synthetic cumate-inducible system was constructed by combining the strong constitutive Bacillus promoter P(veg) with regulatory elements of the Pseudomonas putida, CymR repressor, and its operator sequence CuO. The designed expression cassette containing a sfGFP reporter under the cumate-inducible promoter was assembled into a Bacillus-E. coli shuttle and gene expression investigated in the two Bacillus strains. Characterization of gene expression levels, expression kinetics, and dose-response to cumate inducer concentration confirmed high-level, but tightly controlled GFP reporter expression in tunable, cumate concentration-dependent manner. Unexpectedly, this expression system works equally well for Escherichia coli, resulting in a platform that can be used both in gram-positive and gram-negative expression host. Its tight regulation and controllable expression makes this system useful for metabolic engineering, synthetic biology studies as well industrial protein production.",

    "abstract": "Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (C. reinhardtii) is a single-cell green alga that can be easily genetically manipulated. With its favorable characteristics of rapid growth, low cost, non-toxicity, and the ability for post-translational protein modification, C. reinhardtii has emerged as an attractive option for the biosynthesis of various valuable products. To enhance the expression level of exogenous genes and overcome the silencing of foreign genes by C. reinhardtii, synthetic promoters such as the chimeric promoter AR have been constructed and evaluated. In this study, a synthetic promoter GA was constructed by hybridizing core fragments from the natural promoters of the acyl carrier protein gene (ACP2) and the glutamate dehydrogenase gene (GDH2). The GA promoter exhibited a significant increase (7 times) in expressing GUS, over the AR promoter as positive control. The GA promoter also displayed a strong responsiveness to blue light (BL), where the GUS expression was doubled compared to the white light (WL) condition. The ability of the GA promoter was further tested in the expression of another exogenous cadA gene, responsible for catalyzing the decarboxylation of lysine to produce cadaverine. The cadaverine yield driven by the GA promoter was increased by 1-2 times under WL and 2-3 times under BL as compared to the AR promoter. This study obtained, for the first time, a blue light-responsive GDH2 minimal fragment in C. reinhardtii, which delivered a doubling effect under BL when used alone or in hybrid. Together with the strong GA synthetic promoter, this study offered useful tools of synthetic biology to the algal biotechnology field.",

    "abstract": "Cell metabolism in living organisms is largely regulated at the transcriptional level, and the promoters are regarded as basic regulatory elements responsible for transcription initiation. Promoter engineering is an important technique to regulate gene expression and optimize metabolite biosynthesis in metabolic engineering and synthetic biology. The rational and precise control of gene expression in the multi-gene pathways can significantly affect the metabolic flux distribution and maximize the production of specific metabolites. Thus, many efforts have been made to identify natural promoters, construct inducible or hybrid promoters, and design artificial promoters for fine-tuning specific gene expression at the transcriptional level and improving production levels of the metabolites of interest. In this review, we will briefly introduce the architecture and function of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic promoters, and provide an overview of several major approaches for promoter engineering. The recent achievements and advances by promoter engineering for the optimization of metabolite biosynthetic pathways in multiple widely-used model microorganism, including Escherichia coli, Corynebacterium glutamicum and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, will also be extensively discussed.",

    "abstract": "Next-generation DNA vectors for cancer immunotherapies and vaccine development require promoters eliciting predefined transcriptional activities specific to target cell types, such as dendritic cells (DCs), which underpin immune response. In this study, we describe the de novo design of DC-specific synthetic promoters via in silico assembly of cis-transcription factor response elements (TFREs) that harness the DC transcriptional landscape. Using computational genome mining approaches, candidate TFREs were identified within promoter sequences of highly expressed DC-specific genes or those exhibiting an upregulated expression during DC maturation. Individual TFREs were then screened in vitro in a target DC line and off-target cell lines derived from skeletal muscle, fibroblast, epithelial, and endothelial cells using homotypic (TFRE repeats in series) reporter constructs. Based on these data, a library of heterotypic promoter assemblies varying in the TFRE composition, copy number, and sequential arrangement was constructed and tested in vitro to identify DC-specific promoters. Analysis of the transcriptional activity and specificity of these promoters unraveled underlying design rules, primarily TFRE composition, which govern the DC-specific synthetic promoter activity. Using these design rules, a second library of exclusively DC-specific promoters exhibiting varied transcriptional activities was generated. All DC-specific synthetic promoter assemblies exhibited >5-fold activity in the target DC line relative to off-target cell lines, with transcriptional activities ranging from 8 to 67% of the nonspecific human cytomegalovirus (hCMV-IE1) promoter. We show that bioinformatic analysis of a mammalian cell transcriptional landscape is an effective strategy for de novo design of cell-type-specific synthetic promoters with precisely controllable transcriptional activities.",

    "abstract": "Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) associated with dysfunction of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells is the most common cause of untreatable blindness. To advance gene therapy as a viable treatment for AMD there is a need for technologies that enable controlled, RPE-specific expression of therapeutic genes. Here we describe design, construction and testing of compact synthetic promoters with a pre-defined transcriptional activity and RPE cell specificity. Initial comparative informatic analyses of RPE and photoreceptor (PR) cell transcriptomic data identified conserved and overrepresented transcription factor regulatory elements (TFREs, 8-19 bp) specifically associated with transcriptionally active RPE genes. Both RPE-specific TFREs and those derived from the generically active cytomegalovirus-immediate early (CMV-IE) promoter were then screened in vitro to identify sequence elements able to control recombinant gene transcription in model induced pluripotent stem (iPS)-derived and primary human RPE cells. Two libraries of heterotypic synthetic promoters varying in predicted RPE specificity and transcriptional activity were designed de novo using combinations of up to 20 discrete TFREs in series (323-602 bp) and their transcriptional activity in model RPE cells was compared to that of the endogenous BEST1 promoter (661 bp, plus an engineered derivative) and the highly active generic CMV-IE promoter (650 bp). Synthetic promoters with a highpredicted specificity, comprised predominantly of endogenous TFREs exhibited a range of activities up to 8-fold that of the RPE-specific BEST1 gene promoter. Moreover, albeit at a lower predicted specificity, synthetic promoter transcriptional activity in model RPE cells was enhanced beyond that of the CMV-IE promoter when viral elements were utilized in combination with endogenous RPE-specific TFREs, with a reduction in promoter size of 15%. Taken together, while our data reveal an inverse relationship between synthetic promoter activity and cell-type specificity, cell context-specific control of recombinant gene transcriptional activity may be achievable.",

    "abstract": "Inducible gene expression systems can be used to control the expression of a gene of interest by means of a small-molecule. One of the most common designs involves engineering a small-molecule responsive transcription factor (TF) and its cognate promoter, which often results in a compromise between minimal uninduced background expression (leakiness) and maximal induced expression. Here, we focus on an alternative strategy using quantitative synthetic biology to mitigate leakiness while maintaining high expression, without modifying neither the TF nor the promoter. Through mathematical modelling and experimental validations, we design the CASwitch, a mammalian synthetic gene circuit based on combining two well-known network motifs: the Coherent Feed-Forward Loop (CFFL) and the Mutual Inhibition (MI). The CASwitch combines the CRISPR-Cas endoribonuclease CasRx with the state-of-the-art Tet-On3G inducible gene system to achieve high performances. To demonstrate the potentialities of the CASwitch, we apply it to three different scenarios: enhancing a whole-cell biosensor, controlling expression of a toxic gene and inducible production of Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV) vectors.",

    "abstract": "Most of the gene expression systems available for Gram-negative bacteria are afflicted by relatively high levels of basal (i.e. leaky) expression of the target gene(s). This occurrence affects the system dynamics, ultimately reducing the output and productivity of engineered pathways and synthetic circuits. In order to circumvent this problem, we have designed a novel expression system based on the well-known XylS/Pm transcriptional regulator/promoter pair from the soil bacterium Pseudomonas putida mt-2, in which the key functional elements are physically decoupled. By integrating the xylS gene into the chromosome of the platform strain KT2440, while placing the Pm promoter into a set of standard plasmid vectors, the inducibility of the system (i.e. the output difference between the induced and uninduced state) improved up to 170-fold. We further combined this modular system with an extra layer of post-translational control by means of conditional proteolysis. In this setup, the target gene is tagged with a synthetic motif dictating protein degradation. When the system features were characterized using the monomeric superfolder GFP as a model protein, the basal levels of fluorescence were brought down to zero (i.e. below the limit of detection). In all, these novel expression systems constitute an alternative tool to altogether suppress leaky gene expression, and they can be easily adapted to other vector formats and plugged-in into different Gram-negative bacterial species at the user's will.",

    "abstract": "A significant limitation of numerous current genetic engineering therapy approaches is their limited control over the strength, timing, or cellular context of their therapeutic effect. Synthetic gene/genetic circuits are synthetic biology approaches that can control the generation, transformation, or depletion of a specific DNA, RNA, or protein and provide precise control over gene expression and cellular behavior. They can be designed to perform logical operations by carefully selecting promoters, repressors, and other genetic components. Patent search was performed in Espacenet, resulting in 38 selected patents with 15 most frequent international classifications. Patent embodiments were categorized into applications for the delivery of therapeutic molecules, treatment of infectious diseases, treatment of cancer, treatment of bleeding, and treatment of metabolic disorders. The logic gates of selected genetic circuits are described to comprehensively demonstrate their therapeutic applications. Synthetic gene circuits can be customized for precise control of therapeutic interventions, leading to personalized therapies that respond specifically to individual patient needs, enhancing treatment efficacy and minimizing side effects. They can be highly sensitive biosensors that provide real-time therapy by accurate monitoring various biomarkers or pathogens and appropriately synthesizing a therapeutic molecule. Synthetic gene circuits may also lead to the development of advanced regenerative therapies and to implantable biodevices that produce on-demand bioactive molecules. However, this technology faces challenges for commercial profitability. The genetic circuit designs need adjustments for specific applications, and may have disadvantages like toxicity from multiple regulators, homologous recombination, context dependency, resource overuse, and environmental variability.",

We engineered iFFLs into Escherichia coli promoters using transcription-activator-like effectors (TALEs). These promoters had near-identical expression in different genome locations and plasmids, even when their copy number was perturbed by genomic mutations or changes in growth medium composition.

However, genetic manipulation of Streptomyces strains is much more difficult than other model microorganisms like Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Recently, CRISPR/Cas9 or dCas9-mediated genetic manipulation tools have been developed and facilitated Streptomyces genome editing. However, till now, CRISPR/dCas9-based interference system (CRISPRi) is only designed to repress single gene expression. Herein, the authors developed a novel CRISPRi system for multiplex gene repression in the model strain Streptomyces coelicolor. In this system, the integrative plasmid pSET152 is used as the backbone for the expression of the dCas9/sgRNA complex and both dCas9 and sgRNAs are designed to be under the control of constitutive promoters. Using the integrative CRISPRi system, the authors achieved efficient repression of multiple genes simultaneously; the mRNA levels of four targets are reduced to 2-32% of the control. Furthermore, it is successfully employed for functional gene screening, and an orphan response regulator (RR) (encoded by SCO2013) containing an RNA-binding ANTAR domain is identified being involved in bacterial growth. Collectively, this integrative CRISPRi system is very effective for multiplex gene repression in S. coelicolor, which could be extended to other Streptomyces strains for functional gene screening as well as for metabolic engineering.",

However, these circuits typically require the production of regulatory genes whose only purpose is to coordinate expression of other genes. When designing very small genetic constructs, such as viral genomes, we may want to avoid introducing such auxiliary gene products while nevertheless encoding complex expression dynamics. To this end, here we demonstrate that varying only the placement and strengths of promoters, terminators, and RNase cleavage sites in a computational model of a bacteriophage genome is sufficient to achieve solutions to a variety of basic gene expression patterns. We discover these genetic solutions by computationally evolving genomes to reproduce desired gene expression time-course data. Our approach shows that non-trivial patterns can be evolved, including patterns where the relative ordering of genes by abundance changes over time. We find that some patterns are easier to evolve than others, and comparable expression patterns can be achieved via different genetic architectures. Our work opens up a novel avenue to genome engineering via fine-tuning the balance of gene expression and gene degradation rates.",

    "abstract": "Artificial gene circuits have been proposed to be embedded into microbial cells that function as switches, timers, oscillators, and the Boolean logic gates. Building more complex systems from these basic gene circuit components is one key advance for biologic circuit design and synthetic biology. However, the behavior of bioengineered gene circuits remains unstable and uncertain. In this study, a nonlinear stochastic system is proposed to model the biological systems with intrinsic parameter fluctuations and environmental molecular noise from the cellular context in the host cell. Based on evolutionary systems biology algorithm, the design parameters of target gene circuits can evolve to specific values in order to robustly track a desired biologic function in spite of intrinsic and environmental noise. The fitness function is selected to be inversely proportional to the tracking error so that the evolutionary biological circuit can achieve the optimal tracking mimicking the evolutionary process of a gene circuit. Finally, several design examples are given in silico with the Monte Carlo simulation to illustrate the design procedure and to confirm the robust performance of the proposed design method. The result shows that the designed gene circuits can robustly track desired behaviors with minimal errors even with nontrivial intrinsic and external noise.",

    "abstract": "Discovering DNA regulatory sequence motifs and their relative positions is vital to understanding the mechanisms of gene expression regulation. Although deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved great success in predicting cis-regulatory elements, the discovery of motifs and their combinatorial patterns from these CNN models has remained difficult. We show that the main difficulty is due to the problem of multifaceted neurons which respond to multiple types of sequence patterns. Since existing interpretation methods were mainly designed to visualize the class of sequences that can activate the neuron, the resulting visualization will correspond to a mixture of patterns. Such a mixture is usually difficult to interpret without resolving the mixed patterns. We propose the NeuronMotif algorithm to interpret such neurons. Given any convolutional neuron (CN) in the network, NeuronMotif first generates a large sample of sequences capable of activating the CN, which typically consists of a mixture of patterns. Then, the sequences are \"demixed\" in a layer-wise manner by backward clustering of the feature maps of the involved convolutional layers. NeuronMotif can output the sequence motifs, and the syntax rules governing their combinations are depicted by position weight matrices organized in tree structures. Compared to existing methods, the motifs found by NeuronMotif have more matches to known motifs in the JASPAR database. The higher-order patterns uncovered for deep CNs are supported by the literature and ATAC-seq footprinting. Overall, NeuronMotif enables the deciphering of cis-regulatory codes from deep CNs and enhances the utility of CNN in genome interpretation.",

    "abstract": "While machine learning models have been successfully applied to predicting gene expression from promoter sequences, it remains a great challenge to derive intuitive interpretation of the model and reveal DNA motif grammar such as motif cooperation and distance constraint between motif sites. Previous interpretation approaches are often time-consuming or have difficulty to learn the combinatory rules. In this work, we designed interpretable neural network models to predict the mRNA expression levels from DNA sequences. By applying the Contextual Regression framework we developed, we extracted weighted features to cluster samples into different groups, which have different gene expression levels. We performed motif analysis in each cluster and found motifs with active or repressive regulation on gene expression. By comparing the co-occurrence locations of discovered motifs, we also uncovered multiple grammars of motif combination including communities of cooperative motifs and distance constraints between motif pairs. These results revealed new insights of the regulatory architecture of promoter sequences.",

To date, there are limited studies that systematically compare differences in MPRA design. Here, we screen a library of 2,440 candidate liver enhancers and controls for regulatory activity in HepG2 cells using nine different MPRA designs. We identify subtle but significant differences that correlate with epigenetic and sequence-level features, as well as differences in dynamic range and reproducibility. We also validate that enhancer activity is largely independent of orientation, at least for our library and designs. Finally, we assemble and test the same enhancers as 192-mers, 354-mers and 678-mers and observe sizable differences. This work provides a framework for the experimental design of high-throughput reporter assays, suggesting that the extended sequence context of tested elements and to a lesser degree the precise assay, influence MPRA results.",

    "abstract": "A growing number of variants associated with risk for neurodevelopmental disorders have been identified by genome-wide association and whole genome sequencing studies. As common risk variants often fall within large haplotype blocks covering long stretches of the noncoding genome, the causal variants within an associated locus are often unknown. Similarly, the effect of rare noncoding risk variants identified by whole genome sequencing on molecular traits is seldom known without functional assays. A massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) is an assay that can functionally validate thousands of regulatory elements simultaneously using high-throughput sequencing and barcode technology. MPRA has been adapted to various experimental designs that measure gene regulatory effects of genetic variants within cis- and trans-regulatory elements as well as posttranscriptional processes. This review discusses different MPRA designs that have been or could be used in the future to experimentally validate genetic variants associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. Though MPRA has limitations such as it does not model genomic context, this assay can help narrow down the underlying genetic causes of neurodevelopmental disorders by screening thousands of sequences in one experiment. We conclude by describing future directions of this technique such as applications of MPRA for gene-by-environment interactions and pharmacogenetics.",

However, the vast majority of variants occur within non-coding genomic regions. We designed an integrative computational and experimental framework to identify recurrently mutated non-coding regulatory regions that drive tumor progression. Applying this framework to sequencing data from a large prostate cancer patient cohort revealed a large set of candidate drivers. We used (1) in silico analyses, (2) massively parallel reporter assays, and (3) in vivo CRISPR interference screens to systematically validate metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) drivers. One identified enhancer region, GH22I030351, acts on a bidirectional promoter to simultaneously modulate expression of the U2-associated splicing factor SF3A1 and chromosomal protein CCDC157. SF3A1 and CCDC157 promote tumor growth in vivo. We nominated a number of transcription factors, notably SOX6, to regulate expression of SF3A1 and CCDC157.

Beyond conserved 5'ss and 3'ss motifs, splicing regulatory elements (SREs) play a pivotal role in this recognition process. Here, we present in silico designed sequences with arbitrary a priori prescribed splicing regulatory HEXplorer properties that can be concatenated to arbitrary length without changing their regulatory properties. We experimentally validated in silico predictions in a massively parallel splicing reporter assay on more than 3000 sequences and exemplarily identified some SRE binding proteins. Aiming at a unified 'functional splice site strength' encompassing both U1 snRNA complementarity and impact from neighboring SREs, we developed a novel RNA-seq based 5'ss usage landscape, mapping the competition of pairs of high confidence 5'ss and neighboring exonic GT sites along HBond and HEXplorer score coordinate axes on human fibroblast and endothelium transcriptome datasets. These RNA-seq data served as basis for a logistic 5'ss usage prediction model, which greatly improved discrimination between strong but unused exonic GT sites and annotated highly used 5'ss. Our 5'ss usage landscape offers a unified view on 5'ss and SRE neighborhood impact on splice site recognition, and may contribute to improved mutation assessment in human genetics.",

    "abstract": "Genome mapping studies have generated a nearly complete collection of genes for the human genome, but we still lack an equivalently vetted inventory of human regulatory sequences. Cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) play important roles in controlling when, where, and how much a gene is expressed. We developed a training data-free CRM-prediction algorithm, the Mammalian Regulatory MOdule Detector (MrMOD) for accurate CRM prediction in mammalian genomes. MrMOD provides genome position-fixed CRM models similar to the fixed gene models for the mouse and human genomes using only genomic sequences as the inputs with one adjustable parameter - the significance p-value. Importantly, MrMOD predicts a comprehensive set of high-resolution CRMs in the mouse and human genomes including all types of regulatory modules not limited to any tissue, cell type, developmental stage, or condition. We computationally validated MrMOD predictions used a compendium of 21 orthogonal experimental data sets including thousands of experimentally defined CRMs and millions of putative regulatory elements derived from hundreds of different tissues, cell types, and stimulus conditions obtained from multiple databases. In ovo transgenic reporter assay demonstrates the power of our prediction in guiding experimental design. We analyzed CRMs located in the chromosome 17 using unsupervised machine learning and identified groups of CRMs with multiple lines of evidence supporting their functionality, linking CRMs with upstream binding transcription factors and downstream target genes. Our work provides a comprehensive base pair resolution annotation of the functional regulatory elements and non-functional regions in the mammalian genomes.",

Enhancers, as well as their associated target genes, and transcription factors (TFs) that bind to them, are highly associated with human disease and biological processes. Although some enhancer databases have been published, most only focus on enhancers identified by high-throughput experimental techniques. Therefore, it is highly desirable to construct a comprehensive resource of manually curated enhancers and their related information based on low-throughput experimental evidences. Here, we established a comprehensive manually-curated enhancer database for human and mouse, which provides a resource for experimentally supported enhancers, and to annotate the detailed information of enhancers. The current release of ENdb documents 737 experimentally validated enhancers and their related information, including 384 target genes, 263 TFs, 110 diseases and 153 functions in human and mouse. Moreover, the enhancer-related information was supported by experimental evidences, such as RNAi, in vitro knockdown, western blotting, qRT-PCR, luciferase reporter assay, chromatin conformation capture (3C) and chromosome conformation capture-on-chip (4C) assays.

    "abstract": "STUDY DESIGN: Experimental animal study. OBJECTIVES: To validate the anti-apoptosis effect of microRNA-21 in neurons after spinal cord injury (SCI) and explore the mechanism. SETTING: Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, People's Republic of China. METHODS: In situ hybridization was used to detect the expression of miR-21 in spinal cord neurons (n = 24). In a rat contusion SCI model (n = 48), we upregulated the miR-21 level around the injured area using miR-21 lentiviral vectors and evaluated the therapeutic effect with histology and behavioural scores. In neuronal cells, oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) was exerted to imitate SCI, and we explored the biomechanism using molecular biology and a dual-luciferase reporter assay. RESULTS: miR-21 was expressed in spinal cord neurons and was found to improve neuronal survival and promote functional recovery in rat SCI models. The in vitro results in PC-12 cells revealed that the augmentation of endogenous miR-21 was able to reduce neuronal cell death after OGD. In addition, overexpression of miR-21 was able to reduce cellular apoptosis via decreasing PDCD4 protein levels, and caspase-3 activity was also influenced. Transfection of miR-21 into 293T cells was able to decrease luciferase activity in a reporter assay system, including the 3' untranslated region of PDCD4. CONCLUSIONS: miR-21 may have a protective role in neuronal apoptosis after SCI. PDCD4 may be a functional target gene involved in the miR-21-mediated anti-apoptotic effect through an miR-21/PDCD4/caspase-3 pathway.",

Whilst a great deal of effort has been made in the evaluation of transgenes, it is only more recently with the advance of vector systems that attention has begun to be focused upon the means and control of transgene expression. Until recently, the majority of constructs have employed ubiquitous viral promoters to drive expression from simple gene expression cassettes using viral promoters and lacking introns, 3' untranslated regions (UTRs), locus control regions (LCR's), matrix attachment regions (MAR's) and other such genetic components. It has consequently emerged that these elements may have a key role in determining the levels and longevity of gene expression attainable in vivo, irrespective of the vector system utilised. The majority of gene therapy applications would also benefit from the specific optimisation of 'tailor-made' expression cassettes to optimise their therapeutic efficacy. In conjunction with modification of vector tropism and strategies to limit their immunogenicity, this should create vectors suitable for the clinical application of gene therapy. This review aims to highlight some of the principle considerations of gene expression in vivo, and the means by which it may most effectively be achieved, whether this is via the minimal modification of an existing eukaryotic promoter or by the more extensive design of a novel promoter and associated elements.",

Over the last three decades, several groups have engineered recombinant AAV-producing platforms, yielding high titers of transducing vector particles.

It is becoming increasingly clear that disturbances in the epigenome are hallmarks of cancer, which are targetable and represent attractive starting points for drug creation. Remarkable progress has been made in the past decades in discovering and developing epigenetic-based small molecule inhibitors. Recently, epigenetic-targeted agents in hematologic malignancies and solid tumors have been identified and these agents are either in current clinical trials or approved for treatment. However, epigenetic drug applications face many challenges, including low selectivity, poor bioavailability, instability and acquired drug resistance. New multidisciplinary approaches are being designed to overcome these limitations, e.g., applications of machine learning, drug repurposing, high throughput virtual screening technologies, to identify selective compounds with improved stability and better bioavailability. We provide an overview of the key proteins that mediate epigenetic regulation that encompass histone and DNA modifications and discuss effector proteins that affect the organization of chromatin structure and function as well as presently available inhibitors as potential drugs. Current anticancer small-molecule inhibitors targeting epigenetic modified enzymes that have been approved by therapeutic regulatory authorities across the world are highlighted. Many of these are in different stages of clinical evaluation. We also assess emerging strategies for combinatorial approaches of epigenetic drugs with immunotherapy, standard chemotherapy or other classes of agents and advances in the design of novel epigenetic therapies.",

The occurrence of severe adverse events in several clinical trials involving the transplantation of stem cells genetically corrected with retroviral vectors showed that insertional mutagenesis is not just a theoretical event, and that retroviral transgenesis is associated with a finite risk of genotoxicity. In addressing these issues, the gene therapy community offered a spectacular example of how scientific knowledge and technology can be put to work to understand the causes of unpredicted side effects, design new vectors, and develop tools and models to predict their safety and efficacy. As an added benefit, these efforts brought new basic knowledge on virus-host interactions and on the biology and dynamics of human somatic stem cells.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Zishenhuoxue decoction (ZSHX), a Chinese herbal medicine, exhibits myocardial and vascular endothelial protective properties. The intricate regulatory mechanisms underlying myocardial ischemic injury and its association with dysfunctional mitochondrial quality surveillance (MQS) remain elusive. HYPOTHESIS/PURPOSE: To study the protective effect of ZSHX on ischemic myocardial injury in mice using a TMBIM6 gene-modified animal model and mitochondrial quality control-related experiments. STUDY DESIGN: Using model animals and myocardial infarction surgery-induced ischemic myocardial injury TMBIM6 gene-modified mouse models, the pharmacological activity of ZSHX in inhibiting ischemic myocardial injury and mitochondrial homeostasis disorder in vivo was tested. METHODS: Our focal point entailed scrutinizing the impact of ZSHX on ischemic myocardial impairment through the prism of TMBIM6. This endeavor was undertaken utilizing mice characterized by heart-specific TMBIM6 knockout (TMBIM6(CKO)) and their counterparts, the TMBIM6 transgenic (TMBIM6(TG)) and VDAC1 transgenic (VDAC1(TG)) mice. RESULTS: ZSHX demonstrated dose-dependent effectiveness in mitigating ischemic myocardial injury and enhancing mitochondrial integrity. TMBIM6(CKO) hindered ZSHX's cardio-therapeutic and mitochondrial protective effects, while ZSHX's benefits persisted in TMBIM6(TG) mice. TMBIM6(CKO) also blocked ZSHX's regulation of mitochondrial function in HR-treated cardiomyocytes. Hypoxia disrupted the MQS in cardiomyocytes, including calcium overload, excessive fission, mitophagy issues, and disrupted biosynthesis. ZSHX counteracted these effects, thereby normalizing MQS and inhibiting calcium overload and cardiomyocyte necroptosis. Our results also showed that hypoxia-induced TMBIM6 blockade resulted in the over-activation of VDAC1, a major mitochondrial calcium uptake pathway, while ZSHX could increase the expression of TMBIM6 and inhibit VDAC1-mediated calcium overload and MQS abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that ZSHX regulates mitochondrial calcium homeostasis and MQS abnormalities through a TMBIM6-VDAC1 interaction mechanism, which helps to treat ischemic myocardial injury and provides myocardial protection. This study also offers insights for the clinical translation and application of mitochondrial-targeted drugs in cardiomyocytess.",

    "abstract": "The common IVSI-110 (G>A) beta-thalassemia mutation is a paradigm for intronic disease-causing mutations and their functional repair by non-homologous end joining-mediated disruption. Such mutation-specific repair by disruption of aberrant regulatory elements (DARE) is highly efficient, but to date, no systematic analysis has been performed to evaluate disease-causing mutations as therapeutic targets. Here, DARE was performed in highly characterized erythroid IVSI-110(G>A) transgenic cells and the disruption events were compared with published observations in primary CD34(+) cells. DARE achieved the functional correction of beta-globin expression equally through the removal of causative mutations and through the removal of context sequences, with disruption events and the restriction of indel events close to the cut site closely resembling those seen in primary cells. Correlation of DNA-, RNA-, and protein-level findings then allowed the extrapolation of findings to other mutations by in silico analyses for potential repair based on the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) 9, Cas12a, and transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) platforms. The high efficiency of DARE and unexpected freedom of target design render the approach potentially suitable for 14 known thalassemia mutations besides IVSI-110(G>A) and put it forward for several prominent mutations causing other inherited diseases. The application of DARE, therefore, has a wide scope for sustainable personalized advanced therapy medicinal product development for thalassemia and beyond.",

    "abstract": "As in vivo electroporation advances from the preclinical phase to clinical studies and eventually to routine medical practice, the design of electroporation devices becomes increasingly important. Achieving safety and efficacy levels that meet regulatory requirements, as well as user and patient friendliness, are major design considerations. In addition, the devices will have to be economical to manufacture. This chapter will focus on the design of applicators and electrodes, the pieces of hardware in direct contact with the user and the patient, and thus key elements responsible for the safety and efficacy of the procedure. The two major foreseeable applications of the technology in the DNA field are for gene therapy and DNA vaccination. Design requirements differ considerably for these applications and for the diseases to be treated or prevented. In addition to the trend of device differentiation, there is also a trend to build devices capable of performing both the step of delivering the DNA to the target tissue and the subsequent step of electroporation. This chapter presents the electrical and biological principles underlying applicator and electrode design, gives an overview of existing devices, and discusses their advantages and disadvantages. The chapter also outlines major design considerations, including regulatory pathways, and points out potential future developments.",

    "title": "Interferon Epsilon Loss Is Elusive 9p21 Link to Immune-Cold Tumors, Resistant to Immune Checkpoint Therapy, and Endogenous CXCL9/10 Induction.",
    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Copy number alterations of chromosome 9p, or parts thereof, impair immune response and confer immune-checkpoint therapy (ICT) resistance by direct elimination of immune-regulatory genes on this arm, notably interferon (IFN)-gamma (at 9p24.1) and type I IFN (IFN-I) cluster (9p21.3) genes. Nevertheless, the primary 9p-loss human tumor immune readout is indirect (CXCL9/10 depletion at 4q21.1), and molecular alteration of chromosomes with engineered tandem elements-engineered 9p21.3-syntenic deletions in mice, Cdkn2a/b+/-Mtap (DeltaS) versus larger Cdkn2a/b+Mtap+IFN-I (DeltaL), revealed the causal link of IFN-I, primarily IFNϵ, to immune evasion. METHODS: This report updates and explicates the rapidly emerging body of clinical 9p ICT-cohort data and executes human (tumor, cell line) and mouse-model intrinsic 9p, IFN-I, and tumor-immune microenvironment CXCL9/10 deconvolution, mediation, and experimental studies. We analyzed CXCL9/10-CXCR3 cell sources and regulation by 9p deletion (size and depth) and mouse spatial single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) syntenic chr4qC4 IFN-I (DeltaS versus DeltaL immune-evasive model) studies of immune-cell type, subtype, and subcluster Cxcl9/10(+) numbers, fractions, and per-cell expression. RESULTS: Chr9p (9p, 9p21.3, 9p24.1) copy number loss is associated with immune-cold, programmed cell death protein 1 axis ICT-resistant human papillomavirus-negative head and neck squamous cancer, nonsquamous NSCLC, melanoma, urothelial cancer, and mesothelioma (13 reports, 36 ICT cohorts; <4 y). IFN-I has been associated with IFNalpha and ICT resistance. In human papillomavirus-negative head and neck squamous cancer, IFNE was the most highly expressed (and suppressed in 9p loss) IFN-I gene in tumors and cell lines, driven by 9p21.3 (q = 0.03; versus 9p24.1, q = 0.27); direct link to effector T-cell suppression (CD8 strongest, p = 0.006; mediation analysis), exhibited striking TP53 mutation co-occurrence and IFN-response pathway depletion. Progressively deep 9p21.3 loss (wild-type, shallow, deep) correlated with progressive IFNE and CXCL9/10-CXCR3 suppression; 9p21.3 DeltaS (versus DeltaL) IFN-I impact on CD8, NK (CD4, B, CD103) levels. Pan-tumor IFNE loss/tumor-immune microenvironment patterns were profoundly tissue-specific (Z </= 1.95 in 4/34 tumor types). IFN-intact DeltaS (versus DeltaL) KPC pancreatic model was linked to Cxcl9/10(+) dendritic cell (DC), macrophage, and neutrophil number (confirmed in KPL-3M nonsquamous NSCLC), and macrophage per-cell expression. DC and macrophage subclustering revealed heterogeneity at the level of M1, Ccl5, and conventional type 1 DC (cDC1), particularly high in DeltaS. CONCLUSION: IFNϵ is the elusive, cell-intrinsic 9p21 IFN-I signal to human CD8 T-cell, myeloid DC, CXCL9/10, murine DC, and macrophage subtype and subcluster Cxcl9/10 expression. 9p-loss IFN-I and IFN-gamma pathway (e.g., JAK2) genes at p21 and p24 lack the capacity of endogenous CXCL9/10 induction in an immune-desert, ICT-resistant state. These findings, 9p-loss/ICT-resistance data, and DC vaccine lung trials have led to a DC-CXCL9/10 vaccine, designed to bypass the severe chemokine deficit in 9p-loss tumors.",

    "abstract": "The past several years have witnessed the evolution of gene medicine from an experimental technology into a viable strategy for developing therapeutics for a wide range of human disorders. Numerous prototype DNA-based biopharmaceuticals can now control disease progression by induction and/or inhibition of genes. These potent therapeutics include plasmids containing transgenes, oligonucleotides, aptamers, ribozymes, DNAzymes, and small interfering RNAs. Although only 2 DNA-based pharmaceuticals (an antisense oligonucleotide formulation, Vitravene, (USA, 1998), and an adenoviral gene therapy treatment, Gendicine (China, 2003), have received approval from regulatory agencies; numerous candidates are in advanced stages of human clinical trials. Selection of drugs on the basis of DNA sequence and structure has a reduced potential for toxicity, should result in fewer side effects, and therefore should eventually yield safer drugs than those currently available. These predictions are based on the high selectivity and specificity of such molecules for recognition of their molecular targets. However, poor cellular uptake and rapid in vivo degradation of DNA-based therapeutics necessitate the use of delivery systems to facilitate cellular internalization and preserve their activity. This review discusses the basis of structural design, mode of action, and applications of DNA-based therapeutics. The mechanisms of cellular uptake and intracellular trafficking of DNA-based therapeutics are examined, and the constraints these transport processes impose on the choice of delivery systems are summarized. Finally, the development of some of the most promising currently available DNA delivery platforms is discussed, and the merits and drawbacks of each approach are evaluated.",

    "abstract": "Synthetic biology is a promising multidisciplinary field that brings together experts in scientific disciplines from cell biology to engineering with the goal of constructing elements that do not occur in nature for use in various applications, such as the development of novel approaches to improving healthcare management. Current disease treatment strategies are typically based on the diagnosis of phenotypic changes, which are often the result of an accumulation of endogenous metabolic defects in the human body. These defects occur when the tight regulation of physiological processes is disturbed by genetic alterations, protein function losses, or environmental changes. Such disturbances can result in the development of serious disorders that are often associated with aberrant physiological levels of certain biomolecules (e.g., metabolites, cytokines, and growth factors), which may lead to specific pathogenic states. However, these aberrant levels can also serve as biomarkers for the precise detection and specification of disease types. Clinical interventions are often conducted during the late stages of disease pathogenesis because of a lack of early detection of these physiological disturbances, which results in disease treatment rather than prevention. Therefore, advanced therapeutic tools must be developed to link therapeutic intervention to early diagnosis. Recent advances in the field of synthetic biology have enabled the design of complex gene circuits that can be linked to a host's metabolism to autonomously detect disease-specific biomarkers and then reprogrammed to produce and release therapeutic substances in a self-sufficient and automatic fashion, thereby restoring the physiological balance of the host and preventing the progression of the disease. This concept offers a unique opportunity to design treatment protocols that could replace conventional strategies, especially for diseases with complex and recurrent dynamics, such as chronic diseases.

    "abstract": "Recent progress in cellular and molecular research has provided a new technique to inhibit target gene expression based on DNA technology such as antisense oligonucleotides (ODN) or decoy ODN. Especially, application of an antisense strategy to regulate the transcription of disease-related genes in vivo has important therapeutic potential to treat or cure a variety of diseases and abnormal physiological conditions. On the other hand, recently, a successful ODN-based approach termed decoy ODN has used synthetic ODN containing an enhancer element that can penetrate cells, to bind to sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins and interfere with transcription in vitro and in vivo. Transfection of cis-element double-stranded decoy ODN has been reported as a new powerful tool in a new class of anti-gene strategies to treat various diseases as gene therapy or as a research tool to examine the molecular mechanisms of expression of a specific gene. Transfection of double-stranded ODN corresponding to the cis-sequence will result in attenuation of the authentic cis-trans interaction, leading to removal of trans-factors from the endogenous cis-elements with subsequent modulation of gene expression. To date, we have chosen several target transcription factors such as NFkappaB (nuclear factor-kappaB) and E2F to prevent the progression of diseases, and negative regulatory element (NRE) for the renin gene and angiotensinogen gene-activating element (AGE) for the angiotensinogen gene to examine the molecular mechanisms of gene expression. In this section, we introduce the principles of the decoy strategy and how to design decoy ODN.",

    "abstract": "In clinical gene transfer applications, lentiviral vectors (LV) have rapidly become the primary means to achieve permanent and stable expression of a gene of interest or alteration of gene expression in target cells. This status can be attributed primarily to the ability of the LV to (1) transduce dividing as well as quiescent cells, (2) restrict or expand tropism through envelope pseudo-typing, and (3) regulate gene expression within different cell lineages through internal promoter selection. Recent progress in viral vector design such as the elimination of unnecessary viral elements, split packaging, and self-inactivating vectors has established a significant safety profile for these vectors. The level of GMP compliance required for the manufacture of LV is dependent upon their intended use, stage of drug product development, and country where the vector will be used as the different regulatory authorities who oversee the clinical usage of such products may have different requirements. As such, successful GMP manufacture of LV requires a combination of diverse factors including: regulatory expertise, compliant facilities, validated and calibrated equipments, starting materials of the highest quality, trained production personnel, scientifically robust production processes, and a quality by design approach. More importantly, oversight throughout manufacturing by an independent Quality Assurance Unit who has the authority to reject or approve the materials is required. We describe here the GMP manufacture of LV at our facility using a four plasmid system where 293T cells from an approved Master Cell Bank (MCB) are transiently transfected using polyethylenimine (PEI). Following transfection, the media is changed and Benzonase added to digest residual plasmid DNA. Two harvests of crude supernatant are collected and then clarified by filtration. The clarified supernatant is purified and concentrated by anion exchange chromatography and tangential flow filtration. The final product is then diafiltered directly into the sponsor defined final formulation buffer and aseptically filled.",

High-throughput RNA-seq, Ribo-seq, and RNC-seq have enabled large-scale measurement of translation efficiency dynamics, yet systematic quantification and integration of translation efficiency (TE), initiation efficiency (translation ratio, TR), and elongation speed (elongation velocity index, EVI) at both gene and transcript levels across diverse biological contexts remain limited, even though their context-specific regulation-together with associated UTR features-plays key roles in development, homeostasis, and disease.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent arthritic disease characterized by cartilage degradation and low-grade inflammation, for which there remains a lack of efficacious therapeutic interventions. Notably, mitigating the impact of oxidative stress (OS) and inflammatory factors could help alleviate or hinder the advancement of OA. Given the benefits of both quercetin (Que) and Magnesium ion (Mg(2+)) in OA treatment, coupled with the structural properties of Que, we have innovatively developed the Que-Mg(2+) nanoparticles (NPs), aiming to deliver both Que and Mg(2+) simultaneously and achieve enhanced therapeutic outcomes for OA. Moreover, to avoid the adverse reactions linked to frequent injections, sodium alginate (SA) microspheres encapsulating Que-Mg(2+) NPs (Que-Mg@SA) were designed to treat the H(2)O(2)-induced OA cell model. METHODS: Que-Mg@SA microspheres were synthesized using the ionotropic gelation technique, with calcium chloride acting as the cross-linking agent. Comprehensive characterization of the Que-Mg@SA was conducted through transmission electron microscope (TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), optical microscope, and scanning electron microscope (SEM), which provided detailed insights into their size, zeta potential, morphology, and micromorphology. Additionally, the microsphere swelling rate and Que release were evaluated. The biocompatibility of Que-Mg@SA microspheres, along with their impact on chondrocyte viability, were detected through CCK-8 assay and live/dead cell staining. Furthermore, the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of Que-Mg@SA were evaluated by examining the ROS scavenging ability and pro-inflammatory factors levels, respectively. Finally, the regulatory influence of Que-Mg@SA microspheres on extracellular matrix (ECM) metabolism in OA was assessed by immunofluorescence staining and Western blot. RESULTS: Characterization results revealed that Que-Mg NPs exhibit nanoscale diameter, exceptional stability, and good dispersibility, while Que-Mg@SA possesses high entrapment efficiency (EE%) and loading efficiency (LE%), pronounced hygroscopic properties, and sustained drug-release capabilities. Additionally, in vitro cellular assays revealed that the biocompatible Que-Mg@SA microspheres significantly restored chondrocyte viability, scavenged H(2)O(2)-induced excessive ROS, reduced the levels of inflammatory cytokines, upregulated cartilage anabolic gene expression, downregulated cartilage catabolic protease gene expression, and maintained the metabolic balance of cartilage tissue. CONCLUSION: The functionalized Que-Mg@SA microspheres developed in our study hold great promise as a drug delivery system for OA and potentially other biomedical applications.

To set the appropriate general context, the first aim of this study was to provide a current global overview of approved cell and gene therapy products, with an emphasis on cytotherapies for cutaneous application. Notable advances were shown for North America, Europe, Iran, Japan, and Korea. Then, the second and main aim of this study was to perform a retrospective analysis on the various applications of dermal progenitor fibroblasts and derivatives, as clinically used under the Swiss progenitor cell transplantation program for the past three decades. Therein, the focus was set on the extent and versatility of use of the therapies under consideration, their safety parameters, as well as formulation options for topical application. Quantitative and illustrative data were summarized and reported for over 300 patients treated with various cell-based or cell-derived preparations (e.g., progenitor biological bandages or semi-solid emulsions) in Lausanne since 1992. Overall, this study shows the strong current interest in biological-based approaches to cutaneous regenerative medicine from a global developmental perspective, as well as the consolidated local clinical experience gathered with a specific and safe allogeneic cytotherapeutic approach.

Their unique physicochemical properties, such as nano size, high surface area, biocompatibility, stability, and tunable drug release, make them ideal carriers for a wide range of therapeutic agents. Nanogels (NGs), characterized by their 3D network of crosslinked polymers, offer unique edges like high drug loading capacity, controlled release, and targeted delivery. Additionally, the diverse applications of NGs in medical therapeutics highlight their versatility and potential impact on improving patient outcomes. Their application spans cancer treatment, infectious diseases, and chronic conditions, allowing for precise drug delivery to specific tissues or cells, minimizing side effects, and enhancing therapeutic efficacy. Despite their potential, challenges such as scalability, manufacturing reproducibility, and regulatory hurdles must be addressed. Achieving clinical translation requires overcoming these obstacles to ensure therapeutic payloads' safe and efficient delivery. Strategies such as surface modification and incorporating stimuli-responsive elements enhanced NG performance and addressed specific therapeutic challenges. Advances in nanotechnology, biomaterials, and targeted drug design offer opportunities to improve the performance of NGs and address current limitations. Tailoring NGs for exploring combination therapies and integrating diagnostics for real-time monitoring represent promising avenues for future research. In conclusion, NG drug delivery systems have demonstrated tremendous potential in diverse disease applications.

    "abstract": "Retroviruses are useful tools for the efficient delivery of genes to mammalian cells, owing to their ability to stably integrate into the host cell genome. Over the past few decades, retroviral vectors have been used in gene therapy clinical trials for the treatment of a number of inherited diseases and cancers. The earliest retrovirus vectors were based on simple oncogenic gammaretroviruses such as Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV) which, when pseudotyped with envelope proteins from other viruses such as the gibbon ape leukemia virus envelope protein (GALV) or vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSV-G), can efficiently introduce genes to a wide range of host cells. However, gammaretroviral vectors have the disadvantage that they are unable to efficiently transduce nondividing or slowly dividing cells. As a result, specific protocols have been developed to activate cells through the use of growth factors and cytokines. In the case of hematopoietic stem cells, activation has to be carefully controlled so that pluripotency is maintained. For many applications, gammaretroviral vectors are being superseded by lentiviral vectors based on human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) which has additional accessory proteins that enable integration in the absence of cell division. In addition, retroviral and lentiviral vector design has evolved to address a number of safety concerns. These include separate expression of the viral genes in trans to prevent recombination events leading to the generation of replication-competent viruses. Further, the development of self-inactivating (SIN) vectors reduces the potential for transactivation of neighboring genes and allows the incorporation of regulatory elements that may target gene expression more physiologically to particular cell types.",

In this report, we have taken a systems and network modeling approach in order to understand central mechanisms behind MI219-oxaliplatin synergy with validation in PDAC, colon and breast cancer cell lines. Microarray profiling of drug treatments (MI-219, oxaliplatin or their combination) in capan-2 cells reveal a similar unique set of gene alterations that is duplicated in other solid tumor cells. As single agent, MI-219 or oxaliplatin induced alterations in 48 and 761 genes respectively. The combination treatment resulted in 767 gene alterations with emergence of 286 synergy unique genes. Ingenuity network modeling of combination and synergy unique genes showed the crucial role of five key local networks CREB, CARF, EGR1, NF-kB and E-Cadherin. Compared to single agents the combination treatment super induced p53 and p21 confirming functional synergy. Further, the network signatures were validated at the protein level in all three cell lines. Individually silencing central nodes in these five hubsinterfered with MI-219-oxaliplatin activity confirming their critical role in aiding p53 mediated apoptotic response. We anticipate that our MI219-oxaliplatin network blueprints can be clinically translated in the rationale design and application of this unique therapeutic combination in a genetically pre-defined subset of patients.",

Our strategy is focused on 'multiple network analysis' in which we try to improve cancer diagnostics by using biological networks. Genetic alterations in some important hubs or in driver genes such as BRAF and TP53 play a critical role in regulating many important molecular processes. Most of the studies are focused on the analysis of the effects of single mutations, while tumors often carry mutations of multiple driver genes. The aim of this work is to define an innovative bioinformatics pipeline focused on the design and analysis of networks (such as biomedical and molecular networks), in order to: (1) improve the disease diagnosis; (2) identify the patients that could better respond to a given drug treatment; and (3) predict what are the primary and secondary effects of gene mutations involved in human diseases. RESULTS: By using our pipeline based on a multiple network approach, it has been possible to demonstrate and validate what are the joint effects and changes of the molecular profile that occur in patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma (mCRC) carrying mutations in multiple genes. In this way, we can identify the most suitable drugs for the therapy for the individual patient. This information is useful to improve precision medicine in cancer patients. As an application of our pipeline, the clinically significant case studies of a cohort of mCRC patients with the BRAF V600E-TP53 I195N missense combined mutation were considered. AVAILABILITY: The procedures used in this paper are part of the Cytoscape Core, available at (www.cytoscape.org). Data used here on mCRC patients have been published in [55].

    "title": "A fully human transgene switch to regulate therapeutic protein production by cooling sensation.",
    "abstract": "The ability to safely control transgene expression with simple synthetic gene switches is critical for effective gene- and cell-based therapies. In the present study, the signaling pathway controlled by human transient receptor potential (TRP) melastatin 8 (hTRPM8), a TRP channel family member(1), is harnessed to control transgene expression. Human TRPM8 signaling is stimulated by menthol, an innocuous, natural, cooling compound, or by exposure to a cool environment (15-18  degrees C). By functionally linking hTRPM8-induced signaling to a synthetic promoter containing elements that bind nuclear factor of activated T cells, a synthetic gene circuit was designed that can be adjusted by exposure to either a cool environment or menthol. It was shown that this gene switch is functional in various cell types and human primary cells, as well as in mice implanted with engineered cells. In response to transdermal delivery of menthol, microencapsulated cell implants harboring this gene circuit, coupled to expression of either of two therapeutic proteins, insulin or a modified, activin type IIB, receptor ligand trap protein (mActRIIB(ECD)-hFc), could alleviate hyperglycemia in alloxan-treated mice (a model of type 1 diabetes) or reverse muscle atrophy in dexamethasone-treated mice (a model of muscle wasting), respectively. This fully human-derived orthogonal transgene switch should be amenable to a wide range of clinical applications.",

    "title": "Structural Characterization of DDX23 5' UTR Regulatory Elements and Their Targeting by LNA-Modified Antisense Oligonucleotides.",
    "abstract": "Translation of mRNAs is a tightly regulated process in gene expression. In mRNA, the 5' untranslated region (5' UTR) controls ribosome recruitment and frequently contains structured elements that modulate translation efficacy. This study investigates stable structural motifs within the 5' UTR of DDX23 mRNA, encoding a protein relevant for anticancer therapy, as potential regulators and targets for antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs). Despite bioinformatic predictions and transcriptomic validations suggesting RNA G-quadruplex (rG4) formation, comprehensive structural analysis using a light-up assay and CD, UV, and NMR spectroscopy revealed that most putative rG4-forming sequences do not fold into stable rG4 structures, although one of them exists in an equilibrium between rG4 and an alternative, likely hairpin, conformation. Reporter assays using a robust G4 stabilizer also argue against the significant regulatory role of rG4s in DDX23 mRNA translation. Instead, we identified and characterized a stable hairpin structure with potential regulatory function. Based on these findings, we designed fully locked nucleic acid (LNA)-modified ASOs to target this hairpin and regions flanking the upstream open reading frame (uORF) and start codon of the coding sequence. A reporter assay demonstrated that cap-proximal targeting achieved robust translation inhibition up to 80%. In contrast, targeting the efficiently translated uORF was ineffective, presumably due to steric hindrances from the ribosomal complex. The study yields crucial design principles for translation-regulating ASOs: avoid targeting regions shielded by efficient uORF translation and carefully tune ASO-RNA duplex stability to surpass endogenous structures without disrupting regulatory mechanisms. These findings provide insights into the regulation of DDX23 expression and establish a framework for developing ASO-based therapeutics with broad implications for mRNA targeting in anticancer applications.",

    "abstract": "Multidrug-resistant bacterial infections pose a severe global health threat, highlighting the urgent need for innovative therapeutic options beyond traditional antibiotics. Phage therapy, which employs bacteriophages to infect and eradicate pathogenic bacteria, specifically offers a promising solution. However, the lack of well-characterized therapeutic phages has limited their broader clinical use. A critical aspect of activating the lytic potential of dormant prophages involves the strategic manipulation of transcription factor binding sites (TFBS), which function as pivotal regulatory nodes governing the transition between lysogenic dormancy and lytic activation. Our platform utilizes advanced bioinformatics tools to accurately identify and analyze TFBS, facilitating the targeted redesign or replacement of these sites to disrupt host-mediated repression. By systematically simulating modifications of these regulatory 'switches,' our platform computationally predicts reduced repressor activity, suggesting the potential for prophage activation and bacterial cell lysis. This novel methodology not only broadens the spectrum of therapeutic bacteriophages but also establishes a basis for individualized phage-based therapies, presenting a robust strategy to address the escalating challenge of antibiotic-resistant infections. By enabling the precise identification and engineering of TFBS, our platform signifies a transformative advancement in phage biology, effectively bridging the divide between computational analysis and therapeutic application.",

    "title": "Chlorogenic Acid Activates CFTR-Mediated Cl- Secretion in Mice and Humans: Therapeutic Implications for Chronic Rhinosinusitis.",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Salubrious effects of the green coffee bean are purportedly secondary to high concentrations of chlorogenic acid. Chlorogenic acid has a molecular structure similar to bioflavonoids that activate transepithelial Cl(-) transport in sinonasal epithelia. In contrast to flavonoids, the drug is freely soluble in water. The objective of this study is to evaluate the Cl(-) secretory capability of chlorogenic acid and its potential as a therapeutic activator of mucus clearance in sinus disease. STUDY DESIGN: Basic research. SETTING: Laboratory. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Chlorogenic acid was tested on primary murine nasal septal epithelial (MNSE) (CFTR(+/+) and transgenic CFTR(-/-)) and human sinonasal epithelial (HSNE) (CFTR(+/+) and F508del/F508del) cultures under pharmacologic conditions in Ussing chambers to evaluate effects on transepithelial Cl(-) transport. Cellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), phosphorylation of the CFTR regulatory domain (R-D), and CFTR mRNA transcription were also measured. RESULTS: Chlorogenic acid stimulated transepithelial Cl(-) secretion (change in short-circuit current [DeltaISC = microA/cm(2)]) in MNSE (13.1 +/- 0.9 vs 0.1 +/- 0.1; P < .05) and HSNE (34.3 +/- 0.9 vs 0.0 +/- 0.1; P < .05). The drug had a long duration until peak effect at 15 to 30 minutes after application. Significant inhibition with INH-172 as well as absent stimulation in cultures lacking functional CFTR suggest effects are dependent on CFTR-mediated pathways. However, the absence of elevated cellular cAMP and phosphorylation the CFTR R-D indicates chlorogenic acid does not work through a PKA-dependent mechanism. CONCLUSION: Chlorogenic acid is a water-soluble agent that promotes CFTR-mediated Cl(-) transport in mouse and human sinonasal epithelium. Translating activators of mucociliary transport to clinical use provides a new therapeutic approach to sinus disease. Further in vivo evaluation is planned.",

    "abstract": "Identifying tissue-specific molecular signatures of active regulatory elements is critical to understanding gene regulatory mechanisms. In this study, transcription start sites (TSS) and enhancers were identified using Cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) across endometrial stromal cell (ESC) samples obtained from women with (n = 4) and without endometriosis (n = 4). ESC TSSs and enhancers were compared to those reported in other tissue and cell types in FANTOM5 and were integrated with RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data from the same samples for regulatory activity and network analyses. CAGE tag count differences between women with and without endometriosis were statistically tested and tags within close proximity to genetic variants associated with endometriosis risk were identified. Over 90% of tag clusters mapping to promoters were observed in cells and tissues in FANTOM5. However, some potential cell-type-specific promoters and enhancers were also observed. Regions of open chromatin identified using ATAC-seq provided further evidence of the active transcriptional regions identified by CAGE. Despite the small sample number, there was evidence of differences associated with endometriosis at 210 consensus clusters, including IGFBP5, CALD1 and OXTR. ESC TSSs were also located within loci associated with endometriosis risk from genome-wide association studies. This study provides novel evidence of transcriptional differences in endometrial stromal cells associated with endometriosis and provides a valuable cell-type specific resource of active TSSs and enhancers in endometrial stromal cells.",

    "abstract": "Tissue- or cell type- specific expression of transgenes is often essential for interrogation of biological phenomenon or predictable engineering of multicellular organisms but can be stymied by cryptic enhancers that make identification of promoters that generate desired expression profiles challenging. In plants the months-to-years long timeline associated with prototyping putative tissue-specific promoters in transgenic lines deepens this challenge. We have developed a novel strategy called Ribozyme Enabled Tissue Specificity (RETS) that leverages the knowledge of where and when genes are expressed derived from transcriptomic studies to enable tissue-specific expression without needing characterized promoters. It uses a split self-splicing ribozyme based on a group I intron from Tetrahymena thermophila to enable conditional reconstitution of a transgene mRNA in the presence of a secondary tissue-specific mRNA of choice. We elucidate the design features that enable flexible swapping of transgenes and targets, enhancing transgene expression, and circumventing host RNA interference responses. We then show that these innovations enable tissue-specific and dose-dependent expression of transgenes in Arabidopsis thaliana. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of RETS both for creating genetically encoded biosensors to study the spatiotemporal patterns of gene expression in planta as well as for engineering tissue-specific changes in organ size. RETS provides a novel avenue to study expression patterns of native loci with non-destructive imaging, complementing the weakness of existing approaches. Additionally, the spatiotemporal control of transgene expression afforded by RETS enables precision engineering of plant phenotypes which will facilitate enhancing crops without the trade-offs associated with constitutive expression.",

    "abstract": "Gene inactivation has become the gold standard for determining gene function in the mouse. Many genes inactivated in the germ line cause early lethality that precludes phenotypic assessment at a later time point. Conditional gene inactivation using Cre recombinase expressed via a tissue specific promoter/enhancer allows phenotypic analyses of selected tissues, but lacks temporal control. Recent development of the tamoxifen-inducible Cre-ER (T2) offers both cell type-specific and temporal control of conditional gene inactivation. As an example, we describe the design and step-wise construction of a Cre-ER (T2) knock-in allele at the Pax7 locus using the recombineering method - Pax7 is selectively expressed in embryonic muscle progenitors and adult muscle stem cells. The resulting Pax7-Cre- ER (T2) (Pax7 (CE)) allele has been successfully applied to embryos and adults for tamoxifen-regulated myogenic lineage tracing and gene inactivation (Nature 460:627-631, 2009; Genesis 48:424-436, 2010).",

    "title": "Distinguishing benign from pathogenic duplications involving GPR101 and VGLL1-adjacent enhancers in the clinical setting with the bioinformatic tool POSTRE.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Structural variants (SVs) that disrupt topologically associating domains (TADs) can cause disease by rewiring enhancer-promoter interactions. Duplications involving GPR101 are known to cause X-linked acrogigantism (X-LAG) by enabling aberrant expression of GPR101 through hijacking of enhancers at VGLL1. However, not all GPR101-containing duplications are pathogenic, presenting a diagnostic challenge, especially in the prenatal setting. METHODS: We evaluated POSTRE, a tool designed to predict the regulatory impact of SVs, to distinguish pathogenic from benign GPR101 duplications. We analyzed six non-pathogenic duplications, and 27 known X-LAG associated pathogenic duplications. Tissue-specific enhancer maps built using H3K27ac ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq data as well as gene expression data derived from human anterior pituitary samples were integrated into POSTRE to enable predictions in a X-LAG relevant tissue context. RESULTS: POSTRE correctly classified all 33 duplications as benign or pathogenic. In addition, one X-LAG case with mild clinical features (e.g., severe GH hypersecretion in the absence of pituitary tumorigenesis) was found to include only 2/5 VGLL1 enhancers (also predicted to be the weakest enhancers), whereas all 26 typical X-LAG cases had >/=4 enhancers duplicated. This suggests that milder enhancer hijacking at VGLL1 could explain the different clinical features of X-LAG in this individual. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the utility of POSTRE to support diagnostic pipelines when interpreting SVs affecting chromatin architecture in pituitary disease. By accurately modelling enhancer adoption in a cell type-specific context, POSTRE could help to reduce uncertainty in genetic counselling and offers a rapid alternative to performing chromatin conformation capture experiments.",

    "abstract": "Cis-regulatory elements (CREs) control gene expression, orchestrating tissue identity, developmental timing and stimulus responses, which collectively define the thousands of unique cell types in the body(1-3). While there is great potential for strategically incorporating CREs in therapeutic or biotechnology applications that require tissue specificity, there is no guarantee that an optimal CRE for these intended purposes has arisen naturally. Here we present a platform to engineer and validate synthetic CREs capable of driving gene expression with programmed cell-type specificity. We take advantage of innovations in deep neural network modelling of CRE activity across three cell types, efficient in silico optimization and massively parallel reporter assays to design and empirically test thousands of CREs(4-8). Through large-scale in vitro validation, we show that synthetic sequences are more effective at driving cell-type-specific expression in three cell lines compared with natural sequences from the human genome and achieve specificity in analogous tissues when tested in vivo. Synthetic sequences exhibit distinct motif vocabulary associated with activity in the on-target cell type and a simultaneous reduction in the activity of off-target cells. Together, we provide a generalizable framework to prospectively engineer CREs from massively parallel reporter assay models and demonstrate the required literacy to write fit-for-purpose regulatory code.",

    "abstract": "Small activating RNA (saRNA)-mediated gene activation has opened a new avenue for upregulating the expression of target genes by promoting endogenous transcription, a phenomenon known as RNA activation (RNAa). RNAa is distinct from the established RNAi mechanistic framework, although AGO2 is required by both. The precise mechanism of RNAa is currently disputable and has become a bottleneck in the development of this new technology. saRNA may achieve activation of target genes by directly binding to DNA targets in promoter, or interacting with antisense transcripts transcribed from overlapping promoter sequences, or by silencing other genes. In this chapter, we focused on recent development in our understanding of the target-recognition mechanism in RNAa. Conflicting results on saRNA targets are also discussed. Despite that the target mechanism of RNAa is more complex than expected and not completely understood so far, independent lines of evidence have suggested that saRNAs work by an \"on-site\" mechanism by binding to target genomic DNA in a \"seed-region\"-dependent manner. Finally, \"off-target\" effects of saRNA are observed and should be carefully controlled in designing experiments for and interpreting results from RNAa-related studies.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR-Cas is a powerful genome editing technology and has a great potential for in vivo gene therapy. Successful translational application of CRISPR-Cas to biomedicine still faces many safety concerns, including off-target side effect, cell fitness problem after CRISPR-Cas treatment, and on-target genome editing side effect in undesired tissues. To solve these issues, it is needed to design sgRNA with high cell-specific efficacy and specificity. Existing single-guide RNA (sgRNA) design tools mainly depend on a sgRNA sequence and the local information of the targeted genome, thus are not sufficient to account for the difference in the cellular response of the same gene in different cell types. To incorporate cell-specific information into the sgRNA design, we develop novel interpretable machine learning models, which integrate features learned from advanced transformer-based deep neural network with cell-specific gene property derived from biological network and gene expression profile, for the prediction of CRISPR-Cas9 and CRISPR-Cas12a efficacy and specificity. In benchmark studies, our models significantly outperform state-of-the-art algorithms. Furthermore, we find that the network-based gene property is critical for the prediction of cell-specific post-treatment cellular response. Our results suggest that the design of efficient and safe CRISPR-Cas needs to consider cell-specific information of genes. Our findings may bolster developing more accurate predictive models of CRISPR-Cas across a broad spectrum of biological conditions as well as provide new insight into developing efficient and safe CRISPR-based gene therapy.",

    "abstract": "Genetic tools derived from the Cas9 RNA-guided nuclease are providing essential capabilities to study and engineer bacteria. While the importance of off-target effects was noted early in Cas9's application to mammalian cells, off-target cleavage by Cas9 in bacterial genomes is easily avoided due to their smaller size. Despite this, several studies have reported experimental setups in which Cas9 expression was toxic, even when using the catalytic dead variant of Cas9 (dCas9). Specifically, dCas9 was shown to be toxic when in complex with guide RNAs sharing specific PAM (protospacer adjacent motif)-proximal sequence motifs. Here, we demonstrate that this toxicity is caused by off-target binding of Cas9 to the promoter of essential genes, with silencing of off-target genes occurring with as little as 4 nt of identity in the PAM-proximal sequence. Screens performed in various strains of Escherichia coli and other enterobacteria show that the nature of toxic guide RNAs changes together with the evolution of sequences at off-target positions. These results highlight the potential for Cas9 to bind to hundreds of off-target positions in bacterial genomes, leading to undesired effects. This phenomenon must be considered in the design and interpretation of CRISPR-Cas experiments in bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Neurologic diseases tend to target various areas of the central nervous system (CNS) and can therefore result in paralysis, dementia, and death. Neurodegenerative diseases distinguish themselves from other diseases by affecting nerve cells, which unlike many other cells in our body cannot regenerate when severely injured. The discovery of RNA interference (RNAi) has enabled scientist to design new therapeutic approaches based on specific gene silencing rather than the canonical gene therapy through gene augmentation. Two types of molecules can be used for viral vector-mediated gene silencing: short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) and artificial microRNAs (miRNAs) that have the ability to enter the RNAi pathway. Although both shRNAs and miRNAs can be used to silence genes, they enter the RNAi pathway at different points. Unlike shRNAs, miRNAs require an additional cleavage step inside the nucleus before being exported to the cytoplasm. These molecules can then be incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) which utilizes sequence complementarity to recognize target mRNAs and activate either translational repression, in the case of partial complementarity, or induce mRNA cleavage in the case of complete complementarity. Elevated amounts of shRNAs, which are commonly driven by strong polymerase III promoters, can cause saturation of the endogenous RNAi machinery due to competition between endogenous and artificial molecules. Switching to a DNA polymerase II promoter is an alternative to reduce shRNA production, thereby reducing toxicity. Even though the molecules are designed to target specific mRNAs there may be off-target effects due to nonspecific binding that must be accounted for during the design process. In this chapter we discuss the design and in vitro screening of shRNAs and artificial miRNAs.",

    "abstract": "Next-generation DNA vectors for cancer immunotherapies and vaccine development require promoters eliciting predefined transcriptional activities specific to target cell types, such as dendritic cells (DCs), which underpin immune response. In this study, we describe the de novo design of DC-specific synthetic promoters via in silico assembly of cis-transcription factor response elements (TFREs) that harness the DC transcriptional landscape. Using computational genome mining approaches, candidate TFREs were identified within promoter sequences of highly expressed DC-specific genes or those exhibiting an upregulated expression during DC maturation. Individual TFREs were then screened in vitro in a target DC line and off-target cell lines derived from skeletal muscle, fibroblast, epithelial, and endothelial cells using homotypic (TFRE repeats in series) reporter constructs. Based on these data, a library of heterotypic promoter assemblies varying in the TFRE composition, copy number, and sequential arrangement was constructed and tested in vitro to identify DC-specific promoters. Analysis of the transcriptional activity and specificity of these promoters unraveled underlying design rules, primarily TFRE composition, which govern the DC-specific synthetic promoter activity. Using these design rules, a second library of exclusively DC-specific promoters exhibiting varied transcriptional activities was generated. All DC-specific synthetic promoter assemblies exhibited >5-fold activity in the target DC line relative to off-target cell lines, with transcriptional activities ranging from 8 to 67% of the nonspecific human cytomegalovirus (hCMV-IE1) promoter. We show that bioinformatic analysis of a mammalian cell transcriptional landscape is an effective strategy for de novo design of cell-type-specific synthetic promoters with precisely controllable transcriptional activities.",

Of recent interest, a series of studies have been targeting the role of non-coding RNAs, particularly miRNAs and lncRNAs, in regulating gene expression and influencing cellular pathways that may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of these diseases. miRNAs regulate many biological processes by degrading or repressing the translation of target mRNAs, whereas lncRNAs act as scaffolds, sponges, and guides to control gene expression and cellular activities. Both miRNAs and lncRNAs participate in neurodegenerative mechanisms such as protein aggregation, inflammation, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation. While targeting miRNAs and lncRNAs holds promise for potential therapeutic benefits, problems persist with their efficient delivery, specificity, and off-target effects. New techniques like viral vectors, lipid nanoparticles, and CRISPR-based gene editing will further enhance the development of therapies based on miRNA and lncRNA. Moreover, their interaction with regulatory networks may present new avenues toward understanding disease mechanisms and guiding therapeutic design. This review covers the role of miRNAs and lncRNAs in neurodegenerative disorders, their therapeutic potential, challenges, and future directions in ncRNA-based treatment approaches.",

    "abstract": "Synthetic networks require complex intertwined genetic regulation often relying on transcriptional activation or repression of target genes. CRISPRi-based transcription factors facilitate the programmable modulation of endogenous or synthetic promoter activity and the process can be optimised by using software to select appropriate gRNAs and limit non-specific gene modulation. Here, we develop a computational software pipeline, gDesigner, that enables the automated selection of orthogonal gRNAs with minimized off-target effects and promoter crosstalk. We next engineered a Lachnospiraceae bacterium Cas12a (dLbCas12a)-based repression system that downregulates target gene expression by means of steric hindrance of the cognate promoter. Finally, we generated a library of orthogonal synthetic dCas12a-repressed promoters and experimentally demonstrated it in HEK293FT, U2OS and H1299 cells lines. Our system expands the toolkit of mammalian synthetic promoters with a new complementary and orthogonal CRISPRi-based system, ultimately enabling the design of synthetic promoter libraries for multiplex gene perturbation that facilitate the understanding of complex cellular phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Transient transfection promoter reporter assays are commonly used in the study of transcriptional regulation, and can be used to define and characterize both cis-acting regulatory sequences and trans-acting factors. In the process of using a variety of reporter assays designed to study regulation of the rhodopsin (rho) promoter, we discovered that rhodopsin promoter-driven reporter expression could be activated by certain species of shRNA in a gene-target-independent but shRNA sequence-specific manner, suggesting involvement of a specific shRNA associated pathway. Interestingly, the shRNA-mediated increase of rhodopsin promoter activity was synergistically enhanced by the rhodopsin transcriptional regulators CRX and NRL. Additionally, the effect was cell line-dependent, suggesting that this pathway requires the expression of cell-type specific factors. Since microRNA (miRNA) and interferon response-mediated processes have been implicated in RNAi off-target phenomena, we performed miRNA and gene expression profiling on cells transfected with shRNAs that do target a specific gene but have varied effects on rho reporter expression in order to identify transcripts whose expression levels are associated with shRNA induced rhodopsin promoter reporter activity. We identified a total of 50 miRNA species, and by microarray analysis, 320 protein-coding genes, some of which were predicted targets of the identified differentially expressed miRNAs, whose expression was altered in the presence of shRNAs that stimulated rhodopsin-promoter activity in a non-gene-targeting manner. Consistent with earlier studies on shRNA off-target effects, a number of interferon response genes were among those identified to be upregulated. Taken together, our results confirm the importance of considering off-target effects when interpreting data from RNAi experiments and extend prior results by focusing on the importance of including multiple and carefully designed controls in the design and analysis of the effects of shRNA on transient transfection-based transcriptional assays.",

    "abstract": "Genetic design automation (GDA) tools hold promise to speed-up circuit design in synthetic biology. Their widespread adoption is hampered by their limited predictive power, resulting in frequent deviations between the in silico and in vivo performance of a genetic circuit. Context effects, i.e., the change in overall circuit functioning, due to the intracellular environment of the host and due to cross-talk among circuits components are believed to be a major source for the aforementioned deviations. Incorporating these effects in computational models of GDA tools is challenging but is expected to boost their predictive power and hence their deployment. Using fine-grained thermodynamic models of promoter activity, we show in this work how to account for two major components of cellular context effects: (i) crosstalk due to limited specificity of used regulators and (ii) titration of circuit regulators to off-target binding sites on the host genome. We show how we can compensate the incurred increase in computational complexity through dedicated branch-and-bound techniques during the technology mapping process. Using the synthesis of several combinational logic circuits based on Cello's device library as a case study, we analyze the effect of different intensities and distributions of crosstalk on circuit performance and on the usability of a given device library.",

    "title": "Targeted DNA demethylation of the Arabidopsis genome using the human TET1 catalytic domain.",
    "abstract": "DNA methylation is an important epigenetic modification involved in gene regulation and transposable element silencing. Changes in DNA methylation can be heritable and, thus, can lead to the formation of stable epialleles. A well-characterized example of a stable epiallele in plants is fwa, which consists of the loss of DNA cytosine methylation (5mC) in the promoter of the FLOWERING WAGENINGEN (FWA) gene, causing up-regulation of FWA and a heritable late-flowering phenotype. Here we demonstrate that a fusion between the catalytic domain of the human demethylase TEN-ELEVEN TRANSLOCATION1 (TET1cd) and an artificial zinc finger (ZF) designed to target the FWA promoter can cause highly efficient targeted demethylation, FWA up-regulation, and a heritable late-flowering phenotype. Additional ZF-TET1cd fusions designed to target methylated regions of the CACTA1 transposon also caused targeted demethylation and changes in expression. Finally, we have developed a CRISPR/dCas9-based targeted demethylation system using the TET1cd and a modified SunTag system. Similar to the ZF-TET1cd fusions, the SunTag-TET1cd system is able to target demethylation and activate gene expression when directed to the FWA or CACTA1 loci. Our study provides tools for targeted removal of 5mC at specific loci in the genome with high specificity and minimal off-target effects. These tools provide the opportunity to develop new epialleles for traits of interest, and to reactivate expression of previously silenced genes, transgenes, or transposons.",

Large scale molecular information from living cells can be obtained from reporter constructs that provide activities for either individual transcription factors or multiple factors binding to the full promoter following CRISPR/Cas9 directed insertion of luciferase. In this report, we investigated the design criteria to obtain reporters that are specific and responsive to transcription factor (TF) binding and the integration of TF binding activity with genetic reporter activity. The design of TF reporters was investigated for the impact of consensus binding site spacing sequence and off-target binding on the reporter sensitivity using a library of 25 SMAD3 activity reporters with spacers of random composition and length. A spacer was necessary to quantify activity changes after TGFbeta stimulation. TF binding site prediction algorithms (BEEML, FIMO and DeepBind) were used to predict off-target binding, and nonresponsiveness to a SMAD3 reporter was correlated with a predicted competitive binding of constitutively active p53. The network of activity of the SMAD3 reporter was inferred from measurements of TF reporter library, and connected with large-scale genetic reporter activity measurements. The integration of TF and genetic reporters identified the major hubs directing responses to TGFbeta, and this method provided a systems-level algorithm to investigate cell signaling.",

    "abstract": "We have recently demonstrated that genetic inactivation of EWSR1 : : FLI1 by CRISPR/Cas9, successfully blocks cell proliferation in a cell model of Ewing sarcoma. However, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing can exhibit off-target effects, and thus, precise regulation of Cas9 expression in target cells is essential to develop gene-editing strategies to inactivate EWSR1 : : FLI1 in Ewing sarcoma cells. In this study, we demonstrate that Cas9 can be specifically expressed in Ewing sarcoma cells when located downstream a promoter consisting of GGAA repeats and a consensus TATA box (GGAAprom). Under these conditions, Cas9 is selectively expressed in Ewing sarcoma cells that express EWSR1 : : FLI1 oncoproteins, but not in cells expressing wild-type FLI1. Consequently, Ewing sarcoma cells infected with GGAAprom>Cas9 and a specific gRNA designed to inactivate EWSR1 : : FLI1, showed successful EWSR1 : : FLI1 inactivation and the subsequent blockade of cell proliferation. Notably, GGAAprom>Cas9 can be efficiently delivered to Ewing sarcoma cells via adenoviral vectors both in vitro and in vivo, highlighting the potential of this approach for Ewing sarcoma treatment. Our results demonstrate that the CRISPR/Cas9 machinery is safe and specific for Ewing sarcoma cells when driven under a GGAAprom, paving the way for the development of cancer gene therapies based on the selective expression of genes with therapeutic potential.",

    "abstract": "RNA interference (RNAi) is a post-transcriptional gene silencing mechanism that mediates the sequence-specific degradation of targeted RNA and thus provides a tremendous opportunity for development of oligonucleotide-based drugs. Here, we report on the design and validation of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting highly conserved regions of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) genome. To aim for therapeutic applications by optimizing the RNAi efficacy and reducing potential side effects, we considered different factors such as target RNA variations, thermodynamics and accessibility of the siRNA and target RNA, and off-target effects. This aim was achieved using an in silico design and selection protocol complemented by an automated MysiRNA-Designer pipeline. The protocol included the design and filtration of siRNAs targeting highly conserved and accessible regions within the HCV internal ribosome entry site, and adjacent core sequences of the viral genome with high-ranking efficacy scores. Off-target analysis excluded siRNAs with potential binding to human mRNAs. Under this strict selection process, two siRNAs (HCV353 and HCV258) were selected based on their predicted high specificity and potency. These siRNAs were tested for antiviral efficacy in HCV genotype 1 and 2 replicon cell lines. Both in silico-designed siRNAs efficiently inhibited HCV RNA replication, even at low concentrations and for short exposure times (24h); they also exceeded the antiviral potencies of reference siRNAs targeting HCV. Furthermore, HCV353 and HCV258 siRNAs also inhibited replication of patient-derived HCV genotype 4 isolates in infected Huh-7 cells. Prolonged treatment of HCV replicon cells with HCV353 did not result in the appearance of escape mutant viruses. Taken together, these results reveal the accuracy and strength of our integrated siRNA design and selection protocols. These protocols could be used to design highly potent and specific RNAi-based therapeutic oligonucleotide interventions.",

Herein, we evaluated efficacy and safety of splice factor-based treatments to correct mutation-induced splice defects in an Opa1 mutant mouse line. We applied adeno-associated viruses to the retina. The viruses transduced retinal cells with an engineered U1 snRNA splice factor designed to correct the Opa1 splice defect. We found the treatment to be efficient in increasing wild-type Opa1 transcripts. Correspondingly, Opa1 protein levels increased significantly in treated eyes. Measurements of retinal morphology and function did not reveal therapy-related side-effects supporting the short-term safety of the treatment. Alterations of potential off-target genes were not detected. Our data suggest that treatments of splice defects applying engineered U1 snRNAs represent a promising in vivo therapeutic approach. The therapy increased wild-type Opa1 transcripts and protein levels without detectable morphological, functional or genetic side-effects in the mouse eye. The U1 snRNA-based therapy can be tailored to specific disease gene mutations, hence, raising the possibility of a wider applicability of this promising technology towards treatment of different inherited retinal diseases.",

However, the efficacy of each siRNA widely varies depending on its sequence in mammalian cells; only a limited fraction of randomly designed siRNAs is functional. Moreover, off-target silencing effects arise when the siRNA has partial complementarity in the seed region with unintended genes. Here, we describe the rational designing of functional, off-target effect-reduced siRNAs using siDirect 2.0 Web server (http://siDirect2.RNAi.jp/).

    "abstract": "Suicide genes have been widely investigated for their utility as therapeutic agents and as tools for in vitro negative selection strategies. Several methods for delivery of suicide genes have been explored. Two important considerations for delivery are the quantity of delivered cargo and the ability to target the cargo to specific cells. Delivery using a lentiviral vector is particularly attractive due to the ability to encode the gene within the viral genome, as well as the ability to limit off-target effects by using cell type-specific glycoproteins. Here, we present the design and validation of a diphtheria toxin A (DTA)-encoding lentiviral vector expressing DTA under the control of a constituitive promoter to allow for expression of DTA in a variety of cell types, with specificity provided via selection of glycoproteins for pseudotyping of the lentiviral particles. DTA exerts its toxic activity through inhibition of eukaryotic translation elongation factor 2 (eEF2) via adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribosylation of a modified histidine residue, diphthamide, at His715, which blocks protein translation and leads to cell death. Thus, we also detail development of DTA-resistant cell lines, engineered through CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of the diphthamide 1 (DPH1) gene, which enable both robust virus production by transfection and evaluation of DTA-expressing virus infectivity.",

Derived design rules enabled the identification of FTFOs that reduce c-Myc expression in the Del4 plasmid by up to 80%, significantly impairing cancer cell growth, confluence, mobility, and endogenous c-Myc expression. This work presents FTFOs as an innovative sequence-specific strategy for arresting G-quadruplex structures via triplex formation and suppressing oncogene activity, offering a promising avenue for targeted anticancer therapy.",

    "abstract": "Retinal gene therapy is leading the neurological gene therapy field, with 32 ongoing clinical trials of recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV)-based therapies. Importantly, over 50% of those trials are using restricted promoters from human genes. Promoters that restrict expression have demonstrated increased efficacy and can limit the therapeutic to the target cells thereby reducing unwanted off-target effects. Retinal ganglion cells are a critical target in ocular gene therapy; they are involved in common diseases such as glaucoma, rare diseases such as Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy, and in revolutionary optogenetic treatments. Here, we used computational biology and mined the human genome for the best genes from which to develop a novel minimal promoter element(s) designed for expression in restricted cell types (MiniPromoter) to improve the safety and efficacy of retinal ganglion cell gene therapy. Gene selection included the use of the first available droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing (Drop-seq) dataset, and promoter design was bioinformatically driven and informed by a wide range of genomics datasets. We tested seven promoter designs from four genes in rAAV for specificity and quantified expression strength in retinal ganglion cells in mouse, and then the single best in nonhuman primate retina. Thus, we developed a new human-DNA MiniPromoter, Ple345 (NEFL), which in combination with intravitreal delivery in rAAV9 showed specific and robust expression in the retinal ganglion cells of the nonhuman-primate rhesus macaque retina. In mouse, we also developed MiniPromoters expressing in retinal ganglion cells, the hippocampus of the brain, a pan neuronal pattern in the brain, and peripheral nerves. As single-cell transcriptomics such as Drop-seq become available for other cell types, many new opportunities for additional novel restricted MiniPromoters will present.",

    "abstract": "In this review, we have discussed expression systems employed for both transgene expression and post-transcriptional gene silencing. Although constitutive expression systems can function well for gene therapy protocols for simple Mendelian disorders, other protocols may require carefully designed systems that either ensure targeting to cells of interest or alternatively, transcription that is tightly regulated and conditionally activated. Indeed, it is of utmost importance to regulate expression of potentially immunogenic proteins, such as those encoded by suicide genes, to limit their immunogenic potential. Meanwhile, RNAi may be employed for therapeutic silencing of aberrant cellular or viral genes, but the potential for off-target effects due to activation of double-stranded RNA response pathways or undesired targeting of partial complementary sequences may necessitate carefully controlled and regulated expression of short hairpin RNAs. As we exhaust the current repertoire of simple promoter systems for transgene expression or for RNAi, we need to develop newer systems that combine the high activity of viral promoters with cell type specificity or conditionally active cis-elements. Novel combinations of promoter elements should be one approach for creating such regulated promoters.",

    "abstract": "Antisense oligonucleotide (ASO)-mediated exon skipping is an effective method for generating truncated proteins by altering mRNA splicing. This technique, enabling in situ truncation of proteins, provides a rapid way to investigate the functions of specific domains encoded by the targeted exon(s). In this methodological chapter, we focus on the mouse transcription factor ARID3A (AT-rich interactive domain 3A), which contains a DNA-binding domain (ARID domain) and a nuclear matrix-binding domain (Rekles Beta domain). We describe the design of an ASO targeting the donor splice site of Arid3a exon 8, which primarily encodes the Rekles beta domain, to generate a truncated protein lacking nuclear matrix-binding capacity while preserving an open reading frame. The ASO is specifically designed to hybridize only with Arid3a pre-mRNA, thus minimizing off-target effects. The effect of the ASO is evaluated first by RT-PCR to measure the proportion of alternative transcripts with skipped exon. Alternative transcripts can be subsequently characterized by Sanger sequencing. RT-qPCR is then performed outside the targeted exon to ensure that the overall transcription of the gene is unaffected and to exclude RNA degradation. Finally, protein analysis techniques, such as cellular imaging using immunofluorescence labeling, are used to assess the production of the truncated protein. This ASO-mediated exon skipping approach provides a reliable method for exploring the functional importance of specific protein domains.",

Previously we characterized siRNAs targeted to the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter at site 247, and found that a 21-base antisense strand of siRNA-247 (LTR-247as) suppressed LTR-mediated expression. To characterize the specificity of LTR-247as, vectors expressing antisense RNAs targeted to a region spanning 50 bases up- and downstream of the 247 target site were generated. LTR-247as+7, a approximately 22 base antisense RNA that is shifted by only seven bases upstream of LTR-247as, showed a significant increase in LTR-driven reporter gene expression that was independent of cell type and active chromatin methyl-marks. Promoter-targeting siRNAs have been recently shown to induce gene activation. However, here we demonstrate gene activation via a sequence-specific off-target effect. Microarray analysis of LTR-247as+7-treated cultures resulted in the deregulation of approximately 185 genes. A gene of unknown function, C10orf76, was responsive to inhibition by LTR-247as+7 and the loss of C10orf76 resulted in the upregulation of several genes that were activated by LTR-247as+7. These data suggest caution when using short antisense RNAs or siRNAs designed to target promoter sequences, since promoter-targeted RNAs may have unintended inhibitory effects against factors with suppressive gene activity.",

To study the function of Cped1 in the formation of SSCs, we successfully established a CRISPR/Cas9 knockout system. The gene disruption frequency is 37% in DF1 and 25% in ESCs without off-target effects. Knockout of Cped1 could significantly inhibit the formation of SSCs in vivo and in vitro The fragment of -1050 to -1 bp had the activity as Cped1 gene promoter. Histone acetylation could regulate the expression of Cped1. We added 5-azaeytidi (DNA methylation inhibitors) and TSA (histone deacetylase inhibitors) respectively during the cultivation of SSCs. TSA was validated to promote the transcription of Cped1. Dual-luciferase reporter assay revealed that active control area of the chicken Cped1 gene is -296 to -1 bp. There are Cebpb, Sp1, and Sox2 transcription factor binding sites in this region. Point-mutation experiment results showed that Sox2 negatively regulates the transcription of Cped1. Above results demonstrated that Cped1 is a key gene that regulates the formation of SSCs. Histone acetylation and transcription factor Sox2 participate in the regulation of Cped1.",

    "title": "Targeted DNA Methylation Using Modified DNA Probes: A Potential Therapeutic Tool for Depression and Stress-Related Disorders.",
    "abstract": "Epigenetic modifications play a crucial role in gene regulation and have been implicated in various physiological processes and disease conditions. DNA methylation (DNAm) has been implicated in the etiology and progression of many stress-related psychiatric behaviors, such as depression. The ability to manipulate DNAm may provide a means to reverse and treat such disorders. Although CRISPR-based technologies have enabled locus-specific DNAm editing, their clinical applicability may be limited due to immunogenicity concerns and off-target effects. In this study, we introduce a novel approach for targeted DNAm manipulation using single-stranded methylated DNA probes. The probes were designed against the GRE of FKBP5 and the promoter region of MAOA. In both human embryonic kidney HEK293 and mouse pituitary AtT-20 cells, transfection with their respective methylated probes significantly increased DNAm at targeted CpG sites in a persistent and dose-dependent manner. Importantly, the induced methylation effectively attenuated glucocorticoid-induced upregulation of FKBP5 gene expression. Alteration of methylation was specific to single-stranded probes, as double-stranded methylated probes and unmethylated probes showed no significant effects. Some limitations include the need to further characterize factors that influence probe efficiency, such as probe length and CpG density; develop an efficient in vivo probe delivery system; and perform a more extensive consideration of possible off-target effects. Despite these limitations, our findings suggest that methylated DNA probes have the potential to function as a simple tool for targeted epigenetic manipulation and serve as a safer alternative to CRISPR-based epigenome editing tools for the treatment of stress-related disorders such as depression.",

    "abstract": "Podocyte injury is a key event in glomerular disease leading to proteinuria and opening the path toward glomerular scarring. As a consequence, glomerular research strives to discover molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways affecting podocyte health. The hNphs2.Cre mouse model has been a valuable tool to manipulate podocyte-specific genes and to label podocytes for lineage tracing and purification. Here we designed a novel podocyte-specific tricistronic Cre mouse model combining codon improved Cre expression and fluorescent cell labeling with mTomato under the control of the endogenous Nphs2 promoter using viral T2A-peptides. Independent expression of endogenous podocin, codon improved Cre, and mTomato was confirmed by immunofluorescence, fluorescent activated cell sorting and protein analyses. Nphs2(pod.T2A.ciCre.T2A.mTomato/wild-type) mice developed normally and did not show any signs of glomerular disease or off-target effects under basal conditions and in states of disease. Nphs2(pod.T2A.ciCre.T2A.mTomato/wild-type)-mediated gene recombination was superior to conventional hNphs2.Cre mice-mediated gene recombination. Last, we compared Cre efficiency in a disease model by mating Nphs2(pod.T2A.ciCre.T2A.mTomato/wild-type) and hNphs2.Cre mice to Phb2(fl/fl) mice. The podocyte-specific Phb2 knockout by Nphs2(pod.T2A.ciCre.T2A.mTomato/wild-type) mice resulted in an aggravated glomerular injury as compared to a podocyte-specific Phb2 gene deletion triggered by hNphs2.Cre. Thus, we generated the first tricistronic podocyte mouse model combining enhanced Cre recombinase efficiency and fluorescent labeling in podocytes without the need for additional matings with conventional reporter mouse lines.",

Regulating TF binding in a gene specific manner remains a formidable challenge in drug discovery because the same binding motif may be present at multiple locations in the genome. Here, we present Onco-Regulon (http://www.scfbio-iitd.res.in/software/onco/NavSite/index.htm), an integrated database of regulatory motifs of cancer genes clubbed with Unique Sequence-Predictor (USP) a software suite that identifies unique sequences for each of these regulatory DNA motifs at the specified position in the genome. USP works by extending a given DNA motif, in 5'-->3', 3' -->5' or both directions by adding one nucleotide at each step, and calculates the frequency of each extended motif in the genome by Frequency Counter programme. This step is iterated till the frequency of the extended motif becomes unity in the genome. Thus, for each given motif, we get three possible unique sequences. Closest Sequence Finder program predicts off-target drug binding in the genome. Inclusion of DNA-Protein structural information further makes Onco-Regulon a highly informative repository for gene specific drug development. We believe that Onco-Regulon will help researchers to design drugs which will bind to an exclusive site in the genome with no off-target effects, theoretically.Database URL: http://www.scfbio-iitd.res.in/software/onco/NavSite/index.htm.",

    "title": "Glycogen synthase kinase-3beta regulates post-myocardial infarction remodeling and stress-induced cardiomyocyte proliferation in vivo.",
    "abstract": "RATIONALE: Numerous studies have proposed that glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3beta is a central regulator of the hypertrophic response of cardiomyocytes. However, all of this work has relied on overexpression of GSK-3beta, expression of constitutively active mutants, or small molecule inhibitors with documented off-target effects. Genetic loss of function approaches have not been used in the adult mouse because germ-line deletion of GSK-3beta is embryonic-lethal. OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to define the role played by GSK-3beta in pressure overload (PO)-induced hypertrophy and remodeling following myocardial infarction (MI). METHODS AND RESULTS: We used a mouse model that allows inducible, cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of GSK-3beta in the adult knockout. Surprisingly, we find that knockout mice exposed to PO induced by thoracic aortic constriction exhibit a normal hypertrophic response. Thus, in contrast to virtually all prior published studies, GSK-3beta appears to play at most a minor role in the hypertrophic response to PO stress. However, GSK-3beta does regulate post-MI remodeling because the GSK-3beta knockouts had less left ventricular dilatation and better-preserved left ventricular function at up to 8 weeks post-MI despite demonstrating significantly more hypertrophy in the remote myocardium. Deletion of GSK-3beta also led to increased cardiomyocyte proliferation following PO and MI. CONCLUSIONS: Deletion of GSK-3beta protects against post-MI remodeling and promotes stress-induced cardiomyocyte proliferation in the adult heart. These studies suggest that inhibition of GSK-3beta could be a strategy to both prevent remodeling and to promote cardiac regeneration in pathological states.",

    "title": "Identifying regulational alterations in gene regulatory networks by state space representation of vector autoregressive models and variational annealing.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In the analysis of effects by cell treatment such as drug dosing, identifying changes on gene network structures between normal and treated cells is a key task. A possible way for identifying the changes is to compare structures of networks estimated from data on normal and treated cells separately. However, this approach usually fails to estimate accurate gene networks due to the limited length of time series data and measurement noise. Thus, approaches that identify changes on regulations by using time series data on both conditions in an efficient manner are demanded. METHODS: We propose a new statistical approach that is based on the state space representation of the vector autoregressive model and estimates gene networks on two different conditions in order to identify changes on regulations between the conditions. In the mathematical model of our approach, hidden binary variables are newly introduced to indicate the presence of regulations on each condition. The use of the hidden binary variables enables an efficient data usage; data on both conditions are used for commonly existing regulations, while for condition specific regulations corresponding data are only applied. Also, the similarity of networks on two conditions is automatically considered from the design of the potential function for the hidden binary variables. For the estimation of the hidden binary variables, we derive a new variational annealing method that searches the configuration of the binary variables maximizing the marginal likelihood. RESULTS: For the performance evaluation, we use time series data from two topologically similar synthetic networks, and confirm that our proposed approach estimates commonly existing regulations as well as changes on regulations with higher coverage and precision than other existing approaches in almost all the experimental settings. For a real data application, our proposed approach is applied to time series data from normal Human lung cells and Human lung cells treated by stimulating EGF-receptors and dosing an anticancer drug termed Gefitinib. In the treated lung cells, a cancer cell condition is simulated by the stimulation of EGF-receptors, but the effect would be counteracted due to the selective inhibition of EGF-receptors by Gefitinib. However, gene expression profiles are actually different between the conditions, and the genes related to the identified changes are considered as possible off-targets of Gefitinib. CONCLUSIONS: From the synthetically generated time series data, our proposed approach can identify changes on regulations more accurately than existing methods. By applying the proposed approach to the time series data on normal and treated Human lung cells, candidates of off-target genes of Gefitinib are found. According to the published clinical information, one of the genes can be related to a factor of interstitial pneumonia, which is known as a side effect of Gefitinib.",

    "abstract": "Studies of 3D chromatin organization have suggested that chromosomes are hierarchically organized into large compartments composed of smaller domains called topologically associating domains (TADs). Recent evidence suggests that compartments are smaller than previously thought and that the transcriptional or chromatin state is responsible for interactions leading to the formation of small compartmental domains in all organisms. In vertebrates, CTCF forms loop domains, probably via an extrusion process involving cohesin. CTCF loops cooperate with compartmental domains to establish the 3D organization of the genome. The continuous extrusion of the chromatin fibre by cohesin may also be responsible for the establishment of enhancer-promoter interactions and stochastic aspects of the transcription process. These observations suggest that the 3D organization of the genome is an emergent property of chromatin and its components, and thus may not be only a determinant but also a consequence of its function.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Transcriptional reconfiguration is central to heart failure, the most common cause of which is dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). The effect of 3-dimensional chromatin topology on transcriptional dysregulation and pathogenesis in human DCM remains elusive. METHODS: We generated a compendium of 3-dimensional epigenome and transcriptome maps from 101 biobanked human DCM and nonfailing heart tissues through highly integrative chromatin immunoprecipitation (H3K27ac [acetylation of lysine 27 on histone H3]), in situ high-throughput chromosome conformation capture, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing, and RNA sequencing. We used human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes and mouse models to interrogate the key transcription factor implicated in 3-dimensional chromatin organization and transcriptional regulation in DCM pathogenesis. RESULTS: We discovered that the active regulatory elements (H3K27ac peaks) and their connectome (H3K27ac loops) were extensively reprogrammed in DCM hearts and contributed to transcriptional dysregulation implicated in DCM development. For example, we identified that nontranscribing NPPA-AS1 (natriuretic peptide A antisense RNA 1) promoter functions as an enhancer and physically interacts with the NPPA (natriuretic peptide A) and NPPB (natriuretic peptide B) promoters, leading to the cotranscription of NPPA and NPPB in DCM hearts. We revealed that DCM-enriched H3K27ac loops largely resided in conserved high-order chromatin architectures (compartments, topologically associating domains) and their anchors unexpectedly had equivalent chromatin accessibility. We discovered that the DCM-enriched H3K27ac loop anchors exhibited a strong enrichment for HAND1 (heart and neural crest derivatives expressed 1), a key transcription factor involved in early cardiogenesis. In line with this, its protein expression was upregulated in human DCM and mouse failing hearts. To further validate whether HAND1 is a causal driver for the reprogramming of enhancer-promoter connectome in DCM hearts, we performed comprehensive 3-dimensional epigenome mappings in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes. We found that forced overexpression of HAND1 in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes induced a distinct gain of enhancer-promoter connectivity and correspondingly increased the expression of their connected genes implicated in DCM pathogenesis, thus recapitulating the transcriptional signature in human DCM hearts. Electrophysiology analysis demonstrated that forced overexpression of HAND1 in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes induced abnormal calcium handling. Furthermore, cardiomyocyte-specific overexpression of Hand1 in the mouse hearts resulted in dilated cardiac remodeling with impaired contractility/Ca(2+) handling in cardiomyocytes, increased ratio of heart weight/body weight, and compromised cardiac function, which were ascribed to recapitulation of transcriptional reprogramming in DCM. CONCLUSIONS: This study provided novel chromatin topology insights into DCM pathogenesis and illustrated a model whereby a single transcription factor (HAND1) reprograms the genome-wide enhancer-promoter connectome to drive DCM pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "The composition of muscle fibers, characterized by distinct contractile and metabolic properties, significantly influences meat quality and glucose homeostasis. However, the mechanisms by which three-dimensional (3D) genome topology integrates with epigenetic states to regulate muscle fiber specification and transformation remain poorly understood. Here, we present an integrative analysis of the transcriptome, epigenome, and 3D genome architecture in the slow-twitch glycolytic extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and fast-twitch oxidative soleus (SOL) muscles of the pig (Sus scrofa). Global remodeling of enhancer-promoter (E-P) interactions emerged as a central driver of transcriptional reprogramming associated with muscle contraction and glucose metabolism. We identified tissue-specific super-enhancers (SEs) that regulate muscle fiber-type specification through cooperation of chromatin looping and transcription factors such as KLF5. Notably, the SE-driven activation of STARD7 facilitated the transformation of glycolytic fibers into oxidative fibers by mitigating reactive oxygen species levels and suppressing ERK MAPK signaling. This study elucidates the principles of 3D genome organization in the epigenetic regulation of muscle fiber specification and transformation, providing a foundation for novel therapeutic strategies targeting metabolic disorders and enhancing meat quality.",

Through large-scale epigenomic analyses, we show how sirtuin deficiency alters genome organization and that genomic regions sensitive to sirtuin deficiency are preferentially enriched in active enhancers, thereby promoting interactions within topologically associated domains and the formation of de novo enhancer-promoter loops. In all sirtuin-deficient human stem cell lines, we found that chromatin contacts are rewired to promote aberrant activation of the placenta-specific gene PAPPA, which controls the pro-senescence effects associated with sirtuin deficiency and serves as a potential aging biomarker. Based on our survey of the 3D chromatin architecture, we established connections between sirtuins and potential target genes, thereby informing the development of strategies for aging interventions.",

    "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) genome folding has a fundamental role in the regulation of developmental genes by facilitating or constraining chromatin interactions between cis-regulatory elements (CREs). Polycomb response elements (PREs) are a specific kind of CRE involved in the memory of transcriptional states in Drosophila melanogaster. PREs act as nucleation sites for Polycomb group (PcG) proteins, which deposit the repressive histone mark H3K27me3, leading to the formation of a class of topologically associating domain (TAD) called a Polycomb domain. PREs can establish looping contacts that stabilize the gene repression of key developmental genes during development. However, the mechanism by which PRE loops fine-tune gene expression is unknown. Using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and Cas9 genome engineering, we specifically perturbed PRE contacts or enhancer function and used complementary approaches including 4C-seq, Hi-C and Hi-M to analyze how chromatin architecture perturbation affects gene expression. Our results suggest that the PRE loop at the dac gene locus acts as a constitutive 3D chromatin scaffold during Drosophila development that forms independently of gene expression states and has a versatile function; it restricts enhancer-promoter communication and contributes to enhancer specificity.",

While enhancers regulate spatiotemporal gene expression, chromatin looping is a means for enhancer-promoter interactions yielding cell-type-specific gene expression. Further, non-canonical DNA secondary structures, such as G-quadruplexes (G4s), are related to increased gene expression. However, the role of G4s in promoter-distal regulatory elements, such as super-enhancers (SE), and in chromatin looping has remained elusive. Here we show that mature microRNA 9 (miR-9) is enriched at promoters and SE of genes that are inducible by transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFB1) signaling. Moreover, we find that miR-9 is required for formation of G4s, promoter-super-enhancer looping and broad domains of the euchromatin histone mark H3K4me3 at TGFB1-responsive genes. Our study places miR-9 in the same functional context with G4s and promoter-enhancer interactions during 3D genome organization and transcriptional activation induced by TGFB1 signaling, a critical signaling pathway in cancer and fibrosis.",

    "abstract": "Enhancers can regulate the promoters of their target genes over very large genomic distances. It is widely assumed that mechanisms of enhancer action involve the reorganization of three-dimensional chromatin architecture, but this is poorly understood. The predominant model involves physical enhancer-promoter interaction by looping out the intervening chromatin. However, studying the enhancer-driven activation of the Sonic hedgehog gene (Shh), we have identified a change in chromosome conformation that is incompatible with this simple looping model. Using super-resolution 3D-FISH and chromosome conformation capture, we observe a decreased spatial proximity between Shh and its enhancers during the differentiation of embryonic stem cells to neural progenitors. We show that this can be recapitulated by synthetic enhancer activation, is impeded by chromatin-bound proteins located between the enhancer and the promoter, and appears to involve the catalytic activity of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase. Our data suggest that models of enhancer-promoter communication need to encompass chromatin conformations other than looping.",

    "abstract": "It remains unclear why acute depletion of CTCF (CCCTC-binding factor) and cohesin only marginally affects expression of most genes despite substantially perturbing three-dimensional (3D) genome folding at the level of domains and structural loops. To address this conundrum, we used high-resolution Micro-C and nascent transcript profiling in mouse embryonic stem cells. We find that enhancer-promoter (E-P) interactions are largely insensitive to acute (3-h) depletion of CTCF, cohesin or WAPL. YY1 has been proposed as a structural regulator of E-P loops, but acute YY1 depletion also had minimal effects on E-P loops, transcription and 3D genome folding. Strikingly, live-cell, single-molecule imaging revealed that cohesin depletion reduced transcription factor (TF) binding to chromatin. Thus, although CTCF, cohesin, WAPL or YY1 is not required for the short-term maintenance of most E-P interactions and gene expression, our results suggest that cohesin may facilitate TFs to search for and bind their targets more efficiently.",

To understand the contribution of CTCF-mediated chromatin organization to cell lineage commitment, we analyzed 3D chromatin architecture during the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells into pancreatic islet organoids. We find that CTCF loops are formed and disassembled at different stages of the differentiation process by either recruitment of CTCF to new anchor sites or use of pre-existing sites not previously involved in loop formation. Recruitment of CTCF to new sites in the genome involves demethylation of H3K9me3 to H3K9me2, demethylation of DNA, recruitment of pioneer factors, and positioning of nucleosomes flanking the new CTCF sites. Existing CTCF sites not involved in loop formation become functional loop anchors via the establishment of new cohesin loading sites containing NIPBL and YY1 at sites between the new anchors. In both cases, formation of new CTCF loops leads to strengthening of enhancer promoter interactions and increased transcription of genes adjacent to loop anchors. These results suggest an important role for CTCF and cohesin in controlling gene expression during cell differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Healthy brain functioning requires a continuous fine-tuning of gene expression, involving changes in the epigenetic landscape and 3D chromatin organization. Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are three multifactorial neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) that are partially explained by genetics (gene mutations and genetic risk factors) and influenced by non-genetic factors (i.e., aging, lifestyle, and environmental conditions). Examining comprehensive studies of global and locus-specific (epi)genomic and transcriptomic alterations in human and mouse brain samples at the cell-type resolution has uncovered important phenomena associated with AD. First, DNA methylation and histone marks at promoters contribute to transcriptional dysregulation of genes that are directly implicated in AD pathogenesis (i.e., APP), neuroplasticity and cognition (i.e., PSD95), and microglial activation (i.e., TREM2). Second, the presence of AD genetic risk variants in cell-type-specific distal enhancers (i.e., BIN1 in microglia) alters transcription, presumably by disrupting associated enhancer-promoter interactions and chromatin looping. Third, epigenomic erosion is associated with widespread transcriptional disruption and cell identity loss. And fourth, aging, high cholesterol, air pollution, and pesticides have emerged as potential drivers of AD by inducing locus-specific and global epigenetic modifications that impact key AD-related pathways. Epigenetic studies in ALS/FTD also provide evidence that genetic and non-genetic factors alter gene expression profiles in neurons and astrocytes through aberrant epigenetic mechanisms. We additionally overview the recent development of potential new therapeutic strategies involving (epi)genetic editing and the use of small chromatin-modifying molecules (epidrugs).",

Studies in relatively simple in vitro and in vivo neuronal model systems have demonstrated that synaptic activity during development, or when induced by chemical stimuli (i.e., cLTP, KCl, picrotoxin), activates the NMDAR-Ca(2+)-CREB signaling pathway that upregulates gene expression through changes in the epigenetic landscape (i.e., histone marks and DNA methylation) and/or 3D chromatin organization. The data support a model in which epigenetic modifications in promoters and enhancers facilitate the priming and activation of these regulatory regions, hence leading to the formation of enhancer-promoter interactions (EPIs) through chromatin looping. The exploration of whether similar molecular mechanisms drive gene expression in learning and memory has presented notable challenges due to the distinct phases of learning and the activation of only sparse population of cells (the engram). Consequently, such studies demand precise temporal and spatial control. By combining activity-dependent engram tagging strategies (i.e., TRAP mice) with multi-omics analyses (i.e., RNA-seq, ChiP-seq, ATAC-seq, and Hi-C), it has been recently possible to associate changes in the epigenomic landscape and/or 3D genome architecture with transcriptional waves in engram cells of mice subjected to contextual fear conditioning (CFC), a relevant one-shot Pavlovian learning task. These studies support the role of specific epigenetic mechanisms and of the 3D chromatin organization during the control of gene transcription waves in engram cells. Advancements in our comprehension of the molecular mechanisms driving memory ensemble will undoubtedly play a crucial role in the development of better-targeted strategies to tackle cognitive diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia, among other information-processing disorders.",

    "abstract": "The chromatin organization in the 3D nuclear space is essential for genome functionality. This spatial organization encompasses different topologies at diverse scale lengths with chromosomes occupying distinct volumes and individual chromosomes folding into compartments, inside which the chromatin fiber is packed in large domains (as the topologically associating domains, TADs) and forms short-range interactions (as enhancer-promoter loops). The widespread adoption of high-throughput techniques derived from chromosome conformation capture (3C) has been instrumental in investigating the nuclear organization of chromatin. In particular, Hi-C has the potential to achieve the most comprehensive characterization of chromatin 3D structures, as in principle it can detect any pair of restriction fragments connected as a result of ligation by proximity. However, the analysis of the enormous amount of genomic data produced by Hi-C techniques requires the application of complex, multistep computational procedures that may constitute a difficult task also for expert computational biologists. In this chapter, we describe the computational analysis of Hi-C data obtained from the lymphoblastoid cell line GM12878, detailing the processing of raw data, the generation and normalization of the Hi-C contact map, the detection of TADs and chromatin interactions, and their visualization and annotation.",

To interrogate the full spectrum of chromatin folding ranging from the level of nucleosomes to full chromosomes in mammals, we developed an enhanced 3C-based method called Micro-C. The protocol employs Micrococcal nuclease (MNase) to fragment the genome, which overcomes the resolution limit of restriction enzyme-based methods, enabling the estimation of contact frequencies between proximal nucleosomes. Such improvements successfully resolve the fine-scale level of chromatin folding, including enhancer-promoter or promoter-promoter interactions, genic and nucleosomal folding, and boost the signal-to-noise ratio in detecting loops and substructures underlying TADs. In this chapter, we will thoroughly discuss the details of the Micro-C protocol and critical parameters to consider for generating high-quality Micro-C maps.",

Our understanding of long-range enhancer-promoter (E-P) communication, characterized as loops, remains incomplete without addressing the role of intervening chromatin. Here, we examine the topology of the entire Sonic hedgehog (Shh) regulatory domain in individual alleles from the mouse embryonic forebrain. Through sequential Oligopaint labeling and super-resolution microscopy, we find that the Shh locus maintains a compact structure that adopts several diverse configurations independent of Shh expression. The most frequent configuration contained distal E-P contacts at the expense of those more proximal to Shh, consistent with an interconnected loop. Genetic perturbations demonstrate that this long-range E-P communication operates by Shh-expression-independent and dependent mechanisms, involving CTCF binding sites and active enhancers, respectively. We propose a model whereby gene regulatory elements secure long-range E-P interactions amid an inherent architectural framework to coordinate spatiotemporal patterns of gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Several thousand sex-differential distal enhancers have been identified in mouse liver; however, their links to sex-biased genes and the impact of any sex-differences in nuclear organization and chromatin interactions are unknown. To address these issues, we first characterized 1847 mouse liver genomic regions showing significant sex differential occupancy by cohesin and CTCF, two key 3D nuclear organizing factors. These sex-differential binding sites were primarily distal to sex-biased genes but rarely generated sex-differential TAD (topologically associating domain) or intra-TAD loop anchors, and were sometimes found in TADs without sex-biased genes. A substantial subset of sex-biased cohesin-non-CTCF binding sites, but not sex-biased cohesin-and-CTCF binding sites, overlapped sex-biased enhancers. Cohesin depletion reduced the expression of male-biased genes with distal, but not proximal, sex-biased enhancers by >10-fold, implicating cohesin in long-range enhancer interactions regulating sex-biased genes. Using circularized chromosome conformation capture-based sequencing (4C-seq), we showed that sex differences in distal sex-biased enhancer-promoter interactions are common. Intra-TAD loops with sex-independent cohesin-and-CTCF anchors conferred sex specificity to chromatin interactions indirectly, by insulating sex-biased enhancer-promoter contacts and by bringing sex-biased genes into closer proximity to sex-biased enhancers. Furthermore, sex-differential chromatin interactions involving sex-biased gene promoters, enhancers, and lncRNAs were associated with sex-biased binding of cohesin and/or CTCF. These studies elucidate how 3D genome organization impacts sex-biased gene expression in a non-reproductive tissue through both direct and indirect effects of cohesin and CTCF looping on distal enhancer interactions with sex-differentially expressed genes.",

Enhancers play a fundamental role in the regulation of gene expression, but the molecular underpinnings of enhancer-mediated gene activation remain poorly understood. Many mammalian genes are dependent on the activity of multiple enhancers, which can be separated from their target genes by large genomic distances. Accurate gene regulation therefore relies on specific interactions between enhancers and their target genes in 3D nuclear space. In this review, we discuss recent insights into the mechanisms by which enhancers cooperate to regulate precise and robust gene expression levels. We also review recent progress in our understanding of the molecular drivers of specific 3D interactions between enhancers and their target genes. We conclude by discussing current models of the molecular mechanisms by which enhancers activate gene expression in their 3D chromatin context.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: CTCF is a key insulator-binding protein, and mammalian genomes contain numerous CTCF sites, many of which are organized in tandem. RESULTS: Using CRISPR DNA-fragment editing, in conjunction with chromosome conformation capture, we find that CTCF sites, if located between enhancers and promoters in the protocadherin (Pcdh) and beta-globin clusters, function as an enhancer-blocking insulator by forming distinct directional chromatin loops, regardless whether enhancers contain CTCF sites or not. Moreover, computational simulation in silico and genetic deletions in vivo as well as dCas9 blocking in vitro revealed balanced promoter usage in cell populations and stochastic monoallelic expression in single cells by large arrays of tandem CTCF sites in the Pcdh and immunoglobulin heavy chain (Igh) clusters. Furthermore, CTCF insulators promote, counter-intuitively, long-range chromatin interactions with distal directional CTCF sites, consistent with the cohesin \"loop extrusion\" model. Finally, gene expression levels are negatively correlated with CTCF insulators located between enhancers and promoters on a genome-wide scale. Thus, single CTCF insulators ensure proper enhancer insulation and promoter activation while tandem CTCF topological insulators determine balanced spatial contacts and promoter choice. CONCLUSIONS: These findings have interesting implications on the role of topological chromatin insulators in 3D genome folding and developmental gene regulation.",

    "abstract": "The genome is compacted in the nucleus through a hierarchical chromatin organization, ranging from chromosome territories to compartments, topologically associating domains (TADs), and individual nucleosomes. Nucleosome remodeling complexes hydrolyze ATP to translocate DNA and thereby mobilize histone proteins. While nucleosome remodeling complexes have been extensively studied for their roles in regulating nucleosome positioning and accessibility, their contributions to higher-order chromatin architecture remain less well understood. Here, we investigate the roles of two key nucleosome remodelers, esBAF and INO80C, in shaping 3D genome organization in mouse embryonic stem cells. Using Hi-C, we find that loss of either remodeler has minimal effects on global compartment or TAD structures. In contrast, subcompartment organization is notably altered, suggesting that esBAF and INO80C contribute to finer-scale chromatin topology. To overcome the limited resolution of Hi-C for detecting regulatory loops, we employed promoter capture Micro-C (PCMC), which revealed that the loss of esBAF or INO80C alters a subset of promoter anchored looping interactions. Although these changes occur at distinct genomic loci for each remodeler, the affected sites are commonly enriched for bivalent chromatin regions bound by OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG (OSN), as well as BRG1 and INO80 themselves. Together, our findings reveal that esBAF and INO80C selectively influence subcompartment identity and enhancer-promoter communication at key regulatory loci, highlighting a previously underappreciated role for nucleosome remodelers in higher-order chromatin organization.",

    "title": "Primary osteoarthritis chondrocyte map of chromatin conformation reveals novel candidate effector genes.",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Osteoarthritis is a complex disease with a huge public health burden. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of osteoarthritis-associated sequence variants, but the effector genes underpinning these signals remain largely elusive. Understanding chromosome organisation in three-dimensional (3D) space is essential for identifying long-range contacts between distant genomic features (e.g., between genes and regulatory elements), in a tissue-specific manner. Here, we generate the first whole genome chromosome conformation analysis (Hi-C) map of primary osteoarthritis chondrocytes and identify novel candidate effector genes for the disease. METHODS: Primary chondrocytes collected from 8 patients with knee osteoarthritis underwent Hi-C analysis to link chromosomal structure to genomic sequence. The identified loops were then combined with osteoarthritis GWAS results and epigenomic data from primary knee osteoarthritis chondrocytes to identify variants involved in gene regulation via enhancer-promoter interactions. RESULTS: We identified 345 genetic variants residing within chromatin loop anchors that are associated with 77 osteoarthritis GWAS signals. Ten of these variants reside directly in enhancer regions of 10 newly described active enhancer-promoter loops, identified with multiomics analysis of publicly available chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) and assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) data from primary knee chondrocyte cells, pointing to two new candidate effector genes SPRY4 and PAPPA (pregnancy-associated plasma protein A) as well as further support for the gene SLC44A2 known to be involved in osteoarthritis. For example, PAPPA is directly associated with the turnover of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) proteins, and IGF-1 is an important factor in the repair of damaged chondrocytes. CONCLUSIONS: We have constructed the first Hi-C map of primary human chondrocytes and have made it available as a resource for the scientific community. By integrating 3D genomics with large-scale genetic association and epigenetic data, we identify novel candidate effector genes for osteoarthritis, which enhance our understanding of disease and can serve as putative high-value novel drug targets.",

    "title": "Reorganization of 3D chromatin architecture in doxorubicin-resistant breast cancer cells.",
    "abstract": "Background: Doxorubicin resistance remains a major therapeutic challenge leading to poor survival prognosis and treatment failure in breast cancer. Although doxorubicin induces massive changes in the transcriptional landscape are well known, potential diagnostic or therapeutic targets associated with the reorganization of three-dimensional (3D) chromatin architecture have not yet been systematically investigated. Methods: Here we performed in situ high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) on parental and doxorubicin-resistant MCF7 (MCF7-DR) human breast cancer cells, followed by integrative analysis of HiC, ATAC-seq, RNA-seq and TCGA data. Results: It revealed that A/B compartment switching was positively correlated to genome-wide differential gene expression. The genome of MCF7-DR cells was spatially reorganized into smaller topologically associating domains (TADs) and chromatin loops. We also revealed the contribution of increased chromatin accessibility and potential transcription factor families, including CTCF, AP-1 and bHLH, to gained TADs or loops. Intriguingly, we observed two condensed genomic regions ( approximately 20 kb) with decreased chromatin accessibility flanking TAD boundaries, which might play a critical role in the formation or maintenance of TADs. Finally, combining data from TCGA, we identified a number of gained and lost enhancer-promoter interactions and their corresponding differentially expressed genes involved in chromatin organization and breast cancer signaling pathways, including FA2H, FOXA1 and JRKL, which might serve as potential treatment targets for breast cancer. Conclusion: These data uncovered a close connection between 3D genome reorganization, chromatin accessibility as well as gene transcription and provide novel insights into the epigenomic mechanisms involving doxorubicin resistance in breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "Evidence indicates that enhancers are transcriptionally active. Herein, we investigated transcriptionally active enhancers by using cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) combined with epigenetic marks and chromatin interactions. We identified CAGE-tag highly active (CHA) enhancers as distant regulatory elements with CAGE-tag >/= 90th percentile and overlapping with H3K27ac peaks (4.5% of enhancers). CHA enhancers were conserved between mouse and man and were independent from super-enhancers in predicting cell identity with lower P-values. CHA enhancers had increased open chromatin and a higher recruitment of cell-specific transcription factors as well as molecules involved in 3D genome interactions. HiChIP analysis of enhancer-promoter looping indicated that CHA enhancers had a higher density of anchor loops when compared to regular enhancers. A subset of CHA enhancers and promoters characterized by a high density of chromatin loops and forming hub regulatory units were connected to the promoter of immediate early response genes, genes involved in cancer and encoding for transcription factors. Promoter of genes within hub CHA regulatory units were less likely to be paused. CHA enhancers were enriched in gene variants associated with autoimmune disorders and had looping with causal candidate genes as revealed by Mendelian randomization. Hence, CHA enhancers form a dense hierarchical network of chromatin interactions between regulatory elements and genes involved in cell identity and disorders.",

    "abstract": "Chromatin looping is important for gene regulation, and studies of 3D chromatin structure across species and cell types have improved our understanding of the principles governing chromatin looping. However, 3D genome evolution and its relationship with natural selection remains largely unexplored. In mammals, the CTCF protein defines the boundaries of most chromatin loops, and variations in CTCF occupancy are associated with looping divergence. While many CTCF binding sites fall within transposable elements (TEs), their contribution to 3D chromatin structural evolution is unknown. Here we report the relative contributions of TE-driven CTCF binding site expansions to conserved and divergent chromatin looping in human and mouse. We demonstrate that TE-derived CTCF binding divergence may explain a large fraction of variable loops. These variable loops contribute significantly to corresponding gene expression variability across cells and species, possibly by refining sub-TAD-scale loop contacts responsible for cell-type-specific enhancer-promoter interactions.",

    "title": "Chromatin alternates between A and B compartments at kilobase scale for subgenic organization.",
    "abstract": "Nuclear compartments are prominent features of 3D chromatin organization, but sequencing depth limitations have impeded investigation at ultra fine-scale. CTCF loops are generally studied at a finer scale, but the impact of looping on proximal interactions remains enigmatic. Here, we critically examine nuclear compartments and CTCF loop-proximal interactions using a combination of in situ Hi-C at unparalleled depth, algorithm development, and biophysical modeling. Producing a large Hi-C map with 33 billion contacts in conjunction with an algorithm for performing principal component analysis on sparse, super massive matrices (POSSUMM), we resolve compartments to 500 bp. Our results demonstrate that essentially all active promoters and distal enhancers localize in the A compartment, even when flanking sequences do not. Furthermore, we find that the TSS and TTS of paused genes are often segregated into separate compartments. We then identify diffuse interactions that radiate from CTCF loop anchors, which correlate with strong enhancer-promoter interactions and proximal transcription. We also find that these diffuse interactions depend on CTCF's RNA binding domains. In this work, we demonstrate features of fine-scale chromatin organization consistent with a revised model in which compartments are more precise than commonly thought while CTCF loops are more protracted.",

    "abstract": "TAD boundaries are genomic elements that separate biological processes in neighboring domains by blocking DNA loops that are formed through Cohesin-mediated loop extrusion. Most TAD boundaries consist of arrays of binding sites for the CTCF protein, whose interaction with the Cohesin complex blocks loop extrusion. TAD boundaries are not fully impermeable though and allow a limited amount of inter-TAD loop formation. Based on the reanalysis of Nano-C data, a multicontact Chromosome Conformation Capture assay, we propose a model whereby clustered CTCF binding sites promote the successive stalling of Cohesin and subsequent dissociation from the chromatin. A fraction of Cohesin nonetheless achieves boundary read-through. Due to a constant rate of Cohesin dissociation elsewhere in the genome, the maximum length of inter-TAD loops is restricted though. We speculate that the DNA-encoded organization of stalling sites regulates TAD boundary permeability and discuss implications for enhancer-promoter loop formation and other genomic processes.",

Here, we developed simultaneous conformation and open-chromatin capture (SCOPE-C) to map open chromatin and its long-range spatial interactions from low-input samples. Applying SCOPE-C to fetal cortical cells from humans, macaques, and mice, we reveal that human neurogenesis is characterized by extended long-range (>1 megabase [Mb]) enhancer-promoter loops formed via CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) mediated loop extrusion. In human excitatory neurons (ENs), these interactions establish dynamic networks spanning up to 10 Mb. These networks are enriched with human-biased enhancers and neuropsychiatric disorder-linked single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) regulating key cell-fate genes such as SATB2. The formation of these vast, dynamic enhancer networks appears to be a prominent feature of human ENs, offering mechanistic insights into cortical evolution and the genetic vulnerability of neurodevelopmental regulation.",

Here we address the impact of genomic spacing on these enhancer:promoter interactions and on CFTR gene expression. Using CRISPR/Cas9, we generated clonal cell lines with deletions between the -35 kb airway enhancer and the CFTR promoter in the 16HBE14o(-) airway cell line, or between the intron 1 (185 + 10 kb) intestinal enhancer and the promoter in the Caco2 intestinal cell line. The effect of these deletions on CFTR transcript abundance, as well as the 3D looping structure of the locus was investigated in triplicate clones of each modification. Our results indicate that both small and larger deletions upstream of the promoter can perturb CFTR expression and -35 kb enhancer:promoter interactions in the airway cells, though the larger deletions are more impactful. In contrast, the small intronic deletions have no effect on CFTR expression and intron 1 enhancer:promoter interactions in the intestinal cells, whereas larger deletions do. Clonal variation following a specific CFTR modification is a confounding factor particularly in 16HBE14o(-) cells.",

Advances in chromosome conformation capture sequencing have enabled detailed assessment of chromatin architecture, from enhancer-promoter loops to topological domains and higher-order contacts, across cell types and developmental states. While the ability to investigate genome conformation is maturing, the field faces a central challenge: The link between chromatin interactions and cellular function remains largely correlative, leaving their causality unresolved. This review explores how recent developments in genome engineering enable the targeted manipulation of 3D chromatin architecture - specifically DNA loops - to illuminate causal links between genome structure and function. Synthetic strategies are introduced that rewire enhancer-promoter communication through engineered chromatin loops, leveraging programmable DNA-binding platforms such as zinc fingers, transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs), and CRISPR-Cas9. The current limitations of these approaches related to efficiency, scalability, and specificity are also highlighted, and the strategies to address them are outlined. As these systems mature, programmable 3D genome engineering is emerging as a transformative pillar of synthetic biology, complementing sequence-based editing as a core modality for both understanding and ultimately reprogramming genome function.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: EGFR amplification and/or mutation are found in more than half of the cases with glioblastoma. Yet, the role of chromatin interactions and its regulation of gene expression in EGFR-amplified glioblastoma remains unclear. METHODS: In this study, we explored alterations in 3D chromatin organization of EGFR-amplified glioblastoma and its subsequent impact by performing a comparative analysis of Hi-C, RNA-seq, and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) on EGFR-amplified glioblastoma-derived A172 and normal astrocytes (HA1800 cell line). RESULTS: A172 cells showed an elevated chromatin relaxation, and unexpected entanglement of chromosome regions. A genome-wide landscape of switched compartments and differentially expressed genes between HA1800 and A172 cell lines demonstrated that compartment activation reshaped chromatin accessibility and activated tumorigenesis-related genes. Topological associating domain (TAD) analysis revealed that altered TAD domains in A172 also contribute to oncogene activation and tumor repressor deactivation. Interestingly, glioblastoma-derived A172 cells showed a different chromatin loop contact propensity. Genes in tumorigenesis-associated signaling pathways were significantly enriched at the anchor loci of altered chromatin loops. Oncogene activation and tumor repressor deactivation were associated with chromatin loop alteration. Structure variations (SVs) had a dramatic impact on the chromatin conformation of EGFR-amplified glioblastoma-derived tumor cells. Moreover, our results revealed that 7p11.2 duplication activated EGFR expression in EGFR-amplified glioblastoma via neo-TAD formation and novel enhancer-promoter interaction emergence between LINC01446 and EGFR. CONCLUSIONS: The disordered 3D genomic map and multi-omics data of EGFR-amplified glioblastoma provide a resource for future interrogation of the relationship between chromatin interactions and transcriptome in tumorigenesis.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) relevant to osteoporosis have identified hundreds of loci; however, understanding how these variants influence the phenotype is complicated because most reside in non-coding DNA sequence that serves as transcriptional enhancers and repressors. To advance knowledge on these regulatory elements in osteoclasts (OCs), we performed Micro-C analysis, which informs on the genome topology of these cells and integrated the results with transcriptome and GWAS data to further define loci linked to BMD. Using blood cells isolated from 4 healthy participants aged 31-61 yr, we cultured OC in vitro and generated a Micro-C chromatin conformation capture dataset. We characterized chromatin loops (CLs) in OC from among more than 69 million chromatin interactions identified in the genome. Of the CL identified in OC, >16 000 were unique compared to precursor cells. When sentinel single nucleotide polymorphisms from osteoporosis and bone-related GWAS and those in linkage disequilibrium at r (2) > 0.6 were mapped to CL for OC, 12 588 of these variants were observed within chromatin contact regions. Notable in differential gene ontology enrichment analyses of the topology data for OC and precursors were pathways regulating pluripotency of stem cells, Wnt signaling, nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor signaling and chemokine signaling. These data, in combination with other 3D genome architecture and epigenetic data (eg, histone modifications and chromatin accessibility), will be useful in modeling to predict genome-wide, which enhancers regulate which genes in OC. This data will therefore also be informative for resolving GWAS hits. In conclusion, we have generated a high-resolution genome topology dataset for human OC and have used this to identify CLs relevant to studies of the genetics of osteoporosis. This data will serve as a powerful resource to inform future functional studies of OC biology.",

    "abstract": "Numerous pieces of evidence support the complex, 3D spatial organization of the genome dictates gene expression. CTCF is essential to define topologically associated domain boundaries and to facilitate the formation of insulated chromatin loop structures. To understand CTCF's direct role in global transcriptional regulation, we integrated the miniAID-mClover3 cassette to the endogenous CTCF locus in a human pediatric B-ALL cell line, SEM, and an immortal erythroid precursor cell line, HUDEP-2, to allow for acute depletion of CTCF protein by the auxin-inducible degron system. In SEM cells, CTCF loss notably disrupted intra-TAD loops and TAD integrity in concurrence with a reduction in CTCF-binding affinity, while showing no perturbation to nuclear compartment integrity. Strikingly, the overall effect of CTCF's loss on transcription was minimal. Whole transcriptome analysis showed hundreds of genes differentially expressed in CTCF-depleted cells, among which MYC and a number of MYC target genes were specifically downregulated. Mechanically, acute depletion of CTCF disrupted the direct interaction between the MYC promoter and its distal enhancer cluster residing  approximately 1.8 Mb downstream. Notably, MYC expression was not profoundly affected upon CTCF loss in HUDEP-2 cells suggesting that CTCF could play a B-ALL cell line specific role in maintaining MYC expression.",

Thirty-four previously unrecognized translocations and 44 translocation-mediated neo-loops are mapped by Hi-C analysis.

Importantly, both translocation-mediated neo-loops and NUP98-related fusions are associated with HOXA13 ectopic expressions.

Enhancer-promoter interactions could be relatively stable as cells transition from progenitor to differentiated states; alternatively, chromatin looping could be as dynamic as the gene expression from their loci. The intestinal epithelium is the most rapidly renewing mammalian tissue. Proliferative cells in crypts of Lieberkuhn sustain a stream of differentiated cells that are continually shed into the lumen. We apply chromosome conformation capture combined with chromatin immunoprecipitation (HiChIP) and sequencing to measure enhancer-promoter interactions in progenitor and differentiated cells of the intestinal epithelium. Despite dynamic gene regulation across the differentiation axis, we find that enhancer-promoter interactions are relatively stable. Functionally, we find HNF4 transcription factors are required for chromatin looping at target genes. Depletion of HNF4 disrupts local chromatin looping, histone modifications, and target gene expression.

EWS/FLI dysregulates transcription to induce and maintain sarcomagenesis, but the mechanisms utilized are not fully understood. We therefore sought to define the global effects of EWS/FLI on chromatin conformation and transcription in Ewing sarcoma cells using a well-validated 'knock-down/rescue' model of EWS/FLI function in combination with next generation sequencing assays to evaluate how the chromatin landscape changes with loss, and recovery, of EWS/FLI expression. We found that EWS/FLI (and EWS/ERG) genomic localization is largely conserved across multiple patient-derived Ewing sarcoma cell lines. This EWS/FLI binding signature is associated with establishment of topologically-associated domain (TAD) boundaries, compartment activation, enhancer-promoter looping that involve both intra- and inter-TAD interactions, and gene activation. In addition, EWS/FLI co-localizes with the loop-extrusion factor cohesin to promote chromatin loops and TAD boundaries. Importantly, local chromatin features provide the basis for transcriptional heterogeneity in regulation of direct EWS/FLI target genes across different Ewing sarcoma cell lines. These data demonstrate a key role of EWS/FLI in mediating genome-wide changes in chromatin configuration and support the notion that fusion transcription factors serve as master regulators of three-dimensional reprogramming of chromatin.",

Here, we developed a computational pipeline able to classify all CTCF-CTCF pairs according to their chromatin interactions from Hi-C experiments. The interaction profiles of all CTCF-CTCF pairs were further structurally clustered using self-organizing feature maps and their functionality characterized by their epigenetic states. The resulting clusters were then input to a convolutional neural network aiming at the de novo detecting chromatin loops from Hi-C interaction matrices. Our new method, called LOOPbit, is able to automatically detect significant interactions with a higher proportion of enhancer-promoter loops compared to other callers. Our highly specific loop caller adds a new layer of detail to the link between chromatin structure and function.",

    "abstract": "The molecular subtypes of pancreatic cancer (PC), either classical/progenitor-like or basal/squamous-like, are currently a major topic of research because of their direct association with clinical outcomes. Some transcription factors (TFs) have been reported to be associated with these subtypes. However, the mechanisms by which these molecular signatures of PCs are established remain unknown. Epigenetic regulatory processes, supported by dynamic changes in the chromatin structure, are essential for transcriptional profiles. Previously, we reported the importance of open chromatin profiles in the biological features and transcriptional status of PCs. Here, we aimed to analyze the relationships between three-dimensional (3D) genome structures and the molecular subtypes of human PCs using Hi-C analysis. We observed a correlation of the specific elements of 3D genome modules, including compartments, topologically associating domains, and enhancer-promoter loops, with the expression of related genes. We focused on HNF1B, a TF that is implicated in the progenitor subtype. Forced expression of HNF1B in squamous-type PC organoids induced the upregulation and downregulation of genes associated with progenitor and squamous subtypes, respectively. Long-range genomic interactions induced by HNF1B were accompanied by compartment modulation and H3K27ac redistribution. We also found that these HNF1B-induced changes in subtype-related gene expression required an intrinsically disordered region, suggesting a possible involvement of phase separation in compartment modulation. Thus, mapping of 3D structural changes induced by TFs, such as HNF1B, may become a useful resource for further understanding the molecular features of PCs.",

    "abstract": "Senescence is a state of stable proliferative arrest, generally accompanied by the senescence-associated secretory phenotype, which modulates tissue homeostasis. Enhancer-promoter interactions, facilitated by chromatin loops, play a key role in gene regulation but their relevance in senescence remains elusive. Here, we use Hi-C to show that oncogenic RAS-induced senescence in human diploid fibroblasts is accompanied by extensive enhancer-promoter rewiring, which is closely connected with dynamic cohesin binding to the genome. We find de novo cohesin peaks often at the 3' end of a subset of active genes. RAS-induced de novo cohesin peaks are transcription-dependent and enriched for senescence-associated genes, exemplified by IL1B, where de novo cohesin binding is involved in new loop formation. Similar IL1B induction with de novo cohesin appearance and new loop formation are observed in terminally differentiated macrophages, but not TNFalpha-treated cells. These results suggest that RAS-induced senescence represents a cell fate determination-like process characterised by a unique gene expression profile and 3D genome folding signature, mediated in part through cohesin redistribution on chromatin.",

We identified cell-type-specific, disease-associated candidate cis-regulatory elements and their candidate target genes, including an oligodendrocyte-associated regulatory module containing links to APOE and CLU. We describe cis-regulatory relationships in specific cell types at a subset of AD risk loci defined by genome-wide association studies, demonstrating the utility of this multi-omic single-nucleus approach. Trajectory analysis of glial populations identified disease-relevant transcription factors, such as SREBF1, and their regulatory targets.

Tumor chromatin accessibility is strongly influenced by copy number alterations that can be used to identify subclones, yet underlying cis-regulatory landscapes retain cancer type-specific features. Using organ-matched healthy tissues, we identified the \"nearest healthy\" cell types in diverse cancers, demonstrating that the chromatin signature of basal-like-subtype breast cancer is most similar to secretory-type luminal epithelial cells. Neural network models trained to learn regulatory programs in cancer revealed enrichment of model-prioritized somatic noncoding mutations near cancer-associated genes, suggesting that dispersed, nonrecurrent, noncoding mutations in cancer are functional. Overall, these data and interpretable gene regulatory models for cancer and healthy tissue provide a framework for understanding cancer-specific gene regulation.",

Disruption of this vast collection of intercellular and intracellular programs leads to pregnancy complications and developmental defects. In the present study, we generated a comprehensive, spatially resolved, multimodal cell census elucidating the molecular architecture of the first trimester human placenta. We utilized paired single-nucleus (sn)ATAC (assay for transposase accessible chromatin) sequencing and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), spatial snATAC-seq and RNA-seq, and in situ sequencing and hybridization mapping of transcriptomes at molecular resolution to spatially reconstruct the joint epigenomic and transcriptomic regulatory landscape. Paired analyses unraveled intricate tumor-like gene expression and transcription factor motif programs potentially sustaining the placenta in a hostile uterine environment; further investigation of gene-linked cis-regulatory elements revealed heightened regulatory complexity that may govern trophoblast differentiation and placental disease risk. Complementary spatial mapping techniques decoded these programs within the placental villous core and extravillous trophoblast cell column architecture while simultaneously revealing niche-establishing transcriptional elements and cell-cell communication. Finally, we computationally imputed genome-wide, multiomic single-cell profiles and spatially characterized the placental chromatin accessibility landscape. This spatially resolved, single-cell multiomic framework of the first trimester human placenta serves as a blueprint for future studies on early placental development and pregnancy.",

    "abstract": "Improving effector activity of antigen-specific T cells is a major goal in cancer immunotherapy. Despite the identification of several effector T cell (T(EFF))-driving transcription factors (TFs), the transcriptional coordination of T(EFF) biology remains poorly understood. We developed an in vivo T cell CRISPR screening platform and identified a key mechanism restraining T(EFF) biology through the ETS family TF, Fli1. Genetic deletion of Fli1 enhanced T(EFF) responses without compromising memory or exhaustion precursors. Fli1 restrained T(EFF) lineage differentiation by binding to cis-regulatory elements of effector-associated genes. Loss of Fli1 increased chromatin accessibility at ETS:RUNX motifs, allowing more efficient Runx3-driven T(EFF) biology. CD8(+) T cells lacking Fli1 provided substantially better protection against multiple infections and tumors. These data indicate that Fli1 safeguards the developing CD8(+) T cell transcriptional landscape from excessive ETS:RUNX-driven T(EFF) cell differentiation. Moreover, genetic deletion of Fli1 improves T(EFF) differentiation and protective immunity in infections and cancer.",

    "abstract": "A major driving force behind the evolution of species-specific traits and novel structures is alterations in gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Comprehending evolution therefore requires an understanding of the nature of changes in GRN structure and the responsible mechanisms. Here, we review two insect pigmentation GRNs in order to examine common themes in GRN evolution and to reveal some of the challenges associated with investigating changes in GRNs across different evolutionary distances at the molecular level. The pigmentation GRN in Drosophila melanogaster and other drosophilids is a well-defined network for which studies from closely related species illuminate the different ways co-option of regulators can occur. The pigmentation GRN for butterflies of the Heliconius species group is less fully detailed but it is emerging as a useful model for exploring important questions about redundancy and modularity in cis-regulatory systems. Both GRNs serve to highlight the ways in which redeployment of trans-acting factors can lead to GRN rewiring and network co-option. To gain insight into GRN evolution, we discuss the importance of defining GRN architecture at multiple levels both within and between species and of utilizing a range of complementary approaches.",

We develop a framework to detect perturbation-dependent changes in polyadenylation and characterize modules of co-regulated polyA sites. We find groups of intronic polyA sites regulated by distinct components of the nuclear RNA life cycle, including elongation, splicing, termination, and surveillance. We train and validate a deep neural network (APARENT-Perturb) for tandem polyA site usage, delineating a cis-regulatory code that predicts perturbation response and reveals interactions between regulatory complexes.

Here we investigated the gene regulatory programs in the primary motor cortex of human, macaque, marmoset and mouse using single-cell multiomics assays, generating gene expression, chromatin accessibility, DNA methylome and chromosomal conformation profiles from a total of over 200,000 cells. From these data, we show evidence that divergence of transcription factor expression corresponds to species-specific epigenome landscapes. We find that conserved and divergent gene regulatory features are reflected in the evolution of the three-dimensional genome. Transposable elements contribute to nearly 80% of the human-specific candidate cis-regulatory elements in cortical cells. Through machine learning, we develop sequence-based predictors of candidate cis-regulatory elements in different species and demonstrate that the genomic regulatory syntax is highly preserved from rodents to primates. Finally, we show that epigenetic conservation combined with sequence similarity helps to uncover functional cis-regulatory elements and enhances our ability to interpret genetic variants contributing to neurological disease and traits.",

    "abstract": "Lineage-ambiguous leukemias are high-risk malignancies of poorly understood genetic basis. Here, we describe a distinct subgroup of acute leukemia with expression of myeloid, T lymphoid, and stem cell markers driven by aberrant allele-specific deregulation of BCL11B, a master transcription factor responsible for thymic T-lineage commitment and specification. Mechanistically, this deregulation was driven by chromosomal rearrangements that juxtapose BCL11B to superenhancers active in hematopoietic progenitors, or focal amplifications that generate a superenhancer from a noncoding element distal to BCL11B. Chromatin conformation analyses demonstrated long-range interactions of rearranged enhancers with the expressed BCL11B allele and association of BCL11B with activated hematopoietic progenitor cell cis-regulatory elements, suggesting BCL11B is aberrantly co-opted into a gene regulatory network that drives transformation by maintaining a progenitor state. These data support a role for ectopic BCL11B expression in primitive hematopoietic cells mediated by enhancer hijacking as an oncogenic driver of human lineage-ambiguous leukemia. SIGNIFICANCE: Lineage-ambiguous leukemias pose significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges due to a poorly understood molecular and cellular basis. We identify oncogenic deregulation of BCL11B driven by diverse structural alterations, including de novo superenhancer generation, as the driving feature of a subset of lineage-ambiguous leukemias that transcend current diagnostic boundaries.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 2659.",

Application to a human embryonic kidney cell line identified close to 800 proteins.

Protein occupancy profiling provides a transcriptome-wide catalog of potential cis-regulatory regions on mammalian mRNAs and showed that large stretches in 3' UTRs can be contacted by the mRNA-bound proteome, with numerous putative binding sites in regions harboring disease-associated nucleotide polymorphisms.

    "abstract": "Deuterostomes are one major group of bilaterians composed by hemichordates and echinoderms (collectively called Ambulacraria) and chordates. Comparative studies between these groups can provide valuable insights into the nature of the last common ancestor of deuterostomes and that of bilaterians. Indirect development of hemichordates, with larval phases similar to echinoderms and an adult body plan with an anteroposterior polarity like chordates and other bilaterians, makes them a suitable model for studying the molecular basis of development among deuterostomes. However, a comprehensive, quantitative catalogue of gene expression and chromatin dynamics in hemichordates is still lacking. In this study, we analysed the transcriptomes and chromatin accessibility of multiple developmental stages of the indirect-developing hemichordate Ptychodera flava. We observed that P. flava development is underpinned by a biphasic transcriptional program probably controlled by distinct genetic networks. Comparisons with other bilaterian species revealed similar transcriptional and regulatory dynamics during hemichordate gastrulation, cephalochordate neurulation and elongation stages of annelids. By means of regulatory networks analysis and functional validations by transgenesis experiments in echinoderms, we propose that gastrulation is the stage of highest molecular resemblance in deuterostomes and that much of the molecular basis of deuterostome development was probably present in the bilaterian last common ancestor.",

In most eukaryotic plants, transcription factor (TF) families (WRKY, MADS-box and MYB) activate unique cellular-level abiotic and biotic stress-responsive strategies, which are considered as key determinants for defense and developmental processes. Arabidopsis and rice are two important representative model systems for dicot and monocot plants, respectively. A comprehensive comparative study on 101 OsWRKY, 34 OsMADS box and 122 OsMYB genes (rice genome) and, 71 AtWRKY, 66 AtMADS box and 144 AtMYB genes (Arabidopsis genome) showed various relationships among TFs across species. The phylogenetic analysis clustered WRKY, MADS-box and MYB TF family members into 10, 7 and 14 clades, respectively. All clades in WRKY and MYB TF families and almost half of the total number of clades in the MADS-box TF family are shared between both species. Chromosomal and gene structure analysis showed that the Arabidopsis-rice orthologous TF gene pairs were unevenly localized within their chromosomes whilst the distribution of exon-intron gene structure and motif conservation indicated plausible functional similarity in both species. The abiotic and biotic stress-responsive cis-regulatory element type and distribution patterns in the promoter regions of Arabidopsis and rice WRKY, MADS-box and MYB orthologous gene pairs provide better knowledge on their role as conserved regulators in both species. Co-expression network analysis showed the correlation between WRKY, MADs-box and MYB genes in each independent rice and Arabidopsis network indicating their role in stress responsiveness and developmental processes.",

Here we performed RNA sequencing, assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq), chromatin immunoprecipitation with sequencing, whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, and chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) experiments in up to eleven adult and two embryonic tissues to generate a comprehensive map of transcriptomes, cis-regulatory elements, heterochromatin, methylomes and 3D genome organization in the zebrafish Tubingen reference strain. A comparison of zebrafish, human and mouse regulatory elements enabled the identification of both evolutionarily conserved and species-specific regulatory sequences and networks. We observed enrichment of evolutionary breakpoints at topologically associating domain boundaries, which were correlated with strong histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) and CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) signals. We performed single-cell ATAC-seq in zebrafish brain, which delineated 25 different clusters of cell types.

We examined the connection between TFs, accessible regions, and gene expression across the genome throughout hematopoietic differentiation. We discovered that variants within TF-sensitive accessible chromatin regions in erythroid differentiation, although representing <0.3% of the genome, show a ~100-fold enrichment for blood cell phenotype heritability, which is substantially higher than that for other accessible chromatin regions. Our approach facilitates large-scale mechanistic understanding of phenotype-associated genetic variants by connecting key cis-regulatory elements and their target genes within gene regulatory networks.",

    "abstract": "Gene expression is controlled by interactions between trans-regulatory factors and cis-regulatory DNA sequences, and these interactions constitute the essential functional linkages of gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Validation of GRN models requires experimental cis-regulatory tests of predicted linkages to authenticate their identities and proposed functions. However, cis-regulatory analysis is, at present, at a severe bottleneck in genomic system biology because of the demanding experimental methodologies currently in use for discovering cis-regulatory modules (CRMs), in the genome, and for measuring their activities. Here we demonstrate a high-throughput approach to both discovery and quantitative characterization of CRMs. The unique aspect is use of DNA sequence tags to \"barcode\" CRM expression constructs, which can then be mixed, injected together into sea urchin eggs, and subsequently deconvolved. This method has increased the rate of cis-regulatory analysis by >100-fold compared with conventional one-by-one reporter assays. The utility of the DNA-tag reporters was demonstrated by the rapid discovery of 81 active CRMs from 37 previously unexplored sea urchin genes. We then obtained simultaneous high-resolution temporal characterization of the regulatory activities of more than 80 CRMs. On average 2-3 CRMs were discovered per gene. Comparison of endogenous gene expression profiles with those of the CRMs recovered from each gene showed that, for most cases, at least one CRM is active in each phase of endogenous expression, suggesting that CRM recovery was comprehensive. This approach will qualitatively alter the practice of GRN construction as well as validation, and will impact many additional areas of regulatory system biology.",

    "abstract": "Modularity and hierarchy are important theoretical concepts in biology, and both are useful frameworks to understand the evolution of complex systems. Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) provide a powerful mechanistic model for modularity in animal development, as they are made up of modular (or self-contained) circuits, which are deployed in a hierarchical manner over time. Over the years, studies in the sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, have provided an illustrative example of how these regulatory circuits are responsible for processes such as cell differentiation and cell state specificity. However, GRNs are themselves made up of a nested series of interactions, as each gene can be regulated by multiple cis-regulatory elements, which can be further broken down into distinct transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). As a result, modularity can be applied to each \"level\" of this complex hierarchy. Throughout the literature, there is considerable discussion about the roles modular circuits, modular enhancers, and modular TFBS play in evolution, yet there is little discussion about how these nested interactions operate as a whole. In this chapter, we discuss how modular changes at different levels of the GRN hierarchy affect animal development and aim to provide a unified framework to understand the role of modularity in evolution.",

    "abstract": "Osteosarcoma is a relatively uncommon tumor that is defined histologically by malignant cells developing osteoid. Osteosarcomas are mesenchymal cell tumors that cause abnormal bone growth. A combination of genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors leads mesenchymal stem cells to develop into bone precursor cells, resulting in osteosarcoma. Only tumor suppressor genes, such as p53, Rb, RECQL4, BLM, and WRN, have been detected in inherited family illnesses with an OS susceptibility. These genes, in particular, play an essential role in the development of OS in individuals. In this research, core genes responsible for OS were determined using a microarray and systems biology. 234 genes encoding overexpression and down-regulation were identified, among which 60 were considered as key genes, many of which had known roles in bone growth. Transcriptional regulatory networks were developed with this data and subsequently partitioned to define cis-regulatory modules. Results indicate that several OS-specific genes have strongly conserved the clustering of bone-related cis-regulatory modules, thus promoting the hypothesis that a bone-related gene network is essential for understanding OS biology and may play a role in bone contractility and anomalies.",

    "abstract": "Relatively little is known about the mechanisms through which gene expression regulation evolves. To investigate this, we systematically explored the conservation of regulatory networks in fungi by examining the cis-regulatory elements that govern the expression of coregulated genes. We first identified groups of coregulated Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes enriched for genes with known upstream or downstream cis-regulatory sequences. Reasoning that many of these gene groups are coregulated in related species as well, we performed similar analyses on orthologs of coregulated S. cerevisiae genes in 13 other ascomycete species. We find that many species-specific gene groups are enriched for the same flanking regulatory sequences as those found in the orthologous gene groups fromS. cerevisiae, indicating that those regulatory systems have been conserved in multiple ascomycete species. In addition to these clear cases of regulatory conservation, we find examples of cis-element evolution that suggest multiple modes of regulatory diversification, including alterations in transcription factor-binding specificity, incorporation of new gene targets into an existing regulatory system, and cooption of regulatory systems to control a different set of genes. We investigated one example in greater detail by measuring the in vitro activity of the S. cerevisiae transcription factor Rpn4p and its orthologs from Candida albicans and Neurospora crassa. Our results suggest that the DNA binding specificity of these proteins has coevolved with the sequences found upstream of the Rpn4p target genes and suggest that Rpn4p has a different function in N. crassa.",

The cells of the territory express the same transcriptional regulatory state, and the intra-territorial signaling is essential to maintenance of this specific regulatory state. The structure of the underlying gene regulatory network (GRN) subcircuitry explains the genomically wired mechanism by which community effect signaling is linked to the continuing transcriptional generation of the territorial regulatory state. A clear example is afforded by the oral ectoderm GRN of the sea urchin embryo where cis-regulatory evidence, experimental embryology, and network analysis combine to provide a complete picture. We review this example and consider less well known but similar cases in other developing systems where the same subcircuit GRN topology is present. To resolve mechanistic issues that arise in considering how community effect signaling could operate to produce its observed effects, we construct and analyze the behavior of a quantitative model of community effect signaling in the sea urchin embryo oral ectoderm. Community effect network topology could constitute part of the genomic regulatory code that defines transcriptional function in multicellular tissues composed of cells in contact, and hence may have arisen as a metazoan developmental strategy.",

    "abstract": "Wound response programs are often activated during neoplastic growth in tumors. In both wound repair and tumor growth, cells respond to acute stress and balance the activation of multiple programs, including apoptosis, proliferation, and cell migration. Central to those responses are the activation of the JNK/MAPK and JAK/STAT signaling pathways. Yet, to what extent these signaling cascades interact at the cis-regulatory level and how they orchestrate different regulatory and phenotypic responses is still unclear. Here, we aim to characterize the regulatory states that emerge and cooperate in the wound response, using the Drosophila melanogaster wing disc as a model system, and compare these with cancer cell states induced by ras(V12)scrib(-/-) in the eye disc. We used single-cell multiome profiling to derive enhancer gene regulatory networks (eGRNs) by integrating chromatin accessibility and gene expression signals. We identify a 'proliferative' eGRN, active in the majority of wounded cells and controlled by AP-1 and STAT. In a smaller, but distinct population of wound cells, a 'senescent' eGRN is activated and driven by C/EBP-like transcription factors (Irbp18, Xrp1, Slow border, and Vrille) and Scalloped. These two eGRN signatures are found to be active in tumor cells at both gene expression and chromatin accessibility levels. Our single-cell multiome and eGRNs resource offers an in-depth characterization of the senescence markers, together with a new perspective on the shared gene regulatory programs acting during wound response and oncogenesis.",

    "abstract": "One of the central concerns of Evolutionary Developmental biology is to understand how the specification of cell types can change during evolution. In the last decade, developmental biology has progressed toward a systems level understanding of cell specification processes. In particular, the focus has been on determining the regulatory interactions of the repertoire of genes that make up gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Echinoderms provide an extraordinary model system for determining how GRNs evolve. This review highlights the comparative GRN analyses arising from the echinoderm system. This work shows that certain types of GRN subcircuits or motifs, i.e., those involving positive feedback, tend to be conserved and may provide a constraint on development. This conservation may be due to a required arrangement of transcription factor binding sites in cis regulatory modules. The review will also discuss ways in which novelty may arise, in particular through the co-option of regulatory genes and subcircuits. The development of the sea urchin larval skeleton, a novel feature that arose in echinoderms, has provided a model for study of co-option mechanisms. Finally, the types of GRNs that can permit the great diversity in the patterns of ciliary bands and their associated neurons found among these taxa are discussed. The availability of genomic resources is rapidly expanding for echinoderms, including genome sequences not only for multiple species of sea urchins but also a species of sea star, sea cucumber, and brittle star. This will enable echinoderms to become a particularly powerful system for understanding how developmental GRNs evolve.",

The regulation of gene activity by cis-acting elements (e.g., enhancers) is a crucial mechanism for determining differential gene activity by precise control of gene expression in embryonic space and time. Modifications to regulatory regions can have profound impacts on phenotype, and therefore developmental and evolutionary biologists have increasingly focused on elucidating the transcriptional control of genes that build and pattern body plans. Here, we trace the evolutionary history of transcriptional control of three loci key to vertebrate appendage development (Fgf8, Shh, and HoxD/A). Within and across these regulatory modules, we find both complex and flexible regulation in contrast with more fixed enhancers that appear unchanged over vast timescales of vertebrate evolution. The transcriptional control of vertebrate appendage development was likely already incredibly complex in the common ancestor of fish, implying that subtle changes to regulatory networks were more likely responsible for alterations in phenotype rather than the de novo addition of whole regulatory domains. Finally, we discuss the dangers of relying on inter-species transgenesis when testing enhancer function, and call for more controlled regulatory swap experiments when inferring the evolutionary history of enhancer elements.",

    "abstract": "Organization and development of the early vertebrate hindbrain are controlled by a cascade of regulatory interactions that govern the process of segmentation and patterning along the anterior-posterior axis via Hox genes. These interactions can be assembled into a gene regulatory network that provides a framework to interpret experimental data, generate hypotheses, and identify gaps in our understanding of the progressive process of hindbrain segmentation. The network can be broadly separated into a series of interconnected programs that govern early signaling, segmental subdivision, secondary signaling, segmentation, and ultimately specification of segmental identity. Hox genes play crucial roles in multiple programs within this network. Furthermore, the network reveals properties and principles that are likely to be general to other complex developmental systems. Data from vertebrate and invertebrate chordate models are shedding light on the origin and diversification of the network. Comprehensive cis-regulatory analyses of vertebrate Hox gene regulation have enabled powerful cross-species gene regulatory comparisons. Such an approach in the sea lamprey has revealed that the network mediating segmental Hox expression was present in ancestral vertebrates and has been maintained across diverse vertebrate lineages. Invertebrate chordates lack hindbrain segmentation but exhibit conservation of some aspects of the network, such as a role for retinoic acid in establishing nested Hox expression domains. These comparisons lead to a model in which early vertebrates underwent an elaboration of the network between anterior-posterior patterning and Hox gene expression, leading to the gene-regulatory programs for segmental subdivision and rhombomeric segmentation.

    "abstract": "Large amounts of effort have been invested in trying to understand how a single genome is able to specify the identity of hundreds of cell types. Inspired by some aspects of Caenorhabditis elegans biology, we implemented an in silico evolutionary strategy to produce gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that drive cell-specific gene expression patterns, mimicking the process of terminal cell differentiation. Dynamics of the gene regulatory networks are governed by a thermodynamic model of gene expression, which uses DNA sequences and transcription factor degenerate position weight matrixes as input. In a version of the model, we included chromatin accessibility. Experimentally, it has been determined that cell-specific and broadly expressed genes are regulated differently. In our in silico evolved GRNs, broadly expressed genes are regulated very redundantly and the architecture of their cis-regulatory modules is different, in accordance to what has been found in C. elegans and also in other systems. Finally, we found differences in topological positions in GRNs between these two classes of genes, which help to explain why broadly expressed genes are so resilient to mutations. Overall, our results offer an explanatory hypothesis on why broadly expressed genes are regulated so redundantly compared to cell-specific genes, which can be extrapolated to phenomena such as ChIP-seq HOT regions.",

    "abstract": "The regulatory genome controls genome activity throughout the life of an organism. This requires that complex information processing functions are encoded in, and operated by, the regulatory genome. Although much remains to be learned about how the regulatory genome works, we here discuss two cases where regulatory functions have been experimentally dissected in great detail and at the systems level, and formalized by computational logic models. Both examples derive from the sea urchin embryo, but assess two distinct organizational levels of genomic information processing. The first example shows how the regulatory system of a single gene, endo16, executes logic operations through individual transcription factor binding sites and cis-regulatory modules that control the expression of this gene. The second example shows information processing at the gene regulatory network (GRN) level. The GRN controlling development of the sea urchin endomesoderm has been experimentally explored at an almost complete level. A Boolean logic model of this GRN suggests that the modular logic functions encoded at the single-gene level show compositionality and suffice to account for integrated function at the network level. We discuss these examples both from a biological-experimental point of view and from a computer science-informational point of view, as both illuminate principles of how the regulatory genome works.",

Here, we perform CRISPRi screens of 260 rCREs in PCa cell lines.

We also show that cell-line-specific essential rCREs are enriched in the 8q24.21 region, with the rs11986220-containing rCRE regulating MYC and PVT1 expression, cell proliferation and tumorigenesis in a cell-line-specific manner, depending on DNA methylation-orchestrated occupancy of a CTCF binding site in between this rCRE and the MYC promoter. We demonstrate that CTCF deposition at this site as measured by DNA methylation level is highly variable in prostate specimens, and observe the MYC eQTL in the 8q24.21 locus in individuals with low CTCF binding.

We integrate this dataset into the larger BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network atlas, composed of millions of neurons, to link projection cell types to consensus clusters. Integration with spatial transcriptomics further assigns projection-enriched clusters to smaller source regions than the original dissections.

Perturbation of this cis-regulatory program affects sequential cell fate transitions in neural progenitors and the identity of their progeny. The temporal program operates in parallel to spatial patterning, ensuring the timely availability of regulatory elements for spatial determinants to direct cell-type-specific gene expression.

    "abstract": "In the signal transduction network, from the perception of stress signals to stress-responsive gene expression, various transcription factors and cis-regulatory elements in stress-responsive promoters coordinate plant adaptation to abiotic stresses. Among the AP2/ERF transcription factor family, group VII ERF (ERF-VII) genes, such as RAP2.12, RAP2.2, RAP2.3, AtERF73/HRE1, and AtERF71/HRE2, are known to be involved in the response to hypoxia in Arabidopsis. Notably, HRE2 has been reported to be involved in responses to hypoxia and osmotic stress. In this study, we dissected HRE2 promoter to identify hypoxia- and salt stress-responsive region(s). The analysis of the promoter deletion series of HRE2 using firefly luciferase and GUS as reporter genes indicated that the -116 to -2 region is responsible for both hypoxia and salt stress responses. Using yeast one-hybrid screening, we isolated HAT22/ABIG1, a member of the HD-Zip II subfamily, which binds to the -116 to -2 region of HRE2 promoter. Interestingly, HAT22/ABIG1 repressed the transcription of HRE2 via the EAR motif located in the N-terminal region of HAT22/ABIG1. HAT22/ABIG1 bound to the 5'-AATGATA-3' sequence, HD-Zip II-binding-like cis-regulatory element, in the -116 to -2 region of HRE2 promoter. Our findings demonstrate that the -116 to -2 region of HRE2 promoter contains both positive and negative cis-regulatory elements, which may regulate the expression of HRE2 in responses to hypoxia and salt stress and that HAT22/ABIG1 negatively regulates HRE2 transcription by binding to the HD-Zip II-binding-like element in the promoter region.",

    "title": "Inference of Developmental Gene Regulatory Networks Beyond Classical Model Systems: New Approaches in the Post-genomic Era.",
    "abstract": "The advent of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies has revolutionized the way we understand the transformation of genetic information into morphological traits. Elucidating the network of interactions between genes that govern cell differentiation through development is one of the core challenges in genome research. These networks are known as developmental gene regulatory networks (dGRNs) and consist largely of the functional linkage between developmental control genes, cis-regulatory modules, and differentiation genes, which generate spatially and temporally refined patterns of gene expression. Over the last 20 years, great advances have been made in determining these gene interactions mainly in classical model systems, including human, mouse, sea urchin, fruit fly, and worm. This has brought about a radical transformation in the fields of developmental biology and evolutionary biology, allowing the generation of high-resolution gene regulatory maps to analyze cell differentiation during animal development. Such maps have enabled the identification of gene regulatory circuits and have led to the development of network inference methods that can recapitulate the differentiation of specific cell-types or developmental stages. In contrast, dGRN research in non-classical model systems has been limited to the identification of developmental control genes via the candidate gene approach and the characterization of their spatiotemporal expression patterns, as well as to the discovery of cis-regulatory modules via patterns of sequence conservation and/or predicted transcription-factor binding sites. However, thanks to the continuous advances in HTS technologies, this scenario is rapidly changing. Here, we give a historical overview on the architecture and elucidation of the dGRNs. Subsequently, we summarize the approaches available to unravel these regulatory networks, highlighting the vast range of possibilities of integrating multiple technical advances and theoretical approaches to expand our understanding on the global gene regulation during animal development in non-classical model systems. Such new knowledge will not only lead to greater insights into the evolution of molecular mechanisms underlying cell identity and animal body plans, but also into the evolution of morphological key innovations in animals.",

    "abstract": "Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) are a family of endogenous retroviruses that comprise the ~8.93% of the human genome sequence, with a high proportion being human specific. The recent expansion of repeated HERV sequences has offered a framework for genetic and epigenetic innovation. In the current report, a systematic approach is implemented to catalogue regulatory elements within HERVs, as a roadmap to potential functions of HERV sequences in gene networks. ENCODE Project has offered a wealth of epigenetic data based on omics technologies. I analyzed the presence of HERV sequences on consensus cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) from ENCODE data. On the one side, HERVs are in 1 out of 9 cCREs (>100.000 cCREs in total), dispersed within the genome and present in cis-regulatory regions of ~81% of human genes, as calculated following gene enrichment analysis. On the other side, promoter-associated HERV cCREs are present adjacent to (in a 200 bp window) the transcription start sites of 256 human genes. Regulatory network production, followed by centrality analysis led to the discovery of 90 core genes containing HERV-associated promoters. Pathway analysis on the core network genes and their immediate neighbors revealed a regulatory footprint that, among others, is associated with inflammation, chemokine signaling and response to viral infection. Collectively, these results support the concept that the expansion of regulatory sequences derived from HERVs is critical for epigenetic innovation that may have wired together genes into novel transcriptional networks with critical roles in cellular physiology and pathology.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The osteocyte is a type of cell that appears to be one of the key endocrine regulators of bone metabolism and a key responder to initiate bone formation and remodeling. Identifying the regulatory networks in osteocytes may lead to new therapies for osteoporosis and loss of bone. RESULTS: Using microarray, we identified 269 genes over-expressed in osteocyte, many of which have known functions in bone and muscle differentiation and contractility. We determined the evolutionarily conserved and enriched TF binding sites in the 5 kb promoter regions of these genes. Using this data, a transcriptional regulatory network was constructed and subsequently partitioned to identify cis-regulatory modules. CONCLUSION: Our results show that many osteocyte-specific genes, including two well-known osteocyte markers DMP1 and Sost, have highly conserved clustering of muscle-related cis-regulatory modules, thus supporting the concept that a muscle-related gene network is important in osteocyte biology and may play a role in contractility and dynamic movements of the osteocyte.",

In this perspective, we discuss recent computational progress and challenges toward solving this fundamental problem. We describe how cis-regulatory elements are mapped with various genomics assays and how studies of the 3D chromatin organization could help identifying long-range regulatory effects. We discuss how the cis-regulatory sequence rules can be learned and interpreted with sequence-to-function neural networks, with the goal of identifying genetic variants in human disease. We also describe current methods for mapping gene regulatory networks to describe biological processes. We point out current gaps in knowledge along with technical limitations and benchmarking challenges of computational methods. Finally, we discuss newly emerging technologies, such as spatial transcriptomics, and outline strategies for creating a more general model of the cis-regulatory code that is more broadly applicable across cell types and individuals.",

    "abstract": "A common way to investigate gene regulatory mechanisms is to identify differentially expressed genes using transcriptomics, find their candidate enhancers using epigenomics, and search for over-represented transcription factor (TF) motifs in these enhancers using bioinformatics tools. A related follow-up task is to model gene expression as a function of enhancer sequences and rank TF motifs by their contribution to such models, thus prioritizing among regulators. We present a new computational tool called SEAMoD that performs the above tasks of motif finding and sequence-to-expression modeling simultaneously. It trains a convolutional neural network model to relate enhancer sequences to differential expression in one or more biological conditions. The model uses TF motifs to interpret the sequences, learning these motifs and their relative importance to each biological condition from data. It also utilizes epigenomic information in the form of activity scores of putative enhancers and automatically searches for the most promising enhancer for each gene. Compared to existing neural network models of non-coding sequences, SEAMoD uses far fewer parameters, requires far less training data, and emphasizes biological interpretability. We used SEAMoD to understand regulatory mechanisms underlying the differentiation of neural stem cell (NSC) derived from mouse forebrain. We profiled gene expression and histone modifications in NSC and three differentiated cell types and used SEAMoD to model differential expression of nearly 12,000 genes with an accuracy of 81%, in the process identifying the Olig2, E2f family TFs, Foxo3, and Tcf4 as key transcriptional regulators of the differentiation process.",

To elucidate combinatorial TF binding driving mouse basal ganglia development, we integrated chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) for twelve TFs, H3K4me3-associated enhancer-promoter interactions, chromatin and gene expression data, and functional enhancer assays. We identified sets of putative regulatory elements with shared TF binding (TF-pRE modules) that orchestrate distinct processes of GABAergic neurogenesis and suppress other cell fates. The majority of pREs were bound by one or two TFs; however, a small proportion were extensively bound. These sequences had exceptional evolutionary conservation and motif density, complex chromosomal interactions, and activity as in vivo enhancers. Our results provide insights into the combinatorial TF-pRE interactions that activate and repress expression programs during telencephalon neurogenesis and demonstrate the value of TF binding toward modeling developmental transcriptional wiring.",

    "abstract": "Analysis of gene co-expression networks is a powerful \"data-driven\" tool, invaluable for understanding cancer biology and mechanisms of tumor development. Yet, despite of completion of thousands of studies on cancer gene expression, there were few attempts to normalize and integrate co-expression data from scattered sources in a concise \"meta-analysis\" framework. Here we describe an integrated approach to cancer expression meta-analysis, which combines generation of \"data-driven\" co-expression networks with detailed statistical detection of promoter sequence motifs within the co-expression clusters. First, we applied Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) workflow and Pearson's correlation to generate a comprehensive set of over 3000 co-expression clusters in 82 normalized microarray datasets from nine cancers of different origin. Next, we designed a genome-wide statistical approach to the detection of specific DNA sequence motifs based on similarities between the promoters of similarly expressed genes. The approach, realized as cisExpress software module, was specifically designed for analysis of very large data sets such as those generated by publicly accessible whole genome and transcriptome projects. cisExpress uses a task farming algorithm to exploit all available computational cores within a shared memory node.We discovered that although co-expression modules are populated with different sets of genes, they share distinct stable patterns of co-regulation based on promoter sequence analysis. The number of motifs per co-expression cluster varies widely in accordance with cancer tissue of origin, with the largest number in colon (68 motifs) and the lowest in ovary (18 motifs). The top scored motifs are typically shared between several tissues; they define sets of target genes responsible for certain functionality of cancerogenesis. Both the co-expression modules and a database of precalculated motifs are publically available and accessible for further studies.",

    "abstract": "Identifying master regulators of biological processes and mapping their downstream gene networks are key challenges in systems biology. We developed a computational method, called iRegulon, to reverse-engineer the transcriptional regulatory network underlying a co-expressed gene set using cis-regulatory sequence analysis. iRegulon implements a genome-wide ranking-and-recovery approach to detect enriched transcription factor motifs and their optimal sets of direct targets. We increase the accuracy of network inference by using very large motif collections of up to ten thousand position weight matrices collected from various species, and linking these to candidate human TFs via a motif2TF procedure. We validate iRegulon on gene sets derived from ENCODE ChIP-seq data with increasing levels of noise, and we compare iRegulon with existing motif discovery methods. Next, we use iRegulon on more challenging types of gene lists, including microRNA target sets, protein-protein interaction networks, and genetic perturbation data. In particular, we over-activate p53 in breast cancer cells, followed by RNA-seq and ChIP-seq, and could identify an extensive up-regulated network controlled directly by p53. Similarly we map a repressive network with no indication of direct p53 regulation but rather an indirect effect via E2F and NFY. Finally, we generalize our computational framework to include regulatory tracks such as ChIP-seq data and show how motif and track discovery can be combined to map functional regulatory interactions among co-expressed genes. iRegulon is available as a Cytoscape plugin from http://iregulon.aertslab.org.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Cholangiocytes transit from quiescence to hyperproliferation during cystogenesis in polycystic liver disease (PLD), the severity of which displays prominent sex differences. Epigenetic regulation plays important roles in cell state transition. We aimed to investigate the sex-specific epigenetic basis of hepatic cystogenesis and to develop therapeutic strategies targeting epigenetic modifications for PLD treatment. METHODS: Normal and cystic primary cholangiocytes were isolated from wild-type and PLD mice of both sexes. Chromatin states were characterized by analyzing chromatin accessibility (ATAC sequencing) and multiple histone modifications (chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing). Differential gene expression was determined by transcriptomic analysis (RNA sequencing). Pharmacologic inhibition of epigenetic modifying enzymes was undertaken in PLD model mice. RESULTS: Through genome-wide profiling of chromatin dynamics, we revealed a profound increase of global chromatin accessibility during cystogenesis in both male and female PLD cholangiocytes. We identified a switch from H3K9me3 to H3K9ac on cis-regulatory DNA elements of cyst-associated genes and showed that inhibition of H3K9ac acetyltransferase or H3K9me3 demethylase slowed cyst growth in male, but not female, PLD mice. In contrast, we found that H3K27ac was specifically increased in female PLD mice and that genes associated with H3K27ac-gained regions were enriched for cyst-related pathways. In an integrated epigenomic and transcriptomic analysis, we identified an estrogen receptor alpha-centered transcription factor network associated with the H3K27ac-regulated cystogenic gene expression program in female PLD mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the multi-layered sex-specific epigenetic dynamics underlying cholangiocyte state transition and reveal a potential epigenetic therapeutic strategy for male PLD patients. IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS: In the present study, we elucidate a sex-specific epigenetic mechanism underlying the cholangiocyte state transition during hepatic cystogenesis and identify epigenetic drugs that effectively slow cyst growth in male PLD mice. These findings underscore the importance of sex difference in the pathogenesis of PLD and may guide researchers and physicians to develop sex-specific personalized approaches for PLD treatment.",

The extensive knowledge of sea urchin development has culminated in the description of the exquisitely detailed gene regulatory network (GRN) that governs the specification of various embryonic territories.

This review focuses on recent work that has utilized new genomic resources and systems-level experiments to address questions of evolutionary developmental biology. In particular, we synthesize the results of several recent studies from various echinoderm classes that have explored the development and evolution of the larval skeleton, which is a major feature that distinguishes the two predominant larval subtypes within the Phylum. We specifically examine the ways in which GRNs can evolve, either through cis regulatory and/or protein-level changes in transcription factors. We also examine recent work comparing evolution across shorter time scales that occur within and between species of sea urchin, and highlight the kinds of questions that can be addressed by these comparisons. The advent of new genomic and transcriptomic datasets in additional species from all classes of echinoderm will continue to empower the use of these taxa for evolutionary developmental studies.",

    "abstract": "Transposon-encoded tnpB and iscB genes encode RNA-guided DNA nucleases that promote their own selfish spread through targeted DNA cleavage and homologous recombination(1-4). These widespread gene families were repeatedly domesticated over evolutionary timescales, leading to the emergence of diverse CRISPR-associated nucleases including Cas9 and Cas12 (refs. (5,6)). We set out to test the hypothesis that TnpB nucleases may have also been repurposed for novel, unexpected functions other than CRISPR-Cas adaptive immunity. Here, using phylogenetics, structural predictions, comparative genomics and functional assays, we uncover multiple independent genesis events of programmable transcription factors, which we name TnpB-like nuclease-dead repressors (TldRs). These proteins use naturally occurring guide RNAs to specifically target conserved promoter regions of the genome, leading to potent gene repression in a mechanism akin to CRISPR interference technologies invented by humans(7). Focusing on a TldR clade found broadly in Enterobacteriaceae, we discover that bacteriophages exploit the combined action of TldR and an adjacently encoded phage gene to alter the expression and composition of the host flagellar assembly, a transformation with the potential to impact motility(8), phage susceptibility(9), and host immunity(10). Collectively, this work showcases the diverse molecular innovations that were enabled through repeated exaptation of transposon-encoded genes, and reveals the evolutionary trajectory of diverse RNA-guided transcription factors.",

    "abstract": "Maize (Zea mays) originated in tropical areas and is thus susceptible to low temperatures, which pose a major threat to maize production. Our understanding of the molecular basis of cold tolerance in maize is limited. Here, we identified bZIP68, a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor, as a negative regulator of cold tolerance in maize. Transcriptome analysis revealed that bZIP68 represses the cold-induced expression of DREB1 transcription factor genes. The stability and transcriptional activity of bZIP68 are controlled by its phosphorylation at the conserved Ser250 residue under cold stress. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the bZIP68 locus was a target of selection during early domestication. A 358-bp insertion/deletion (Indel-972) polymorphism in the bZIP68 promoter has a significant effect on the differential expression of bZIP68 between maize and its wild ancestor teosinte. This study thus uncovers an evolutionary cis-regulatory variant that could be used to improve cold tolerance in maize.",

Despite being shorter and lowly expressed, these isoforms are shared between individuals and efficiently translated. Functional analyses show stable expression, specific cellular localization, and, in some cases, modified functions. Exonized TEs are rich in ancient genes, whereas the involved splice sites are recent and can be evolutionarily conserved. In addition, exonized TEs contribute to the secondary structure of the emerging isoforms, supporting their functional relevance. We conclude that TE-spliced isoforms represent a diversity reservoir of functional proteins on which natural selection can act.",

    "abstract": "We recently witnessed a tremendous increase in genomics studies on gene regulation and in entirely sequenced genomes from closely related species. This has triggered analyses that suggest a wide range of evolutionary dynamics of gene regulation, from rapid turnover of transcription-factor binding sites to conservation of enhancer function across large evolutionary distances. Many examples show that enhancers can evolve beyond recognizable sequence similarity while retaining function. However, bioinformatics approaches are increasingly able to detect conserved regulatory elements through characteristic evolutionary sequence signatures. Cis-regulatory changes are also a major source of morphological evolution, which might be facilitated by many biochemically functional elements that are selectively neutral and by the buffering function of redundant enhancers and 'shadow' enhancers.",

    "abstract": "Comparative genomics is a promising approach to the challenging problem of eukaryotic regulatory element identification, because functional noncoding sequences may be conserved across species from evolutionary constraints. We systematically analyzed known human and Saccharomyces cerevisiae regulatory elements and discovered that human regulatory elements are more conserved between human and mouse than are background sequences. Although S. cerevisiae regulatory elements do not appear to be more conserved by comparison of S. cerevisiae to Schizosaccharomyces pombe, they are more conserved when compared with multiple other yeast genomes (Saccharomyces paradoxus, Saccharomyces mikatae, and Saccharomyces bayanus). Based on these analyses, we developed a sequence-motif-finding algorithm called CompareProspector, which extends Gibbs sampling by biasing the search in regions conserved across species. Using human-mouse comparison, CompareProspector identified known motifs for transcription factors Mef2, Myf, Srf, and Sp1 from a set of human-muscle-specific genes. It also discovered the NFAT motif from genes up-regulated by CD28 stimulation in T-cells, which implies the direct involvement of NFAT in mediating the CD28 stimulatory signal. Using Caenorhabditis elegans-Caenorhabditis briggsae comparison, CompareProspector found the PHA-4 motif and the UNC-86 motif. CompareProspector outperformed many other computational motif-finding programs, demonstrating the power of comparative genomics-based biased sampling in eukaryotic regulatory element identification.",

    "abstract": "To gain insight into how mammalian gene expression is controlled by rapidly evolving regulatory elements, we jointly analysed promoter and enhancer activity with downstream transcription levels in liver samples from 15 species. Genes associated with complex regulatory landscapes generally exhibit high expression levels that remain evolutionarily stable. While the number of regulatory elements is the key driver of transcriptional output and resilience, regulatory conservation matters: elements active across mammals most effectively stabilize gene expression. In contrast, recently evolved enhancers typically contribute weakly, consistent with their high evolutionary plasticity. These effects are observed across the entire mammalian clade and are robust to potential confounders, such as the gene expression level. Using liver as a representative somatic tissue, our results illuminate how the evolutionary stability of gene expression is profoundly entwined with both the number and conservation of surrounding promoters and enhancers.",

    "abstract": "Hoxa2 is an evolutionarily conserved developmental regulatory gene that functions to specify rhombomere (r) and pharyngeal arch (PA) identities throughout the Osteichthyes. Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) hoxa2a, like orthologous Hoxa2 genes from other osteichthyans, is expressed during embryogenesis in r2-7 and PA2-7, whereas the paralogous medaka pseudogene, psihoxa2b, is expressed in noncanonical Hoxa2 domains, including the pectoral fin buds. To understand the evolution of cis-regulatory element (CRE) control of gene expression, we conducted eGFP reporter gene expression studies with extensive functional mapping of several conserved CREs upstream of medaka hoxa2a and psihoxa2b in transient and stable-line transgenic medaka embryos. The CREs tested were previously shown to contribute to directing mouse Hoxa2 gene expression in r3, r5, and PA2-4. Our results reveal the presence of sequence elements embedded in the medaka hoxa2a and psihoxa2b upstream enhancer regions (UERs) that mediate expression in r4 and the PAs (hoxa2a r4/CNCC element) or in r3-7 and the PAs psihoxa2b r3-7/CNCC element), respectively. Further, these elements were shown to be highly conserved among osteichthyans, which suggests that the r4 specifying element embedded in the UER of Hoxa2 is a deeply rooted rhombomere specifying element and the activity of this element has been modified by the evolution of flanking sequences that redirect its activity to alternative developmental compartments.",

However, studies in zebrafish remain constrained by the sparse annotation of functional control elements in the zebrafish genome. Here we performed RNA sequencing, assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq), chromatin immunoprecipitation with sequencing, whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, and chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) experiments in up to eleven adult and two embryonic tissues to generate a comprehensive map of transcriptomes, cis-regulatory elements, heterochromatin, methylomes and 3D genome organization in the zebrafish Tubingen reference strain. A comparison of zebrafish, human and mouse regulatory elements enabled the identification of both evolutionarily conserved and species-specific regulatory sequences and networks. We observed enrichment of evolutionary breakpoints at topologically associating domain boundaries, which were correlated with strong histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) and CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) signals. We performed single-cell ATAC-seq in zebrafish brain, which delineated 25 different clusters of cell types. By combining long-read DNA sequencing and Hi-C, we assembled the sex-determining chromosome 4 de novo. Overall, our work provides an additional epigenomic anchor for the functional annotation of vertebrate genomes and the study of evolutionarily conserved elements of 3D genome organization.",

From their first description more than 15 years ago, their extreme conservation has both fascinated and perplexed researchers in genomics and evolutionary biology.

    "title": "Identification of putative regulatory upstream ORFs in the yeast genome using heuristics and evolutionary conservation.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The translational efficiency of an mRNA can be modulated by upstream open reading frames (uORFs) present in certain genes. A uORF can attenuate translation of the main ORF by interfering with translational reinitiation at the main start codon. uORFs also occur by chance in the genome, in which case they do not have a regulatory role. Since the sequence determinants for functional uORFs are not understood, it is difficult to discriminate functional from spurious uORFs by sequence analysis. RESULTS: We have used comparative genomics to identify novel uORFs in yeast with a high likelihood of having a translational regulatory role. We examined uORFs, previously shown to play a role in regulation of translation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, for evolutionary conservation within seven Saccharomyces species. Inspection of the set of conserved uORFs yielded the following three characteristics useful for discrimination of functional from spurious uORFs: a length between 4 and 6 codons, a distance from the start of the main ORF between 50 and 150 nucleotides, and finally a lack of overlap with, and clear separation from, neighbouring uORFs. These derived rules are inherently associated with uORFs with properties similar to the GCN4 locus, and may not detect most uORFs of other types. uORFs with high scores based on these rules showed a much higher evolutionary conservation than randomly selected uORFs. In a genome-wide scan in S. cerevisiae, we found 34 conserved uORFs from 32 genes that we predict to be functional; subsequent analysis showed the majority of these to be located within transcripts. A total of 252 genes were found containing conserved uORFs with properties indicative of a functional role; all but 7 are novel. Functional content analysis of this set identified an overrepresentation of genes involved in transcriptional control and development. CONCLUSION: Evolutionary conservation of uORFs in yeasts can be traced up to 100 million years of separation. The conserved uORFs have certain characteristics with respect to length, distance from each other and from the main start codon, and folding energy of the sequence. These newly found characteristics can be used to facilitate detection of other conserved uORFs.",

Although reconstruction of regulatory circuits from genomic data alone is therefore desirable, this remains a major computational challenge. Comparative approaches that examine the conservation and divergence of circuits and their components across strains and species can help reconstruct circuits as well as provide insights into the evolution of gene regulatory processes and their adaptive contribution. In recent years, advances in genomic and computational tools have led to a wealth of methods for such analysis at the sequence, expression, pathway, module, and entire network level. Here, we review computational methods developed to study transcriptional regulatory networks using comparative genomics, from sequence to functional data. We highlight how these methods use evolutionary conservation and divergence to reliably detect regulatory components as well as estimate the extent and rate of divergence.

Here we map the genome-wide binding locations of 165 human, 93 worm and 52 fly transcription regulatory factors, generating a total of 1,019 data sets from diverse cell types, developmental stages, or conditions in the three species, of which 498 (48.9%) are presented here for the first time. We find that structural properties of regulatory networks are remarkably conserved and that orthologous regulatory factor families recognize similar binding motifs in vivo and show some similar co-associations. Our results suggest that gene-regulatory properties previously observed for individual factors are general principles of metazoan regulation that are remarkably well-preserved despite extensive functional divergence of individual network connections. The comparative maps of regulatory circuitry provided here will drive an improved understanding of the regulatory underpinnings of model organism biology and how these relate to human biology, development and disease.",

    "abstract": "Multiple distal cis-regulatory elements (CREs) often cooperate to regulate gene expression, and the presence of multiple CREs for a gene has been proposed to provide redundancy and robustness to variation. However, we do not understand how attributes of a gene's distal CRE landscape-the CREs that contribute to its regulation-relate to its expression and function. Here, we integrate three-dimensional chromatin conformation and functional genomics data to quantify the CRE landscape composition genome-wide across ten human tissues and relate their attributes to the function, constraint, and expression patterns of genes. Within each tissue, we find that expressed genes have larger CRE landscapes than nonexpressed genes and that genes with tissue-specific CREs are more likely to have tissue-specific expression. Controlling for the association between expression level and CRE landscape size, we also find that CRE landscapes around genes under strong constraint (e.g., loss-of-function intolerant and housekeeping genes) are not significantly smaller than other expressed genes as previously proposed; however, they do have more evolutionarily conserved sequences than CREs of expressed genes overall. We also show that CRE landscape size does not associate with expression variability across individuals; nonetheless, genes with larger CRE landscapes have a relative depletion for variants that influence expression levels (expression quantitative trait loci). Overall, this work illustrates how differences in gene function, expression, and evolutionary constraint are reflected in features of CRE landscapes. Thus, considering the CRE landscape of a gene is vital for understanding gene expression dynamics across biological contexts and interpreting the effects of noncoding genetic variants.",

    "abstract": "Cell walls are a distinguishing characteristic of plants essential to their survival. The pectin content of primary cell walls in grasses and dicots is distinctly different. Polygalacturonases (PGs) can degrade pectins and participate in multiple developmental processes of plants. This study comprehensively compared the evolution, expression, and cis-regulatory element of PGs in grasses and dicots. A total of 577 PGs identified from five grasses and five dicots fell into seven clades. Evolutionary analysis demonstrated the distinct differences between grasses and dicots in patterns of gene duplication and loss, and evolutionary rates. Grasses generally contained much fewer clade C and F members than dicots. We found that this disparity was the result of less duplication and more gene losses in grasses. More duplications occurred in clades D and E, and expression analysis showed that most of clade E members were expressed ubiquitously at a high overall level and clade D members were closely related to male reproduction in both grasses and dicots, suggesting their biological functions were highly conserved across species. In addition to the general role in reproductive development, PGs of clades C and F specifically played roles in root development in dicots, shedding light on organ differentiation between the two groups of plants. A regulatory element analysis of clade C and F members implied that possible functions of PGs in specific biological responses contributed to their expansion and preservation. This work can improve the knowledge of PGs in plants generally and in grasses specifically and is beneficial to functional studies.",

    "abstract": "Comparative genomics has revealed a class of non-protein-coding genomic sequences that display an extraordinary degree of conservation between two or more organisms, regularly exceeding that found within protein-coding exons. These elements, collectively referred to as conserved non-coding elements (CNEs), are non-randomly distributed across chromosomes and tend to cluster in the vicinity of genes with regulatory roles in multicellular development and differentiation. CNEs are organized into functional ensembles called genomic regulatory blocks-dense clusters of elements that collectively coordinate the expression of shared target genes, and whose span in many cases coincides with topologically associated domains. CNEs display sequence properties that set them apart from other sequences under constraint, and have recently been proposed as useful markers for the reconstruction of the evolutionary history of organisms. Disruption of several of these elements is known to contribute to diseases linked with development, and cancer. The emergence, evolutionary dynamics and functions of CNEs still remain poorly understood, and new approaches are required to enable comprehensive CNE identification and characterization.

The majority of pREs were bound by one or two TFs; however, a small proportion were extensively bound.

Further, conserved amino acids in the C9 TMH1 region were identified, implying their potential functional association with MAC growth and pore formation. Transposons and simple repeats, as gene elements, exhibited a differential distribution in the genomic regions in different animal groups but were sparsely scattered around the sixth exon (TMH1 region). Notably, this demonstrated the regulatory complexity of the C9 gene in higher vertebrates. The negative selection pressures on fish and non-fish groups improved both the sequence conservation and similarity. Through gene/protein regulatory network and pathway analyses, the systematic function of C9 protein was showcased; thus, we could reveal the divergence of the systematic function of C9 across species from different evolutionary positions. In addition, more complicated functions of C9 in higher vertebrates could established by the altered spatial conformation of the protein. Collectively, the present study illustrates the C9 gene evolutionary process and the difference in its systematic function across multiple species. Such advances provide new insights for understanding the evolutionary and potential functions of complement C9.",

    "abstract": "Human higher cognition is attributed to the evolutionary expansion and elaboration of the human cerebral cortex. However, the genetic mechanisms contributing to these developmental changes are poorly understood. We used comparative epigenetic profiling of human, rhesus macaque, and mouse corticogenesis to identify promoters and enhancers that have gained activity in humans. These gains are significantly enriched in modules of coexpressed genes in the cortex that function in neuronal proliferation, migration, and cortical-map organization. Gain-enriched modules also showed correlated gene expression patterns and similar transcription factor binding site enrichments in promoters and enhancers, suggesting that they are connected by common regulatory mechanisms. Our results reveal coordinated patterns of potential regulatory changes associated with conserved developmental processes during corticogenesis, providing insight into human cortical evolution.",

    "abstract": "With the imminent completion of the whole genome sequence of humans, increasing attention is being focused on the annotation of cis-regulatory elements in the human genome. Comparative genomics approaches based on evolutionary conservation have proved useful in the detection of conserved cis-regulatory elements. The pufferfish, Fugu rubripes, is an attractive vertebrate model for comparative genomics, by virtue of its compact genome and maximal phylogenetic distance from mammals. Fugu has lost a large proportion of nonessential DNA, and retained single orthologs for many duplicate genes that arose in the fish lineage. Non-coding sequences conserved between fugu and mammals have been shown to be functional cis-regulatory elements. Thus, fugu is a model fish genome of choice for discovering evolutionarily conserved regulatory elements in the human genome. Such evolutionarily conserved elements are likely to be shared by all vertebrates, and related to regulatory interactions fundamental to all vertebrates. The functions of these conserved vertebrate elements can be rapidly assayed in mammalian cell lines or in transgenic systems such as zebrafish/medaka and Xenopus, followed by validation of crucial elements in transgenic rodents.",

    "abstract": "Extreme metabolic adaptations can elucidate genetic programs that govern mammalian metabolism. Here, we used convergent evolutionary changes in hibernating lineages to define conserved cis-regulatory elements (CREs) and metabolic programs. We characterized mouse hypothalamus gene expression and chromatin dynamics across fed, fasted, and refed states and then used comparative genomics of hibernating versus nonhibernating lineages to identify cis elements with convergent changes in hibernators. Multi-omics approaches pinpointed CREs, hub genes, regulatory programs, and cell types underlying lineage divergence. Hibernators accumulated loss-of-function effects for CREs regulating hypothalamic responses, and the refeeding period after fasting served as a key phase for molecular processes with convergent evolutionary changes. This work provides a genetic framework for harnessing hibernator adaptations to understand human metabolic control.",

    "abstract": "The Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) pathway is a multi-member signaling cascade whose basic components are found in all animals. One member, BMP3, which arose more recently in evolution and is found only in deuterostomes, serves a unique role as an antagonist to both the canonical BMP and Activin pathways. However, the mechanisms that control BMP3 expression, and the cis-regulatory regions mediating this regulation, remain poorly defined. With this in mind, we sought to identify the Bmp3 promoter in mouse (M. musculus) through functional and comparative genomic analyses. We found that the minimal promoter required for expression in resides within 0.8 kb upstream of Bmp3 in a region that is highly conserved with rat (R. norvegicus). We also found that an upstream region abutting the minimal promoter acts as a repressor of the minimal promoter in HEK293T cells and osteoblasts. Strikingly, a portion of this region is conserved among all available eutherian mammal genomes (47/47), but not in any non-eutherian animal (0/136). We also identified multiple conserved transcription factor binding sites in the Bmp3 upstream ECR, suggesting that this region may preserve common cis-regulatory elements that govern Bmp3 expression across eutherian mammals. Since dysregulation of BMP signaling appears to play a role in human health and disease, our findings may have application in the development of novel therapeutics aimed at modulating BMP signaling in humans.",

As more high-quality ruminant genome assemblies have become available, we have redesigned the user interface, integrated and expanded multi-omics data, and developed novel features to improve the database. The new version, RGD v2.0, houses 78 ruminant genomes; 110-species synteny alignments for major livestock (including cattle, sheep, goat) and wild ungulates; 21 012 orthologous gene clusters with Gene Ontology and pathway annotation;  approximately 8 600 000 conserved elements; and  approximately 1 000 000 cis-regulatory elements by utilizing 1053 epigenomic data sets. The transcriptome data in RGD v2.0 has nearly doubled, currently with 1936 RNA-seq data sets, and 155 174 phenotypic data sets have been newly added. New and updated features include: (i) The UCSC Genome Browser, BLAT, BLAST and Table Browser tools were updated for six available ruminant livestock species. (ii) The LiftOver tool was newly introduced into our browser to allow coordinate conversion between different ruminant assemblies. And (iii) tissue specificity index, tau, was calculated to facilitate batch screening of specifically expressed genes.

As a complement to genetic and comparative genomics approaches, the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements Project was launched to contribute maps of RNA transcripts, transcriptional regulator binding sites, and chromatin states in many cell types. The resulting genome-wide data reveal sites of biochemical activity with high positional resolution and cell type specificity that facilitate studies of gene regulation and interpretation of noncoding variants associated with human disease. However, the biochemically active regions cover a much larger fraction of the genome than do evolutionarily conserved regions, raising the question of whether nonconserved but biochemically active regions are truly functional. Here, we review the strengths and limitations of biochemical, evolutionary, and genetic approaches for defining functional DNA segments, potential sources for the observed differences in estimated genomic coverage, and the biological implications of these discrepancies. We also analyze the relationship between signal intensity, genomic coverage, and evolutionary conservation. Our results reinforce the principle that each approach provides complementary information and that we need to use combinations of all three to elucidate genome function in human biology and disease.",

By combining the genome-wide transcription factor occupancy repertoires, associated epigenetic signals, and co-association patterns, here we deduce several evolutionary principles of gene regulatory features operating since the mouse and human lineages diverged. The genomic distribution profiles, primary binding motifs, chromatin states, and DNA methylation preferences are well conserved for TF-occupied sequences. However, the extent to which orthologous DNA segments are bound by orthologous TFs varies both among TFs and with genomic location: binding at promoters is more highly conserved than binding at distal elements. Notably, occupancy-conserved TF-occupied sequences tend to be pleiotropic; they function in several tissues and also co-associate with many TFs. Single nucleotide variants at sites with potential regulatory functions are enriched in occupancy-conserved TF-occupied sequences.",

The difficulty of this task stems from two equally important problems: our knowledge of how regulatory elements are encoded in genomes remains elementary, and there is a vast genomic search space for regulatory elements, since most of mammalian genomes are noncoding. Comparative genomic approaches are having a remarkable impact on the study of transcriptional regulation in eukaryotes and currently represent the most efficient and reliable methods of predicting noncoding sequences likely to control the patterns of gene expression. By subjecting eukaryotic genomic sequences to computational comparisons and subsequent experimentation, we are inching our way toward a more comprehensive catalog of common regulatory motifs that lie behind fundamental biological processes. We are still far from comprehending how the transcriptional regulatory code is encrypted in the human genome and providing an initial global view of regulatory gene networks, but collectively, the continued development of comparative and experimental approaches will rapidly expand our knowledge of the transcriptional regulome.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Parasitism is a major ecological niche for a variety of nematodes. Multiple nematode lineages have specialized as pathogens, including deadly parasites of insects that are used in biological control. We have sequenced and analyzed the draft genomes and transcriptomes of the entomopathogenic nematode Steinernema carpocapsae and four congeners (S. scapterisci, S. monticolum, S. feltiae, and S. glaseri). RESULTS: We used these genomes to establish phylogenetic relationships, explore gene conservation across species, and identify genes uniquely expanded in insect parasites. Protein domain analysis in Steinernema revealed a striking expansion of numerous putative parasitism genes, including certain protease and protease inhibitor families, as well as fatty acid- and retinol-binding proteins. Stage-specific gene expression of some of these expanded families further supports the notion that they are involved in insect parasitism by Steinernema. We show that sets of novel conserved non-coding regulatory motifs are associated with orthologous genes in Steinernema and Caenorhabditis. CONCLUSIONS: We have identified a set of expanded gene families that are likely to be involved in parasitism. We have also identified a set of non-coding motifs associated with groups of orthologous genes in Steinernema and Caenorhabditis involved in neurogenesis and embryonic development that are likely part of conserved protein-DNA relationships shared between these two genera.",

    "abstract": "The divergence of regulatory regions and gene regulatory network (GRN) rewiring is a key driver of cichlid phenotypic diversity. However, the contribution of miRNA-binding site turnover has yet to be linked to GRN evolution across cichlids. Here, we extend our previous studies by analyzing the selective constraints driving evolution of miRNA and transcription factor (TF)-binding sites of target genes, to infer instances of cichlid GRN rewiring associated with regulatory binding site turnover. Comparative analyses identified increased species-specific networks that are functionally associated to traits of cichlid phenotypic diversity. The evolutionary rewiring is associated with differential models of miRNA- and TF-binding site turnover, driven by a high proportion of fast-evolving polymorphic sites in adaptive trait genes compared with subsets of random genes. Positive selection acting upon discrete mutations in these regulatory regions is likely to be an important mechanism in rewiring GRNs in rapidly radiating cichlids. Regulatory variants of functionally associated miRNA- and TF-binding sites of visual opsin genes differentially segregate according to phylogeny and ecology of Lake Malawi species, identifying both rewired, for example, clade-specific and conserved network motifs of adaptive trait associated GRNs. Our approach revealed several novel candidate regulators, regulatory regions, and three-node motifs across cichlid genomes with previously reported associations to known adaptive evolutionary traits.",

Identifying the genomic elements that have become constrained specifically in primates has been hampered by the faster evolution of noncoding DNA compared to protein-coding DNA(10), the relatively short timescales separating primate species(11), and the previously limited availability of whole-genome sequences(12). Here we construct a whole-genome alignment of 239 species, representing nearly half of all extant species in the primate order. Using this resource, we identified human regulatory elements that are under selective constraint across primates and other mammals at a 5% false discovery rate. We detected 111,318 DNase I hypersensitivity sites and 267,410 transcription factor binding sites that are constrained specifically in primates but not across other placental mammals and validate their cis-regulatory effects on gene expression. These regulatory elements are enriched for human genetic variants that affect gene expression and complex traits and diseases. Our results highlight the important role of recent evolution in regulatory sequence elements differentiating primates, including humans, from other placental mammals.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The dirigent (DIR) genes encode proteins that act as crucial regulators of plant lignin biosynthesis. In Solanaceae species, members of the DIR gene family are intricately related to plant growth and development, playing a key role in responding to various biotic and abiotic stresses. It will be of great application significance to analyze the DIR gene family and expression profile under various pathogen stresses in Solanaceae species. RESULTS: A total of 57 tobacco NtDIRs and 33 potato StDIRs were identified based on their respective genome sequences. Phylogenetic analysis of DIR genes in tobacco, potato, eggplant and Arabidopsis thaliana revealed three distinct subgroups (DIR-a, DIR-b/d and DIR-e). Gene structure and conserved motif analysis showed that a high degree of conservation in both exon/intron organization and protein motifs among tobacco and potato DIR genes, especially within members of the same subfamily. Total 8 pairs of tandem duplication genes (3 pairs in tobacco, 5 pairs in potato) and 13 pairs of segmental duplication genes (6 pairs in tobacco, 7 pairs in potato) were identified based on the analysis of gene duplication events. Cis-regulatory elements of the DIR promoters participated in hormone response, stress responses, circadian control, endosperm expression, and meristem expression. Transcriptomic data analysis under biotic stress revealed diverse response patterns among DIR gene family members to pathogens, indicating their functional divergence. After 96 h post-inoculation with Ralstonia solanacearum L. (Ras), tobacco seedlings exhibited typical symptoms of tobacco bacterial wilt. The qRT-PCR analysis of 11 selected NtDIR genes displayed differential expression pattern in response to the bacterial pathogen Ras infection. Using line 392278 of potato as material, typical symptoms of potato late blight manifested on the seedling leaves under Phytophthora infestans infection. The qRT-PCR analysis of 5 selected StDIR genes showed up-regulation in response to pathogen infection. Notably, three clustered genes (NtDIR2, NtDIR4, StDIR3) exhibited a robust response to pathogen infection, highlighting their essential roles in disease resistance. CONCLUSION: The genome-wide identification, evolutionary analysis, and expression profiling of DIR genes in response to various pathogen infection in tobacco and potato have provided valuable insights into the roles of these genes under various stress conditions. Our results could provide a basis for further functional analysis of the DIR gene family under pathogen infection conditions.",

    "abstract": "Nitrogen is one of the most inaccessible plant nutrients, but certain species have overcome this limitation by establishing symbiotic interactions with nitrogen-fixing bacteria in the root nodule. This root-nodule symbiosis (RNS) is restricted to species within a single clade of angiosperms, suggesting a critical, but undetermined, evolutionary event at the base of this clade. To identify putative regulatory sequences implicated in the evolution of RNS, we evaluated the genomes of 25 species capable of nodulation and identified 3091 conserved noncoding sequences (CNS) in the nitrogen-fixing clade (NFC). We show that the chromatin accessibility of 452 CNS correlates significantly with the regulation of genes responding to lipochitooligosaccharides in Medicago truncatula. These included 38 CNS in proximity to 19 known genes involved in RNS. Five such regions are upstream of MtCRE1, Cytokinin Response Element 1, required to activate a suite of downstream transcription factors necessary for nodulation in M. truncatula. Genetic complementation of an Mtcre1 mutant showed a significant decrease of nodulation in the absence of the five CNS, when they are driving the expression of a functional copy of MtCRE1. CNS identified in the NFC may harbor elements required for the regulation of genes controlling RNS in M. truncatula.",

Gene families related to digestion, endocrine signaling, cuticular hydrocarbon synthesis, and chemoreception expanded in the ant ancestor, while many caste-associated genes underwent positive selection in the formicoid ancestor. Elaborations and reductions of queen-worker dimorphism and other social traits left convergent signatures of intensified or relaxed selection in conserved signaling and metabolic pathways, suggesting that a core gene set was used to diversify organizational complexity.

    "abstract": "Human health depends on perplexing defensive cellular responses against microbial pathogens like Viruses. Despite the major effort undertaken, the (epi)genomic mechanisms that human cells utilize to tailor defensive gene expression programs against microbial attacks have remained inadequately understood, mainly due to a significant lack of recording of the in vivo functional cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) of the human genome. Here, we introduce the virus-responsive fate of the human (epi)genome as characterized in naive and infected cells by functional genomics, computational biology, DNA evolution, and DNA Grammar and Syntax investigations. We discovered that multitudes of novel functional virus-responsive CRMs (vrCRMs) compose typical enhancers (tEs), super-enhancers (SEs), repetitive-DNA enhancers (rDEs), and stand-alone functional genomic stretches that grant human cells regulatory underpinnings for layering basal immunity and eliminating illogical/harmful defensive responses under homeostasis, yet stimulating virus-responsive genes and transposable elements (TEs) upon infection. Moreover, extensive epigenomic reprogramming of previously unknown SE landscapes marks the transition from naive to antiviral human cell states and involves the functions of the antimicrobial transcription factors (TFs), including interferon response factor 3 (IRF3) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), as well as coactivators and transcriptional apparatus, along with intensive modifications/alterations in histone marks and chromatin accessibility. Considering the polyphyletic evolutionary fingerprints of the composite DNA sequences of the vrCRMs assessed by TFs-STARR-seq, ranging from the animal to microbial kingdoms, the conserved features of antimicrobial TFs and chromatin complexes, and their pluripotent stimulus-induced activation, these findings shed light on how mammalian (epi)genomes evolved their functions to interpret the exogenous stress inflicted and program defensive transcriptional responses against microbial agents. Crucially, many known human short variants, e.g. single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions, deletions etc., and quantitative trait loci (QTLs) linked to autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Crohn's disease (CD) etc., were mapped within or vastly proximal (+/-2.5 kb) to the novel in vivo functional SEs and vrCRMs discovered, thus underscoring the impact of their (mal)functions on human physiology and disease development. Hence, we delved into the virus-responsive fate of the human (epi)genome and illuminated its architecture, function, evolutionary origins, and its significance for cellular homeostasis. These results allow us to chart the \"Human hyper-Atlas of virus-infection\", an integrated \"molecular in silico\" encyclopedia situated in the UCSC Genome Browser that benefits our mechanistic understanding of human infectious/(auto)immune diseases development and can facilitate the generation of in vivo preclinical animal models, drug design, and evolution of therapeutic applications.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic phenotypes are pivotal for many areas, but disentangling how evolutionary history and environmental adaptation shape these phenotypes is an open problem. Especially for microbes, which are metabolically diverse and often interact in complex communities, few phenotypes can be determined directly. Instead, potential phenotypes are commonly inferred from genomic information, and rarely were model-predicted phenotypes employed beyond the species level. Here, we propose sensitivity correlations to quantify similarity of predicted metabolic network responses to perturbations, and thereby link genotype and environment to phenotype. We show that these correlations provide a consistent functional complement to genomic information by capturing how network context shapes gene function. This enables, for example, phylogenetic inference across all domains of life at the organism level. For 245 bacterial species, we identify conserved and variable metabolic functions, elucidate the quantitative impact of evolutionary history and ecological niche on these functions, and generate hypotheses on associated metabolic phenotypes. We expect our framework for the joint interpretation of metabolic phenotypes, evolution, and environment to help guide future empirical studies.",

    "abstract": "Plant genomes encode a complex and evolutionary diverse regulatory grammar that forms the basis for most life on earth. A wealth of regulome and epigenome data have been generated in various plant species, but no common, standardized resource is available so far for biologists. Here, we present ChIP-Hub, an integrative web-based platform in the ENCODE standards that bundles >10,000 publicly available datasets reanalyzed from >40 plant species, allowing visualization and meta-analysis. We manually curate the datasets through assessing ~540 original publications and comprehensively evaluate their data quality. As a proof of concept, we extensively survey the co-association of different regulators and construct a hierarchical regulatory network under a broad developmental context. Furthermore, we show how our annotation allows to investigate the dynamic activity of tissue-specific regulatory elements (promoters and enhancers) and their underlying sequence grammar. Finally, we analyze the function and conservation of tissue-specific promoters, enhancers and chromatin states using comparative genomics approaches. Taken together, the ChIP-Hub platform and the analysis results provide rich resources for deep exploration of plant ENCODE. ChIP-Hub is available at https://biobigdata.nju.edu.cn/ChIPHub/ .",

    "abstract": "Plant genomes contain a large fraction of noncoding sequences. The discovery and annotation of conserved noncoding sequences (CNSs) in plants is an ongoing challenge. Here we report the application of comparative genomics to systematically identify CNSs in 50 well-annotated Gramineae genomes using rice (Oryza sativa) as the reference. We conduct multiple-way whole-genome alignments to the rice genome. The rice genome is annotated as 20 conservation states (CSs) at single-nucleotide resolution using a multivariate hidden Markov model (ConsHMM) based on the multiple-genome alignments. Different states show distinct enrichments for various genomic features, and the conservation scores of CSs are highly correlated with the level of associated chromatin accessibility. We find that at least 33.5% of the rice genome is highly under selection, with more than 70% of the sequence lying outside of coding regions. A catalog of 855,366 regulatory CNSs is generated, and they significantly overlapped with putative active regulatory elements such as promoters, enhancers, and transcription factor binding sites. Collectively, our study provides a resource for elucidating functional noncoding regions of the rice genome and an evolutionary aspect of regulatory sequences in higher plants.",

    "abstract": "Homology searches between DNA sequences of evolutionary distant species (phylogenetic footprinting) offer a fast detection method for regulatory sequences. Because of the small size of their genomes, tetraodontid species such as the Japanese pufferfish and green spotted pufferfish have become attractive models for comparative genomics. A disadvantage of the tetraodontid species is, however, that they cannot be bred and manipulated routinely under laboratory conditions, so these species are less attractive for developmental and genetic analysis. In contrast, an increasing arsenal of transgene techniques with the developmental model species zebrafish and medaka are being used for functional analysis of cis regulatory sequences. The main disadvantage is the much larger genome. While comparison between many loci proved the suitability of phylogenetic footprinting using fish and mammalian sequences, fast rate of change in enhancer structure and gene duplication within teleosts may obscure detection of homologies. Here we discuss the contribution and potentials provided by different teleost models for the detection and functional analysis of conserved cis-regulatory elements.",

To date, the majority of these studies have focused on the transcriptome in mammalian and yeast phylogenies. Here, we present a novel multi-species proteomic dataset and a computational pipeline to systematically compare the protein levels across multiple plant species. Globally we find that protein levels diverge according to phylogenetic distance but is more constrained than the mRNA level. Module-level comparative analysis of groups of proteins shows that proteins that are more highly expressed tend to be more conserved. To interpret the evolutionary patterns of conservation and divergence, we develop a novel network-based integrative analysis pipeline that combines publicly available transcriptomic datasets to define co-expression modules. Our analysis pipeline can be used to relate the changes in protein levels to different species-specific phenotypic traits. We present a case study with the rhizobia-legume symbiosis process that supports the role of autophagy in this symbiotic association.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Because species-specific gene expression is driven by species-specific regulation, understanding the relationship between sequence and function of the regulatory regions in different species will help elucidate how differences among species arise. Despite active experimental and computational research, relationships among sequence, conservation, and function are still poorly understood. RESULTS: We compared transcription factor occupied segments (TFos) for 116 human and 35 mouse TFs in 546 human and 125 mouse cell types and tissues from the Human and the Mouse ENCODE projects. We based the map between human and mouse TFos on a one-to-one nucleotide cross-species mapper, bnMapper, that utilizes whole genome alignments (WGA). Our analysis shows that TFos are under evolutionary constraint, but a substantial portion (25.1% of mouse and 25.85% of human on average) of the TFos does not have a homologous sequence on the other species; this portion varies among cell types and TFs. Furthermore, 47.67% and 57.01% of the homologous TFos sequence shows binding activity on the other species for human and mouse respectively. However, 79.87% and 69.22% is repurposed such that it binds the same TF in different cells or different TFs in the same cells. Remarkably, within the set of repurposed TFos, the corresponding genome regions in the other species are preferred locations of novel TFos. These events suggest exaptation of some functional regulatory sequences into new function. Despite TFos repurposing, we did not find substantial changes in their predicted target genes, suggesting that CRMs buffer evolutionary events allowing little or no change in the TFos - target gene associations. Thus, the small portion of TFos with strictly conserved occupancy underestimates the degree of conservation of regulatory interactions. CONCLUSION: We mapped regulatory sequences from an extensive number of TFs and cell types between human and mouse using WGA. A comparative analysis of this correspondence unveiled the extent of the shared regulatory sequence across TFs and cell types under study. Importantly, a large part of the shared regulatory sequence is repurposed on the other species. This sequence, fueled by turnover events, provides a strong case for exaptation in regulatory elements.",

    "abstract": "Metazoan genomes primarily consist of non-coding DNA in comparison to coding regions. Non-coding fraction of the genome contains cis-regulatory elements, which ensure that the genetic code is read properly at the right time and space during development. Regulatory elements and their target genes define functional landscapes within the genome, and some developmentally important genes evolve by keeping the genes involved in specification of common organs/tissues in clusters and are termed gene complex. The clustering of genes involved in a common function may help in robust spatio-temporal gene expression. Gene complexes are often found to be evolutionarily conserved, and the classic example is the hox complex. The evolutionary constraints seen among gene complexes provide an ideal model system to understand cis and trans-regulation of gene function. This review will discuss the various characteristics of gene regulatory modules found within gene complexes and how they can be characterized.",

    "abstract": "The limited regenerative capacity of the human heart contributes to high morbidity and mortality worldwide. In contrast, zebrafish exhibit robust regenerative capacity, providing a powerful model for studying how to overcome intrinsic epigenetic barriers maintaining cardiac homeostasis and initiate regeneration. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of the histone modifications H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K27me3 and H3K27ac during various stages of zebrafish heart regeneration. We found a vast gain of repressive chromatin marks one day after myocardial injury, followed by the acquisition of active chromatin characteristics on day four and a transition to a repressive state on day 14, and identified distinct transcription factor ensembles associated with these events. The rapid transcriptional response involves the engagement of super-enhancers at genes implicated in extracellular matrix reorganization and TOR signaling, while H3K4me3 breadth highly correlates with transcriptional activity and dynamic changes at genes involved in proteolysis, cell cycle activity, and cell differentiation. Using loss- and gain-of-function approaches, we identified transcription factors in cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells influencing cardiomyocyte dedifferentiation or proliferation. Finally, we detected significant evolutionary conservation between regulatory regions that drive zebrafish and neonatal mouse heart regeneration, suggesting that reactivating transcriptional and epigenetic networks converging on these regulatory elements might unlock the regenerative potential of adult human hearts.",

    "abstract": "The yellow boxfish ( Ostracion cubicus) exhibits a combination of derived morphological traits specialized for coral reef environments and ancestral characteristics, including a fused dermal plate. Contradictory evolutionary evidence hinders true classification of O. cubicus. To clarify its evolutionary position within Tetraodontiformes, a chromosome-level genome assembly was generated, representing the most contiguous and complete genome to date for this lineage. Notably, O. cubicus possessed the largest genome within the order Tetraodontiformes, primarily due to extensive transposable element expansion. Phylogenetic analysis based on 19 whole genomes and 131 mitochondrial genomes resolved Tetraodontiformes into three major sister groups (Ostraciidae-Molidae, Tetraodontidae, and Balistidae-Monacanthidae). Comparative genomic evidence indicated that O. cubicus diverged early from the common ancestor of modern Tetraodontiformes and retained the highest number of HOX genes among surveyed taxa. Although overall genomic architecture was largely conserved, certain genetic and environmental changes may have contributed to its phenotypic adaptations, including climate cooling during the Miocene-Pliocene Transition, recent DNA and long interspersed nuclear element (LINE) transposon bursts, lineage-specific chromosomal rearrangements, and gene family expansion. Many positively selected genes and rapidly evolving genes were associated with skeletal development, including bmp7, egf7, and bmpr2. Transcriptomic comparisons between carapace and tail skin revealed various candidate genes and pathways related to carapace formation, such as postn, scpp1, and components of the TGF-beta signaling pathway. A derived amino acid substitution in eda, coupled with protein structural modeling, suggested potential molecular convergence in dermal plate formation among teleosts. These findings provide novel insights into the genomic and developmental basis of carapace evolution and coral reef-adaptation in O. cubicus, offering a strong case for evolutionary balance between genomic conservation with regulatory innovation to achieve coral reef specialization.",

    "title": "Inferring mammalian tissue-specific regulatory conservation by predicting tissue-specific differences in open chromatin.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Evolutionary conservation is an invaluable tool for inferring functional significance in the genome, including regions that are crucial across many species and those that have undergone convergent evolution. Computational methods to test for sequence conservation are dominated by algorithms that examine the ability of one or more nucleotides to align across large evolutionary distances. While these nucleotide alignment-based approaches have proven powerful for protein-coding genes and some non-coding elements, they fail to capture conservation of many enhancers, distal regulatory elements that control spatial and temporal patterns of gene expression. The function of enhancers is governed by a complex, often tissue- and cell type-specific code that links combinations of transcription factor binding sites and other regulation-related sequence patterns to regulatory activity. Thus, function of orthologous enhancer regions can be conserved across large evolutionary distances, even when nucleotide turnover is high. RESULTS: We present a new machine learning-based approach for evaluating enhancer conservation that leverages the combinatorial sequence code of enhancer activity rather than relying on the alignment of individual nucleotides. We first train a convolutional neural network model that can predict tissue-specific open chromatin, a proxy for enhancer activity, across mammals. Next, we apply that model to distinguish instances where the genome sequence would predict conserved function versus a loss of regulatory activity in that tissue. We present criteria for systematically evaluating model performance for this task and use them to demonstrate that our models accurately predict tissue-specific conservation and divergence in open chromatin between primate and rodent species, vastly out-performing leading nucleotide alignment-based approaches. We then apply our models to predict open chromatin at orthologs of brain and liver open chromatin regions across hundreds of mammals and find that brain enhancers associated with neuron activity have a stronger tendency than the general population to have predicted lineage-specific open chromatin. CONCLUSION: The framework presented here provides a mechanism to annotate tissue-specific regulatory function across hundreds of genomes and to study enhancer evolution using predicted regulatory differences rather than nucleotide-level conservation measurements.",

These highly connected genes adopted an active chromatin state in early differentiating cells, consistent with lineage commitment. Base-pair-resolution neural network models identified strong cell-type-specific enrichment of noncoding mutations predicted to be disruptive in a cohort of ASD individuals and identified frequently disrupted TF binding sites. This approach illustrates how cell-type-specific mapping can provide insights into the programs governing human development and disease.",

Concomitant single-cell ATAC sequencing exposes underlying dynamics of open chromatin landscapes and regenerative gene regulatory networks of diverse cardiac cell types and reveals extracellular mediators of cardiomyocyte proliferation, angiogenesis, and fibroblast activation. Together, our data provide a transcriptional basis for neonatal heart regeneration at single-cell resolution and suggest strategies for enhancing cardiac function after injury.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR-based gene activation (CRISPRa) is a strategy for upregulating gene expression by targeting promoters or enhancers in a tissue/cell-type specific manner. Here, we describe an experimental framework that combines highly multiplexed perturbations with single-cell RNA sequencing (sc-RNA-seq) to identify cell-type-specific, CRISPRa-responsive cis-regulatory elements and the gene(s) they regulate. Random combinations of many gRNAs are introduced to each of many cells, which are then profiled and partitioned into test and control groups to test for effect(s) of CRISPRa perturbations of both enhancers and promoters on the expression of neighboring genes. Applying this method to a library of 493 gRNAs targeting candidate cis-regulatory elements in both K562 cells and iPSC-derived excitatory neurons, we identify gRNAs capable of specifically upregulating intended target genes and no other neighboring genes within 1 Mb, including gRNAs yielding upregulation of six autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) risk genes in neurons. A consistent pattern is that the responsiveness of individual enhancers to CRISPRa is restricted by cell type, implying a dependency on either chromatin landscape and/or additional trans-acting factors for successful gene activation. The approach outlined here may facilitate large-scale screens for gRNAs that activate genes in a cell type-specific manner.",

We assayed a library of core promoters in a mixture of HEK293 and K562 cells and showed that scMPRA is a reproducible, highly parallel, single-cell reporter gene assay that detects cell-type-specific cis-regulatory activity.

AAV vectors driven by these enhancers successfully targeted layer-specific glutamatergic neurons, GABAergic interneuron subtypes, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes with high specificity. Cross-species comparison revealed that some macaque enhancers are conserved and functional across species, but enhancers with layer-specific targeting in macaques did not label neurons in mice, highlighting evolutionary differences in cortical CREs. Targeting precision was further improved using a FLPo-dependent intersectional approach with two enhancers.

Among these, 40,831 were unique to AD tissues. Validation experiments confirmed the activity of many regions, including several candidate regulators of APP expression.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Analyzing disease-linked genetic variants via expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) helps identify potential disease-causing genes. Previous research prioritized genes by integrating Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) results with tissue-level eQTLs. Recent studies have explored brain cell type-specific eQTLs, but a systematic analysis across multiple Alzheimer's disease (AD) genome-wide association study (GWAS) datasets or comparisons between tissue-level and cell type-specific effects remain limited. Here, we integrated brain cell type-level and bulk-level eQTL datasets with AD GWAS datasets to identify potential causal genes. METHODS: We used Summary Data-Based Mendelian Randomization (SMR) and Bayesian Colocalization (COLOC) to integrate AD GWAS summary statistics with eQTLs datasets. Combining data from five AD GWAS, two single-cell eQTL datasets, and one bulk eQTL dataset, we identified novel candidate causal genes and further confirmed known ones. We investigated gene regulation through enhancer activity using H3K27ac and ATAC-seq data, performed protein-protein interaction (PPI) and pathway enrichment, and conducted a drug/compound enrichment analysis with Drug Signatures Database (DSigDB) to support drug repurposing for AD. RESULTS: We identified 28 candidate causal genes for AD, of which 12 were uniquely detected at the cell-type level, 9 were exclusive to the bulk level and 7 detected in both. Among the 19 cell-type level candidate causal genes, microglia contributed the highest number of candidate genes, followed by excitatory neurons, astrocytes, inhibitory neurons, oligodendrocytes, and oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). PABPC1 emerged as a novel candidate causal gene in astrocytes. We generated PPI networks for the candidate causal genes and found that pathways such as membrane organization, cell migration, and ERK1/2 and PI3K/AKT signaling were enriched. The AD-risk variant associated with candidate causal gene PABPC1 is located near or within enhancers only active in astrocytes. We classified the 28 genes into three drug tiers and identified druggable interactions, with imatinib mesylate emerging as a key candidate. A drug-target gene network was created to explore potential drug targets for AD. CONCLUSIONS: We systematically prioritized AD candidate causal genes based on cell type-level and bulk level molecular evidence. The integrative approach enhances our understanding of molecular mechanisms of AD-related genetic variants and facilitates interpretation of AD GWAS results.",

    "title": "Single-cell insights: pioneering an integrated atlas of chromatin accessibility and transcriptomic landscapes in diabetic cardiomyopathy.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) poses a growing health threat, elevating heart failure risk in diabetic individuals. Understanding DCM is crucial, with fibroblasts and endothelial cells playing pivotal roles in driving myocardial fibrosis and contributing to cardiac dysfunction. Advances in Multimodal single-cell profiling, such as scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq, provide deeper insights into DCM's unique cell states and molecular landscape for targeted therapeutic interventions. METHODS: Single-cell RNA and ATAC data from 10x Multiome libraries were processed using Cell Ranger ARC v2.0.1. Gene expression and ATAC data underwent Seurat and Signac filtration. Differential gene expression and accessible chromatin regions were identified. Transcription factor activity was estimated with chromVAR, and Cis-coaccessibility networks were calculated using Cicero. Coaccessibility connections were compared to the GeneHancer database. Gene Ontology analysis, biological process scoring, cell-cell communication analysis, and gene-motif correlation was performed to reveal intricate molecular changes. Immunofluorescent staining utilized various antibodies on paraffin-embedded tissues to verify the findings. RESULTS: This study integrated scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data obtained from hearts of WT and DCM mice, elucidating molecular changes at the single-cell level throughout the diabetic cardiomyopathy progression. Robust and accurate clustering analysis of the integrated data revealed altered cell proportions, showcasing decreased endothelial cells and macrophages, coupled with increased fibroblasts and myocardial cells in the DCM group, indicating enhanced fibrosis and endothelial damage. Chromatin accessibility analysis unveiled unique patterns in cell types, with heightened transcriptional activity in myocardial cells. Subpopulation analysis highlighted distinct changes in cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts, emphasizing pathways related to fatty acid metabolism and cardiac contraction. Fibroblast-centered communication analysis identified interactions with endothelial cells, implicating VEGF receptors. Endothelial cell subpopulations exhibited altered gene expressions, emphasizing contraction and growth-related pathways. Candidate regulators, including Tcf21, Arnt, Stat5a, and Stat5b, were identified, suggesting their pivotal roles in DCM development. Immunofluorescence staining validated marker genes of cell subpopulations, confirming PDK4, PPARgamma and Tpm1 as markers for metabolic pattern-altered cardiomyocytes, activated fibroblasts and endothelial cells with compromised proliferation. CONCLUSION: Our integrated scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq analysis unveils intricate cell states and molecular alterations in diabetic cardiomyopathy. Identified cell type-specific changes, transcription factors, and marker genes offer valuable insights. The study sheds light on potential therapeutic targets for DCM.",

    "abstract": "The establishment of cell types during development requires precise interactions between genes and distal regulatory sequences. We have a limited understanding of how these interactions look in three dimensions, vary across cell types in complex tissue, and relate to transcription. Here we describe optical reconstruction of chromatin architecture (ORCA), a method that can trace the DNA path in single cells with nanoscale accuracy and genomic resolution reaching two kilobases. We used ORCA to study a Hox gene cluster in cryosectioned Drosophila embryos and labelled around 30 RNA species in parallel. We identified cell-type-specific physical borders between active and Polycomb-repressed DNA, and unexpected Polycomb-independent borders. Deletion of Polycomb-independent borders led to ectopic enhancer-promoter contacts, aberrant gene expression, and developmental defects. Together, these results illustrate an approach for high-resolution, single-cell DNA domain analysis in vivo, identify domain structures that change with cell identity, and show that border elements contribute to the formation of physical domains in Drosophila.",

    "abstract": "With the advent of recent next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies in genomics, transcriptomics, and epigenomics, profiling single-cell sequencing became possible. The single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is widely used to characterize diverse cell populations and ascertain cell type-specific regulatory mechanisms. The gene regulatory network (GRN) mainly consists of genes and their regulators-transcription factors (TF). Here, we describe the lightning-fast Python implementation of the SCENIC (Single-Cell reEgulatory Network Inference and Clustering) pipeline called pySCENIC. Using single-cell RNA-seq data, it maps TFs onto gene regulatory networks and integrates various cell types to infer cell-specific GRNs. There are two fast and efficient GRN inference algorithms, GRNBoost2 and GENIE3, optionally available with pySCENIC. The pipeline has three steps: (1) identification of potential TF targets based on co-expression; (2) TF-motif enrichment analysis to identify the direct targets (regulons); and (3) scoring the activity of regulons (or other gene sets) on single cell types.",

However, an understanding of how extant genetic variants affect cis regulation remains limited. Here, we investigated the consequences of cis-regulatory diversity using single-cell genomics of more than 0.7 million nuclei across 172 Zea mays (maize) inbreds. Our analyses pinpointed cis-regulatory elements distinct to domesticated maize and revealed how historical transposon activity has shaped the cis-regulatory landscape. Leveraging population genetics principles, we fine-mapped about 22,000 chromatin accessibility-associated genetic variants with widespread cell type-specific effects. Variants in TEOSINTE BRANCHED1/CYCLOIDEA/PROLIFERATING CELL FACTOR-binding sites were the most prevalent determinants of chromatin accessibility. Finally, integrating chromatin accessibility-associated variants, organismal trait variation, and population differentiation revealed how local adaptation has rewired regulatory networks in unique cellular contexts to alter maize flowering.",

To advance our understanding of postnatal brain development, we simultaneously profiled gene expression and chromatin accessibility in 101,924 single nuclei from four brain regions across ten donors, covering five key postnatal stages from infancy to late adulthood. Using this dataset and chromosome conformation capture data, we constructed enhancer-based gene regulatory networks to identify cell-type-specific regulators of brain development and interpret genome-wide association study loci for ten main brain disorders. Our analysis connected 2,318 cell-specific loci to 1,149 unique genes, representing 41% of loci linked to the investigated traits, and highlighted 55 genes influencing several disease phenotypes. Pseudotime analysis revealed distinct stages of postnatal oligodendrogenesis and their regulatory programs.

We identified cell type-specific domains in which chromatin accessibility is highly correlated with gene expression. Differentiation pseudotime trajectory analysis indicates that chromatin accessibility at CREs precedes transcription and that dynamic changes in chromatin structure play a critical role in neuronal lineage commitment. In addition, we mapped cell type-specific and temporally specific genetic loci implicated in neuropsychiatric traits, including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Together, our results describe the complex regulation of cell composition at critical stages in lineage determination and shed light on the impact of spatiotemporal alterations in gene expression on neuropsychiatric disease.",

Here we report a comprehensive atlas of candidate cis-regulatory DNA elements (cCREs) in the adult mouse brain, generated by analysing chromatin accessibility in 2.3 million individual brain cells from 117 anatomical dissections. The atlas includes approximately 1 million cCREs and their chromatin accessibility across 1,482 distinct brain cell populations, adding over 446,000 cCREs to the most recent such annotation in the mouse genome. The mouse brain cCREs are moderately conserved in the human brain. The mouse-specific cCREs-specifically, those identified from a subset of cortical excitatory neurons-are strongly enriched for transposable elements, suggesting a potential role for transposable elements in the emergence of new regulatory programs and neuronal diversity. Finally, we infer the gene regulatory networks in over 260 subclasses of mouse brain cells and develop deep-learning models to predict the activities of gene regulatory elements in different brain cell types from the DNA sequence alone.

Switching from pro-inflammatory lipid mediators (PIMs) to specialized pro-resolving (SPMs) is a critical step toward acute inflammation resolution and preventing chronic inflammation. Although the biosynthetic pathways and enzymes for PIMs and SPMs have now been largely identified, the actual transcriptional profiles underlying the immune cell type-specific transcriptional profiles of these mediators are still unknown. Using the Atlas of Inflammation Resolution, we created a large network of gene regulatory interactions linked to the biosynthesis of SPMs and PIMs. By mapping single-cell sequencing data, we identified cell type-specific gene regulatory networks of the lipid mediator biosynthesis. Using machine learning approaches combined with network features, we identified cell clusters of similar transcriptional regulation and demonstrated how specific immune cell activation affects PIM and SPM profiles. We found substantial differences in regulatory networks in related cells, accounting for network-based preprocessing in functional single-cell analyses. Our results not only provide further insight into the gene regulation of lipid mediators in the immune response but also shed light on the contribution of selected cell types in their biosynthesis.",

    "abstract": "The recent development of single-cell techniques is essential to unravel complex biological systems. By measuring the transcriptome and the accessible genome on a single-cell level, cellular heterogeneity in a biological environment can be deciphered. Transcription factors act as key regulators activating and repressing downstream target genes, and together they constitute gene regulatory networks that govern cell morphology and identity. Dissecting these gene regulatory networks is crucial for understanding molecular mechanisms and disease, especially within highly complex biological systems. The gene regulatory network analysis software ANANSE and the motif enrichment software GimmeMotifs were both developed to analyse bulk datasets. We developed scANANSE, a software pipeline for gene regulatory network analysis and motif enrichment using single-cell RNA and ATAC datasets. The scANANSE pipeline can be run from either R or Python. First, it exports data from standard single-cell objects. Next, it automatically runs multiple comparisons of cell cluster data. Finally, it imports the results back to the single-cell object, where the result can be further visualised, integrated, and interpreted. Here, we demonstrate our scANANSE pipeline on a publicly available PBMC multi-omics dataset. It identifies well-known cell type-specific hematopoietic factors. Importantly, we also demonstrated that scANANSE combined with GimmeMotifs is able to predict transcription factors with both activating and repressing roles in gene regulation.",

Differential gene expression and accessibility sites are largely distinct within nuclei for each cell type and muscle fiber, with the largest numbers of regulatory events observed in the three muscle fiber types (slow, fast, and intermediate) and lumican (LUM)-expressing fibro-adipogenic progenitor cells. Single-cell regulatory circuit triad reconstruction (transcription factor, chromatin interaction site, regulated gene) also identifies largely distinct gene regulatory circuits modulated by exercise in the three muscle fiber types and LUM-expressing fibro-adipogenic progenitor cells, involving a total of 328 transcription factors acting at chromatin sites regulating 2025 genes.

We characterized the genome-wide chromatin architecture at bulk and single-cell resolution, applying sci-ATAC-seq on whole 24-hpf stage zebrafish embryos, generating accessibility profiles for  approximately 23,000 single nuclei. We developed a genome segmentation method, ScregSeg (single-cell regulatory landscape segmentation), for defining regulatory programs, and candidate CREs, specific to one or more cell types. We integrated the ScregSeg output with bulk measurements for histone post-translational modifications and 3D genome organization and identified new regulatory principles between chromatin modalities prevalent during zebrafish development. Sci-ATAC-seq profiling of npas4l/cloche mutant embryos identified novel cellular roles for this hematovascular transcriptional master regulator and suggests an intricate mechanism regulating its expression.

These GRNs control temporal patterning in primary progenitors, regulate transition from primary to neurogenic progenitors, and drive specification of each major retinal cell type. We confirm that NFI transcription factors selectively activate expression of genes promoting late-stage temporal identity in primary retinal progenitors and identify other transcription factors that regulate rod photoreceptor specification in postnatal retina. This study inventories cis- and trans-acting factors that control retinal development and can guide cell-based therapies aimed at replacing retinal neurons lost to disease.",

    "abstract": "Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic (H-I) brain injury, a leading cause of neurodevelopmental disabilities, severely affects the metabolically active and neurogenic hippocampus. To investigate its acute effects and identify drug targets for early therapeutic windows, we applied single-nucleus RNA sequencing on postnatal day 8 (P8) mouse hippocampi under sham, hypoxic, and hypoxic-ischemic conditions. We constructed a comprehensive hippocampal cell atlas and developed a machine-learning classifier for precise cell type identification. Our analysis reveals early vulnerabilities in mature neurons and notable resilience in immature DG, GABAergic, and Cajal-Retzius cells following H-I. Gene regulatory network analysis identified key transcription factors associated with neuronal vulnerability, along with upregulated ribosome biogenesis and dysregulated calcium homeostasis pathways. We observed rapid activation of astrocytes and microglia, with Runx1 identified as a potential key transcription factor associated with early microglia immune responses. Endothelial cells displayed complex transcriptional changes and predicted intercellular signaling patterns that may influence vascular repair and recovery. Our study advances the understanding of immediate cellular and transcriptional responses to neonatal H-I injury, providing new insights into hippocampal cell heterogeneity and pathophysiology.

    "abstract": "Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is known to modulate immune response in peripheral blood cells. The mechanisms of THC's effects on gene expression in human immune cells remains poorly understood. Combining a within-subject design with single cell transcriptome mapping, we report that THC acutely alters gene expression in 15,973 blood cells. We identified 294 transcriptome-wide significant genes among eight cell types including 69 common genes and 225 cell-type-specific genes affected by THC administration, including those genes involving in immune response, cytokine production, cell proliferation and apoptosis. We revealed distinct transcriptomic sub-clusters affected by THC in major immune cell types where THC perturbed cell-type-specific intracellular gene expression correlations. Gene set enrichment analysis further supports the findings of THC's common and cell-type-specific effects on immune response and cell toxicity. This comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic profiling provides important insights into THC's acute effects on immune function that may have important medical implications.",

    "abstract": "MOTIVATION: Identifying regulatory regions in the genome is of great interest for understanding the epigenomic landscape in cells. One fundamental challenge in this context is to find the target genes whose expression is affected by the regulatory regions. A recent successful method is the Activity-By-Contact (ABC) model which scores enhancer-gene interactions based on enhancer activity and the contact frequency of an enhancer to its target gene. However, it describes regulatory interactions entirely from a gene's perspective, and does not account for all the candidate target genes of an enhancer. In addition, the ABC model requires two types of assays to measure enhancer activity, which limits the applicability. Moreover, there is neither implementation available that could allow for an integration with transcription factor (TF) binding information nor an efficient analysis of single-cell data. RESULTS: We demonstrate that the ABC score can yield a higher accuracy by adapting the enhancer activity according to the number of contacts the enhancer has to its candidate target genes and also by considering all annotated transcription start sites of a gene. Further, we show that the model is comparably accurate with only one assay to measure enhancer activity. We combined our generalized ABC model with TF binding information and illustrated an analysis of a single-cell ATAC-seq dataset of the human heart, where we were able to characterize cell type-specific regulatory interactions and predict gene expression based on TF affinities. All executed processing steps are incorporated into our new computational pipeline STARE. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The software is available at https://github.com/schulzlab/STARE.

    "abstract": "In diploid organisms, biallelic gene expression enables the production of adequate levels of mRNA(1,2). This is essential for haploinsufficient genes, which require biallelic expression for optimal function to prevent the onset of developmental disorders(1,3). Whether and how a biallelic or monoallelic state is determined in a cell-type-specific manner at individual loci remains unclear. MSL2 is known for dosage compensation of the male X chromosome in flies. Here we identify a role of MSL2 in regulating allelic expression in mammals. Allele-specific bulk and single-cell analyses in mouse neural progenitor cells revealed that, in addition to the targets showing biallelic downregulation, a class of genes transitions from biallelic to monoallelic expression after MSL2 loss. Many of these genes are haploinsufficient. In the absence of MSL2, one allele remains active, retaining active histone modifications and transcription factor binding, whereas the other allele is silenced, exhibiting loss of promoter-enhancer contacts and the acquisition of DNA methylation. Msl2-knockout mice show perinatal lethality and heterogeneous phenotypes during embryonic development, supporting a role for MSL2 in regulating gene dosage. The role of MSL2 in preserving biallelic expression of specific dosage-sensitive genes sets the stage for further investigation of other factors that are involved in allelic dosage compensation in mammalian cells, with considerable implications for human disease.",

Yet, despite its complexity, gene regulatory logic can be broken down into modular components consisting of a transcription factor (TF) activating or repressing the target gene expression through its binding to a cis-regulatory region. We propose a nonparametric approach, TRIPOD, to detect and characterize the three-way relationships between a TF, its target gene, and the accessibility of the TF's binding site using single-cell RNA and ATAC multiomic data. We apply TRIPOD to interrogate the cell-type-specific regulatory logic in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and contrast our results to detections from enhancer databases, cis-eQTL studies, ChIP-seq experiments, and TF knockdown/knockout studies. We then apply TRIPOD to mouse embryonic brain data and identify regulatory relationships, validated by ChIP-seq and PLAC-seq. Finally, we demonstrate TRIPOD on the SHARE-seq data of differentiating mouse hair follicle cells and identify lineage-specific regulation supported by histone marks and super-enhancer annotations.

Together with RNA barcode stabilization via circularization, these scalable single-cell quantitative expression reporters provide high-contrast readouts, analogous to classic in situ assays but entirely from sequencing. Screening >200 regions of accessible chromatin in a multicellular in vitro model of early mammalian development, we identify 13 (8 previously uncharacterized) autonomous and cell-type-specific developmental CREs. We further demonstrate that chimeric CRE pairs generate cognate two-cell-type activity profiles and assess gain- and loss-of-function multicellular expression phenotypes from CRE variants with perturbed transcription factor binding sites. Single-cell quantitative expression reporters can be applied in developmental and multicellular systems to quantitatively characterize native, perturbed and synthetic CREs at scale, with high sensitivity and at single-cell resolution.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell RNA sequencing has enabled to capture the gene activities at single-cell resolution, thus allowing reconstruction of cell-type-specific gene regulatory networks (GRNs). The available algorithms for reconstructing GRNs are commonly designed for bulk RNA-seq data, and few of them are applicable to analyze scRNA-seq data by dealing with the dropout events and cellular heterogeneity. In this paper, we represent the joint gene expression distribution of a gene pair as an image and propose a novel supervised deep neural network called DeepDRIM which utilizes the image of the target TF-gene pair and the ones of the potential neighbors to reconstruct GRN from scRNA-seq data. Due to the consideration of TF-gene pair's neighborhood context, DeepDRIM can effectively eliminate the false positives caused by transitive gene-gene interactions. We compared DeepDRIM with nine GRN reconstruction algorithms designed for either bulk or single-cell RNA-seq data. It achieves evidently better performance for the scRNA-seq data collected from eight cell lines. The simulated data show that DeepDRIM is robust to the dropout rate, the cell number and the size of the training data. We further applied DeepDRIM to the scRNA-seq gene expression of B cells from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of the patients with mild and severe coronavirus disease 2019. We focused on the cell-type-specific GRN alteration and observed targets of TFs that were differentially expressed between the two statuses to be enriched in lysosome, apoptosis, response to decreased oxygen level and microtubule, which had been proved to be associated with coronavirus infection.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data has revolutionized our understanding of cellular heterogeneity, yet current approaches face challenges in efficiency, interpretability, and connecting molecular insights to therapeutic applications. Despite advances in deep learning methods, identifying cell-type-specific functional gene sets remains difficult. RESULTS: In this study, we present scKAN, an interpretable framework for scRNA-seq analysis with two primary goals: accurate cell-type annotation and the discovery of cell-type-specific marker genes and gene sets. The key innovation is using the learnable activation curves of the Kolmogorov-Arnold network to model gene-to-cell relationships. This approach provides a more direct way to visualize and interpret these specific interactions compared to the aggregated weighting schemes typical of attention mechanisms. This architecture achieves superior performance in cell-type annotation, with a 6.63% improvement in macro F1 score over state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, it enables the systematic identification of functionally coherent cell-type-specific gene sets. We demonstrate the framework's translational potential through a case study on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, where gene signatures identified by scKAN led to a potential drug repurposing candidate, whose binding stability was supported by molecular dynamics simulations. CONCLUSIONS: Our work establishes scKAN as an efficient and interpretable framework that effectively bridges single-cell analysis with drug discovery. By combining lightweight architecture with the ability to uncover nuanced biological patterns, our approach offers an interpretable method for translating large-scale single-cell data into actionable therapeutic strategies. This approach provides a robust foundation for accelerating the identification of cell-type-specific targets in complex diseases.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in single-cell transposase-accessible chromatin using a sequencing assay (scATAC-seq) allow cellular heterogeneity dissection and regulatory landscape reconstruction with an unprecedented resolution. However, compared to bulk-sequencing, its ultra-high missingness remarkably reduces usable reads in each cell type, resulting in broader, fuzzier peak boundary definitions and limiting our ability to pinpoint functional regions and interpret variant impacts precisely. We propose a weakly supervised learning method, scEpiLock, to directly identify core functional regions from coarse peak labels and quantify variant impacts in a cell-type-specific manner. First, scEpiLock uses a multi-label classifier to predict chromatin accessibility via a deep convolutional neural network. Then, its weakly supervised object detection module further refines the peak boundary definition using gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM). Finally, scEpiLock provides cell-type-specific variant impacts within a given peak region. We applied scEpiLock to various scATAC-seq datasets and found that it achieves an area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of ~0.9 and an area under precision recall (AUPR) above 0.7. Besides, scEpiLock's object detection condenses coarse peaks to only (1/3) of their original size while still reporting higher conservation scores. In addition, we applied scEpiLock on brain scATAC-seq data and reported several genome-wide association studies (GWAS) variants disrupting regulatory elements around known risk genes for Alzheimer's disease, demonstrating its potential to provide cell-type-specific biological insights in disease studies.",

    "abstract": "In plants, the biosynthetic pathways of some specialized metabolites are partitioned into specialized or rare cell types, as exemplified by the monoterpenoid indole alkaloid (MIA) pathway of Catharanthus roseus (Madagascar Periwinkle), the source of the anticancer compounds vinblastine and vincristine. In the leaf, the C. roseus MIA biosynthetic pathway is partitioned into three cell types with the final known steps of the pathway expressed in the rare cell type termed idioblast. How cell-type specificity of MIA biosynthesis is achieved is poorly understood. We generated single-cell multi-omics data from C. roseus leaves. Integrating gene expression and chromatin accessibility profiles across single cells, as well as transcription factor (TF)-binding site profiles, we constructed a cell-type-aware gene regulatory network for MIA biosynthesis. We showcased cell-type-specific TFs as well as cell-type-specific cis-regulatory elements. Using motif enrichment analysis, co-expression across cell types, and functional validation approaches, we discovered a novel idioblast-specific TF (Idioblast MYB1, CrIDM1) that activates expression of late-stage MIA biosynthetic genes in the idioblast. These analyses not only led to the discovery of the first documented cell-type-specific TF that regulates the expression of two idioblast-specific biosynthetic genes within an idioblast metabolic regulon but also provides insights into cell-type-specific metabolic regulation.",

    "abstract": "Germination involves highly dynamic transcriptional programs as the cells of seeds reactivate and express the functions necessary for establishment in the environment. Individual cell types have distinct roles within the embryo, so must therefore have cell type-specific gene expression and gene regulatory networks. We can better understand how the functions of different cell types are established and contribute to the embryo by determining how cell type-specific transcription begins and changes through germination. Here we describe a temporal analysis of the germinating Arabidopsis thaliana embryo at single-cell resolution. We define the highly dynamic cell type-specific patterns of gene expression and how these relate to changing cellular function as germination progresses. Underlying these are unique gene regulatory networks and transcription factor activity. We unexpectedly discover that most embryo cells transition through the same initial transcriptional state early in germination, even though cell identity has already been established during embryogenesis. Cells later transition to cell type-specific gene expression patterns. Furthermore, our analyses support previous findings that the earliest events leading to the induction of seed germination take place in the vasculature. Overall, our study constitutes a general framework with which to characterize Arabidopsis cell transcriptional states through seed germination, allowing investigation of different genotypes and other plant species whose seed strategies may differ.",

Most current models for how enhancers function invoke physical proximity between enhancer elements and their target genes. Here, we use an imaging-based approach to examine the spatial relationship of cell type-specific enhancers and their target genes with single-cell resolution. Using high-throughput microscopy, we measure the spatial distance from target promoters to their cell type-specific active and inactive enhancers in individual pancreatic cells derived from distinct lineages. We find increased proximity of all promoter-enhancer pairs relative to non-enhancer pairs separated by similar genomic distances. Strikingly, spatial proximity between enhancers and target genes was unrelated to tissue-specific enhancer activity. Furthermore, promoter-enhancer proximity did not correlate with the expression status of target genes. Our results suggest that promoter-enhancer pairs exist in a distinctive chromatin environment but that genome folding is not a universal driver of cell-type specificity in enhancer function.",

Here, we propose a novel causal criterion, neighbor cross-mapping entropy (NME), for inferring GRNs from both steady data and time-series data. NME is designed to quantify 'continuous causality' or functional dependency from one variable to another based on their function continuity with varying neighbor sizes. NME shows superior performance on benchmark datasets, comparing with existing methods. By applying to scRNA-seq datasets, NME not only reliably inferred GRNs for cell types but also identified cell states. Based on the inferred GRNs and further their activity matrices, NME showed better performance in single-cell clustering and downstream analyses. In summary, based on continuous causality, NME provides a powerful tool in inferring causal regulations of GRNs between genes from scRNA-seq data, which is further exploited to identify novel cell types/states and predict cell type-specific network modules.",

    "abstract": "Mineral nutrient uptake and deposition profoundly influence plant development, stress resilience, and productivity. Silicon (Si), though classified as a non-essential element, significantly influences a plant's physiology, particularly in fortifying defense responses and mitigating stress. While the genetic and molecular mechanisms of Si uptake and transport are well studied in monocots, particularly rice, their role in dicot species, such as soybean, remains unclear at the cellular and molecular levels. In this study, we utilized single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to dissect cellular responses to Si accumulation in soybean leaves. We identified distinct cellular populations, including a unique Si-induced or Si-associated cell cluster within vascular cells, suggesting a specialized mechanism of Si distribution. Si treatment notably induced the expression of defense-related genes, with a pronounced enrichment in vascular cells, underscoring their pivotal role in activating plant defense mechanisms. Moreover, Si modulated the expression of genes involved in phytoalexin biosynthesis, salicylic acid, and immune receptor signaling, suggesting transcriptional priming of genes involved in defense responses. Further investigation of Si transporters revealed precise expression of an Si efflux gene in epidermal cells in response to Si treatment. We also validated the role of efflux Si transporters using a Xenopus oocyte assay and CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing of composite soybean plant roots. This study provides critical insights into the biotic stress regulatory networks influenced by Si treatment in soybean leaves at the single-cell level, thus laying the foundation for enhancing stress tolerance through optimized mineral nutrient uptake.",

We identified 203 differentially expressed lncRNAs, including cell type-specific ones like MALAT1, NEAT1, ZFAS1, SNHG7, SNHG8, and SNHG25 modulating immune function in classical monocyte, NK T, proliferating NK, plasmablast, naive, and activated B/T cells.

Despite similar repeat element abundance, variant lncRNAs displayed higher Alu content, suggesting increased interactions with proximal and distal genes, crucial for immune response modulation. The comparable repeat abundance but distinct expression levels of variant and invariant lncRNAs highlight the significance of investigating the regulatory mechanisms of invariant lncRNAs.

    "title": "The characterization and validation of regulated cell death-related genes in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Regulated cell death (RCD), a genetically controlled process mediated by specialized molecular pathways (commonly termed programmed cell death), plays pivotal roles in diverse pathophysiological processes. However, the landscape and functional implications of RCD subtypes in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) remain poorly characterized. This study aimed to systematically investigate the involvement of RCD mechanisms in the pathogenesis and progression of CRSwNP. METHODS: Transcriptomic datasets (GSE136825, GSE23552, GSE198950, GSE196169, GSE156285) related to CRSwNP were retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. A comprehensive panel of 18 RCD-associated gene sets was compiled through a systematic literature review. Gene set variation analysis (GSVA) was employed to profile RCD activation patterns in CRSwNP. Integrative bioinformatics approaches including weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression were implemented to identify hub RCD-related genes and construct a cell death index (CDI). Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data were analyzed to map RCD dynamics across cellular subpopulations. Clinical validation was performed using qRT-PCR quantification of key genes in nasal polyp/inferior turbinate tissues, with the concurrent assessment of symptom severity via visual analogue scale (VAS) scores. RESULTS: GSVA revealed significant upregulation of 8 RCD subtypes in CRSwNP: apoptosis, ferroptosis, necroptosis, entotic cell death, lysosome-dependent cell death, NETosis, immunogenic cell death, and anoikis. Pathway enrichment analysis demonstrated that RCD-related differentially expressed genes were predominantly involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and immune-inflammatory regulation. Furthermore, the WGCNA algorithm and LASSO analysis identified 8 key cell death genes (PTHLH, GRINA, S100A9, SCG2, HMOX1, RNF183, TYROBP, SEMA7A), which were utilized to construct the cell death-related index (CDI). In training and validation cohorts, the CDI was significantly elevated in CRSwNP compared to control and exhibited high diagnostic performance, with elevated scores correlating with enhanced immune cell infiltration. Single-cell resolution analysis uncovered cell type-specific RCD activation patterns. Clinical validation confirmed significantly higher expression of S100A9, PTHLH, and HMOX1 in eosinophilic versus non-eosinophilic polyps. Notably, expression levels of PTHLH, S100A9, HMOX1, GRINA, and TYROBP showed strong positive correlations with VAS scores. CONCLUSIONS: Our investigation delineates an RCD activation signature in CRSwNP pathogenesis, characterized by 8 key cell death modalities and their regulatory genes. The novel CDI exhibits promising diagnostic potential, while mechanistic insights suggest RCD pathways may drive disease progression through EMT potentiation and inflammatory cascade amplification. These findings provide a framework for developing RCD-targeted therapeutic strategies in CRSwNP.",

    "abstract": "The dysregulation of gene expression programs in the human atria during persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) is not completely understood. Here, we reanalyze bulk RNA-sequencing datasets from two studies (N = 242) and identified 755 differentially expressed genes in left atrial appendages of individuals with persistent AF and non-AF controls. We combined the bulk RNA-sequencing differentially expressed genes with a left atrial appendage single-nucleus multi-omics dataset to assign genes to specific atrial cell types. We found noncoding genes at the IFNG locus (LINC01479, IFNG-AS1) strongly dysregulated in cardiomyocytes. We defined a gene expression signature potentially driven by androgen receptor signaling in cardiomyocytes from individuals with AF. Cell-type-specific gene expression modules suggested an increase in T cell and a decrease in adipocyte and neuronal cell gene expression in AF. Lastly, we showed that reducing NR4A1 expression, a marker of a poorly characterized human atrial fibroblast subtype, fibroblast activation markers, extracellular matrix remodeling and cell proliferation decreased.",

    "abstract": "Dysregulation of early B cell lymphopoiesis-the process guiding cellular immunity development-can lead to malignancy, making it crucial to understand its regulatory mechanisms. We generated a multiomics resource comprising paired chromatin accessibility and gene expression profiles across eight human B cell precursor populations, providing a detailed characterization of early human B cell development. Integrative analysis revealed highly cell type-specific regulatory elements and enabled the reconstruction of the gene regulatory network governing differentiation. We identified putative candidate regulons, such as ELK3, enriched in pro-B cells and potentially involved in cell cycle progression. Regulons from bulk data were projected onto single-cell data, validating their activity and refining the regulatory landscape. This resource enabled identification of active regulatory programs and transformation-associated states in B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The publicly available atlas provides a valuable resource for understanding B cell development and disease, supporting future efforts to decode regulatory programs in immunity and hematologic malignancies.",

    "title": "Single-cell gene regulation network inference by large-scale data integration.",
    "abstract": "Single-cell ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq) has proven to be a state-of-art approach to investigating gene regulation at the single-cell level. However, existing methods cannot precisely uncover cell-type-specific binding of transcription regulators (TRs) and construct gene regulation networks (GRNs) in single-cell. ChIP-seq has been widely used to profile TR binding sites in the past decades. Here, we developed SCRIP, an integrative method to infer single-cell TR activity and targets based on the integration of scATAC-seq and a large-scale TR ChIP-seq reference. Our method showed improved performance in evaluating TR binding activity compared to the existing motif-based methods and reached a higher consistency with matched TR expressions. Besides, our method enables identifying TR target genes as well as building GRNs at the single-cell resolution based on a regulatory potential model. We demonstrate SCRIP's utility in accurate cell-type clustering, lineage tracing, and inferring cell-type-specific GRNs in multiple biological systems.

    "title": "Cell type-specific transcriptional profiling: implications for metabolite profiling.",
    "abstract": "Plant development and survival is centered on complex regulatory networks composed of genes, proteins, hormone pathways, metabolites and signaling pathways. The recent advancements in whole genome biology have furthered our understanding of the interactions between these networks. As a result, numerous cell type-specific transcriptome profiles have been generated that have elucidated complex gene regulatory networks occurring at the cellular level, many of which were masked during whole-organ analysis. Modern technologies have also allowed researchers to generate multiple whole-organ metabolite profiles; however, only a limited number have been generated at the level of individual cells. Recent advancements in the isolation of individual cell populations have made cell type-specific metabolite profiles possible, enabling the enhanced detection and quantification of metabolites that were formerly unavailable when considering the whole organ. The comparison of metabolite and transcriptome profiles from the same cells has been a valuable resource to generate predictions regarding specific metabolite activity and function. In this review, we focus on recent studies that demonstrate the value of cell type-specific transcriptional profiles and their comparison with profiles generated from whole organs. Advancements in the isolation of single-cell populations will be highlighted, and the potential application towards generating detailed metabolic profiles will be discussed.",
