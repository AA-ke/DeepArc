Abstract:
We consider a nonlocal bistable reaction-diffusion equation, which serves as a model for a population structured by a phenotypic trait, subject to mutation, trait-dependent fitness, and nonlocal competition. Within this replicator-mutator framework, we further incorporate a ''pseudo-Allee effect'' so that the long time behavior (extinction vs. survival) depends on the size of the initial data. After proving the well-posedness of the associated Cauchy problem, we investigate its long-time behavior. We first show that small initial data lead to extinction. More surprisingly, we then prove that that extinction may also occur for too large initial data, in particular when selection is not strong enough. Finally, we exhibit situations where intermediate initial data lead to persistence, thereby revealing the existence of (at least) two thresholds. These results stand in sharp contrast with the behavior observed in local bistable equations.

Abstract:
We present a spatially-extended system of chemical reactions exhibiting adaptation to time-dependent influxes of reactants. Here adaptation is defined as improved reproductive success, namely the ability of one of the many locally stable states available to the system to expand in space at the expense of other states. We find that adaptation can arise simply by environmental exposure to sequences of varying influxes. This adaptation is specific to the temporal sequence yet flexible enough to generalize to related sequences. It is enhanced through repeated exposure to the same environmental sequence, representing a form of learning, and through spatial interactions, enabling natural selection to act and representing a form of collective learning. Finally, adaptation benefits from a nearby adapted state, representing a form of teacher-guided learning. By combining environmental drives and reproduction within a stochastic reaction-diffusion dynamics framework, our model lays a foundation for a theory of adaptation grounded in physical principles.

Abstract:
Large animal groups -- bird flocks, fish schools, insect swarms -- are often assumed to form by gradual aggregation of sparsely distributed individuals. Using a mathematically precise framework based on time-varying directed interaction networks, we show that this widely held view is incomplete.   The theory demonstrates that large moving groups do not arise by slow accumulation; instead, they emerge through the rapid merging of multiple pre-existing subgroups that are simultaneously activated under high-density conditions. The key mechanism is topological: the long-term interaction structure of any moving group contains a single dominant strongly connected component (SCC). This dominant SCC determines the collective velocity -- both speed and direction -- of the entire group.   When two subgroups encounter one another, the trailing subgroup aligns with -- and ultimately inherits -- the velocity of the dominant SCC of the leading subgroup. Repeated merging events naturally generate large groups whose speed is predicted to be lower than the mean speed of the original subgroups. The same dynamics explain several universal empirical features: broad neighbour-distance distributions, directional asymmetry in neighbour selection, and the characteristic narrow-front, wide-rear geometry of real flocks.   The framework yields testable predictions for STARFLAG-style 3D datasets, offering a unified explanation for the formation, maintenance, and geometry of coordinated animal groups.

Abstract:
We investigate whether the structural connectivity of urban road networks helps explain dengue incidence in Recife, Brazil (2015--2024). For each neighborhood, we compute the average \emph{communicability curvature}, a graph-theoretic measure capturing the ability of a locality to influence others through multiple network paths. We integrate this metric into Negative Binomial models, fixed-effects regressions, SAR/SAC spatial models, and a hierarchical INLA/BYM2 specification. Across all frameworks, curvature is the strongest and most stable predictor of dengue risk. In the BYM2 model, the structured spatial component collapses ($φ\approx 0$), indicating that functional network connectivity explains nearly all spatial dependence typically attributed to adjacency-based CAR terms. The results show that dengue spread in Recife is driven less by geographic contiguity and more by network-mediated structural flows.

Abstract:
Mutualisms are key for structuring ecological communities, but they are sensitive to environmental change and fluctuations in population size. Consequently, how mutualisms achieve stability remains an open question in ecological theory. Motivated by previous results in competitive and predator-prey interactions, we hypothesize that self-organized pattern formation can act as a key stabilizing mechanism of mutualistic interactions. We test this hypothesis using a two-species reaction-diffusion model of a plant-pollinator system that incorporates non-local plant competition and local mutualistic interactions. We first perform a linear stability analysis to determine the conditions under which non-local competition can trigger vegetation pattern formation. We then compute the bifurcation diagrams for both spatial and homogeneous solutions and find that pattern formation enables coexistence at mutualistic strengths below the threshold required in well-mixed populations. This stability gain increases as environmental conditions worsen, because local maxima in vegetation density create the conditions for community persistence despite globally harsh conditions. Moreover, in the strong mutualism limit, the spatial system exhibits multistability between patterned and homogeneous solutions, creating alternative stable configurations that can buffer against fluctuations in population abundance. Spatial self-organization thus stabilizes mutualistic communities through spatial patterns, potentially driving plant-pollinator persistence in stressed environments, including arid ecosystems.

Abstract:
Building upon the eco-evolutionary game dynamics framework established by Tilman et al., we investigate stochastic fluctuations in a two-strategy system incorporating environmental feedback mechanisms, where the payoff matrix exhibits population size dependence. We adopt a systematic approach which is the so-called $Ω$-expansion. When the stochastic factor is integrated, it is shown that the population size for each strategy fluctuates around the interior equilibrium of the macroscopic equations (corresponding to the deterministic model of the eco-evolutionary game) and its variance converges to a constant that is proportional to the environmental carrying capacity if the interior equilibrium is asymptotically stable. The simulation results demonstrate that the $Ω$ expansion provides a valid approximation, and the reliability of the aforementioned conclusions is verified. Therefore, analogous to Fudenberg and Harris' s stochastic replicator dynamics for infinite populations under external noise (\emph{J. Econ. Theory 57, 420-441}), the dynamic stability of the eco-evolutionary game can be extended to the stochastic regime when the environmental carrying capacity is sufficiently large.

Abstract:
The genetic evolution of SARS-CoV-2 has caused recurring epidemic waves, understanding its global dispersal patterns is critical for effective surveillance. We developed the Site-based mutation dynamics - Equal Power Sampling (S-EPS) framework, a phylogenetic-free, bias-correcting framework for profiling viral source-sink dynamics. Applying S-EPS to 6.6 million SARS-CoV-2 genomes (March 2020 - June 2024) from 13 regions worldwide, we identified Africa and the Indian subcontinent as the predominant sources of key mutations. Southeast Asia serves as an early transmission hub, while Russia and South America mainly acted as sinks. Key mutations took longer to establish fitness in source regions than externally. Once an amino acid substitution on the receptor-binding domain reached 1% prevalence in major sources, there is an 80% probability it would spread elsewhere, with a 2-month median lead time (IQR: 1-4). Our findings underscore the importance of genetic surveillance, with S-EPS offering enhanced capability for monitoring emerging viral threats.

Abstract:
Phylogenetic trees and networks are graphs used to model evolutionary relationships, with trees representing strictly branching histories and networks allowing for events in which lineages merge, called reticulation events. While the question of data sufficiency has been studied extensively in the context of trees, it remains largely unexplored for networks. In this work we take a first step in this direction by establishing bounds on the amount of genomic data required to reconstruct binary level-$1$ semi-directed phylogenetic networks, which are binary networks in which reticulation events are indicated by directed edges, all other edges are undirected, and cycles are vertex-disjoint. For this class, methods have been developed recently that are statistically consistent. Roughly speaking, such methods are guaranteed to reconstruct the correct network assuming infinitely long genomic sequences. Here we consider the question whether networks from this class can be uniquely and correctly reconstructed from finite sequences. Specifically, we present an inference algorithm that takes as input genetic sequence data, and demonstrate that the sequence length sufficient to reconstruct the correct network with high probability, under the Cavender-Farris-Neyman model of evolution, scales logarithmically, polynomially, or polylogarithmically with the number of taxa, depending on the parameter regime. As part of our contribution, we also present novel inference rules for quartet data in the semi-directed phylogenetic network setting.

Abstract:
Fixed tree topologies are widely used in phylodynamic analyses to reduce computational burden, yet the consequences of this assumption remain insufficiently understood. Here, we systematically assess the impact of various fixed-topology strategies on phylogenetic and phylodynamic parameter estimates across a diverse set of viral datasets. We compare fully Bayesian joint inference with fixed-topology strategies, including conditioning on maximum likelihood trees subsequently dated with LSD or TreeTime. Our analyses show that global parameters of the substitution and site models are largely robust to the fixed-topology assumption, whereas parameters that depend on the temporal structure of the tree, such as molecular clock rates, node ages, and demographic histories, can exhibit substantial biases. We do treat unconstrained Bayesian analyses as the reference, although we recognize that these too are model-based approximations. Nevertheless, our results highlight serious discordance associated with fixing the topology and underscore the need for faster, time-aware methods that simultaneously integrate topology and parameter estimation. These findings raise important questions about the balance between computational efficiency and inferential accuracy in phylodynamic studies.

Abstract:
Mechanistic models are essential tools across ecology, epidemiology, and the life sciences, but parameter inference remains challenging when likelihood functions are intractable. Approximate Bayesian Computation with Sequential Monte Carlo (ABC-SMC) offers a powerful likelihood-free alternative that requires only the ability to simulate data from mechanistic models. Despite its potential, many researchers remain hesitant to adopt these methods due to perceived complexity. This tutorial bridges that gap by providing a practical, example-driven introduction to ABC-SMC using Python. From predator-prey dynamics to hierarchical epidemic models, we illustrate by example how to implement, diagnose, and interpret ABC-SMC analyses. Each example builds intuition about when and why ABC-SMC works, how partial observability affects parameter identifiability, and how hierarchical structures naturally emerge in Bayesian frameworks. All code leverages PyMC's modern probabilistic programming interface, ensuring reproducibility and easy adaptation to new problems.

Abstract:
We considered a model for an infectious disease outbreak, when the depletion of susceptible individuals is negligible, and assumed that individuals adapt their behavior according to the information they receive about new cases. In line with the information index approach, we supposed that individuals react to past information according to a memory kernel that is continuously distributed in the past. We analyzed equilibria and their stability, with analytical results for selected cases. Thanks to the recently developed pseudospectral approximation of delay equations, we studied numerically the long-term dynamics of the model for memory kernels defined by gamma distributions with a general non-integer shape parameter, extending the analysis beyond what is allowed by the linear chain trick. In agreement with previous studies, we showed that behavior adaptation alone can cause sustained waves of infections even in an outbreak scenario, and notably in the absence of other processes like demographic turnover, seasonality, or waning immunity. Our analysis gives a more general insight into how the period and peak of epidemic waves depend on the shape of the memory kernel and how the level of minimal contact impacts the stability of the behavior-induced positive equilibrium.

Abstract:
Clemmesen's hook refers to a commonly observed slowdown and rebound in breast cancer incidence around the age at menopause. It suggests a shift in the underlying carcinogenic dynamics, but the mechanistic basis remains poorly understood. Building on our previously developed Extended Multistage Clonal Expansion Tumor (MSCE-T) model, we perform a theoretical analysis to determine the conditions under which Clemmesen's hook would occur. Our results show that Clemmesen's hook can be quantitatively explained by time-specific changes in the proliferative and apoptotic balance of early-stage mutated cell populations, corresponding to the decline in progesterone levels and progesterone-driven proliferation due to reduced menstrual cycles preceding menopause, and changing dominant carcinogenic impact from alternative growth pathways post-menopause (e.g., adipose-derived growth signals). In contrast, variation in last-stage clonal dynamics cannot effectively reproduce the observed non-monotonic incidence pattern. Analytical results further demonstrate that midlife incidence dynamics corresponding to the hook are governed primarily by intrinsic proliferative processes rather than detection effects. Overall, this study provides a mechanistic and mathematical explanation for Clemmesen's hook and establishes a quantitative framework linking hormonal transitions during menopause to age-specific breast cancer incidence curve.

Abstract:
Originating in evolutionary game theory, the class of "zero-determinant" strategies enables a player to unilaterally enforce linear payoff relationships in simple repeated games. An upshot of this kind of payoff constraint is that it can shape the incentives for the opponent in a predetermined way. An example is when a player ensures that the agents get equal payoffs. While extensively studied in infinite-horizon games, extensions to discounted games, nonlinear payoff relationships, richer strategic environments, and behaviors with long memory remain incompletely understood. In this paper, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for a player to enforce arbitrary payoff relationships (linear or nonlinear), in expectation, in discounted games. These conditions characterize precisely which payoff relationships are enforceable using strategies of arbitrary complexity. Our main result establishes that any such enforceable relationship can actually be implemented using a simple two-point reactive learning strategy, which conditions on the opponent's most recent action and the player's own previous mixed action, using information from only one round into the past. For additive payoff constraints, we show that enforcement is possible using even simpler (reactive) strategies that depend solely on the opponent's last move. In other words, this tractable class is universal within expectation-enforcing strategies. As examples, we apply these results to characterize extortionate, generous, equalizer, and fair strategies in the iterated prisoner's dilemma, asymmetric donation game, nonlinear donation game, and the hawk-dove game, identifying precisely when each class of strategy is enforceable and with what minimum discount factor.

Abstract:
We look at the interaction of dispersal and environmental stochasticity in $n$-patch models. We are able to prove persistence and extinction results even in the setting when the dispersal rates are stochastic. As applications we look at Beverton-Holt and Hassell functional responses. We find explicit approximations for the total population size at stationarity when we look at slow and fast dispersal. In particular, we show that if dispersal is small then in the Beverton-Holt setting, if the carrying capacity is random, then environmental fluctuations are always detrimental and decrease the total population size. Instead, in the Hassell setting, if the inverse of the carrying capacity is made random, then environmental fluctuations always increase the population size. Fast dispersal can save populations from extinction and therefore increase the total population size. We also analyze a different type of environmental fluctuation which comes from switching environmental states according to a Markov chain and find explicit approximations when the switching is either fast or slow - in examples we are able to show that slow switching leads to a higher population size than fast switching.   Using and modifying some approximation results due to Cuello, we find expressions for the total population size in the $n=2$ patch setting when the growth rates, carrying capacities, and dispersal rates are influenced by random fluctuations. We find that there is a complicated interaction between the various terms and that the covariances between the various random parameters (growth rate, carrying capacity, dispersal rate) play a key role in whether we get an increase or a decrease in the total population size. Environmental fluctuations turn to sometimes be beneficial -- this show that not only dispersal, but also environmental stochasticity can lead to an increase in population size.

Abstract:
Collective vigilance describes how animals in groups benefit from the predator detection efforts of others. Empirical observations typically find either a many-eyes strategy with all (or many) group members maintaining a low level of individual vigilance, or a sentinel strategy with one (or a few) individuals maintaining a high level of individual vigilance while others do not. With a general analytical treatment that makes minimal assumptions, we show that these two strategies are alternate solutions to the same adaptive problem of balancing the costs of predation and vigilance. Which strategy is preferred depends on how costs scale with the level of individual vigilance: many-eyes strategies are preferred where costs of vigilance rise gently at low levels but become steeper at higher levels (convex; e.g. an open field); sentinel strategies are preferred where costs of vigilance rise steeply at low levels and then flatten out (concave; e.g. environments with vantage points). This same dichotomy emerges whether individuals act selfishly to optimise their own fitness or cooperatively to optimise group fitness. The model is extended to explain discrete behavioural switching between strategies and differential levels of vigilance such as edge effects.

Abstract:
Population heterogeneity is a key factor in epidemic dynamics, influencing both transmission and final epidemic size. While heterogeneity is often modeled through age structure, spatial location, or contact patterns, differences in host susceptibility have recently gained attention, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Building on the framework of Diekmann and Inaba (Journal of Mathematical Biology, 2023), we focus on the special case of SEIR-models, which are widely used for influenza and other respiratory infections. We derive the model equations under two distinct assumptions linking susceptibility and infectiousness. Analytical results show that heterogeneity in susceptibility reduces the epidemic final size compared to homogeneous models with the same basic reproduction number $\Ro$. In the case of gamma-distributed susceptibility, we obtain stronger results on the epidemic final size. The resulting model captures population heterogeneity through a single parameter, which makes it practical for fitting epidemic data. We illustrate its use by applying it to seasonal influenza in Italy.

Abstract:
We present ContagionRL, a Gymnasium-compatible reinforcement learning platform specifically designed for systematic reward engineering in spatial epidemic simulations. Unlike traditional agent-based models that rely on fixed behavioral rules, our platform enables rigorous evaluation of how reward function design affects learned survival strategies across diverse epidemic scenarios. ContagionRL integrates a spatial SIRS+D epidemiological model with configurable environmental parameters, allowing researchers to stress-test reward functions under varying conditions including limited observability, different movement patterns, and heterogeneous population dynamics. We evaluate five distinct reward designs, ranging from sparse survival bonuses to a novel potential field approach, across multiple RL algorithms (PPO, SAC, A2C). Through systematic ablation studies, we identify that directional guidance and explicit adherence incentives are critical components for robust policy learning. Our comprehensive evaluation across varying infection rates, grid sizes, visibility constraints, and movement patterns reveals that reward function choice dramatically impacts agent behavior and survival outcomes. Agents trained with our potential field reward consistently achieve superior performance, learning maximal adherence to non-pharmaceutical interventions while developing sophisticated spatial avoidance strategies. The platform's modular design enables systematic exploration of reward-behavior relationships, addressing a knowledge gap in models of this type where reward engineering has received limited attention. ContagionRL is an effective platform for studying adaptive behavioral responses in epidemic contexts and highlight the importance of reward design, information structure, and environmental predictability in learning.

Abstract:
Collapse Lineage Tree (CLTree) is a software tool that annotates, roots, and evaluates phylogenetic trees by using lineages. A recursive algorithm was designed to annotate the branches by the common taxonomic lineage of its descendants in a rooted tree. For an unrooted tree, it determines the root that best conforms to the taxonomic system based on the aforementioned lineage annotations. Based on the lineage annotations of notes, CLTree infers the monophyly of taxonomic units and quantifies the concordance between the phylogenetic tree and the taxonomic system base on Shannon entropy. The core algorithm of CLTree is highly efficient with linear complexity, capable of processing phylogenetic trees with 17,955 terminal nodes within one second. We believe that CLTree will serve as a powerful tool for study of evolution and taxonomy.

Abstract:
Understanding how cooperation emerges and persists is a central challenge in evolutionary game theory. Existing models often rely on restricted, hand-picked strategy sets, which can overlook critical behavioural pathways. A recent four-strategy framework showed that cheap talk can promote cooperation through local interactions, yet it remained unclear whether modelled strategies might alter these conclusions. Here, we extend this framework to the complete set of eight strategies that naturally arise from communication and decision-making rules. We show that incorporating the full strategy space dramatically changes the evolutionary landscape. Cooperation becomes both more robust and more versatile, driven by novel pathways absent in the restricted model. In particular, we uncover a previously overlooked mechanism in which suspicious cooperation catalyses a cyclic dynamic that sustains cooperation. Conversely, the assumed role of strategic defection in the biased model is fragile, acting mainly as a spoiler rather than a genuine evolutionary attractor. The complete model further reveals a rich spectrum of long-term behaviours, including stable coexistence among up to seven strategies and time-varying patterns of partial coexistence. These results demonstrate that the full strategy space unlocks hidden routes to cooperative behaviour and highlight the importance of comprehensive modelling when explaining the emergence of cooperation.

Abstract:
Real ecosystems are characterized by sparse and asymmetric interactions, posing a major challenge to theoretical analysis. We introduce a new method to study the generalized Lotka-Volterra model with stochastic dynamics on sparse graphs. By deriving local Fokker-Planck equations and employing a mean-field closure, we can efficiently compute stationary states for both symmetric and asymmetric interactions. We validate our approach by comparing the results with the direct integration of the dynamical equations and by reproducing known results and, for the first time, we map the phase diagram for sparse asymmetric networks. Our framework provides a versatile tool for exploring stability in realistic ecological communities and can be generalized to applications in different contexts, such as economics and evolutionary game theory.

Abstract:
We study a model for a mosquito-borne epidemic outbreak in which humans can adopt protective behaviour against vector bites depending on information on the past and present prevalence. Assuming that mosquitoes can also feed on other non-competent hosts (i.e. hosts that cannot infect others), we first review some results from the literature by showing that protective behaviour may either decrease or increase the value of the reproduction number of the epidemic depending on multiple elements. Then, assuming that changes in opinion occur much faster than the spread of the disease, we exploit an approach based on the Geometric Singular Perturbation Theory to reduce the two-group model to a model for a homogeneous host population. Then, we use the resulting model to investigate the effect of information-induced behavioural changes on the transient dynamics of the epidemic, discussing the case when protective measures induced an outbreak with a low attack rate. We illustrate how behavioural changes might either help in containing an epidemic outbreak or make the epidemic last longer, even triggering recurrent damped epidemic waves. We conclude with numerical simulations to illustrate our analytical results.

Abstract:
In mathematical phylogenetics, labeled histories describe the sequences by which sets of labeled lineages coalesce to a shared ancestral lineage. We study labeled histories for at-most-$r$-furcating trees. Consider a rooted leaf-labeled tree in which internal nodes each have $i$ offspring, and $i$ is permitted to range from 2 to $r$ across internal nodes, for a specified value of $r$. For labeled topologies with $n$ leaves, we enumerate the total number of labeled histories with at-most-$r$-furcation. We enumerate the labeled histories possessed by a specific at-most-$r$-furcating labeled topology. We then demonstrate that the maximally probable at-most-$r$-furcating unlabeled topology on $n \geq 2$ leaves -- the unlabeled topology whose labelings have the largest number of labeled histories -- is the maximally probable strictly bifurcating unlabeled topology on $n$ leaves. Finally, we enumerate labeled histories for at-most-$r$-furcating labeled topologies in a setting that permits simultaneous branchings. We similarly reduce the problem of identifying the maximally probable at-most-$r$-furcating unlabeled topology on $n \geq 2$ leaves, allowing simultaneity, to that of identifying the maximally probable strictly bifurcating unlabeled topology on $n$ leaves, with simultaneity; we conjecture the shape of this bifurcating unlabeled topology. The computations contribute to the study of multifurcation, which arises in various biological processes, and they connect to analogous mathematical settings involving precedence-constrained scheduling.

Abstract:
An age structured mathematical model with time dependent parameters is developed to investigate the dynamics of dengue transmission. Its properties are thoroughly analyzed in the first part of this work, as for example its disease free steady state, the corresponding effective reproduction numbers, its basic reproduction number (obtained via the Euler and Lotka equation and the next generation matrix approach). We also provide formulas for the time-varying effective reproduction number, and draw relations with the instantaneous growth rate. In the second part, we apply this model to Brazil and use weekly time series data from this country. Various medical parameters are firstly evaluated from these data, and an extensive numerical simulations for the period 2021 to 2024 is then carried out. Estimation of the transmission rates are derived both from epidemiological data and from environmental data such as temperature and humidity. The time-varying effective reproduction numbers are then estimated on these data, following the theoretical investigations performed in the first part. The sensitive parameters that significantly affect the model dynamics are presented graphically. Model predictions for following year by using different transmission rates are finally presented. Our findings show the importance of population age distribution, vector population dynamics, and climate, contributing to a deeper understanding of dengue transmission dynamics in Brazil.

Abstract:
We present a new class of models for assessing the cell dynamics characterising muscular dystrophies. The proposed approach comprises a system of integro-differential equations for the statistical distributions, over a large patient cohort, of the densities of muscle fibers and immune cells implicated in muscle inflammation, degeneration, and regeneration, which underpin disease development. Considering an appropriately scaled version of this model, we formally derive, as the corresponding mean-field limit, a system of Fokker-Planck equations, from which we subsequently derive, as a macroscopic model counterpart, a system of differential equations for the mean densities of muscle and immune cells in the cohort of patients and the related variances. Then, we study long-time asymptotics for the mean-field model by determining the quasi-equilibrium cell distribution functions, which are in the form of probability density functions of inverse Gamma distributions, and proving the long-time convergence to such quasi-equilibrium distributions. The analytical results obtained are illustrated by means of a sample of results of numerical simulations. The modeling approach presented here has the potential to offer new insights into the balance between degeneration and regeneration mechanisms in the progression of muscular dystrophies, and provides a basis for future extensions, including the modeling of therapeutic interventions.

Abstract:
In temperate regions, respiratory virus epidemics recur on a yearly basis, primarily during the winter season. This is believed to be induced by seasonal forcing, where the rate at which the virus can be transmitted varies cyclically across the course of each year. Seasonal epidemics can place substantial burden upon the healthcare system, with large numbers of infections and hospitalisations occurring across a short time period. However, the interactions between seasonal forcing and the factors necessary for epidemic resurgence - such as waning immunity, antigenic variation or demography - remain poorly understood. In this manuscript, we examine how the dynamics of antibody waning and antigenic variation can shape the seasonal recurrence of epidemics. We develop a susceptible-infectious-susceptible (SIS) immuno-epidemiological model of respiratory virus spread, where the susceptible population is stratified by their antibody level against the currently circulating strain of the virus, with this decaying as both antibody waning and antigenic drift occur. In the absence of seasonal forcing, we demonstrate the existence of two Hopf bifurcations over the effective antibody decay rate, with associated periodic model solutions. When seasonal forcing is introduced, we identify complex interactions between the strength of forcing and the effective antibody decay rate, yielding myriad dynamics including multi-year periodicity, quasiperiodicity and chaos. The timing and magnitude of seasonal epidemics is highly sensitive to this interaction, with the distribution of infection timing (by time of year) varying substantially across the parameter space. Finally, we show that seasonal forcing can produce resonant amplification (or damping) resulting in a cumulative infection burdens that is greater (or lesser) than would otherwise be observed.

Abstract:
Benthic habitat is challenging due to the environmental complexity of the seafloor, technological limitations, and elevated operational costs, especially in under-explored regions. This generates knowledge gaps for the sustainable management of hydrobiological resources and their nexus with society. We developed ECOSAIC (Ecological Compression via Orthogonal Specialized Autoencoders for Interpretable Classification), an Artificial Intelligence framework for automatic classification of benthic habitats through interpretable latent representations using a customizable autoencoder. ECOSAIC compresses n-dimensional feature space by optimizing specialization and orthogonality between domain-informed features. We employed two domain-informed categories: biogeochemical and hydrogeomorphological, that together integrate biological, physicochemical, hydrological and geomorphological, features, whose constraints on habitats have been recognized in ecology for a century. We applied the model to the Colombian Pacific Ocean and the results revealed 16 benthic habitats, expanding from mangroves to deep rocky areas up to 1000 m depth. The candidate habitats exhibited a strong correspondence between their environmental constraints, represented in latent space, and their expected species composition. This correspondence reflected meaningful ecological associations rather than purely statistical correlations, where the habitat's environmental offerings align semantically with the species' requirements. This approach could improve the management and conservation of benthic habitats, facilitating the development of functional maps that support marine planning, biodiversity conservation and fish stock assessment. We also hope it provides new insights into how ecological principles can inform AI frameworks, particularly given the substantial data limitations that characterize ecological research.

Abstract:
Trained on massive cross-species DNA corpora, DNA large language models (LLMs) learn the fundamental "grammar" and evolutionary patterns of genomic sequences. This makes them powerful priors for DNA sequence modeling, particularly over long ranges. However, two major constraints hinder their use in practice: the quadratic computational cost of self-attention and the growing memory required for key-value (KV) caches during autoregressive decoding. These constraints force the use of heuristics such as fixed-window truncation or sliding windows, which compromise fidelity on ultra-long sequences by discarding distant information. We introduce FOCUS (Feature-Oriented Compression for Ultra-long Self-attention), a progressive context-compression module that can be plugged into pretrained DNA LLMs. FOCUS combines the established k-mer representation in genomics with learnable hierarchical compression: it inserts summary tokens at k-mer granularity and progressively compresses attention key and value activations across multiple Transformer layers, retaining only the summary KV states across windows while discarding ordinary-token KV. A shared-boundary windowing scheme yields a stationary cross-window interface that propagates long-range information with minimal loss. We validate FOCUS on an Evo-2-based DNA LLM fine-tuned on GRCh38 chromosome 1 with self-supervised training and randomized compression schedules to promote robustness across compression ratios. On held-out human chromosomes, FOCUS achieves near-lossless fidelity: compressing a 1 kb context into only 10 summary tokens (about 100x) shifts the average per-nucleotide probability by only about 0.0004. Compared to a baseline without compression, FOCUS reduces KV-cache memory and converts effective inference scaling from O(N^2) to near-linear O(N), enabling about 100x longer inference windows on commodity GPUs with near-lossless fidelity.

Abstract:
In this work, we study the finite-population behaviour of the Reed-Frost epidemic model. Our analysis relies on the exact expression for the final epidemic size, replaced by Monte Carlo simulations in cases where the exact formula becomes numerically unstable. When the initial reproduction number is greater than a critical threshold, the distribution of the final size becomes bimodal. We therefore define the probabilities of small and large outbreaks, providing an intuitive answer to the question posed in the title through simple arguments based on the geometric distribution. Finally, an agent-based simulation confirms that the Reed-Frost model offers a good approximation in the case of the COVID-19 outbreak.

Abstract:
In this work, we integrate theoretical modeling, molecular simulation, and empirical analysis to identify and characterize evolutionary hysteresis. We first show how epistatic interactions create bistable fitness landscapes and structural hysteresis in a two-locus Wright-Fisher model, revealing two distinct hysteresis regimes under cyclic and noisy selection. Notably, an epistatically constrained population achieves maximal average fitness at an intermediate level of environmental stochasticity. We then extend this framework to more complex systems, demonstrating robust hysteresis loops in both a disordered multi-locus model and in biophysically realistic simulation of protein structural flexibility. Finally, we present direct empirical evidence of evolutionary hysteresis. By analyzing two decades of metagenomic time-series data from freshwater C. Nanopelagicaceae experiencing strong seasonal temperature cycles, we find that approximately 65% of seasonally oscillating alleles exhibit statistically significant hysteresis. Together, these results establish hysteresis as a general, measurable feature of evolution and a potential probe of complex fitness landscapes.

Abstract:
Ecological processes depend on the flow and balance of essential elements such as carbon (C) and phosphorus (P), and changes in these elements can cause adverse effects to ecosystems. The theory of Ecological Stoichiometry offers a conceptual framework to investigate the impact of elemental imbalances on structured populations while simultaneously considering how ecological structures regulate nutrient cycling and ecosystem processes. While there have been significant advances in the development of stoichiometric food web models, these efforts often consider a homogeneous population and neglect stage-structure. The development of stage-structured population models has significantly contributed to understanding energy flow and population dynamics of ecological systems. However, stage structure models fail to consider food quality in addition to food quantity. We develop a stoichiometric stage-structure producer-grazer model that considers co-limitation of nutrients, and parameterize the model for an algae-Daphnia food chain. Our findings emphasize the impact of stoichiometric constraints on structured population dynamics. By incorporating both food quantity and quality into maturation rates, we demonstrate how stage-structured dynamics can influence outcomes in variable environments. Stage-specific parameters, such as juvenile growth and ingestion rates can drive shifts in equilibria, limit cycles, and bifurcation points. These effects are especially significant in high-light environments where nutrient limitations are most pronounced.

Abstract:
In this paper we study the dynamics of stochastic microorganism flocculation models. Given the strong influence of environmental and seasonal fluctuations that are present in these models, we propose a stochastic model that includes multiple layers of stochasticity, from small Brownian fluctuations, to possibly large changes due to environmental `shifts'. We are able to give a full classification of the asymptotic behavior of these models. New techniques had to be developed to prove the persistence and extinction of the process as the system is not in Kolmogorov form and, as a result, the analysis is significantly more involved.

Abstract:
This paper considers large-scale vaccination campaigns, a major platform for vaccine access in a lot of the world, as a recapture estimate of the target population marked by routine immunization. Framing the campaign as a measurement, we learn about its properties, including the campaign's coverage of the target population and some implied sampling properties of post-campaign coverage surveys (PCCSs), the current gold-standard in implementation quality measurement.   We develop this idea in the context of the 2023 measles campaign in Kano State, Nigeria, where we have detailed implementation data collected by vaccination teams involved in that effort. Looking specifically at the teams' tally sheets, the daily records of who they vaccinated, we find significant discrepancies between the recapture estimates and those from the corresponding PCCS. Exploring a variety of bias models applied to both the tally sheets and the PCCS helps clarify how anecdotal issues from the field relate to this discrepancy.   Overall, we find that the tally sheets, despite being an unorthodox population sample, provide a tractable perspective on implementation and measurement, one that's in principle available nearly instantly and at high resolution for any vaccination touchpoint.

Abstract:
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a mounting global health crisis, requiring rapid and reliable prediction frameworks that capture its complex evolutionary dynamics. Traditional antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST), while accurate, remains laborious and time-consuming, limiting its clinical scalability. Existing computational approaches, primarily reliant on single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based analysis, fail to account for evolutionary drivers such as horizontal gene transfer (HGT) and genome-level interactions.   This study introduces a novel Evolutionary Mixture of Experts (Evo-MoE) framework that integrates genomic sequence analysis, machine learning, and evolutionary algorithms to model and predict AMR evolution. A Mixture of Experts model, trained on labeled genomic data for multiple antibiotics, serves as the predictive core, estimating the likelihood of resistance for each genome. This model is embedded as a fitness function within a Genetic Algorithm designed to simulate AMR development across generations. Each genome, encoded as an individual in the population, undergoes mutation, crossover, and selection guided by predicted resistance probabilities.   The resulting evolutionary trajectories reveal dynamic pathways of resistance acquisition, offering mechanistic insights into genomic evolution under selective antibiotic pressure. Sensitivity analysis of mutation rates and selection pressures demonstrates the model's robustness and biological plausibility. Validation against curated AMR databases and literature evidence further substantiates the framework's predictive fidelity.   This integrative approach bridges genomic prediction and evolutionary simulation, offering a powerful tool for understanding and anticipating AMR dynamics, and potentially guiding rational antibiotic design and policy interventions.

Abstract:
A correlation between karyotype diversity and species richness was first observed in mammals in 1980, and subsequently confirmed after controlling for phylogenetic signal. The correlation was attributed to submicroscopic factors, presumably operating at the level of the genome. At the same time, an unexpected association between mutation rates and substitution rates has been observed in all eukaryotes so far examined. One hypothesis to explain the latter observation proposed that neutral mutation (dS) and non-neutral (dN) substitution rates in gene codons co-vary according to genomic position, or location in the genome. Later, it was found that mutation and substitution rates in eukaryotes increase with DNA replication timing during the Synthetic phase, or S phase, of the cell cycle. In 1991, Motoo Kimura proposed a molecular theory of non-adaptive radiation (NAR). Accordingly, genetic drift plays a significant role in speciation, albeit in parallel to and in conjunction with natural selection. The following will examine the contribution of DNA replication timing and DNA repair factors to the relationship between species richness and karyotype diversity, and by extension, to the large variation in species richness across the mammalian Tree of Life.

Abstract:
We study here the social network generated by the asynchronous visits, to a fixed set of sites, of mobile agents modelled as independent random walks on the plane lattice. The social network is constructed by assuming that a group of agents are associated if they have visited the same set of sites within a finite time interval. This construction is an instance of a random intersection graph, and has been used in the literature to study association networks in a number of animal species. We characterize the mathematical structure of these networks, which we view as one-mode projections of suitable bipartite graphs or, equivalently, as 2-sections of the corresponding hypergraphs. We determine analytically the probability distribution of the random bipartite graphs and hypergraphs associated to this construction, and suggest that association networks generated by the use of common resources are better described by hypergraphs rather than simple projected graphs, that miss important information regarding the actual associations among the agents.

Abstract:
Theoretical ecologists have long leveraged empirical data in various forms to advance ecology. Recently increased volumes and access to ecological data present an expanding set of opportunities for theoreticians to inform model development, framing, and interpretation. Whereas statisticians have collective guidance on best practices for data use, theoreticians might lack formal education on how to integrate diverse types of data into a single ecological model. As a group of predominantly early-career theoretical ecologists, we have developed guiding principles and practical tips to support theoretical ecologists in synthesizing multiple types of data at different phases of the modeling process. Our rules fall into three overarching themes: iteration in the data-model integration process, leveraging multiple sources of data), and understanding uncertainty. Across these rules, we emphasize that the data-model integration requires transparent, justifiable, and defensible communication of modeling choices to support readers in appropriately contextualizing the model and its implications.

Abstract:
Stochastic chemical reaction or population dynamics in finite systems often terminates in an absorbing state. Yet in large spatially extended systems, the time to reach species extinction (or fixation) becomes exceedingly long. Tuning control parameters may diminish the survival probability, rendering species coexistence susceptible to stochastic extinction events. In inhomogeneous settings, where a vulnerable subsystem is diffusively coupled to an adjacent stable patch, the former is reanimated through continuous influx from the interfaces, provided the absorbing region sustains spreading activity fronts. We demonstrate this generic elimination of finite-size extinction instabilities via immigration flux in predator-prey, epidemic spreading, and cyclic competition models.

Abstract:
In this work we study an age-structured chemostat model with a renewal boundary condition and a coupled substrate equation. The model is nonlinear and consists of a hyperbolic partial differential equation and an ordinary differential equation with nonlinear, nonlocal terms appearing both in the ordinary differential equation and the boundary condition. Both differential equations contain a non-negative control input, while the states of the model are required to be positive. Under an appropriate weak solution framework, we determine the state space and the input space for this model. We prove global existence and uniqueness of solutions for all admissible initial conditions and all allowable control inputs. To this purpose we employ a combination of Banach's fixed-point theorem with implicit solution formulas and useful solution estimates. Finally, we show that the age-structured chemostat model gives a well-defined control system on a metric space.

Abstract:
Given an evolutionary model, such as Wright--Fisher (WF) or Moran, the n-coalescent problem consists of going backward in time to find for example the time to the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) and the topology of the tree. In the literature, this problem is tackled mostly by computing directly the random variable t, time to reach the MRCA. I show here that by shifting the focus from the random variable t to the joined variable (n,t), where n is the number of ancestors at time t, the problem is greatly simplified. Indeed, P(n,t), the probability of this variable, obeys a simpler master equation that can be solved in a straightforward way for the most general model. This probability can then be used to compute relevant information of the n-coalescent, for both random variables $t_{n}$ (random time to reach a given state n) and $n_{t}$ (random number of ancestors at a given time t). The cumulative distribution function for $t_{1}$ for example is $P(1,t)$. I give in this article the general solution for continuous time models such as Moran and discrete time ones such as WF.

Abstract:
We study an infection-age structured epidemic model in which both the infectivity and the rate of loss of immunity depend on the time-since-infection. The model can be equivalently viewed as a nonlinear renewal equation for the incidence of infection or as a partial differential equation for the density of infected individuals. We explicitly consider gamma, rather than Erlang, distributed durations of infection using a combination of ODE approximations and numerical bifurcation methods. We show that the shape of this distribution strongly influences stability of the endemic equilibrium, even when the basic reproduction number $R_0$ and the mean duration of infectiousness are fixed. Moreover, we establish the existence of regions of bistability, where a stable endemic equilibrium coexists with a stable periodic orbit. To our knowledge, this provides the first example of bistability in infection-age structured models with waning immunity alone. Finally, we show how common compartmental modelling approaches, which impose implicit assumptions on the distribution of the duration of infection, can lead to spurious dynamical outcomes. Taken together, our analysis underscores the crucial role of distributional structure in epidemic modelling and provides new insights into the rich dynamics of infection-age structured SIS/SIRS models.

Abstract:
For many taxonomic groups, online biodiversity portals used by naturalists and citizen scientists constitute the primary source of distributional information. Over the last decade, site-occupancy models have been advanced as a promising framework to analyse such loosely structured, opportunistically collected datasets. Current approaches often ignore important aspects of the detection process and do not fully capitalise on the information present in these datasets, leaving opportunities for fine-grained spatiotemporal backcasting untouched. We propose a flexible Bayesian spatiotemporal site-occupancy model that aims to mimic the data-generating process that underlies common citizen science datasets sourced from public biodiversity portals, and yields rich biological output. We illustrate the use of the model to a dataset containing over 3M butterfly records in Belgium, collected through the citizen science data portal Observations.be. We show that the proposed approach enables retrospective predictions on the occupancy of species through time and space at high resolution, as well as inference on inter-annual distributional trends, range dynamics, habitat preferences, phenological patterns, detection patterns and observer heterogeneity. The proposed model can be used to increase the value of opportunistically collected data by naturalists and citizen scientists, and can aid the understanding of spatiotemporal dynamics of species for which rigorously collected data are absent or too costly to collect.

Abstract:
Species-rich ecosystems often exhibit multiple stable states with distinct species compositions. Yet, the factors determining the likelihood of each state's occurrence remain poorly understood. Here, we characterize and explain the landscape of stable states in the random Generalized Lotka-Volterra (GLV) model, in which multistability is widespread. We find that the same pool of species with random initial abundances can result in different stable states, whose likelihoods typically differ by orders of magnitude. A state's likelihood increases sharply with its total biomass, or inverse self-inhibition. We develop a simplified model to predict and explain this behavior, by coarse-graining ecological interactions so that each stable state behaves as a unit. In this setting, we can accurately predict the entire landscape of stable states using only two macroscopic properties: the biomass of each state and species diversity. Our theory also provides insight into the biomass-likelihood relationship: High-biomass states have low self-inhibition and thus grow faster, outcompete others, and become much more likely. These results reveal emergent self-inhibition as a fundamental organizing principle for the attractor landscape of complex ecosystems - and provide a path to predict ecosystem outcomes without knowing microscopic interactions.

Abstract:
A novel mathematical framework is proposed to describe the ecological and evolutionary consequences of consumer--resource interactions. Both the consumer and resource are assumed to consist of several (sub)species, which interact between themselves in addition to incorporating the deleterious effects of the consumer on the resource. Separating the ecological and evolutionary time scales, we allow our mathematical model to evolve, with the evolutionary steps chosen according to the (divergent) objective functions of the consumer and the resource. Numerical simulations show that the model, along with the expected outcomes of either consumer or resource winning the evolutionary battle, is capable of producing also the (quasi)stationary state of consumer--resource coexistence with monotone growth of both the consumer and resource fitnesses. Such stable states highlight the importance of the intra-population interactions, which, despite the opposite evolutionary goals of the consumer and the resource, lead to long term ecological stability.

Abstract:
Growth is a multi-layered phenomenon in human societies, composed of socioeconomic and demographic change at many different scales. Yet, standard macroeconomic indicators average over most of these processes, blurring the spatial and hierarchical heterogeneity driving people's choices and experiences. To address this gap, we introduce here a framework based on the Price equation to decompose aggregate growth exactly into endogenous and selection effects across nested spatial scales. We illustrate this approach with population and income data from the Chicago metropolitan area (2014-2019) and show that both growth rates and spatial selection effects are most intense at local levels, fat-tailed and spatially correlated. We also find that selection, defined as the covariance between prevailing income and relative population change, is concentrated in few spatial units and exhibits scaling behavior when grouped by county. Despite the intensity of local sorting, selection effects largely cancel in the aggregate, implying that fast heterogeneous micro-dynamics can yield deceptively stable macro-trends. By treating local spatial units (neighborhoods) as evolving subpopulations under selection, we demonstrate how methods from complex systems provide new tools to classify residential selection processes, such as abandonment and gentrification, in an urban sociological framework. This approach is general and applies to any other nested economic systems such as networks of production, occupations, or innovation enabling a new mechanistic understanding of compositional change and growth across scales of organization.

Abstract:
Waning immunity and reinfection are critical features of many infectious diseases, but epidemiological models often fail to capture the intricate interaction between an individual's history of immunity and their current infection status; when they do, the approach is usually overly simplistic. We develop a novel dual-age structured model that simultaneously tracks immunity age (time since the last recovery from infection) and infection age (time since infection) to analyze epidemic dynamics under conditions of waning immunity and reinfection. The model is formulated as a system of age-structured partial differential equations that describe susceptible and infected populations stratified by both immunity and infection ages. We derive basic reproduction numbers associated with the model and numerically solve the system using a second-order Runge-Kutta scheme along the characteristic lines. We further extend the model to explore vaccination interventions, specifically targeting individuals according to their immunity age. Numerical results reveal that higher contact rates produce larger amplitude oscillations with longer interepidemic periods. The relationship between initial infection levels and long-term epidemic behavior is nonmonotonic. Vaccination efficiency depends critically on the viral load profile across immunity and infection age, with more pronounced viral load distributions requiring higher vaccination rates for disease elimination. Most efficient vaccination strategies begin with intermediate immunity ages rather than targeting only fully susceptible individuals. The structured dual-age framework provides a flexible approach to analyzing the dynamics of reinfection and evaluating targeted vaccination strategies based on the history of immunity.

Abstract:
RNA-based vaccination has been broadly applied in the COVID pandemic. A characteristic of the immunization was fast waning immunity. However, the time scale of this process varied considerable for virus subtypes and among individuals. Understanding the origin of this variability is crucial in order to improve future vaccination strategies. Here, we introduce a mathematical model of RNA-based vaccination and the kinetics of the induced immune response. In the model, antigens produced following vaccination rise an immune response leading to germinal center reactions and accordingly B-cell differentiation into memory B-cells and plasma cells. In a negative feedback loop, the antibodies synthesized by newly specified plasma cells shut down the germinal center reaction as well as antigen-induced differentiation of memory B-cell into plasma cells. This limits the build-up of long-lasting immunity and thus is accompanied by fast waning immunity. The detailed data available on infection with and vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 enabled computational simulation of essential processes of the immune response. By simulation, we analyzed to which extent a single or double dose vaccination provides protection against infection. We find that variability of the immune response in individuals, originating e.g. in different immune cell densities, results in a broad log-normal-like distribution of the vaccine-induced protection times that peaks around 100 days. Protection times decrease for virus variants with mutated antibody binding sites or increased replication rates. Independent of these virus specifics, our simulations suggest optimal timing of a second dose about 5 weeks after the first in agreement with clinical trials.

Abstract:
One of the greatest challenges of terrestrial locomotion is resisting gravity. The morphological adaptive features of the limb long-bones of extant elephants, the heaviest living terrestrial animals, have previously been highlighted; however, their bone microanatomy remains largely unexplored. Here we investigate the microanatomy of the six limb long-bones in Elephas maximus and Loxodonta africana, using comparisons of virtual slices as well as robustness analyses, to understand how they were adapted to heavy weight-bearing. We find that the long bones of elephant limbs display a relatively thick cortex and a medullary area almost entirely filled with trabecular bone. This trabecular bone is highly anisotropic with trabecular orientations reflecting the mechanical load distribution along the limb. The respective functional roles of the bones are reflected in their microanatomy through variations of cortical thickness distribution and main orientation of the trabeculae. We find microanatomical adaptations to heavy weight support that are common to other heavy mammals. Despite these shared characteristics, the long bones of elephants are closer to those of sauropods due to their shared columnar posture, which allows a relaxation of morphofunctional constraints, and thus relatively less robust bones with a thinner cortex than would be expected in such massive animals.

Abstract:
Basic and instantaneous reproduction numbers, "R" _"0" and "R" _"t" , are important metrics to assess progress of an epidemic and effectiveness of preventative interventions undertaken, and also to estimate coverage needed for vaccination. Reproduction numbers are related to the daily number of positive cases recorded by the national public health authorities, via the renewal equation. During periods of exponential growth or decay they are linked also to the rate constants by the Lotka-Euler equation. For either application, we need the distribution of generation times between primary and secondary infections. In practice, we use instead the directly observable serial interval between symptoms onset of infector and infectee. Pre-symptomatic transmission that occurs in COVID infection causes serial intervals to extend to negative values, which can be described with a Gaussian distribution. Consistent application of the two approaches requires careful attention to lower limits imposed on the distribution. Allowing Gaussian-distributed serial intervals to extend to minus infinity with the Lotka-Euler equation, as commonly is done, results in lower reproduction numbers than predicted from the discretized renewal equation. Here, we formulate the Lotka-Euler equation for Gaussian distributions including an explicit lower cut-off, and use this to explore the consequences of presymptomatic transmission for COVID-19 infections.

Abstract:
Evolution occurs in populations of reproducing individuals. In stochastic descriptions of evolutionary dynamics, such as the Moran process, individuals are chosen randomly for birth and for death. If the same type is chosen for both steps, then the reproductive event is wasted, because the composition of the population remains unchanged. Here we introduce a new phenotype, which we call a \textit{replacer}. Replacers are efficient competitors. When a replacer is chosen for reproduction, the offspring will always replace an individual of another type (if available). We determine the selective advantage of replacers in well-mixed populations and on one-dimensional lattices. We find that being a replacer substantially boosts the fixation probability of neutral and deleterious mutants. In particular, fixation probability of a single neutral replacer who invades a well-mixed population of size $N$ is of the order of $1/\sqrt N$ rather than the standard $1/N$. Even more importantly, replacers are much better protected against invasions once they have reached fixation. Therefore, replacers dominate the mutation selection equilibrium even if the phenotype of being a replacer comes at a substantial cost: curiously, for large population size and small mutation rate the relative fitness of a successful replacer can be as low as $1/e$.

Abstract:
Multispecies ecosystems modelled by generalized Lotka-Volterra equations exhibit stationary population abundances, where large number of species often coexist. Understanding the precise conditions under which this is at all feasible and what triggers species extinctions is a key, outstanding problem in theoretical ecology. Using standard methods of random matrix theory, I show that distributions of species abundances are Gaussian at equilibrium, in the weakly interacting regime. One consequence is that feasibility is generically broken before stability, for large enough number of species. I further derive an analytic expression for the probability that $n=0,1,2,...$ species go extinct and conjecture that a single-parameter scaling law governs species extinctions. These results are corroborated by numerical simulations in a wide range of system parameters.

Abstract:
Dengue continues to pose a major global threat, infecting nearly 390 million people annually. Recognizing the pivotal role of vector competence (vc), recent research focuses on mosquito parameters to inform transmission modeling and vector control strategies.This study models interactions between Aedes vectors and dengue pathogens, highlighting vc as a key driver of within vector infection dynamics and endemic persistence. Using a predator prey framework, we show that endemic conditions emerge naturally from the biological interplay between the vectors strategies to pathogen pressure and we prove global stability of such conditions. Our results reveal that under tropical and subtropical environmental pressures, the innate immune system of vectors cannot offset high vc during endemic outbreaks, highlighting a fundamental biological trade off, vectors can evolve increased transmission potential but cannot enhance immune capacity. This constraint defines the limits of their evolutionary response to pathogen driven selection and drives instability in disease transmission dynamics.

Abstract:
Habitat fragmentation, often driven by human activities, alters ecological landscapes by disrupting connectivity and reshaping species interactions. In such fragmented environments, habitats can be modeled as networks, where individuals disperse across interconnected patches. We consider an intraspecific competition model, where individuals compete for space while dispersing according to a nonlinear random walk, capturing the heterogeneity of the network. The interplay between asymmetric competition, dispersal dynamics, and spatial heterogeneity leads to nonuniform species distribution: individuals with stronger competitive traits accumulate in central (hub) habitat patches, while those with weaker traits are displaced toward the periphery. We provide analytical insights into this mechanism, supported by numerical simulations, demonstrating how competition and spatial structure jointly influence species segregation. In the large-network limit, this effect becomes extreme, with dominant individuals disappearing from peripheral patches and subordinate ones from central regions, establishing spatial segregation. This pattern may create favorable conditions for speciation, as physical separation can reinforce divergence within the population over time.

Abstract:
Social contact patterns are a key input to many infectious disease models. Contact surveys, where participants are asked to provide information on their recent close and casual contacts with others, are one of the standard methods to measure contact patterns in a population. Surveys that require detailed sociodemographic descriptions of contacts allow for the specification of fine-grained contact rates between subpopulations in models. However, perception biases affecting a surveyed person's ability to estimate sociodemographic attributes (e.g., age, race, socioeconomic status) of others could affect contact rates derived from survey data. Here, we simulate contact surveys using a synthetic contact network of New Mexico to investigate the impact of these biases on survey accuracy and infectious disease model projections. We found that perception biases affecting the estimation of another individual's age and race substantially decreased the accuracy of the derived contact patterns. Using these biased patterns in a Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered compartmental model lead to an underestimation of cumulative incidence among older people (65+ years) and individuals identifying as races other than White. Our study shows that perception biases can impact contact patterns estimated from surveys in ways that systematically underestimate disease burden in minority populations when used in transmission models.

Abstract:
A canonical step in quantifying a system is to measure its entropy. Shannon entropy and other traditional entropy measures capture only the information encoded in the frequencies of a system's elements. Recently, Leinster, Cobbold, and Reeve (LCR) introduced a method that also captures the rich information encoded in the similarities and differences among elements, yielding similarity-sensitive entropy. More recently, the Vendi score (VS) was introduced as an alternative, raising the question of how LCR and VS compare, and which is preferable. Here we address these questions conceptually, analytically, and experimentally, using 53 machine-learning datasets. We show that LCR and VS can differ by orders of magnitude and can capture complementary information about a system, except in limiting cases. We demonstrate that both LCR and VS depend on how similarities are scaled and introduce the concept of ``half distance'' to parameterize this dependence. We prove that VS provides an upper bound on LCR for several values of the Rényi-Hill order parameter and conjecture that this bound holds for all values. We conclude that VS is preferable only when interpreting elements as linear combinations of a more fundamental set of ``ur-elements'' or when the system or dataset possesses a quantum-mechanical character. In the broader circumstance where one seeks simply to capture the rich information encoded by similarity, LCR is favored; nevertheless, for certain half-distances the two methods can complement each other.

Abstract:
Estimating species and gene trees from sequence data is challenging. Gene tree estimation is often hampered by low phylogenetic signal in alignments, leading to inaccurate trees. Species tree estimation is complicated by incomplete lineage sorting (ILS), where gene histories differ from the species' history. Summary methods like MP-EST, ASTRAL2, and ASTRID infer species trees from gene trees but suffer when gene tree accuracy is low. To address this, the Statistical Binning (SB) and Weighted Statistical Binning (WSB) pipelines were developed to improve gene tree estimation. However, previous studies only tested these pipelines using multi-locus bootstrapping (MLBS), not the BestML approach.   This thesis proposes a novel pipeline, WSB+WQMC, which shares design features with the existing WSB+CAML pipeline but has other desirable properties and is statistically consistent under the GTR+MSC model. This study evaluated WSB+WQMC against WSB+CAML using BestML analysis on various simulated datasets. The results confirmed many trends seen in prior MLBS analyses. WSB+WQMC substantially improved gene tree and species tree accuracy (using ASTRAL2 and ASTRID) on most datasets with low, medium, and moderately high ILS levels. In a direct comparison, WSB+WQMC computed less accurate trees than WSB+CAML under certain low and medium ILS conditions. However, WSB+WQMC performed better or at least as accurately as WSB+CAML on all datasets with moderately high and high ILS. It also proved better for estimating gene trees on some medium and low ILS datasets. Thus, WSB+WQMC is a promising alternative to WSB+CAML for phylogenetic estimation, especially in the presence of low phylogenetic signal.

Abstract:
Bacteria develop resistance to antibiotics through various mechanisms, with the specific mechanism depending on the drug-bacteria pair. It remains unclear, however, which resistance mechanism best supports favorable treatment outcomes, specifically in clearing infections and inhibiting further resistance. In this study, we use periodic ordinary differential equation models to simulate different antibiotic treatment protocols for bacterial infections. Using stability analysis and numerical simulations, we investigate how different resistance mechanisms, including plasmid-induced and mutation-induced resistance, affect treatment outcomes. Our findings suggest that antibiotic treatments with fixed dosing schedules are more likely to be effective when resistance arises exclusively through plasmid-mediated transmission. Further, when treatment fails, mutation-driven mechanisms tend to favor the selection of fully resistant bacterial strains. We also investigated the efficacy of different treatment strategies based on these mechanisms, finding that a twice-daily regimen consistently outperforms a once-daily regimen in terms of infection clearance. Additionally, our simulations with short half-life antibiotics indicate that the "catch-up" strategy outperforms the "compensatory double-dose" approach after a missed dose, a finding that aligns with general pharmaceutical advice for short-half-life drugs.

Abstract:
Living systems can be understood as organized entities that capture, transform, and reproduce information. Classical gene-centered models explain adaptation through frequency changes driven by differential fitness, yet they often neglect the higher-order organization and causal closure that characterize living systems. Here we review evolutionary frameworks, from the replicator equation to group selection and holobiont dynamics, and show that evolutionary change in population frequencies can be expressed as a Jeffreys divergence. In holobionts, this formalism allows partitioning the total information associated with selection acting on the genome and the microbiome, as well as the information involved in matching specific genotypes with particular microbiotas, yielding an informational signature of stable symbiotic coevolution. Building on this foundation, we propose a categorical model of Information Handlers (IH), entities capable of self-maintenance, mutation, and combination. Each lineage is represented as a discrete coalgebra with internal (M,R) closure, while the global system forms a supercategory of interacting lineages. Replication, reproduction, and transmission are modeled as morphisms whose informational changes are captured by a functor mapping biological transformations into transformations within an informational category, measurable through Jeffreys divergences. This framework connects gene-centered evolutionary dynamics with relational and organizational perspectives, offering a unified categorical view of living systems.

Abstract:
Island endemism is shaped by complex interactions among environmental, ecological, and evolutionary factors, yet the relative contributions of topography, climate, and land cover remain incompletely quantified. We investigated the drivers of endemic plant richness across Crete, a Mediterranean biodiversity hotspot, using spatially explicit data on species distributions, topographic complexity, climatic variability, land cover, and soil characteristics. Artificial Neural Network models, a machine learning tool, were employed to assess the relative importance of these predictors and to identify hotspots of endemism. We found that total species richness, elevation range, and climatic variability were the strongest predictors of endemic richness, reflecting the role of biodiversity, topographic heterogeneity, and climatic gradients in generating diverse habitats and micro-refugia that promote speciation and buffer extinction risk. Endemic hotspots only partially overlapped with areas of high total species richness, indicating that total species richness was the optimal from the ones examined, yet an imperfect surrogate. These environmentally heterogeneous areas also provide critical ecosystem services, including soil stabilization, pollination, and cultural value, which are increasingly threatened by tourism, renewable energy development, land-use change, and climate impacts. Our findings underscore the importance of prioritizing mountainous and climatically variable regions in conservation planning, integrating ecosystem service considerations, and accounting for within-island spatial heterogeneity. By explicitly linking the environmental drivers of endemism to both biodiversity patterns and ecosystem function, this study provides a framework for evidence-based conservation planning in Crete and other Mediterranean islands with similar geological and biogeographic contexts.

Abstract:
In evolutionary models of large populations, it is common to analyze the effects of cyclic or random variation in the parameters that describe selection. It is less common, however, to study how stochasticity in the genetic transmission process itself affects evolutionary outcomes. Suppose that a gene locus has alleles $A$ and $a$ under constant selection. This locus is linked to a modifier locus with alleles $M_1$ and $M_2$, which control the mutation rate from $A$ to $a$. The Reduction Principle states that, near a mutation--selection balance where $M_1$ is fixed with mutation rate $u_1$, a rare allele $M_2$ can invade if its associated rate $u_2$ is lower than $u_1$. This result, valid for both haploids and diploids, assumes constant mutation rates through time. We extend this framework by allowing the mutation rate associated with $M_2$ to fluctuate randomly across generations, denoted as $u_{2,t}$. In this stochastic setting, the condition for invasion by a new modifier allele depends not only on the resident mutation rate $u_1$ and the mean mutation rate $u_2$ associated with the invading allele, but also on the temporal distribution of $u_{2,t}$, the strength of selection at the $A/a$ locus, and the recombination rate between $M_1/M_2$ and $A/a$. The analysis shows how stochasticity and recombination in transmission do not simply modify the magnitude of evolutionary change predicted under deterministic assumptions. Instead, through their interaction with selection and linkage, they can generate conditions under which the direction of modifier evolution is qualitatively reversed relative to the deterministic Reduction Principle.

Abstract:
Growing literatures on epidemic and rumor dynamics show that infection and information coevolve. We present a unified framework for modeling the spread of infection and information: a general class of interaction-driven fluid-limit models expressed as coupled ODEs. The class includes the SIR epidemic model, the Daley-Kendall rumor model, and many extensions. For this general class, we derive theoretical results: under explicit graph-theoretic conditions, we obtain a classification of asymptotic behavior and motivate a conjecture of exponential decay for vanishing states. When these conditions are violated, the classification can fail, and decay may become non-exponential (e.g., algebraic). In deriving the main result, we establish asymptotic stability and $L^1$-integrability properties for state variables. Alongside these results, we introduce the dependency graph that captures outflow dependencies and offers a new angle on the structure of this model class. Finally, we illustrate the results with several examples, including a heterogeneous rumor model and a rumor-dependent SIR model, showing how small changes to the dependency graph can flip asymptotic behavior and reshape epidemic trajectories.

Abstract:
In this paper, we present a stochastic SVEIS epidemic model perturbed by a Black-Karasinski process. Using a Lyapunov functional approach, we derive a sufficient condition, Rs0>1 for the existence of a stationary distribution, which indicates disease persistence. Additionally, we theoretically demonstrate that the disease will die out at an exponential rate if Re0<1 . Our results show that random fluctuations will facilitate disease outbreak.

Abstract:
Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are universal adaptors of the genetic code, yet their evolutionary dynamics across photosynthetic eukaryotes remain underexplored. Here, we present the largest comparative re-analysis integrating the PlantRNA database with published data to explore tRNA gene evolution. We find that tRNA gene repertoires have been deeply shaped by ecological transitions, genome architecture, and translational demands. Terrestrialization marks a major shift in tRNA evolution, characterized by the loss of selenoproteins and their dedicated selenocysteine tRNAs in land plants compared to algae. Patterns of intron prevalence, position, and structure diverged among lineages, with extensive intron loss occurring around the origin of land plants. Organellar genomes exhibit divergent trajectories: mitochondrial tRNA sets are highly labile due to recurrent gene losses, imports, and horizontal transfers, whereas plastid repertoires are comparatively stable with lineage-specific exceptions. In parallel, angiosperm nuclear tRNA genes exhibit reinforced cis-regulatory elements, consistent with increased and developmentally complex translational demands, and their copy number correlates tightly with codon usage and amino acid composition. Finally, conserved yet family-biased clustering of nuclear tRNA genes reveals contrasting organizational principles in plants versus metazoans. Together, these findings establish tRNA gene evolution as a major determinant of translational capacity and a key driver of photosynthetic diversification.

Abstract:
In this paper we use Species Distribution Models (SDMs) to forecast the future diversity and distribution of orchids in Great Britain and Ireland under scenarios of climate and land-use change. The study analyzes occurrence data for native orchid taxa in the BSBI database at a fine spatial resolution (1 km^2, monads) and incorporates multiple environmental variables including climate, land use, topography, and soil. These SDMs project significant losses in orchid species richness by 2050 and 2070, especially under severe climate and land-use scenarios, with declines expected across most species and regions, including Ireland where historical data previously indicated gains. The models reveal vulnerable species likely to face extinction by 2070, emphasizing the impact of both climate warming and habitat modifications. This approach differs from previous trend-based analyses by integrating future projections, high-resolution spatial data, and dynamic land-use scenarios, thereby providing higher-resolution estimates of orchid range contractions and diversity losses. While current observed orchid trends show some regional increases, particularly in Ireland, the SDM forecasts indicate substantial future risks. The study also discusses uncertainties due to niche truncation from geographic data limits and highlights the need for broader-scale modeling for more robust predictions. Overall, the paper anticipates conservation challenges for orchid biodiversity in response to ongoing environmental changes.

Abstract:
Infectious disease outbreaks have precipitated a profusion of mathematical models. We introduce a unifying concept of "epidemic momentum" -- prevalence weighted by the capacity to infect in the future -- and use it to reveal a common underlying geometry that corresponds to contours of a generic first integral. Exploiting this conserved quantity, we show that it is possible to (i) disentangle the basic reproduction number $R_0$ from the population proportion that was immune before a disease invasion or re-emergence and (ii) infer both from observed data. This separation enables us to revise the classical estimate of the epidemic final size, incorporating prior population immunity. To illustrate the utility of these insights, we present a novel reappraisal of the main wave of the 1918 influenza pandemic.

Abstract:
Zika fever, a mosquito-borne viral disease with potential severe neurological complications and birth defects, remains a significant public health concern. The epidemiological models often oversimplify the dynamics of Zika transmission by assuming immediate detection of all infected cases. This study provides an enhanced SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered) model to incorporate partial information by distinguishing between detected and undetected Zika infections (also known as "dark figures"). By distinguishing the compartments, the model captures the complexities of disease spread by accounting for uncertainties about transmission and the number of undetected infections. This model implements the Kalman filter technique to estimate the hidden states from the observed states. Numerical simulations were performed to understand the dynamics of Zika transmission and real-world data was utilized for parameterization and validation of the model. The study aims to provide information on the impact of undetected Zika infections on disease spread within the population, which will contribute to evidence-based decision making in public health policy and practice.

Abstract:
In recent years, numerous advances have been made in understanding how epidemic dynamics is affected by changes in individual behaviours. We propose an SIS-based compartmental model to tackle the simultaneous and coupled evolution of an outbreak and of the adoption by individuals of the isolation measure. The compliance with self-isolation is described with the help of the imitation dynamics framework. Individuals are incentivised to isolate based on the prevalence and the incidence rate of the outbreak, and are tempted to defy isolation recommendations depending on the duration of isolation and on the cost of putting social interactions on hold. We are able to derive analytical results on the equilibria of the model under the homogeneous mean-field approximation. Simulating the compartmental model on empirical networks, we also do a preliminary check of the impact of a network structure on our analytical predictions. We find that the dynamics collapses to surprisingly simple regimes where either the imitation dynamics no longer plays a role or the equilibrium prevalence depends on only two parameters of the model, namely the cost and the relative time spent in isolation. Whether individuals prioritise disease prevalence or incidence as an indicator of the state of the outbreak appears to play no role on the equilibria of the dynamics. However, it turns out that favouring incidence may help to flatten the curve in the transient phase of the dynamics. We also find a fair agreement between our analytical predictions and simulations run on an empirical multiplex network.

Abstract:
We analyse a series of bacterial growth models with in-built inter-individual variation in rates of cell division. We show that this variation leads to reduced population growth in favorable regimes and reduced population killing in detrimental environments. By treating environmental stress as a model parameter, we then show that the reduction in population growth aggravates with stress. We apply these models to data on growth rates for populations of green algae {\em Clamydomonas reinhardtii}. Specifically, we compare growth rates of two ancestral strains and respective mutation accumulation lines, measured along a stress gradient. The data had previously shown mutants growing consistently slower than ancestors, and this effect aggravating with stress. Here we show that this trend is expected if mutants are more variable than ancestors in individual rates of cell division, even if their means are higher. This can open new prospects for prediction of how populations respond to environmental changes.

Abstract:
Aquaculture is pivotal for global food security but faces significant challenges from infectious diseases, particularly those caused by Streptococcus species such as Streptococcus iniae and Streptococcus agalactiae. These pathogens induce severe systemic infections in various fish species, resulting in high morbidity and mortality rates. This review consolidates current knowledge on the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical manifestations of these infections in fish and provides a comprehensive analysis of multifaceted control and prebention strategies. Advancements in genetic engineering and selective breeding are highlighted, demonstrating significant potential in developing disease-resistant fish strains through technologies like CRISPR-Cas9 and genomic selection. We examine the impact of farming practices on disease prevalence, emphasizing the roles of stocking density, feeding regimes, and biosecurity measures. The integration of big data analytics and IoT technologies is shown to revolutionize disease monitoring and management, enabling real-time surveillance and predictive modeling for timely interventions. Progress in vaccine development, including subunit, DNA, and recombinant protein vaccines, highlights the importance of tailored immunoprophylactic strategies. Furthermore, this review emphasizes the One-Health approach and the essential collaboration among industry, academia, and government to address the interconnected health of humans, animals, and the environment. This holistic strategy, supported by advanced technologies and collaborative efforts, promises to enhance the sustainability and productivity of aquaculture systems. Future research directions advocate for continued innovation and interdisciplinary partnerships to overcome the persistent challenges of streptococcal infections in aquaculture.

Abstract:
Phylogenetic tree shapes capture fundamental signatures of evolution. We consider ``ranked'' tree shapes, which are equipped with a total order on the internal nodes compatible with the tree graph. Recent work has established an elegant bijection of ranked tree shapes and a class of integer matrices, called \textbf{F}-matrices, defined by simple inequalities. This formulation is for isochronous ranked tree shapes, where all leaves share the same sampling time, such as in the study of ancient human demography from present-day individuals. Another important style of phylogenetics concerns trees where the ``timing'' of events is by branch length rather than calendar time. This style of tree, called a rooted phylogram, is output by popular maximum-likelihood methods. These trees are broadly relevant, such as to study the affinity maturation of B cells in the immune system. Discretizing time in a rooted phylogram gives a fully heterochronous ranked tree shape, where leaves are part of the total order. Here we extend the \textbf{F}-matrix framework to such fully heterochronous ranked tree shapes. We establish an explicit bijection between a class of \textbf{F}-matrices and the space of such tree shapes. The matrix representation has the key feature that values at any entry are highly constrained via four previous entries, enabling straightforward enumeration of all valid tree shapes. We also use this framework to develop probabilistic models on ranked tree shapes. Our work extends understanding of combinatorial objects that have a rich history in the literature.

Abstract:
The classical Maximum-Entropy Principle (MEP) based on Shannon entropy is widely used to construct least-biased probability distributions from partial information. However, the Shore-Johnson axioms that single out the Shannon functional hinge on strong system independence, an assumption often violated in real-world, strongly correlated systems. We provide a self-contained guide to when and why practitioners should abandon the Shannon form in favour of the one-parameter Uffink-Jizba-Korbel (UJK) family of generalized entropies. After reviewing the Shore and Johnson axioms from an applied perspective, we recall the most commonly used entropy functionals and locate them within the UJK family. The need for generalized entropies is made clear with two applications, one rooted in economics and the other in ecology. A simple mathematical model worked out in detail shows the power of generalized maximum entropy approaches in dealing with cases where strong system independence does not hold. We conclude with practical guidelines for choosing an entropy measure and reporting results so that analyses remain transparent and reproducible.

Abstract:
We introduce a general diploid population model with self-fertilization and possible overlapping generations, and study the genealogy of a sample of $n$ genes as the population size $N$ tends to infinity. Unlike traditional approach in coalescent theory which considers the unconditional (annealed) law of the gene genealogies averaged over the population pedigree, here we study the conditional (quenched) law of gene genealogies given the pedigree. We focus on the case of high selfing probability and obtain that this conditional law converges to a random probability measure, given by the random law of a system of coalescing random walks on an exchangeable fragmentation-coalescence process of \cite{berestycki04}. This system contains the system of coalescing random walks on the ancestral recombination graph as a special case, and it sheds new light on the site-frequency spectrum (SFS) of genetic data by specifying how SFS depends on the pedigree. The convergence result is proved by means of a general characterization of weak convergence for random measures on the Skorokhod space with paths taking values in a locally compact Polish space.

Abstract:
Understanding the dynamics of the spread of diseases within populations is critical for effective public health interventions. We extend the classical SIR model by incorporating additional complexities such as the introduction of a cure and migration between cities. Our framework leverages a system of differential equations to simulate disease transmission across a network of interconnected cities, capturing more realistic patterns. We present theoretical results on the convergence of population sizes in the migration framework (in the absence of deaths). We also run numerical simulations to understand how the timing of the introduction of the cure affects mortality rates. Our numerical results explain how localized interventions affect the spread of the disease across cities. In summary, this work advances the modeling of epidemics to a more local scope, offering a more expressive tool for epidemiological research and public health planning.

Abstract:
Mapping habitat quality, based on factors like host availability and environmental suitability, is a common approach to determining which locations are important for the spread of a species. Mapping habitat connectivity takes geographic analyses a step further, evaluating the potential roles of locations in biological invasions, pandemics, or species conservation. Locations with high habitat quality may play a minor role in species spread if they are geographically isolated. Yet, a location with lower habitat quality may play a major role in a species' spread if it acts as a bridge between regions that would otherwise be physically fragmented.   Here we introduce the geohabnet R package, which evaluates the potential importance of locations for the spread of species through habitat landscapes. geohabnet incorporates key factors such as dispersal probabilities and habitat availability in a network framework, for better understanding habitat connectivity for host-dependent species, such as pathogens, arthropod pests, or pollinators.   geohabnet uses publicly available or user-provided datasets, six network centrality metrics, and a user-selected geographic scale. We provide examples using geohabnet for surveillance prioritization of emerging plant pests in Africa and the Americas. These examples illustrate how users can apply geohabnet for their species of interest and generate maps of the estimated importance of geographic locations for species spread.   geohabnet provides a quick, open-source, and reproducible baseline to quantify a species' habitat connectivity across a wide range of geographic scales and evaluates potential scenarios for the expansion of a species through habitat landscapes. geohabnet supports biosecurity programs, invasion science, and conservation biology when prioritizing management efforts for transboundary pathogens, pests, or endangered species.

Abstract:
Evolutionary systems must learn to generalize, often extrapolating from a limited set of selective conditions to anticipate future environmental changes. The mechanisms enabling such generalization remain poorly understood, despite their importance to predict ecological robustness, drug resistance, or design future-proof vaccination strategies. Here, we demonstrate that annealed population heterogeneity, wherein distinct individuals in the population experience different instances of a complex environment over time, can act as a form of implicit regularization and facilitate evolutionary generalization. Mathematically, annealed heterogeneity introduces a variance-weighted demographic noise term that penalizes across-environment fitness variance and effectively rescales the population size, thereby biasing evolution toward generalist solutions. This process is indeed analogous to a variant of the mini-batching strategy employed in stochastic gradient descent, where an effective multiplicative noise produces an inductive bias by triggering noise-induced transitions.   Through numerical simulations and theoretical analysis we discuss the conditions under which variation in how individuals experience environmental selection can naturally promote evolutionary strategies that generalize across environments and anticipate novel challenges.

Abstract:
We study the effect of intratumor heterogeneity in the likelihood of cancer cells moving from a primary tumor to other sites in the human body, generating a metastatic process. We model different scenarios of competition between tumor cells using a static evolutionary game in which cells compete for nutrients and oxygen and might choose to stay and proliferate in the primary tumor or opt to a motility strategy in order to find resources in a metastatic site. The theoretical results found in the evolutionarily equilibrium in the mathematical model are in line with the empirical results observed in oncology, namely, the coexistence of both primary and metastatic tumors and the conditions that favor a metastatic process. Particularly, the model finds mathematical support for what is empirically observed in punctuated and branching cancers for the specific case of clear cell renal cell carcinomas: motility of cells is larger in punctuated cancers if the proportion of BAP1 mutations remain below a given cell proportion threshold.

Abstract:
Collective systems that self-organise to maximise the group's ability to collect and distribute information can be successful in environments with high spatial and temporal variation. Such organisations are abundant in nature, as sharing information is a key benefit of many biological collective systems, and have been influential in the design of many artificial collectives such as swarm robotics. Understanding how these systems may be spatially distributed to optimise their collective potential is therefore of importance in both ecology and in collective systems design. Here, we develop a mathematical model which uses an optimisation framework to determine the higher-order spatial structure of a collective that optimises group-level knowledge transfer. The domain of the objective function is a set of weighted simplicial sets, which can fully represent the spatial structure from a topological perspective. By varying the parameters within the objective function and the constraints, we determine how the optimal spatial structure may vary when individuals differ in their information gathering ability and how this variation differs in the context of resource constraints. Our key findings are that the amount of resources in the environment can lead to specific subgroup sizes being optimal for the group as a whole when individuals are homogeneous in their information gathering abilities. Further, when there is variation in information gathering abilities, our model implies that the sharing of space between smaller subgroups of the population, rather than the whole population, is optimal for collective knowledge sharing. Our results have applications across diverse contexts from behavioural ecology to bio-inspired collective systems design.

Abstract:
Rabies continues to pose a significant zoonotic threat, particularly in areas with high populations of domestic dogs that serve as viral reservoirs. This study conducts a comparative analysis of Stochastic Continuous-Time Markov Chain (CTMC) and deterministic models to gain insights into rabies persistence within human and canine populations. By employing a multitype branching process, the stochastic threshold for rabies persistence was determined, revealing important insights into how stochasticity influences extinction probabilities. The stochastic model utilized 10,000 sample paths to estimate the probabilities of rabies outbreaks, offering a rigorous assessment of the variability in disease occurrences. Additionally, the study introduces a novel mathematical formulation of rabies transmission dynamics, which includes environmental reservoirs, free-ranging dogs, and domestic dogs as essential transmission factors. The basic reproduction number ($\mathcal{R}_0$) was derived and analyzed within stochastic frameworks, effectively bridging the gap between these two modeling approaches. Numerical simulations confirmed that the results from the stochastic model closely aligned with those from the deterministic model, while also highlighting the importance of stochasticity in scenarios with low infection rates. Ultimately, the study advocates for a comprehensive approach to rabies control that integrates both the predictable trends identified through deterministic models and the impact of random events emphasized by stochastic models.

Abstract:
The Swadesh approach for determining the temporal separation between two languages relies on the stochastic process of words replacement (when a complete new word emerges to represent a given concept). It is well known that the basic assumptions of the Swadesh approach are often unrealistic due to various contamination phenomena and misjudgments (horizontal transfers, variations over time and space of the replacement rate, incorrect assessments of cognacy relationships, presence of synonyms, and so on). All of this means that the results cannot be completely correct.   More importantly, even in the unrealistic case that all basic assumptions are satisfied, simple mathematics places limits on the accuracy of estimating the temporal separation between two languages. These limits, which are purely probabilistic in nature and which are often neglected in lexicostatistical studies, are analyzed in detail in this article.   Furthermore, in this work we highlight that the evolution of a language's lexicon is also driven by another stochastic process: gradual lexical modification of words. We show that this process equally also represents a major contribution to the reshaping of the vocabulary of languages over the centuries and we also show, from a purely probabilistic perspective, that taking into account this second random process significantly increases the precision in determining the temporal separation between two languages.

Abstract:
In this paper we investigate the asymptotic behavior of some SIR models incorporating demography, bounded random transmission coefficient and a time-dependent vaccination strategy targeting the susceptible population. In this setting, we establish the existence and uniqueness of non-negative global solution of the models and derive conditions under which either the disease is eradicated or becomes endemic. In addition, the theoretical results are further illustrated by several numerical simulations.

Abstract:
In this work, we prove the existence of a 2-cycle in an integrodifference equation with a Laplace kernel and logistic growth function, connecting two non-trivial fixed points of the second iterate of the logistic map in the non-chaotic regime. This model was first studied by Kot (1992), and the 2-cycle we establish corresponds to one numerically observed by Bourgeois, Leblanc, and Lutscher (2018) for the Ricker growth function. We provide strong evidence that the 2-cycle for the Ricker growth function can be rigorously proven using a similar approach. Finally, we present numerical results indicating that both 2-cycles exhibit spectral stability.

Abstract:
We consider populations evolving according to natural selection, mutation, and recombination, and assume that the genomes of all or a representative selection of individuals are known. We pose the problem if it is possible to infer fitness parameters and genotype fitness order from such data. We tested this hypothesis in simulated populations. We delineate parameter ranges where this is possible and other ranges where it is not.Our work provides a framework for determining when fitness inference is feasible from population-wide, whole-genome, time-stratified data and highlights settings where it is not. We give a brief survey of biological model organisms and human pathogens that fit into this framework.

Abstract:
Species distribution models (SDMs), which aim to predict species occurrence based on environmental variables, are widely used to monitor and respond to biodiversity change. Recent deep learning advances for SDMs have been shown to perform well on complex and heterogeneous datasets, but their effectiveness remains limited by spatial biases in the data. In this paper, we revisit deep SDMs from a Bayesian perspective and introduce BATIS, a novel and practical framework wherein prior predictions are updated iteratively using limited observational data. Models must appropriately capture both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty to effectively combine fine-grained local insights with broader ecological patterns. We benchmark an extensive set of uncertainty quantification approaches on a novel dataset including citizen science observations from the eBird platform. Our empirical study shows how Bayesian deep learning approaches can greatly improve the reliability of SDMs in data-scarce locations, which can contribute to ecological understanding and conservation efforts.

Abstract:
Human bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) include skeletal stem cells with ground-breaking therapeutic potential. However, BMSC colonies have very heterogeneous in vivo behaviour, due to their different potency; this unpredictability is the greatest hurdle to the development of skeletal regeneration therapies. Colony-level heterogeneity urges a fundamental question: how is it possible that one colony as a collective unit behaves differently from another one? If cell-to-cell variability were just an uncorrelated random process, a million cells in a transplant-bound colony would be enough to yield statistical homogeneity, hence washing out any colony-level traits. A possible answer is that the differences between two originating cells are transmitted to their progenies and collectively persist through an hereditary mechanism. But non-genetic inheritance remains an elusive notion, both at the experimental and at the theoretical level. Here, we prove that heterogeneity in the lineage topology of BMSC clonal colonies is determined by heritable traits that regulate cell-cycle exit. The cornerstone of this result is the definition of a novel entropy of the colony, which measures the hereditary ramifications in the distribution of inactive cells across different branches of the proliferation tree. We measure the entropy in 32 clonal colonies, obtained from single-cell lineage tracing experiments, and show that in the greatest majority of clones this entropy is decisively smaller than that of the corresponding non-hereditary lineage. This result indicates that hereditary epigenetic factors play a major role in determining cycle exit of bone marrow stromal cells.

Abstract:
Many Mendelian randomization (MR) papers have been conducted only in people of European ancestry, limiting transportability of results to the global population. Expanding MR to diverse ancestry groups is essential to ensure equitable biomedical insights, yet presents analytical and conceptual challenges. This review examines the practical challenges of MR analyses beyond the European only context, including use of data from multi-ancestry, mismatched ancestry, and admixed populations. We explain how apparent heterogeneity in MR estimates between populations can arise from differences in genetic variant frequencies and correlation patterns, as well as from differences in the distribution of phenotypic variables, complicating the detection of true differences in the causal pathway.   We summarize published strategies for selecting genetic instruments and performing analyses when working with limited ancestry-specific data, discussing the assumptions needed in each case for incorporating external data from different ancestry populations. We conclude that differences in MR estimates by ancestry group should be interpreted cautiously, with consideration of how the identified differences may arise due to social and cultural factors. Corroborating evidence of a biological mechanism altering the causal pathway is needed to support a conclusion of differing causal pathways between ancestry groups.

Abstract:
We design a linear chain trick algorithm for dynamical systems for which we have oscillatory time histories in the distributed time delay. We make use of this algorithmic framework to analyse memory effects in disease evolution in a population. The modelling is based on a susceptible-infected-recovered SIR - model and on a susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered SEIR - model through a kernel that dampens the activity based on the recent history of infectious individuals. This corresponds to adaptive behavior in the population or through governmental non-pharmaceutical interventions. We use the linear chain trick to show that such a model may be written in a Markovian way, and we analyze the stability of the system. We find that the adaptive behavior gives rise to either a stable equilibrium point or a stable limit cycle for a close to constant number of susceptibles, i.e.\ locally in time. We also show that the attack rate for this model is lower than it would be without the dampening, although the adaptive behavior disappears as time goes to infinity and the number of infected goes to zero.

Abstract:
We investigate the adaptive Ambush strategy in cyclic models following the rules of the spatial rock-paper-scissors game. In our model, individuals of one species possess cognitive abilities to perceive environmental cues and assess the local density of the species they dominate in the spatial competition for natural resources. Based on this assessment, they either initiate a direct attack or, if the local concentration of target individuals does not justify the risk, reposition strategically to prepare an ambush. To quantify the evolutionary consequences of these behavioural strategies, we perform stochastic simulations, analysing emergent spatial patterns and the dependence of species densities on the threshold used by individuals to decide between immediate attack or anticipation. Our findings reveal that, despite being designed to enhance efficiency, cognitive strategies can reduce the abundance of the species due to the constraints of cyclic dominance. We identify an optimal decision threshold: attacking only when the local density of target individuals exceeds 15% provides the best balance between selection risk and long-term persistence. Furthermore, the Ambush strategy benefits low-mobility organisms, increasing coexistence probabilities by up to 53%. These results deepen the understanding of adaptive decision-making in spatial ecology, linking cognitive complexity to ecosystem resilience and extinction risk.

Comment: Accepted in Physical Review E

Abstract:
In a mix of prejudiced and unprejudiced individuals engaged in strategic interactions, the individual intensity of prejudice is expected to have effect on overall level of societal prejudice. High level of prejudice should lead to discrimination that may manifest as unfairness and, perhaps, even spite. In this paper, we investigate this idea in the classical paradigm of the ultimatum game which we theoretically modify to introduce prejudice at the level of players, terming its intensity as prejudicity. The stochastic evolutionary game dynamics, in the regime of replication-selection, reveals the emergence of spiteful behaviour as a dominant behaviour via a first order phase transition -- a discontinuous jump in the frequency of spiteful individuals at a threshold value of prejudicity. The phase transition is quite robust and becomes progressively conspicuous in the limit of large population size where deterministic evolutionary game dynamics, viz., replicator dynamics, approximates the system closely. The emergence of spite driven by prejudice is also found to persist when one considers long-term evolutionary dynamics in the mutation-selection dominated regime.

Abstract:
Chikungunya virus is a mosquito-borne arbovirus with the potential to establish sustained transmission in subtropical regions like Florida, where climatic and ecological conditions support vector proliferation. In this study, we develop a Continuous Time Markov Chain model to assess the probability of long-term Chikungunya establishment in Miami-Dade County following repeated introductions of external infectious individuals. This work aims to identify seasonal windows of heightened endemic risk and evaluates the impact of vector control strategies on mitigating the likelihood of persistent transmission. These results generate insights into the dynamics of Chikungunya virus infections and inform targeted interventions to prevent its transition from minor sporadic outbreaks to endemic circulation.

Abstract:
The Paradox of Enrichment (PoE) predicts that increasing resources, such as nutrient inputs like fertilizers or food availability, should destabilize ecological systems, such as crop-pest dynamics, leading to population cycles that can increase the risk of crop failure during environmental shocks. Yet, since the Green Revolution, fertilizer use has surged without widespread evidence of yield instability, challenging the PoE's relevance to modern agriculture. Here, we propose and test a novel resolution: that insecticides, frequently co-applied with fertilizers, act as stabilizing agents that counterbalance enrichment-induced instability. Using a modified PoE model with empirically grounded parameters for three major crop-pest systems-soybean-aphid, wheat-aphid, and cabbage-diamondback moth-we find that fertilizer increases yields, but destabilizes dynamics, whereas insecticides restore stability and ensure more predictable harvests. These findings reveal that insecticides may suppress pests but also play a critical role in stabilizing crop yields in nutrient-enriched agroecosystems, with implications for ecosystem management, eutrophication, conservation biology, and pesticide policy.

Abstract:
The Generic Population Concept - Agent-Based Model, henceforth short, GEPOC ABM, is one of the models within GEPOC, a generic concept to model a country's population and its dynamics using causal modelling approaches. The model is well established and had already proven its worth in various use cases from evaluation of MMR vaccination rates to SARS-CoV-2 epidemics modelling. In this work we will reproducibly specify the base model, to be specific, version 2.2 of it, and several extensions. The base model GEPOC ABM depicts the population of a country with the features sex and age. It uses a co-simulation-inspired time-update, where person-level discrete-event simulators are synchronised by a simulation layer at macro-steps, making the approach amenable to parallelization. A core design choice is structuring person agents around the life-year rather than the calendar year; accordingly, each agent schedules demographic events annually on their birthday. To expand the model's capabilities beyond basic demographic features, GEPOC ABM Geography adds a residence feature in the form of geographical coordinates. Further extensions include GEPOC ABM IM, which adds internal migration processes in three variants, and GEPOC ABM CL, which models locations where agents may have contacts with each other. In this definition we solely specify the conceptual models and do not go into any details with respect to implementation or gathering/processing of parametrisation data.

Abstract:
Cumulants and moments are closely related to the basic mathematics of continuous and discrete selection (respectively). These relationships generalize Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural selection and also make clear some of its limitation. The relationship between cumulants and continuous selection is especially intuitive and also provides an alternative way to understand cumulants. We show that a similarly simple relationship exists between moments and discrete selection. In more complex scenarios, we show that thinking of selection over discrete generations has significant advantages. For a simple mutation model, we find exact solutions for the equilibrium moments of the fitness distribution. These solutions are surprisingly simple and have some interesting implications including: a necessary and sufficient condition for mutation selection balance, a very simple formula for mean fitness and the fact that the shape of the equilibrium fitness distribution is determined solely by mutation (whereas the scale is determined by the starting fitness distribution).

Abstract:
We propose an epidemic model for the spread of vector-borne diseases. The model, which is built extending the classical susceptible-infected-susceptible model, accounts for two populations -- humans and vectors -- and for cross-contagion between the two species, whereby humans become infected upon interaction with carrier vectors, and vectors become carriers after interaction with infected humans. We formulate the model as a system of ordinary differential equations and leverage monotone systems theory to rigorously characterize the epidemic dynamics. Specifically, we characterize the global asymptotic behavior of the disease, determining conditions for quick eradication of the disease (i.e., for which all trajectories converge to a disease-free equilibrium), or convergence to a (unique) endemic equilibrium. Then, we incorporate two control actions: namely, vector control and incentives to adopt protection measures. Using the derived mathematical tools, we assess the impact of these two control actions and determine the optimal control policy.

Abstract:
Viruses are microscopic infectious agents that require a host cell for replication. Viral replication occurs in several stages, and the completion time for each stage varies due to differences in the cellular environment. Thus, the time to complete each stage in viral replication is a random variable. However, no analytic expression exists for the viral population at the cellular level when the completion time for each process constituting viral replication is a random variable. This paper presents a simplified model of viral replication, treating each stage as a renewal process with independently and identically distributed completion times. Using the proposed model, we derive an analytical formula for viral populations at the cellular level, based on viewing viral replication as a birth-death process. The mean viral count is expressed via probability density functions representing the completion time for each step in the replication process. This work validates the results with stochastic simulations. This study provides a new quantitative framework for understanding viral infection dynamics.

Comment: 15 pages, 2 figures

Abstract:
We study the propagation speed of bistable traveling waves in the classical two-component diffusive Lotka-Volterra system under strong competition. From an ecological perspective, the sign of the propagation speed determines the long-term outcome of competition between two species and thus plays a central role in predicting the success or failure of invasion of an alien species into habitats occupied by a native species. Using comparison arguments, we establish sufficient conditions determining the sign of the propagation speed, which refine previously known results. In particular, we show that in the symmetric case, where the two species differ only in their diffusion rates, the faster diffuser prevails over a substantially broader parameter range than previously established. Moreover, we demonstrate that when the interspecific competition coefficients differ significantly, the outcome of competition cannot be reversed by adjusting diffusion or growth rates. These findings provide a rigorous theoretical framework for analyzing invasion dynamics, offering sharper mathematical criteria for invasion success or failure.

Abstract:
In this study, we provide a relatively simple simulation framework for constructing artificial life (ALife) with both autonomous and evolutionary aspects by extending chemoton model. While the original chemoton incorporates metabolism, membrane, and genetic templates, it lacks a mechanism for phenotypic variation, preventing true evolutionary dynamics. To address this, we introduced a genotype-phenotype coupling by linking templates to a second autocatalytic cycle, enabling mutations to affect phenotype and be subject to selection. Using a genetic algorithm, we simulated populations of chemotons over generations. Results showed that chemotons without access to the new cycle remained in a stable but complexity-limited regime, while lineages acquiring the additional metabolic set evolved longer templates. These findings demonstrate that even simple replicator systems can achieve primitive evolvability, highlighting structural thresholds and rare innovations as key drivers. Our framework provides a tractable model for exploring autonomy and evolution in ALife.

Abstract:
Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are neural networks that embed the laws of dynamical systems modeled by differential equations into their loss function as constraints. In this work, we present a PINN framework applied to oncology. Here, we seek to learn time-varying interactions due to a combination therapy in a tumor microenvironment. In oncology, experimental data are often sparse and composed of a few time points of tumor volume. By embedding inductive biases derived from prior information about a dynamical system, we extend the physics-informed neural networks (PINN) and incorporate observed biological constraints as regularization agents. The modified PINN algorithm is able to steer itself to a reasonable solution and can generalize well with only a few training examples. We demonstrate the merit of our approach by learning the dynamics of treatment applied intermittently in an ordinary differential equation (ODE) model of a combination therapy. The algorithm yields a solution to the ODE and time-varying forms of some of the ODE model parameters. We demonstrate a strong convergence using metrics such as the mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE).

Abstract:
Phylogenetic trees capture evolutionary relationships among species and reflect the forces that shaped them. While many studies rely on branch length information, the topology of phylogenetic trees (particularly their degree of imbalance) offers a robust framework for inferring evolutionary dynamics when timing data is uncertain. Classical metrics, such as the Colless and Sackin indices, quantify tree imbalance and have been extensively used to characterize phylogenies. Empirical phylogenies typically show intermediate imbalance, falling between perfectly balanced and highly skewed trees. This regime is marked by a power-law relationship between subtree sizes and their cumulative sizes, governed by a characteristic exponent. Although a recent niche-size model replicates this scaling, its mathematical origin and the exponent's value remain unclear. We present a generative model inspired by Kingman's coalescent that incorporates niche-like dynamics through preferential node coalescence. This process maps to Smoluchowski's coagulation kinetics and is described by a generalized Smoluchowski equation. Our model produces imbalanced trees with power-law exponents matching empirical and numerical observations, revealing the mathematical basis of observed scaling laws and offering new tools to interpret tree imbalance in evolutionary contexts.

Abstract:
Encounters between individuals underlie key ecological processes such as predation, mating, and disease transmission, making encounter rates a direct link between individual movement behavior and population-level outcomes. We investigate how two common features of animal movement--directional persistence and range residency--jointly shape encounter rates. Using the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck with foraging (OUF) model, which integrates these two properties of animal movement, we derive exact analytical expressions for encounter rates and show that, for range-resident animals, the effect of persistence depends strongly on the degree of home-range overlap. Based on this theoretical result, we then introduce a new encounter-based metric that quantifies the spatial organization of home ranges at scales relevant to animal encounters. We finally apply this metric to movement data from lowland tapirs ($\textit{Tapirus terrestris}$) in Brazil's Pantanal region and find a significant level of home-range spatial segregation, consistent with the solitary behavior of this species.

Phylogenetic inference, the task of reconstructing how related sequences evolved from common ancestors, is a central task in evolutionary genomics. The current state-of-the-art methods exploit probabilistic models of sequence evolution along phylogenetic trees, by searching for the tree maximizing the likelihood of observed sequences, or by estimating the posterior of the tree given the sequences in a Bayesian framework. Both approaches typically require to compute likelihoods, which is only feasible under simplifying assumptions such as independence of the evolution at the different positions of the sequence, and even then remains a costly operation. Here we present Phyloformer 2, the first likelihood-free inference method for posterior distributions over phylogenies. Phyloformer 2 exploits a novel encoding for pairs of sequences that makes it more scalable than previous approaches, and a parameterized probability distribution factorized over a succession of subtree merges. The resulting network provides accurate estimates of the posterior distribution, and outperforms both state-of-the-art maximum likelihood methods and a previous likelihood-free method for point estimation. It opens the way to fast and accurate phylogenetic inference under realistic models of sequence evolution.

Abstract:
Accurate epidemic forecasting requires models that account for the layered and heterogeneous nature of real social interactions. The basic reproduction number $\mathcal R_0$ calculated from models that assume homogeneous mixing or single-layer contact structures have limited applicability to complex social systems. Here, we propose an expression of $\mathcal R_0$ in the context of multiplex networks, enabling the analysis of disease transmission across multiple social layers.   We adapt the Degree-Based Mean-Field (DBMF) SIR model for single-layered complex networks to the multiplex setting, where each layer has its own degree distribution and infection rate. Using the Next Generation Matrix method, we derive an analytical expression for the basic reproduction number $\mathcal R_0$. Numerical integration of the multiplex DBMF equations shows that $\mathcal R_0 = 1$ marks the epidemic threshold and governs the functional dependence of key outbreak indicators. In addition to the exact result for the $\mathcal R_0$, we provide an approximation denoted as $τ$, which is easier to compute and more straightforward to interpret in terms of the parameters of the system, and shares most of the expected properties of the basic reproduction number.   Stochastic agent-based simulations confirm these results, demonstrating a direct correspondence between $τ$ and the average number of secondary infections in the early epidemic phase, in line with the interpretation of $\mathcal R_0$.   This research provides a robust generalization of $\mathcal R_0$ for layered contact structures, offering a more realistic basis for epidemic forecasting and the design of intervention strategies.

Abstract:
Reconstructing evolutionary histories and estimating the rate of evolution from molecular sequence data is of central importance in evolutionary biology and infectious disease research. We introduce a flexible Bayesian phylogenetic inference framework that accommodates changing evolutionary rates over time by modeling sequence character substitution processes as inhomogeneous continuous-time Markov chains (ICTMCs) acting along the unknown phylogeny, where the rate remains as an unknown, positive and integrable function of time. The integral of the rate function appears in the finite-time transition probabilities of the ICTMCs that must be efficiently computed for all branches of the phylogeny to evaluate the observed data likelihood. Circumventing computational challenges that arise from a fully nonparametric function, we successfully parameterize the rate function as piecewise constant with a large number of epochs that we call the polyepoch clock model. This makes the transition probability computation relatively inexpensive and continues to flexibly capture rate change over time. We employ a Gaussian Markov random field prior to achieve temporal smoothing of the estimated rate function. Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling enabled by scalable gradient evaluation under this model makes our framework computationally efficient. We assess the performance of the polyepoch clock model in recovering the true timescales and rates through simulations under two different evolutionary scenarios. We then apply the polyepoch clock model to examine the rates of West Nile virus, Dengue virus and influenza A/H3N2 evolution, and estimate the time-varying rate of SARS-CoV-2 spread in Europe in 2020.

Abstract:
The evolutionary mechanisms of cooperative behavior represent a fundamental topic in complex systems and evolutionary dynamics. Although recent advances have introduced real-world stochasticity in nonlinear public goods game (PGG), such stochasticity remains static, neglecting its origin in the external environment as well as the coevolution of system stochasticity and cooperative behavior driven by environmental dynamics. In this work, we introduce a dynamic environment feedback mechanism into the stochastic nonlinear PGG framework, establishing a coevolutionary model that couples environmental states and individual cooperative strategies. Our results demonstrate that the interplay among environment feedback, nonlinear effects, and stochasticity can drive the system toward a wide variety of steady-state structures, including full defection, full cooperation, stable coexistence, and periodic limit cycles. Further analysis reveals that asymmetric nonlinear parameters and environment feedback rates exert significant regulatory effects on cooperation levels and system dynamics. This study not only enriches the theoretical framework of evolutionary game theory, but also provides a foundation for the management of ecological systems and the design of cooperative mechanisms in society.

Abstract:
We address the problem of localizing the source of infection in an undirected, tree-structured network under a susceptible-infected outbreak model. The infection propagates with independent random time increments (i.e., edge-delays) between neighboring nodes, while only the infection times of a subset of nodes can be observed. We show that a reduced set of observers may be sufficient, in the statistical sense, to localize the source and characterize its identifiability via the joint Laplace transform of the observers' infection times. Using the explicit form of these transforms in terms of the edge-delay probability distributions, we propose scale-invariant least-squares estimators of the source. We evaluate their performance on synthetic trees and on a river network, demonstrating accurate localization under diverse edge-delay models. To conclude, we highlight overlooked technical challenges for observer-based source localization on networks with cycles, where standard spanning-tree reductions may be ill-posed.

Abstract:
We employ an n-player coordination game to model mutualism emergence and abandonment. We illustrate our findings in the context of the host--host interactions among plants in plant-mycorrhizal fungi (MF) mutualisms. The coordination game payoff structure captures the insight that mutualistic strategies lead to robust advantages only after such "biological markets" reach a certain scale. The game gives rise to three types of Nash equilibria, which correspond to the states derived in studies of the ancestral reconstruction of the mycorrhizal symbiosis in seed plants. We show that all types of Nash equilibria correspond to steady states of a dynamical system describing the underlying evolutionary process. We then employ methods from large deviation theory on discrete-time Markov processes to study stochastic evolutionary dynamics. We provide a sharp analytical characterization of the stochastic steady states and of the transition dynamics across Nash equilibria and employ simulations to illustrate these results in special cases. We find that the mutualism is abandoned and re-established several times through evolutionary time, but the mutualism may persist the majority of time. Changes that reduce the benefit-to-cost ratio associated with the symbiosis increase the likelihood of its abandonment. While the mutualism establishment and abandonment could result from direct transitions across the mutualistic and non-mutualistic states, it is far more likely for such transitions to occur indirectly through intermediate partially mutualistic states. The MF-plant mutualism might be (partially or fully) abandoned by plants even if it provides overall superior fitness.

Abstract:
Positive selection drives the emergence of adaptive mutations in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, shaping drug resistance, transmissibility, and virulence. Phylogenetic trees capture evolutionary relationships among isolates and provide a natural framework for detecting such adaptive signals. We present a phylogeny-guided graph attention network (GAT) approach, introducing a method for converting SNP-annotated phylogenetic trees into graph structures suitable for neural network analysis. Using 500 M. tuberculosis isolates from four major lineages and 249 single-nucleotide variants (84 resistance-associated and 165 neutral) across 61 drug-resistance genes, we constructed graphs where nodes represented isolates and edges reflected phylogenetic distances. Edges between isolates separated by more than seven internal nodes were pruned to emphasise local evolutionary structure. Node features encoded SNP presence or absence, and the GAT architecture included two attention layers, a residual connection, global attention pooling, and a multilayer perceptron classifier. The model achieved an accuracy of 0.88 on a held-out test set and, when applied to 146 WHO-classified "uncertain" variants, identified 41 candidates with convergent emergence across multiple lineages, consistent with adaptive evolution. This work demonstrates the feasibility of transforming phylogenies into GNN-compatible structures and highlights attention-based models as effective tools for detecting positive selection, aiding genomic surveillance and variant prioritisation.

Abstract:
The origin of microbial cells required the emergence of metabolism, an autocatalytic network of roughly 400 enzymatically catalyzed chemical reactions that synthesize the building blocks of life: amino acids, nucleotides and cofactors. Proposals for metabolic origin are theoretical in nature [1-9], empirical studies addressing the origin and early evolution of the 400-reaction chemical network itself are lacking. Here we identify intermediate states in the primordial assembly of metabolism from its inorganic origins, using structure-refined clusters for metabolic enzymes of prokaryotic genomes. We show that metabolism in the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) was enzymatically incomplete, undergoing final assembly independently in the lineages leading to bacteria and archaea, with metal catalysts that predated both enzymes and cofactors providing essential functions. Over half of modern core metabolism corresponds to laboratory reactions catalyzed by native transition metals--Fe(0), Co(0), Ni(0) and their alloys--under conditions of serpentinizing hydrothermal vents. As the hitherto elusive source of primordial aqueous phosphorylation, we show that phosphite, a constituent of serpentinizing systems [10], phosphorylates AMP [11] to ADP using native metals in water. Seventeen cofactors that transfer electrons, nitrogen, and carbon units to substrates in modern metabolism [12] can be functionally replaced by environmental transition metals [13-19]. The data reveal that cofactors are synthesized late in enzymatic metabolism and are required in reactions preceding their synthesis, specifying the existence at origins of simpler precursors, which we identify here as native metals. Cofactors liberated metabolism from a requirement for solid state catalysis at a phosphorylating hydrothermal vent, engendering its autocatalytic state.

Abstract:
Predicting species distributions using occupancy models accounting for imperfect detection is now commonplace in ecology. Recently, modelling spatial and temporal autocorrelation was proposed to alleviate the lack of replication in occupancy data, which often prevents model identifiability. However, how such models perform in highly heterogeneous datasets where missing or single-visit data dominates remains an open question. Motivated by an heterogeneous fine-scale butterfly occupancy dataset, we evaluate the performance of a multi-season occupancy model with spatial and temporal random effects to a skewed (Poisson) distribution of the number of surveys per site, overlap of covariates between occupancy and detection submodels, and spatiotemporal clustering of observations. Results showed that the model is robust to heterogeneous data and covariate overlap. However, when spatiotemporal gaps were added, site occupancy was biased towards the average occupancy, itself overestimated. Random effects did not correct the influence of gaps, due to identifiability issues of variance and autocorrelation parameters. Occupancy analysis of two butterfly species further confirmed these results. Overall, multi-season occupancy models with autocorrelation are robust to heterogeneous data and covariate overlap, but still present identifiability issues and are challenged by severe data gaps, which compromise predictions even in data-rich areas.

Abstract:
Environmental feedback mechanisms are ubiquitous in real-world complex systems. In this study, we incorporate a homogeneous environment into the evolutionary dynamics of a three-state system comprising cooperators, defectors, and empty nodes. Both coherence resonance and equilibrium states, resulting from the tightly clustering of cooperator agglomerates, enhance population survival and environmental quality. The resonance phenomenon arises at the transition between cooperative and defective payoff parameters in the prisoner's dilemma game.

Abstract:
We define symmetric and asymmetric branching trees, a class of processes particularly suited for modeling genealogies of inhomogeneous populations where individuals may reproduce throughout life. In this framework, a broad class of Crump-Mode-Jagers processes can be constructed as (a)symmetric Sevast'yanov processes, which count the branches of the tree. Analogous definitions yield reduced (a)symmetric Sevast'yanov processes, which restrict attention to branches that lead to extant progeny. We characterize their laws through generating functions. The genealogy obtained by pruning away branches without extant progeny at a fixed time is shown to satisfy a branching property, which provides distributional characterizations of the genealogy.

Abstract:
Insect species subject to infection, predation, and anisotropic environmental conditions may exhibit preferential movement patterns. Given the innate stochasticity of exogenous factors driving these patterns over short timescales, individual insect trajectories typically obey overdamped stochastic dynamics. In practice, data-driven modeling approaches designed to learn the underlying Fokker-Planck equations from observed insect distributions serve as ideal tools for understanding and predicting such behavior. Understanding dispersal dynamics of crop and silvicultural pests can lead to a better forecasting of outbreak intensity and location, which can result in better pest management. In this work, we extend weak-form equation learning techniques, coupled with kernel density estimation, to learn effective models for lepidopteran larval population movement from highly sparse experimental data. Galerkin methods such as the Weak form Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (WSINDy) algorithm have recently proven useful for learning governing equations in several scientific contexts. We demonstrate the utility of the method on a sparse dataset of position measurements of fall armyworms (Spodoptera frugiperda) obtained in simulated agricultural conditions with varied plant resources and infection status.

Abstract:
We investigate predator-prey school interactions in aquatic environments using a stochastic differential equation (SDE)-based, particle-level model that incorporates attraction, repulsion, alignment, and environmental noise. Two predation strategies-center attack and nearest attack-are examined to assess their effects on prey survival, predator efficiency, and group dynamics. Simulations reveal diverse emergent behaviors such as prey dispersal and regrouping, oscillatory predation with collective defense, and predator encirclement. Results show that collective hunting enhances capture efficiency compared to solitary attacks, but benefits diminish beyond a critical predator group size due to intra-predator competition. This work provides new insights into cooperative predation and introduces a generalizable SDE framework for analyzing predator-prey interactions.

Abstract:
Why do human populations remain vulnerable to collapse, even when they are large? Classical demographic theory predicts that volatility in growth should decline rapidly with size due to the averaging effects of the law of large numbers. As such, while small-scale societies may be demographically fragile, large-scale societies should be much more stable. Using a large census dataset of 228 indigenous societies from Brazil, we show that this prediction does not hold. Instead of volatility declining as the square root of population size, it falls much more slowly. This means that individuals within communities do not behave as independent demographic units as their lives are correlated through cooperation, shared subsistence practices, overlapping land use, and exposure to common shocks such as disease outbreaks or failed harvests. These correlations build demographic synchrony, drastically reducing the effective demographic degrees of freedom in a population, keeping volatility higher than expected at all scales. As a result, large-scale populations fluctuate as if they were much smaller, increasing their vulnerability to collapse. This helps explain why human societies of all sizes seem vulnerable to collapse, and why the archaeological and historical record is filled with examples of large, complex societies collapsing despite their size. We suggest demographic synchrony provides a general mechanism for understanding why human populations remain vulnerable across all scales: Scale still stabilizes synchronous populations via density increases, but synchrony ensures that stability grows only slowly with size, leaving large populations more volatile, and more vulnerable, than classical demographic theory predicts.

Abstract:
Zoonotic pathogens represent a growing global risk, yet the speed of adaptive immune activation across mammalian species remains poorly understood. Despite orders-of-magnitude differences in size and metabolic rate, we show that the time to initiate adaptive immunity is remarkably consistent across species. To understand this invariance, we analyse empirical data showing how the numbers and sizes of lymph nodes scale with body mass, finding that larger animals have both more and larger lymph nodes. Using scaling theory and our mathematical model, we show that larger lymph nodes enable faster search times, conferring an advantage to larger animals that otherwise face slower biological times. This enables mammals to maintain, or even accelerate, the time to initiate the adaptive immune response as body size increases. We validate our analysis in simulations and compare it to empirical data.

Abstract:
Aging is a universal consequence of life, yet researchers have identified no universal theme. This manuscript considers aging from the perspective of entropy, wherein things fall apart. We first examine biological information change as a mutational distance, analogous to physical distance. In this model, informational change over time is fitted to an advection-diffusion equation, a normal distribution with a time component. The solution of the advection-diffusion equation provides a means of measuring the entropy of diverse biological systems. The binomial distribution is also sufficient to demonstrate that entropy increases as mutations or epimutations accumulate. As modeled, entropy scales with lifespans across the tree of life. This perspective provides potential mechanistic insights and testable hypotheses as to how evolution has attained enhanced longevity: entropy management. We find entropy is an inclusive rather than exclusive aging theory.

Abstract:
Ancestral recombination graphs (ARGs) encode the complete genealogical history of a population of recombining lineages. ARGs, and their succinct representation, tree sequences, are increasingly central to modern population genetics methods, yet building an intuition for ARGs remains challenging. This is particularly true when analyzing ancestry in a geographic context, as there is a critical lack of dedicated, interactive tools capable of visualizing ARGs as spatiotemporal objects. To address this gap, we introduce ARGscape, an interactive platform for simulating, analyzing, and visualizing ARGs across space and time. ARGscape provides a user-friendly graphical interface featuring dynamic 2- and 3-dimensional visualizations to explore ARGs through space and time, as well as a novel "spatial diff" visualization for quantitative comparison of geographic inference methods. ARGscape is an innovative, unified framework that seamlessly integrates leading command-line, Python, and R-based tools for ARG simulation, manipulation, and use in spatiotemporal inference into both graphical and command-line interfaces. By integrating these various functionalities, ARGscape facilitates novel data exploration and hypothesis generation, while lowering the barrier to entry for spatiotemporal ARG analysis in both research and education use-cases. ARGscape is built with a Python FastAPI backend and a React/TypeScript frontend. It is freely available as a live demo at https://www.argscape.com and as a Python package on PyPI (pip install argscape). The source code and documentation are available on GitHub at https://github.com/chris-a-talbot/argscape.

Abstract:
Additional food sources for an introduced predator are known to increase its efficiency on a target pest. In this context, inhibiting factors such as interference, predator competition, and the introduction of temporally dependent quantity and quality of additional food are all known to enable pest extinction. As climate change and habitat degradation have increasing effects in enhancing patchiness in ecological systems, the effect of additional food in patch models has also been recently considered. However, the question of complete pest extinction in such patchy systems remains open. In the current manuscript, we consider a biological control model where additional food drives competition among predators in one patch, and they subsequently disperse to a neighboring patch via drift or dispersal. We show that complete pest extinction in both patches is possible. Further, this state is proved to be globally asymptotically stable under certain parametric restrictions. We also prove a codimension-2 Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation. We discuss our results in the context of designing pest management strategies under enhanced climate change and habitat fragmentation. Such strategies are particularly relevant to control invasive pests such as the Soybean aphid (\emph{Aphis glycines}), in the North Central United States.

Abstract:
Biological control strategies against mosquito-borne diseases--such as the sterile insect technique (SIT), RIDL, and Wolbachia-based releases--require reliable estimates of dispersal and survival of released males. We propose a mechanistic--statistical framework for mark--release--recapture (MRR) data linking an individual-based 2D diffusion model with its reaction--diffusion limit. Inference is based on solving the macroscopic system and embedding it in a Poisson observation model for daily trap counts, with uncertainty quantified via a parametric bootstrap. We validate identifiability using simulated data and apply the model to an urban MRR campaign in El Cano (Havana, Cuba) involving four weekly releases of sterile Aedes aegypti males. The best-supported model suggests a mean life expectancy of about five days and a typical displacement of about 180 m. Unlike empirical fits of survival or dispersal, our mechanistic approach jointly estimates movement, mortality, and capture, yielding biologically interpretable parameters and a principled framework for designing and evaluating SIT-based interventions.

Abstract:
From the formation of ice in small clusters of water molecules to the mass raids of army ant colonies, the emergent behavior of collectives depends critically on their size. At the same time, common wisdom holds that such behaviors are robust to the loss of individuals. This tension points to the need for a more systematic study of how number influences collective behavior. We initiate this study by focusing on collective behaviors that change abruptly at certain critical numbers of individuals. We show that a subtle modification of standard bifurcation analysis identifies such critical numbers, including those associated with discreteness- and noise-induced transitions. By treating them as instances of the same phenomenon, we show that critical numbers across physical scales and scientific domains commonly arise from competing feedbacks that scale differently with number. We then use this idea to find overlooked critical numbers in past studies of collective behavior and explore the implications for their conclusions. In particular, we highlight how deterministic approximations of stochastic models can fail near critical numbers. We close by distinguishing these qualitative changes from density-dependent phase transitions and by discussing how our approach could generalize to broader classes of collective behaviors.

Phylogenetic trees represent certain species and their likely ancestors. In such a tree, present-day species are leaves and an edge from u to v indicates that u is an ancestor of v. Weights on these edges indicate the phylogenetic distance. The phylogenetic diversity (PD) of a set of species A is the total weight of edges that are on any path between the root of the phylogenetic tree and a species in A. Selecting a small set of species that maximizes phylogenetic diversity for a given phylogenetic tree is an essential task in preservation planning, where limited resources naturally prevent saving all species. An optimal solution can be found with a greedy algorithm [Steel, Systematic Biology, 2005; Pardi and Goldman, PLoS Genetics, 2005]. However, when a food web representing predator-prey relationships is given, finding a set of species that optimizes phylogenetic diversity subject to the condition that each saved species should be able to find food among the preserved species is NP-hard [Spillner et al., IEEE/ACM, 2008]. We present a generalization of this problem, where, inspired by biological considerations, the food web has weighted edges to represent the importance of predator-prey relationships. We show that this version is NP-hard even when both structures, the food web and the phylogenetic tree, are stars. To cope with this intractability, we proceed in two directions. Firstly, we study special cases where a species can only survive if a given fraction of its prey is preserved. Secondly, we analyze these problems through the lens of parameterized complexity. Our results include that finding a solution is fixed-parameter tractable with respect to the vertex cover number of the food web, assuming the phylogenetic tree is a star.

Abstract:
Progress of the COVID-19 pandemic was quantified, in the first instance, using the daily number of positive cases recorded by the national public health authorities. Averaged over a seven-day window, the daily incidence of COVID-19 in Germany reveals clear sections of exponential growth or decay in propagation of infection. Comparing with incidence profiles according to onset-of-symptoms shows that reporting of cases involves variable delays. Observed changes in exponential rates come from growing public awareness, governmental restrictions and their later relaxation, annual holidays, seasonal variation, emergence of new viral variants, and from mass vaccination. Combining the measured rates with epidemiological parameters established for SARS-CoV-2 yields the dynamics of change in disease transmission. Combined with the distribution of serial intervals (or generation times), the rate gives basic and instantaneous values of the reproduction number that govern development and ultimate outcome of the epidemic. Herd immunity requires vaccination of approximately seventy percent of the population, but this increases to circa eighty percent for the more transmissible Alpha-variant. Beyond this point, progressive vaccination reduces the susceptible population, and competes with the emergence of new variants. By the first Omicron wave, circa seventy percent were doubly vaccinated, with the target then standing at circa eighty percent. Combined with the distribution of times-to-death, incidence rates from onset of symptoms predict the daily profile of COVID-associated deaths and estimated case-fatality ratio. Cases are under-reported in the first wave and reflect age heterogeneity in fatalities at the second wave. In periods of low incidence, COVID mortality was one percent or less of detected infection.

Abstract:
Evolutionary game theory offers a general framework to study how behaviors evolve by social learning in a population. This body of theory can accommodate a range of social dilemmas, or games, as well as real-world complexities such as spatial structure or behaviors conditioned on reputations. Nonetheless, this approach typically assumes a deterministic payoff structure for social interactions. Here, we extend evolutionary game theory to account for random changes in the social environment, so that mutual cooperation may bring different rewards today than it brings tomorrow, for example. Even when such environmental noise is unbiased, we find it can have a qualitative impact on the behaviors that evolve in a population. Noisy payoffs can permit the stable co-existence of cooperators and defectors in the prisoner's dilemma, for example, as well as bistability in snowdrift games and stable limit cycles in rock-paper-scissors games -- dynamical phenomena that cannot occur in the absence of noise. We conclude by discussing the relevance of our framework to scenarios where the nature of social interactions is subject to external perturbations.

Abstract:
Climate change and fisheries jointly shape the resilience of the Barents Sea marine ecosystem, yet the recovery of key fish populations to climate and anthropogenic disturbances requires further investigation. This study examines how fishing pressure and climate change, driven by the NEMO-MEDUSA Earth system model, influence the recovery times of Demersal and Planktivorous fish in the Barents Sea. We used the StrathE2EPolar end-to-end ecosystem model to simulate transient dynamics under increasing fishing pressure scenarios, and quantified recovery times for Demersal, Planktivorous, and ecosystem-wide groups relative to a shifting unfished baseline. Recovery times increased with both fishing intensity and climate change, by as much as 18 years for Demersal fish and 54 years for Planktivorous fish across all fishing scenarios. At the ecosystem level, recovery was constrained by the slow rebound of top predators, many of which experienced biomass collapse under climate change, preventing recovery to a shifting baseline. Our results suggest that fishing pressure in tandem with climate change substantially reduces ecosystem resilience, highlighting the importance of sustainable harvest strategies in a changing climate.

Abstract:
In this paper, we introduce gonosomic algebras to algebraically translate the phenomenon of genetic sterility. Gonosomic algebras extend the concept of gonosomal algebras used as algebraic model of genetic phenomena related to sex-determination and sex-linked gene transmission by allowing genetic sterility to be taken into account. Conditions under which gonosomic algebras are not gonosomal and several algebraic constructions of gonosomic algebras are given. To each gonosomic algebra, an evolution operator noted W is associated that gives the state of the offspring population at the birth stage. Next from W we define the operator V which gives the frequency distribution of genetic types. We show that the various stability notions of equilibrium points are preserved by passing from W to V .

Abstract:
We investigate traveling wave solutions in the two-species reaction-diffusion Lotka-Volterra competition system under weak competition. For the strict weak competition regime $(b<a<1/c,\,d>0)$, we construct refined upper and lower solutions combined with the Schauder fixed point theorem to establish the existence of traveling waves for all wave speeds $s\geq s^*:=\max\{2,2\sqrt{ad}\}$, and provide verifiable sufficient conditions for the emergence of non-monotone waves. Such conditions for non-monotonic waves have not been explicitly addressed in previous studies. It is interesting to point out that our result for non-monotone waves also hold for the critical speed case $s=s^*$. In addition, in the critical weak competition case $(b<a=1/c,\,d>0)$, we rigorously prove, for the first time, the existence of front-pulse traveling waves.

Abstract:
Metagenomic data has significantly advanced microbiome research by employing ecological models, particularly in personalised medicine. The generalised Lotka-Volterra (gLV) model is commonly used to understand microbial interactions and predict ecosystem dynamics. However, gLV models often fail to capture complex interactions, especially when data is limited or noisy. This study critically assesses the effectiveness of gLV and similar models using Bayesian inference and a model reduction method based on information theory. We found that ecological data often leads to non-interpretability and overfitting due to limited information, noisy data, and parameter sloppiness. Our results highlight the need for simpler models that align with the available data and propose a distribution-based approach to better capture ecosystem diversity, stability, and competition. These findings challenge current bottom-up ecological modelling practices and aim to shift the focus toward a Statistical Mechanics view of ecology based on distributions of parameters.

Abstract:
This study investigates the impact of time since fire on bird community composition in Southern California chaparral ecosystems. We surveyed avian richness and abundance across 14 sites representing a 0 to 25 year post-fire chronosequence in Los Angeles County. Sites burned within the last five years supported fewer species, primarily dominated by generalists, while mid- to late-successional sites exhibited greater richness and a higher proportion of specialists. These patterns corresponded with increases in vegetation structural complexity over time. However, no consistent relationships were found between bird communities and abiotic variables, such as weather, temperature, and elevation, likely due to the single-visit sampling design. Our results align with successional theory and underscore the ecological importance of fire return intervals that allow full chaparral recovery. Restoration and management should prioritize long-term structural development, invasive grass control, and post-fire heterogeneity to support diverse and resilient avian communities.

Abstract:
Everyone can see that over the last 150 years, theoretical ecology has become considerably more mathematical. But what is the nature of this phenomenon? Are mathematics applied, as in the use of statistical tests, for example, or are they involved, as in physics, where laws cannot be expressed without them? Through the history of the {\em Competitive Exclusion Principle} formulated at the very beginning of the 20th century by the naturalist Grinnell concerning the distribution of brown-backed chickadees, up to its modern integration into what is known in mathematics as population dynamics, I highlight the effectiveness of what could be called the mathematical novel in clarifying certain concepts in theoretical ecology.

Abstract:
To promote climate adaptation and mitigation, it is crucial to understand stakeholder perspectives and knowledge gaps on land use and climate changes. Stakeholders across 21 European islands were consulted on climate and land use change issues affecting ecosystem services. Climate change perceptions included temperature, precipitation, humidity, extremes, and wind. Land use change perceptions included deforestation, coastal degradation, habitat protection, renewable energy facilities, wetlands, and others. Additional concerns such as invasive species, water or energy scarcity, infrastructure problems, and austerity were also considered. Climate and land use change impact perceptions were analysed with machine learning to quantify their influence. The predominant climatic characteristic is temperature, and the predominant land use characteristic is deforestation. Water-related problems are top priorities for stakeholders. Energy-related problems, including energy deficiency and issues with wind and solar facilities, rank high as combined climate and land use risks. Stakeholders generally perceive climate change impacts on ecosystem services as negative, with natural habitat destruction and biodiversity loss identified as top issues. Land use change impacts are also negative but more complex, with more explanatory variables. Stakeholders share common perceptions on biodiversity impacts despite geographic disparity, but they differentiate between climate and land use impacts. Water, energy, and renewable energy issues pose serious concerns, requiring management measures.

Abstract:
Our adaptive immune system relies on the persistence over long times of a diverse set of antigen-experienced B cells to encode our memories of past infections and to protect us against future ones. While longitudinal repertoire sequencing promises to track the long-term dynamics of many B cell clones simultaneously, sampling and experimental noise make it hard to draw reliable quantitative conclusions. Leveraging statistical inference, we infer the dynamics of memory B cell clonal dynamics and conversion to plasmablasts, which includes clone creation, degradation, abundance fluctuations, and differentiation. We find that memory B cell clones degrade slowly, with a half-life of 10 years. Based on the inferred parameters, we predict that it takes about 50 years to renew 50\% of the repertoire, with most observed clones surviving for a lifetime. We infer that, on average, 1 out of 100 memory B cells differentiates into a plasmablast each year, more than expected from purely antigen-stimulated differentiation, and that plasmablast clones degrade with a half-life of about one year in the absence of memory imports. Our method is general and could be applied to other longitudinal repertoire sequencing B cell subsets.

Abstract:
Public opinion on environmental issues remains polarized in many countries, posing a significant barrier to the implementation of effective policies. Behind this polarization, empirical studies have identified social susceptibility, personal prejudice, and personal experience as dominant factors in opinion formation on environmental issues. However, current coupled human-environment models have not yet incorporated all three factors in polarized populations. We developed a stylized coupled human-environment model to investigate how social susceptibility, personal prejudice, and personal experience shape opinion formation and the environment in polarized populations. Using analytical and numerical methods, we characterized the conditions under which polarization, consensus, opinion changes, and cyclic dynamics emerge depending on the costs of mitigation, environmental damage, and the factors influencing opinion formation. Our model shows that prejudice is the key driver of persistent polarization, with even slightly prejudiced populations maintaining indefinite polarization independent of their level of objectivity. We predict that polarization can be reduced by decreasing the role of prejudice or increasing the willingness to consider opposing opinions. Finally, our model shows that cost reduction methods are less effective at reducing environmental impact in prejudiced populations. Our model generates thresholds for when reducing costs or emissions is more useful depending on the factors which influence the population's opinion formation. Overall, our model provides a framework for investigating the importance of cognitive and social structures in determining human-environment dynamics.

Abstract:
Infected individuals in some epidemics can remain asymptomatic while still carrying and transmitting the infection. These individuals contribute to the spread of the epidemic and pose a significant challenge to public health policies. Identifying asymptomatic individuals is critical for measuring and controlling an epidemic, but periodic and widespread testing of healthy individuals is often too costly. This work tackles the problem of identifying asymptomatic individuals considering a classic SI (Susceptible-Infected) network epidemic model where a fraction of the infected nodes are not observed as infected (i.e., their observed state is identical to susceptible nodes). In order to classify healthy nodes as asymptomatic or susceptible, a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model with supervised learning is adopted where a set of node features are built from the network with observed infected nodes. The approach is evaluated across different network models, network sizes, and fraction of observed infections. Results indicate that the proposed methodology is robust across different scenarios, accurately identifying asymptomatic nodes while also generalizing to different network sizes and fraction of observed infections.

Abstract:
Climate change is a global emergency, as was the COVID-19 pandemic. Why was our collective response to COVID-19 so much stronger than our response to the climate emergency, to date? We hypothesize that the answer has to do with the scale of the systems, and not just spatial and temporal scales but also the `altruistic scale' that measures whether an action must rely upon altruistic motives for it to be adopted. We treat COVID-19 and climate change as common pool resource problems that exemplify coupled human-environment systems. We introduce a framework that captures regimes of containment, mitigation, and failure to control. As parameters governing these three scales are varied, it is possible to shift from a COVID-like system to a climate-like system. The framework replicates both inaction in the case of climate change mitigation, as well as the faster response that we exhibited to COVID-19. Our cross-system comparison also suggests actionable ways that cooperation can be improved in large-scale common pool resources problems, like climate change. More broadly, we argue that considering scale and incorporating human-natural system feedbacks are not just interesting special cases within non-cooperative game theory, but rather should be the starting point for the study of altruism and human cooperation.

Abstract:
The COVID-19 pandemic underscored a critical need for intervention strategies that balance disease containment with socioeconomic stability. We approach this challenge by designing a framework for modeling and evaluating disease-spread prevention strategies. Our framework leverages multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) - a formulation necessitated by competing objectives - combined with a new stochastic differential equation (SDE) pandemic simulator, calibrated and validated against global COVID-19 data. Our simulator reproduces national-scale pandemic dynamics with orders of magnitude higher fidelity than other models commonly used in reinforcement learning (RL) approaches to pandemic intervention. Training a Pareto-Conditioned Network (PCN) agent on this simulator, we illustrate the direct policy trade-offs between epidemiological control and economic stability for COVID-19. Furthermore, we demonstrate the framework's generality by extending it to pathogens with different epidemiological profiles, such as polio and influenza, and show how these profiles lead the agent to discover fundamentally different intervention policies. To ground our work in contemporary policymaking challenges, we apply the model to measles outbreaks, quantifying how a modest 5% drop in vaccination coverage necessitates significantly more stringent and costly interventions to curb disease spread. This work provides a robust and adaptable framework to support transparent, evidence-based policymaking for mitigating public health crises.

Abstract:
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) threatens global health. A promising and underexplored strategy to tackle this problem are sequential therapies exploiting collateral sensitivity (CS), whereby resistance to one drug increases sensitivity to another. Here, we develop a four-genotype stochastic birth-death model with two bacteriostatic antibiotics to identify switching periods that maximize bacterial extinction under subinhibitory concentrations. We show that extinction probability depends nonlinearly on switching period, with stepwise increases aligned to discrete switch events: fast sequential therapies are suboptimal as they do not allow for the evolution of resistance, a key ingredient in these therapies. A geometric distribution framework accurately predicts cumulative extinction probabilities, where the per-switch extinction probability rises with switching period. We further derive a heuristic approximation for the extinction probability based on times to fixation of single-resistant mutants. Sensitivity analyses reveal that strong reciprocal CS is required for this strategy to work, and we explore how increasing antibiotic doses and higher mutation rates modulate extinction in a nonmonotonic manner. Finally, we discuss how longer therapies maximize extinction but also cause higher resistance, leading to a Pareto front of optimal switching periods. Our results provide quantitative design principles for in vitro and clinical sequential antibiotic therapies, underscoring the potential of CS-guided regimens to suppress resistance evolution and eradicate infections.

Abstract:
Chikungunya (CHIK) is a viral disease transmitted to humans through the bites of {\it Aedes} mosquitoes infected with the chikungunya virus (CHIKV). CHIKV has been imported annually to Florida in the last decade due to Miami's crucial location as a hub for international travel, particularly from Central and South America including Brazil, where CHIK is endemic. This work addresses to the geographic spread of CHIK, incorporating factors such as human movement, temperature dependency, as well as vertical transmission, and incubation periods, for different patches. Central to the model is the integration of a multi-patch framework, and in the numerical analysis it is considered human movement between endemic Brazilian states and Florida. We establish crucial correlations between the mosquito reproduction number $\mathcal{R}_{m}$ and the disease reproduction number $\mathcal{R}_{0}$ with the disease dynamics in a multi-patch environment, encompassing not only a numerical analysis but also from a theoretical perspective. Through numerical simulations, validated with real population and temperature data, it is possible to understand the disease dynamics under many different scenarios and make future projections, offering insights for potential effective control strategies, as well as addressing the timing for these strategies to be adopted.

Abstract:
We study a bi-virus susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) epidemic model in which individuals are either susceptible or infected with one of two virus strains, and consider mutation-driven transitions between strains. The general case of bi-directional mutation is first analyzed, where we characterize the disease-free equilibrium and establish its global asymptotic stability, as well as the existence, uniqueness, and stability of an endemic equilibrium. We then present a game-theoretic framework where susceptible individuals strategically choose whether to adopt protection or remain unprotected, to maximize their instantaneous payoffs. We derive Nash strategies under bi-directional mutation, and subsequently consider the special case of unidirectional mutation. In the latter case, we show that coexistence of both strains is impossible when mutation occurs from the strain with lower reproduction number and transmission rate to the other strain. Furthermore, we fully characterize the stationary Nash equilibrium (SNE) in the setting permitting coexistence, and examine how mutation rates influence protection adoption and infection prevalence at the SNE. Numerical simulations corroborate the analytical results, demonstrating that infection levels decrease monotonically with higher protection adoption, and highlight the impact of mutation rates and protection cost on infection state trajectories.

Abstract:
In this work, we investigate the population dynamics of tumor cells under therapeutic pressure. Although drug treatment initially induces a reduction in tumor burden, treatment failure frequently occurs over time due to the emergence of drug resistance, ultimately leading to cancer recurrence. To model this process, we employ a two-type branching process with state-dependent growth rates. The model assumes an initial tumor population composed predominantly of drug-sensitive cells, with a small subpopulation of resistant cells. Sensitive cells may acquire resistance through mutation, which is coupled to a change in cellular fitness. Furthermore, the growth rates of resistant cells are modulated by the overall tumor burden. Using stochastic differential equation techniques, we establish a functional law of large numbers for the scaled populations of sensitive cells, resistant cells, and the initial resistant clone. We then define the stochastic recurrence time as the first time the total tumor population regrows to its initial size following treatment. For this recurrence time, as well as for measures of clonal diversity and the size of the largest resistant clone at recurrence, we derive corresponding law of large number limits. These asymptotic results provide a theoretical foundation for constructing statistically consistent estimators for key biological parameters, including the cellular growth rates, the mutation rate, and the initial fraction of resistant cells.

However, the effectiveness of within-farm sampling remains to be examined, particularly during the early phase of an outbreak when disease prevalence is low, animals may be asymptomatic, or clinical signs are masked by co-circulating diseases. This study assessed four sampling strategies for detecting ASFV-infected animals in suspected growing pig farms within the first 14 days of the introduction of either a high- or moderate-virulence ASFV strain. Pens were selected using three methods: random sampling, targeted sampling of pens with clinical animals, and informative sampling based on estimated pen infection probabilities. The informative sampling method was further divided into sequential method, which ranked pens by descending viral load probability, and cluster and random method, which selected pens at random from high and low viral load clusters. Each pen-selection method was examined with different sample sizes. We calculated the sensitivity of each approach as the probability of detecting at least one ASFV-positive pig per farm. Results showed that sampling 30 pens with one pig per pen using the target and random pen-selection method yielded the highest detection sensitivity, even in the presence of other co-circulating diseases that interfere with the accurate identification of clinical ASFV cases. In contrast, sampling five pens resulted in the lowest sensitivity. These findings provide valuable insights for improving ASFV surveillance strategies in the U.S. and can inform preparedness efforts for other foreign animal diseases.

Abstract:
Road mortality may be a significant factor in the global decline of amphibian populations, yet rigorous assessments of its effect on long-term population persistence are lacking.   Here, we investigate population persistence through a field study and mathematical model of a western toad ({\textit{Anaxyrus Boreas}} {\RR(Baird and Girard, 1852)}) population within a highway corridor in the Selkirk Mountains of British Columbia.   The analysis shows traffic levels strongly correlate with toad mortality, with each additional vehicle causing a 3.1\% $\pm$ 1.3\% ($p=0.020$) increase in toad deaths.   Although the current risk of the population becoming threatened or endangered is low, it rises to 50\% if baseline road mortality increases from 10\% to 30\%. Gravid female mortality is higher than the baseline mortality and can increase the probability of endangerment by nearly two-fold at higher baseline mortality levels.   We make the case that a small increase in vehicle traffic resulting from future development and recreational pressures   could destabilize this apparently healthy toad population. The high sensitivity to traffic levels and rapid transition from healthy to endangered raises concerns for similar populations worldwide. Compensatory structures such as amphibian underpasses (toad tunnels) should be given high priority.

Abstract:
We extend a formal framework that previously derived time from the multifractal structure of biological lineages (Hudnall \& D'Souza, 2025). That work showed that time itself is multifractal -- not a universal background dimension, but an observer-dependent geometry. Here we develop the corresponding theory of measurement: showing that a multifractal conception of time not only permits measurement, but grounds it more rigorously in the structure of biology. The tree of life is modeled as the outcome of stochastic, convex branching, and we show how information-theoretic and fractal measures render its multifractal geometry into measurable, observer-relative time intervals. At the core is a dilation equation that expresses relative time elapse between entities as dimensionless ratios. Operational standards such as the SI second remain valid, but our framework makes explicit their lineage-dependence. This framework unifies measurement theory with biological form, preserves full compatibility with established science, and provides a biologically grounded theory of observation. It enables comparative analyses of duration and kinematics across lineages, with predictions that are directly open to experimental validation.

Abstract:
We analyze a variant of the Noisy $K$-Branching Random Walk, a population model that evolves according to the following procedure. At each time step, each individual produces a large number of offspring that inherit the fitness of their parents up to independent and identically distributed fluctuations. The next generation consists of a random sample of all the offspring so that the population size remains fixed, where the sampling is made according to a parameterized Gibbs measure of the fitness of the offspring. Our model interpolates between classical models of fitness waves and exhibits a novel phase transition in the propagation of the wave. By employing a stochastic Hopf-Cole transformation, we show that as we increase the population size, the random dynamics of the model can be described by deterministic operations acting on the limiting population densities. We then show that for fitness fluctuations with exponential tails, these operations admit a unique traveling wave solution with local stability. The traveling wave solution undergoes a phase transition when changing selection pressure, revealing a complex interaction between evolution and natural selection.

Abstract:
By unifying three foundational principles of modern biology, we develop a mathematical framework to analyze the growing tree of life. Contrary to the static case, where the analogy between phylogenetic trees and the tree that grows in soil is drawn, our framework shows that the living tree of life is analogous to a Cantor dust where each branch is a distinct fractal curve. The system as a whole is therefore multifractal in the sense that it consists of many unique fractals. The three foundational principles for the mathematical framework are that phylogeny is nested, phylogeny is dualistic (i.e., transitive between singularities and populations), and phylogeny is stochastic. Integrating these three principles, we model the dynamic (i.e., living) tree of life as a random iterated function system that generates unique convexly related sequences of branching random variables (visualized in Animation 1). The multifractal nature of this dynamic tree of life implies that, for any two living entities, the time interval from their last common ancestor to the present moment is a distinct fractal curve for each. Thus, the length of a time interval along each distinct branch is unique, so that time is also multifractal and not an ultrametric on the tree of life.

Abstract:
Lattice-based random walk models are widely used to study populations of migrating cells with motility bias and proliferation. Crowding is typically represented by volume exclusion, where each lattice site can be occupied by at most one agent and conflicting moves are aborted. This framework enables simulations that yield both population-level spatiotemporal agent density profiles and individual agent trajectories, comparable to experimental cell-tracking data. Previous continuum models for tagged-agent trajectories captured trajectory information only, and overlooked any measure of variability. This is an important limitation since trajectory data is inherently variable. To address this limitation, here we derive partial differential equations for the probability density function of tagged-agent trajectories. This continuum description has a clear physical interpretation, agrees well with distributional data from stochastic simulations, reveals the role of stochasticity in different contexts, and generalises to multiple subpopulations of distinct agents.

Abstract:
In network-based SIS models of infectious disease transmission, infection can only occur between directly connected individuals. This constraint naturally gives rise to spatial correlations between the states of neighboring nodes, as the infection status of connected individuals becomes interdependent. Although mean-field approximations are commonly invoked to simplify disease forecasting on networks, they fail to account for these correlations by assuming that infectious individuals are well-mixed within a population, leading to inaccurate predictions of infection numbers over time. As such, the development of mathematical frameworks that account for spatially correlated infections is of great interest, as they offer a compromise between accurate disease forecasting and analytic tractability. Here, we use existing corrections to mean-field theory on the regular lattice to construct a more general framework for equivalent corrections on regular random graph topologies. We derive and simulate a system of ordinary differential equations for the time evolution of the spatial correlation function at various geodesic distances on random networks, and use solutions to this hierarchy of ordinary differential equations to predict the global infection density as a function of time, finding good agreement with corresponding numerical simulations. Our results constitute a substantial development on existing corrections to mean-field theory for infectious individuals in SIS processes and provide an in-depth characterization of how structural randomness in networks affects the dynamical trajectories of infectious diseases on networks.

Abstract:
In complex ecological communities, species may self-organize into clusters or clumps where highly similar species can coexist. The emergence of such species clusters can be captured by the interplay between neutral and niche theories. Based on the generalized Lotka-Volterra model of competition, we propose a minimal model for ecological communities in which the steady states contain self-organized clusters. In this model, species compete only with their neighbors in niche space through a common interaction strength. Unlike many previous theories, this model does not rely on random heterogeneity in interactions. By varying only the interaction strength, we find an exponentially large set of cluster patterns with different sizes and combinations. There are sharp phase transitions into the formation of clusters. There are also multiple phase transitions between different sets of possible cluster patterns, many of which accumulate near a small number of critical points. We analyze such a phase structure using both numerical and analytical methods. In addition, the special case with only nearest neighbor interactions is exactly solvable using the method of transfer matrices from statistical mechanics. We analyze the critical behavior of these systems and make comparisons with existing lattice models.

Abstract:
In recent decades, European forests have faced an increased incidence of fire disturbances. This phenomenon is likely to persist, given the rising frequency of extreme events expected in the future. Estimating canopy recovery time after disturbance serves as a critical assessment for understanding forest resilience, which can ultimately help determine the ability of forests to regain their capacity to provide essential ecosystem services. This study estimated fire severity and post-disturbance recovery in European forests using a remote sensing--based time series approach. MODIS Leaf Area Index (LAI) time series data were used to track the evolution of vegetation cover over burned areas from 2001 to 2024. Fire severity was defined relative to pre-disturbance conditions by comparing vegetation status before and after fire events. Recovery intervals were determined from temporal evolution of vegetation greening as the duration required to reach the pre-disturbance LAI baseline. Furthermore, this study analyzed the severity and recovery indicators in relation to forest species diversity and landscape heterogeneity metrics across Europe, offering valuable insights into the spatial variability of forest response dynamics across diverse forest ecosystems across Europe. Results revealed a consistent pattern across vegetation cover types: higher forest species diversity and greater landscape shape complexity were associated with lower fire severity and, notably, shorter recovery times following fire disturbance.

Abstract:
This study develops and analyzes an extended Susceptible, Infected, Hospitalized and Recovered (SIHR) model incorporating time dependent control functions to capture preventive measures (e.g., distancing, mask use) and resource limited therapeutic interventions. This formulation provides a realistic mathematical framework for modeling public health responses beyond classical uncontrolled epidemic models. The control design is integrated into the model via an optimal control framework, solved numerically using the Forward Backward Sweep method, enabling the exploration of intervention strategies on epidemic dynamics, including infection prevalence, hospitalization burden, and the effective reproduction number. To assess the robustness of these strategies under uncertainty, we employ Polynomial Chaos Expansion combined with Sobol sensitivity indices, quantifying the influence of key epidemiological parameters (transmission, recovery, hospitalization rates) on model outcomes. Numerical simulations, calibrated to Djiboutian COVID 19 data, show that combined preventive and therapeutic interventions substantially mitigate epidemic burden, though their effectiveness depends critically on transmission related uncertainties. The originality of this work lies in combining optimal control theory with global sensitivity analysis, thus bridging numerical methods, optimization, and epidemic modeling. This integrated approach offers a general mathematical framework for designing and evaluating control strategies in infectious disease outbreaks, with applications to low resource settings and beyond.

Abstract:
The majority of analysis of interacting systems is done for weak and well-balanced interactions, when in fact topology and rare event factors often result in strong and sign-biased interactions when considering real systems. We analyse the impact of strong mutualistic interactions in a uniformly weighted Erdős-Rényi network under generalised Lotka-Volterra dynamics. In difference to the typical case we show the interaction topology and system dynamics combine to produce power law abundance distributions in a critical region of the phase diagram, identifiable as a Griffiths phase. We find asymptotic expressions for the fixed point solution in this region, and establish the boundary of this region as when topology alone determines the abundance distribution. We show that the Griffiths phase persists for strong mutualistic interactions more generally, and survives when combined with weak all-to-all competition.

Abstract:
West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne virus of the genus Flaviviridae circulating between mosquitoes and birds, while humans, equids, and other mammals are dead-end hosts. Several preventive measures are recommended to reduce the WNV burden among different hosts. In this work, we develop a mathematical framework for evaluating the theoretical effectiveness of various WNV control methods in Germany. We consider mosquito reduction methods such as the physical removal and destruction of potential mosquito breeding sites, the use of larvicides, and the use of adulticides. We also evaluate the usage of personal protective equipment (PPE) that aims to reduce human-mosquito contact. Adopting PPEs may not happen instantly due to different perceptions, social influence, and the perceived inconvenience and/or frustration that come with using PPEs. Thus, we model a dynamic adoption of PPEs by considering the perceived risk of infection, perceived inconvenience of using PPEs, and the imitation dynamics due to social influence. Furthermore, the model captures vaccination of equids. We formulate and study an optimal control problem, where mosquito controls are temperature-dependent and the decision to start or stop applying the control methods is influenced by the changes in temperature. The optimal control model supports the development and seasonal timing of cost-effective mosquito control methods. For example, results from the optimal control study show that mosquito control efforts in Germany should be initiated during early spring and stopped at the end of June or early July, during the first year of control, to avoid overuse and unnecessary costs. Finally, we developed a Shiny app that allows users to test how different combinations of interventions could reduce WNV cases.

Abstract:
Recent studies on indirect reciprocity with private assessment on complete graphs suggest the possibility that one can continuously modulate the degree of segregation by controlling how to judge a good person helping a bad one. A well-known social norm called L6 judges it as bad, which eventually segregates the society into two antagonistic clusters, but if it is judged as good, the system reaches paradise where everyone likes each other. In this work, we numerically study this transition between segregation and paradise in two different settings. Firstly, in a uniform population of size $N$ where everyone regards such a donor as good with probability $p$ and bad with $1-p$, we observe paradise when $Np$ is sufficiently greater than $O(1)$. In contrast, in a heterogeneous setting where only $k$ individuals judge such a donor as good, the size difference of the clusters increases almost linearly as $k$ increases, so paradise can only be reached as $k \to N$ in a large population. Therefore, when an urgent change is needed to overcome the segregation due to L6, a small change in each and every individual's behavior is more efficient than a radical change in a fraction of the population.

Abstract:
The use of ad-hoc engineered viruses in the fight against tumours is one of the greatest ideas in cancer therapeutics within the last three decades. Together with other strategies such as immunotherapies, nanoparticles and adjunct therapies, the use of viral vectors in clinical trials and in the clinics has been and is still widely studied and pursued. The ability of those vectors to infiltrate and infect tumours represents one of the key attributes that regulates the success of such a strategy. Although some remarkable successes have been obtained, it is still not entirely clear how to achieve reliable protocols that can be routinely employed with confidence on a significant range of tumours. In this work, we thus concentrate on the study of different mathematical descriptions of virotherapy with the aim of better understanding the role of viral infectivity and viral dynamics in positive therapeutic outcomes. In particular, we compare probabilistic, individual approaches with continuous, spatially inhomogeneous models and investigate the importance of different tumour motility and different mathematical representations of viral infectivity. These formulations also allow us to arrive at better analytical characterisation of how waves of viral infections arise and propagate in tumours, providing interesting insights into therapy dynamics. Similarly to previous studies, oscillatory behaviours, stochasticity and cancers' diffusivities are all central to the eradication or the escape of tumours under virotherapy. Here, though, our results also show that the ability of viruses to infect tumours seems, in certain cases, more important to a final positive outcome than tumours' motility or even reproducibility. This could hopefully represent a first step into better insights into viral dynamics that may help clinicians to achieve consistently better outcomes.

Abstract:
Ecological interactions can dramatically alter evolutionary outcomes in complex communities. Yet, the classic theoretical results of population genetics (e.g., Kimura's fixation formula) largely ignore ecological effects. Here, we address this shortcoming by using dynamical mean-field theory to integrate ecology into classical population genetics models. We show that ecological interactions between parents and mutants result in frequency-dependent selection and can be characterized by a single emergent parameter that measures the strength of ecological feedbacks. We derive an explicit analytic expression for the fixation probability that generalizes Kimura's famous result and analyze it in various ecological and evolutionary limits. We find that ecological interactions suppress fixation probabilities for moderately beneficial mutants when compared to Kimura's predictions, with the strength of suppression increasing with larger effective population sizes, greater selective differences between parent and mutant, and for ecosystems with a large number of "open niches" (i.e., ecosystems well below the packing bound). Frequency-dependent selection also gives rise to prolonged parent-mutant coexistence in complex communities, a phenomenon absent in classical population genetics. Our study establishes a framework for integrating ecological interactions into population genetics models and helps illuminate how ecology can affect evolutionary outcomes.

Abstract:
The host's odor serves as a critical biological tracking signal in the host-seeking process of mosquitoes, and its heterogeneity significantly influences the transmission of mosquito-borne diseases. In this study, we propose a mosquito-borne disease model incorporating odor-baited traps to examine the impact of odor on disease transmission. Following recent experimental evidence, we also assume that infected humans are more attractive than susceptible or recovered ones.   The value of the basic reproduction number, $R_0$, depends on the attractiveness of traps, adjusted relative to infected individuals; the dependence on the relative attractiveness of susceptibles is non-monotone, suggesting that there exists an optimal mosquito preference that maximizes disease transmission. When $R_0>1$, there exists an endemic equilibrium which, under certain conditions, is proved to be globally stable. An endemic equilibrium may also exist when $R_0 < 1$, due to a backward bifurcation occurring when infected humans incur significant mortality. The phenomenon of backward bifurcation is reduced when odor-baited traps are more abundant.   Analytical results and simulations show that deploying traps and enhancing their lethality for mosquitoes can help reduce disease prevalence and the risk of an outbreak. However, the attenuation of odor in highly attractive traps may lead to a rebound in the epidemic, especially when the traps gradually lose their attractiveness compared to susceptible hosts.

Abstract:
The Vendi score (VS), a diversity metric recently conceived in the context of machine learning, with applications in a wide range of fields, has a few distinct advantages over the metrics commonly used in ecology. It is classification-independent, incorporates abundance information, and has a tunable sensitivity to rare/abundant types. Using rich COVID-19 sequence data as a paradigm, we develop methods for applying the VS to time-resolved sequence data. We show how the VS allows for characterization of the overall diversity of circulating viruses and for discernment of emerging variants prior to formal identification. Furthermore, applying the VS to phylogenetic trees provides a convenient overview of within-clade diversity which can aid viral variant detection.

Abstract:
We consider a phenotype-structured reaction-diffusion model of avascular glioma growth. The model describes the interaction dynamics between tumour cells and oxygen, and takes into account anisotropic cell movement and oxygen diffusion related to structural anisotropy of the brain's extracellular environment. In this model, phenotypic heterogeneity of tumour cells is captured by a continuous phenotype-structuring variable, the value of which evolves due to phenotypic changes. We first analyse a one-dimensional version of the model and formally show, through a Hopf-Cole transformation, that it admits, in appropriate asymptotic regimes, phenotypically heterogeneous travelling wave solutions, wherein the locally prevailing cell phenotype varies across the wave due to the presence of oxygen gradients. This provides a mathematical formalisation for the emergence of intratumour phenotypic heterogeneity driven by differences in oxygen availability across the tumour. We then report on the results of both 1D simulations, which corroborate the results of formal asymptotic analyses, and 2D simulations, which also demonstrate the impact of anisotropy in cell movement and oxygen diffusion on tumour growth and on the phenotypic composition of the tumour edge. These results are complemented with additional results of 3D simulations, which are carried out on the geometry of the brain by using a hybrid finite difference-finite element method and integrating patient-specific magnetic resonance imaging data with diffusion tensor imaging data.

Abstract:
Spatial structure can play an important role in the evolution of cooperative behavior and the achievement of collective success of a population. In this paper, we explore the role of random and directed motion on spatial pattern formation and the payoff achieved by populations in both stochastic and deterministic models of spatial populations who engage in social interactions following a hawk-dove game. For the case of purely diffusive motion, both a stochastic spatial model and a partial differential equation model show that Turing patterns can emerge when hawks have a greater movement rate than doves, and in both models hawks and doves see an increase in population size and average payoff as hawk mobility increases. For the case of the payoff-driven motion, the stochastic model shows an overall decrease in population size and average payoff, but the PDE model displays more subtle behavior in this setting and will depend on the relative diffusivities of the two strategies. The PDE model also displays a biologically infeasible short-wave instability in the case of payoff-driven motion and equal diffusivities, indicating that we need to be careful about the mathematical properties of PDE models with payoff-driven directed motion and indicating potential use for nonlocal PDE models for spatial patterns in evolutionary games with directed motion.

We solve this by treating multinomial updates as independent square-root diffusions of zero drift, yielding a closed-form law for the first-extinction time. We prove that the mean coincides exactly with the Wright-Fisher result of Baxter et al., thereby replacing exponential-cost evaluations with a linear-cost expression, and we validate this result through extensive simulations. Finally, we demonstrate predictive power for model collapse in a simple self-training setup: the onset of collapse coincides with the resampling-driven first-extinction time computed from the model's initial stationary distribution. These results hint to a unified view of resampling extinction dynamics.

Abstract:
Developmental trajectories are known to be canalized, or robust to both environmental and genetic perturbations. However, even when these trajectories are decanalized by an environmental perturbation outside of the range of conditions to which they are robust, they often produce phenotypes similar to known mutants called phenocopies. This correspondence between the effect of environmental and genetic perturbations has received little theoretical attention. Here, we study an abstract regulatory model which is evolved to follow a specific trajectory. We then study the effect of both small and large perturbations to the trajectory both by changing parameters and by perturbing the state in a timed manner. We find, surprisingly, that the phenomenon of phenocopying emerges in evolved trajectories even though the alternative trajectories are not selected for. Our results suggest that evolution simplifies the structure of high-dimensional phenotypic landscapes which can simultaneously show robustness and phenocopying.

Abstract:
Motivated by observations in sequence data of herpesviruses, we introduce a multi-locus model for the joint evolution of different genotypes in a virus population that is distributed across a population of hosts. In the model, virus particles replicate, recombine, and mutate within their hosts at rates that act on different time scales. Furthermore, virus particles are exchanged between hosts at reinfection events and hosts are replaced by primary infected hosts when they die. We determine the asymptotic type distribution observed in a single host in the limit of large host and virus populations under asymptotic rate assumptions by tracing back the ancestry of the sample. The proposed model may serve as a null model for the evolution of virus populations that are capable of persistence and can be used to estimate the strengths of different evolutionary forces driving genetic diversity, see also [4].

Abstract:
Biofilm infections on medical implants are difficult to eradicate because insufficient nutrient availability promotes antibiotic-tolerant persister cells that survive treatment and reseed growth. Existing mathematical models usually omit nutrient-dependent phenotypic switching between proliferative and persister states. Without this mechanism, models cannot capture how environmental conditions control the balance between active growth and dormancy, which is central to biofilm persistence. We present a continuum model that couples nutrient transport with the dynamics of proliferative bacteria, persisters, dead cells, and extracellular polymeric substances. The switching rates between proliferative and persister phenotypes depend on local nutrient concentration through two thresholds, enabling adaptation across nutrient-poor, intermediate, and nutrient-rich regimes. Simulations show that nutrient limitation produces a high and sustained proportion of persister cells even when biomass is reduced, whereas nutrient-rich conditions support reversion to proliferative growth and lead to greater biomass. The model also predicts that persister populations peak at times that vary with nutrient availability, and these peaks coincide with turning points in biofilm growth, identifying critical intervention windows. By directly linking nutrient availability to phenotypic switching, our model reveals mechanisms of biofilm persistence that earlier models could not capture, and it points toward strategies that target nutrient-driven adaptation as a means to improve the control of implant-associated infections.

Abstract:
Cooperation is fundamental to the functioning of biological and social systems in both human and animal populations, with the structure of interactions playing a crucial role. Previous studies have used networks to describe interactions and explore the evolution of cooperation, but with limited transposability to social settings due to biologically relevant assumptions. Exogenous processes -- that affect the individual and are not derived from social interactions -- even if unbiased, have a role in supporting cooperation over defection, and this role has been largely overlooked in the context of network-based interactions. Here, we show that selection can favor either cooperation or defection depending on the frequency of exogenous, even if neutral, processes in any population structure. Our framework allows for deriving analytically the conditions for favoring a specific behavior in any network structure strongly affected by non-social environments (frequent exogenous forcing, FEF), which contrasts with previous computationally prohibitive methods. Our results demonstrate that the requirements for favoring cooperation under FEF do not match those in the rare-mutation limit, establishing that underlying neutral processes can be considered a mechanism for cooperation. We reveal that, under FEF, populations are less cooperative, and network heterogeneity can provide an advantage only if targeting specific network properties, clarifying seemingly contradictory experimental results and evolutionary predictions. While focused on cooperation, our assumptions generalize to any decision-making process involving a choice between alternative options. Our framework is particularly applicable to non-homogeneous human populations, offering a new perspective on cooperation science in the context of cultural evolution, where neutral and biased processes within structured interactions are abundant.

Abstract:
Many biological populations exhibit diversity in their strategy for survival and reproduction in a given environment, and microbes are an example. We explore the fate of different strategies under sustained environmental change by considering a mathematical model for a large population of asexual organisms. Fitness is a bimodal function of a quantitative trait, with two local optima, separated by a local minimum, i.e., a mixture of stabilising and disruptive selection. The optima represent two locally `best' trait values. We consider regimes where, when the environment is unchanging, the equilibrium distribution of the trait is bimodal. A bimodal trait distribution generally requires, for its existence, mutational coupling between the two peaks, and it indicates two coexisting clones with distinct survival and reproduction strategies. When subject to persistent environmental change, the population adapts by utilising mutations that allow it to track the changing environment. The faster the rate of change of the environment, the larger the effect of the mutations that are utilised. Under persistent environmental change, the distribution of trait values takes two different forms. At low rates of change, the distribution remains bimodal. At higher rates, the distribution becomes unimodal. This loss of a clone/biodiversity is driven by a novel mechanism where environmental change decouples a class of mutations.

Abstract:
In response to increasing threats to biodiversity, conservation objectives have been set at national and international level, with the aim of halting biodiversity decline by reducing direct anthropogenic pressures on species. However, the potential effects of conservation policies derived from these objectives on common species remain rarely studied. Common species are often not the primary species targeted by conservation measures and can be distributed across a wide range of habitats that may be affected differently by these measures. We analyse the effect of a range of pressures related to climate, land use and land use intensity, on 263 common bird and 144 common butterfly species from more than 20,000 sites between 2000 and 2021 across 26 European countries. We use land-use and land-use-intensity change scenarios produced previously using the IPBES Nature Futures Framework to support the achievement of conservation objectives, as well as climate change scenarios in order to project the future of biodiversity pressures in Europe up to 2050. To project the future of common biodiversity in these scenarios, we translate these pressure changes into expected variations of abundances for all common bird and butterfly species, as well as for the multi-species indicators used to monitor common biodiversity status in Europe. The projected trends are improved, while still declining, for birds in particular farmland species under the scenarios that meet the conservation objectives, with few effects on butterflies. No scenario shows a stop or a reversal in the decline in abundance of bird and butterfly species that are currently common, on the time scale considered. Our results therefore call into question the fate of common biodiversity under the current conservation policies and the need for other anticipatory frameworks that do not implicitly require a growing need for natural resources.

Abstract:
To ensure faithful information transmission, cells utilize nonequilibrium drives to reduce errors. Kinetic proofreading is a classic mechanism known to sharpen ligand discrimination by T lymphocytes. It remains an open question whether the adaptive immune system relies solely on kinetic proofreading to boost fidelity. Here, we suggest an alternative: an enhanced form of mechanical proofreading (MPR) in which adaptive force exertion via dynamic cell-cell contact allows faithful selection of high-affinity B lymphocytes. Using a minimal model validated with experiment, we show that adaptive MPR, characterized by mechanical feedback between force generation and contact formation, enables robust discrimination of receptor quality regardless of ligand quantity. Although MPR generically balances the tradeoffs between speed and fidelity, a negative scaling of contact duration with ligand abundance indicates the presence of feedback. Due to its ability to modulate interactions of distinct ligands that share load at membrane contacts, adaptive MPR can be harnessed to mitigate autoimmunity or enhance multivalent vaccines. Overall, this work suggests a generalization of the proofreading mechanism to encompass cellular designs that act across scales to enable competing functionalities.

Abstract:
In this paper, we proposed new predator-prey models that take into account memory and kicks. Memory is understood as the dependence of current behavior on the history of past behavior. The equations of these proposed models are generalizations of the Lotka-Volterra and Kolmogorov equations by using the Caputo fractional derivative of non-integer order and periodic kicks. This fractional derivative allows us to take into account memory with power-law fading. The periodic kicks, which are described by Dirac delta-functions, take into account short duration of interaction between predators and prey. For the proposed equations, which are fractional differential equations with kicks, we obtain exact solutions that describe behaviors of predator and prey with power-law fading memory. Using these exact solutions, we derive, without using any approximations, new discrete maps with memory that represent the proposed predator-prey models with memory.

Abstract:
Urban ecosystems exhibit complex predator-prey dynamics increasingly disrupted by anthropogenic disturbances (e.g., noise, habitat fragmentation). Classical Lotka-Volterra (LV) models fail to capture these human-induced stressors, and integrated frameworks incorporating functional responses, stochasticity, and spatial dynamics remain scarce. We develop a comprehensive stochastic model to quantify how human disturbance reshapes predator-prey interactions in urban landscapes, using rat-cat systems as a case study. Our framework extends the LV model to incorporate: (i) human disturbance as an external mortality factor, (ii) Holling Type III functional responses to model predation saturation and prey refugia, (iii) multiplicative noise and periodic forcing to capture stochastic disturbance regimes, and (iv) spatial diffusion across fragmented habitats. We non-dimensionalize the system to generalize dynamics and analyze stability, bifurcations, and noise-induced transitions. Numerical simulations (MATLAB) reveal three key outcomes: (1) Human disturbance disrupts classical oscillations, inducing quasi-periodic cycles and elevating extinction risks; (2) Stochasticity lowers collapse thresholds by 25% compared to deterministic predictions; (3) Spatial diffusion drives pattern formation (e.g., disturbance shadows, prey hotspots) through habitat coupling. Results highlight the extreme vulnerability of urban wildlife to anthropogenic pressures, demonstrating how disturbance intensity governs system stability. The model provides a predictive framework for conservation strategies, emphasizing refuge enhancement and phased interventions synchronized with population cycles.

Abstract:
Navigation through narrow passages during colony relocation by the tandem-running ants, $\textit{Diacamma}$ $\textit{indicum}$, is a tour de force of biological traffic coordination. Even on one-lane paths, the ants tactfully manage a bidirectional flow: Informed individuals (termed leaders) guide nest-mates (termed followers) from a suboptimal nest to a new optimal nest, and then return to recruit additional followers. We propose that encounters between the ants moving in opposite directions can be modelled within the framework of game theory leading to an understanding of the mechanism behind observed behaviours. Our experiments reveal that, upon encountering a tandem pair (a leader and its follower) on a narrow path, the returning leader reverses her direction and proceeds toward the new nest again as if she becomes the leader guiding a follower. This observed behaviour is consistent with game-theoretic predictions, provided the assumption of perfect rationality is relaxed in favour of bounded rationality -- specifically, procedural rationality. In other words, the experimental outcomes are consistent with sampling equilibrium but not with Nash equilibrium. Our work, which strives to induct the essence of behavioural game theory into the world of ants, is first ever report of realizing sampling equilibrium in scenarios not involving human players.

Abstract:
Antibiotic resistance presents a growing global health threat by diminishing the effectiveness of treatments and allowing once-manageable bacterial infections to persist. This study develops and analyzes an optimization-based mathematical model to investigate the impact of varying antibiotic dosages on bacterial resistance, incorporating the role of the immune system. Additionally, to capture the effects of over and underdosing, a floor function is newly introduced into the model as a switch function. The model is examined both analytically and numerically. As part of the analytical solution, the validity of the model through the existence and uniqueness theorem, stability at the equilibrium points, and characteristics of equilibrium points in relation to state variables have been investigated. Numerical simulations, performed using the Runge Kutta 4th order method, reveal that while antibiotics effectively reduce sensitive bacteria, they simultaneously increase resistant strains and suppress immune cell levels. The results also demonstrate that underdosing antibiotics increases the risk of resistance through bacterial mutation, while overdosing weakens the immune system by disrupting beneficial microbes. These findings emphasize that improper dosing whether below or above the prescribed level can accelerate the development of antibiotic resistance, underscoring the need for carefully regulated treatment strategies that preserve both antimicrobial effectiveness and immune system integrity.

Abstract:
Recently, a new vector encoding, Ordered Leaf Attachment (OLA), was introduced that represents $n$-leaf phylogenetic trees as $n-1$ length integer vectors by recording the placement location of each leaf. Both encoding and decoding of trees run in linear time and depend on a fixed ordering of the leaves. Here, we investigate the connection between OLA vectors and the maximum acyclic agreement forest (MAAF) problem. A MAAF represents an optimal breakdown of $k$ trees into reticulation-free subtrees, with the roots of these subtrees representing reticulation events. We introduce a corrected OLA distance index over OLA vectors of $k$ trees, which is easily computable in linear time. We prove that the corrected OLA distance corresponds to the size of a MAAF, given an optimal leaf ordering that minimizes that distance. Additionally, a MAAF can be easily reconstructed from optimal OLA vectors. We expand these results to multifurcated trees: we introduce an $O(kn \cdot m\log m)$ algorithm that optimally resolves a set of multifurcated trees given a leaf-ordering, where $m$ is the size of a largest multifurcation, and show that trees resolved via this algorithm also minimize the size of a MAAF. These results suggest a new approach to fast computation of phylogenetic networks and identification of reticulation events via random permutations of leaves. Additionally, in the case of microbial evolution, a natural ordering of leaves is often given by the sample collection date, which means that under mild assumptions, reticulation events can be identified in polynomial time on such datasets.

Abstract:
We show that a simple mechanistic model of spatial dispersal for settling organisms, subject to parameter variability, can generate heavy-tailed radial probability density functions. The movement of organisms in the model consists of a two-dimensional diffusion that ceases after a random time, where the parameters that characterize each of these stages have been randomized. Our findings show that these minimal assumptions can yield heavy-tailed dispersal patterns, providing a simplified framework that increases the understanding of long-distance dispersal events in movement ecology.

Comment: A single index to accurately measure functional diversity at different biological levels

Abstract:
Despite the critical role of functional diversity (FD) in understanding ecological systems and processes, its robust quantification remains a significant challenge. A long-held view in the field is that it is not possible to capture its three facets -- functional richness, functional divergence, and functional evenness -- in a single index. This perspective has prompted recent proposals for FD measurement to use three separate indices, one for each aspect. Here, we challenge this paradigm by demonstrating that the probability-weighted Vendi Score (pVS), first introduced by Friedman and Dieng (2023), can serve as a powerful functional diversity index that can capture its three facets. We adapt pVS to functional ecology by defining it as the exponential of the Rényi entropy of the eigenvalues of the abundance-weighted trait similarity matrix. This formulation allows pVS to be applicable at any biological level. It can be defined at the species level, at which most existing FD metrics are defined, and at the individual level to naturally incorporate intraspecific trait variation (ITV) when detailed data are available. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate the robustness of pVS. We first mathematically prove it satisfies several essential desiderata for FD metrics, including invariance to functional redundancy, set monotonicity, distance monotonicity, and concavity. We then show that pVS consistently exhibits the expected ground-truth behavior on simulated ecosystem scenarios under which many FD metrics fail. By integrating abundances and trait similarities within a single, theoretically sound framework, pVS provides a generally applicable index for ecology.

Abstract:
The evolutionary biology of aging is fundamental to understanding the mechanisms of aging and how to develop anti-aging treatments. Thus far most evolutionary theory concerns the genetics of aging with limited physiological integration. Here we present an intuitive evolutionary framework built on how physiology is regulated and how this regulation itself is then predicted to age. Life has evolved to secure reproduction and avoid system failure in early life, and it is the physiological regulation that evolves in response to those early life selection pressures that leads to the emergence of aging. Importantly, asymmetrical regulation of physiology will evolve as the Darwinian fitness costs of loss of regulation will not be symmetrical. When asymmetrical regulatory systems break during aging, they cause physiological function to drift towards the physiological range where costs of dysregulation are lowest, rendering aging directional. Our model explains many puzzling aspects of the biology of aging. These include why aging appears (but is not) programmed, why aging is gradual yet heterogeneous, why cellular and hormonal signaling are closely related to aging, the compensation law of mortality, why trade-offs between reproduction and aging remain elusive, why longer-lived organisms show more signs of aging during their natural lifespans, and why longer-lived organisms can be less responsive to treatments of aging that work well in short-lived organisms. We provide predictions of our theory that are empirically testable. By incorporating physiological regulation into evolutionary models of aging, we provide a novel perspective to guide empirical research in this still growing field.

Abstract:
Plants come with sophisticated strategies to survive within a highly competing environment. In addition, they need to resist frequent attacks from a variety of herbivores acting alone, in small groups, or in swarms. Since the amount of energy a plant might invest in defense and reproduction is limited, a complex optimization problem emerges. In a shared habitat, plants fight herbivores by shape and camouflage, by the release of specific toxins, or by attracting predators of herbivores. Furthermore, plants alert their surrounding field by signaling substances in the event of an assault. Transported by air or through a network of roots, signaling substances reach neighbors to trigger their defense. The offsprings of a plant commonly grow within a certain distance to benefit from symbiotic protection. We introduce a grid-based visual simulation software for detailed configuration and subsequent processing of the behavior of the resulting system in time and space. In terms of solution to a computational optimization problem inspired by nature, settings with low energy need and long life able to cope with different patterns of attack can be figured out and analyzed. Applications include novel techniques for efficient construction and secure operation of sensor networks.

Abstract:
Reconciling increasing food production with biodiversity conservation is critical yet challenging, particularly given global declines in beneficial insects driven by monoculture intensification. Intercropping, the simultaneous or sequential cultivation of multiple crops, has been proposed as a viable strategy to enhance beneficial insect services and suppress pests, yet global evidence regarding optimal spatiotemporal intercropping configurations remains fragmented. Here, we synthesize results from 7,584 field experiments spanning six continents and 22 Koppen climate regions, evaluating effects of spatial (row, strip, mixed, agroforestry) and temporal (additive, replacement, relay) intercropping configuations on beneficial insect (predators, parasitoids, pollinators) abundance and pest suppression using the Management Efficiency Ratio (MER; log ratio of abundance in intercropping versus monoculture). Relay intercropping, characterized by temporally staggered planting, emerged as the universally optimal temporal configuration, substantially increasing predator (MER = 0.473) and parasitoid populations (MER = 0.512) and effectively suppressing pests (MER = -0.611) globally. At regional scales, identical spatiotemporal configurations simultaneously optimized beneficial insect predator abundance and pest suppression in 57% of regions, while other regions required distinct, insect-specific approaches. Our findings highlight relay intercropping as a globally generalizable solution, but underscore regional variation that calls for targeted policies to simultaneously secure food production and biodiversity conservation.

Abstract:
Infectious pathogens often propagate by superspreading, which focusses onward transmission on disproportionately few infected individuals. At the same time, infector-infectee pairs tend to have more similar transmission potentials than expected by chance, as risk factors assort among individuals who frequently interact. A key problem for infectious disease epidemiology, and in the dynamics of complex systems, is to understand how structured variation in individual transmission will scale to impact epidemic dynamics. Here we introduce a framework that reveals how population structure shapes epidemic thresholds, through autocorrelation of individual reproductive numbers along chains of transmission. We show that chains of superspreading can sustain epidemics even when the average transmission rate in the host population is below one, and derive a mathematical threshold beyond which correlated superspreading allows epidemics in otherwise subcritical systems. Empirical analysis of 47 transmission trees for 13 human pathogens indicate self-organizing bursts of superspreading are common and that many trees are near the critical boundary. Vaccination campaigns that proceed up assortative hierarchies of transmission are predicted to sustain the force of infection until herd immunity is reached, providing a mechanistic basis for threshold dynamics observed in real-world settings. Conversely, modulating correlations in transmission, rather than mean or variance, could enable cities and other complex systems to develop immune-like capacities that suppress contagion while preserving core functions.

Abstract:
This study compares the predictive capacity of the Dynamic Habitat Index (DHI) - a remote sensing (RS)-based measure of habitat productivity and variability - against traditional land-use/land-cover (LULC) metrics in species distribution modelling (SDM) applications. RS and LULC-based SDMs were built using distribution data for eleven bird, amphibian, and mammal species in Île-de-France. Predictor variables were derived from Sentinel-2 RS data and LULC classifications, with the latter incorporating Euclidean distance to habitat types. Ensemble SDMs were built using nine algorithms and evaluated with the Continuous Boyce Index (CBI) and a calibrated AUC. Habitat suitability scores and their binary transformations were assessed using niche overlap indices (Schoener, Warren, and Spearman rank correlation coefficient). Both RS and LULC approaches exhibited similar predictive accuracy overall. After binarisation however, the resulting niche maps diverged significantly. While LULC-based models exhibited spatial constraints (habitat suitability decreased as distance from recorded occurrences increased), RS-based models, which used continuous data, were not affected by geographic bias or distance effects. These results underscore the need to account for spatial biases in LULC-based SDMs. The DHI may offer a more spatially neutral alternative, making it a promising predictor for modelling species niches at regional scales.

Abstract:
From genomes and ecosystems to bureaucracies and cities, the growth of complex systems occurs by adding new types of functions and expanding existing ones. We present a simple generative model that generalizes the Yule-Simon process by including: (i) a size-dependent probability of introducing new functions, and (ii) a generalized preferential attachment mechanism for expanding existing ones. We uncover a shared underlying structure that helps explain how function diversity evolves in empirical observations, such as prokaryotic proteomes, U.S. federal agencies, and urban economies. We show that real systems are often best represented as having non-Zipfian rank-frequency distributions, driven by sublinear preferential attachment, whilst still maintaining power-law scaling in their abundance distributions. Furthermore, our analytics explain five distinct phases of the organization of functional elements across complex systems. The model integrates empirical findings regarding the logarithmic growth of diversity in cities and the self-similarity of their rank-frequency distributions. Self-similarity previously observed in the rank-frequency distributions of cities is not observed in cells and federal agencies -- however, under a rescaling relative to the total diversity, all systems admit self-similar structures predicted by our theory.

Abstract:
UK woodlands, forests, and urban treescapes are under threat from invasive species, exacerbated by climate change, trade, and transport. Invasive tree pests debilitate their host and disrupt forest ecosystems, thus it is imperative to quantitatively model and predict their spread. Addressing this, we model the spread of an invasive pest using a spatiotemporal reaction-diffusion equation, representing the spatial distribution as a population density field. We solve this intractable equation numerically and, from the solution, we determine first arrival times of the pest at locations in the field. The adopted model permits us to obtain the expansion rate of pest spread directly from the model parameters, which we infer in the Bayesian paradigm, using a Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme. We apply our framework to the ongoing spread of oak processionary moth in the UK, an outbreak which continues to grow despite management efforts. We demonstrate that our approach effectively captures the spread of the pest and that this has occurred at a non-constant expansion rate. The proposed framework is a powerful tool for quantitatively modelling the spread of an invasive tree pest and could underpin future prediction and management approaches.

Abstract:
Chest X-rays (CXRs) are the most commonly performed imaging investigation. In the UK, many centres experience reporting delays due to radiologist workforce shortages. Artificial intelligence (AI) tools capable of distinguishing normal from abnormal CXRs have emerged as a potential solution. If normal CXRs could be safely identified and reported without human input, a substantial portion of radiology workload could be reduced.   This article examines the feasibility and implications of autonomous AI reporting of normal CXRs. Key issues include defining normal, ensuring generalisability across populations, and managing the sensitivity-specificity trade-off. It also addresses legal and regulatory challenges, such as compliance with IR(ME)R and GDPR, and the lack accountability frameworks for errors. Further considerations include the impact on radiologists practice, the need for robust post-market surveillance, and incorporation of patient perspectives. While the benefits are clear, adoption must be cautious.

Abstract:
We propose a new dynamic SIR model that, in contrast with the available model on time scales, is biological relevant. For the new SIR model we obtain an explicit solution, we prove the asymptotic stability of the extinction and disease-free equilibria, and deduce some necessary conditions for the monotonic behavior of the infected population. The new results are illustrated with several examples in the discrete, continuous, and quantum settings.

Abstract:
Epidemic control frequently relies on adjusting interventions based on prevalence. But designing such policies is a highly non-trivial problem due to uncertain intervention effects, costs and the difficulty of quantifying key transmission mechanisms and parameters. Here, using exact mathematical and computational methods, we reveal a fundamental limit in epidemic control in that prevalence feedback policies are outperformed by a single optimally chosen constant control level. Specifically, we find no incentive to use prevalence based control under a wide class of cost functions that depend arbitrarily on interventions and scale with infections. We also identify regimes where prevalence feedback is beneficial. Our results challenge the current understanding that prevalence based interventions are required for epidemic control and suggest that, for many classes of epidemics, interventions should not be varied unless the epidemic is near the herd immunity threshold.

Abstract:
How regional heterogeneity in social and cultural processes drive--and respond to--climate dynamics is little studied. Here we present a coupled social-climate model stratified across five world regions and parameterized with geophysical, economic and social survey data. We find that support for mitigation evolves in a highly variable fashion across regions, according to socio-economics, climate vulnerability, and feedback from changing temperatures. Social learning and social norms can amplify existing sentiment about mitigation, leading to better or worse global warming outcomes depending on the region. Moreover, mitigation in one region, as mediated by temperature dynamics, can influence other regions to act, or just sit back, thus driving cross-regional heterogeneity in mitigation opinions. The peak temperature anomaly varies by several degrees Celsius depending on how these interactions unfold. Our model exemplifies a framework for studying how global geophysical processes interact with population-scale concerns to determine future sustainability outcomes.

Abstract:
Tumor-immune interactions are shaped by both antigenic heterogeneity and stochastic perturbations in the tumor microenvironment, yet the mathematical mechanisms underlying immune phase transitions remain poorly understood. We propose a four-compartment dynamical model that incorporates antigen accumulation and immune escape mutations. Bifurcation analysis reveals bistability between immune surveillance and immune escape states, providing a mechanistic explanation for heterogeneous immune outcomes during tumor progression. In the multistable regime, the stable manifold of a saddle point partitions the state space into distinct basins of attraction, determining the long-term fate of the system. We further analyze how stochastic fluctuations in the tumor microenvironment perturb these separatrices, potentially triggering irreversible state transitions. By characterizing the critical noise intensity and estimating the tipping time, we establish a mathematical framework for assessing noise-induced transitions. The model further predicts that increasing tumor cell death can improve system resilience to stochastic perturbations, whereas stronger immune pressure may facilitate immune escape-highlighting the nonlinear and non-monotonic nature of tumor-immune dynamics.

Abstract:
A central question in evolutionary biology is how to quantitatively understand the dynamics of genetically diverse populations. Modeling the genotype distribution is challenging, as it ultimately requires tracking all correlations (or cumulants) among alleles at different loci. The quasi-linkage equilibrium (QLE) approximation simplifies this by assuming that correlations between alleles at different loci are weak -- i.e., low linkage disequilibrium -- allowing their dynamics to be modeled perturbatively. However, QLE breaks down under strong selection, significant epistatic interactions, or weak recombination. We extend the multilocus QLE framework to allow cumulants up to order $K$ to evolve dynamically, while higher-order cumulants ($>K$) are assumed to equilibrate rapidly. This extended QLE (exQLE) framework yields a general equation of motion for cumulants up to order $K$, which parallels the standard QLE dynamics (recovered when $K = 1$). In this formulation, cumulant dynamics are driven by the gradient of average fitness, mediated by a geometrically interpretable matrix that stems from competition among genotypes. Our analysis shows that the exQLE with $K=2$ accurately captures cumulant dynamics even when the fitness function includes higher-order (e.g., third- or fourth-order) epistatic interactions, capabilities that standard QLE lacks. We also applied the exQLE framework to infer fitness parameters from temporal sequence data. Overall, exQLE provides a systematic and interpretable approximation scheme, leveraging analytical cumulant dynamics and reducing complexity by progressively truncating higher-order cumulants.

Abstract:
Human social life is shaped by repeated interactions, where past experiences guide future behavior. In evolutionary game theory, a key challenge is to identify strategies that harness such memory to succeed in repeated encounters. Decades of research have identified influential one-step memory strategies (such as Tit-for-Tat, Generous Tit-for-Tat, and Win-Stay Lose-Shift) that promote cooperation in iterated pairwise games. However, these strategies occupy only a small corner of the vast strategy space, and performance in isolated pairwise contests does not guarantee evolutionary success. The most effective strategies are those that can spread through a population and stabilize cooperation. We propose a general framework for repeated-interaction strategies that encompasses arbitrary memory lengths, diverse informational inputs (including both one's own and the opponent's past actions), and deterministic or stochastic decision rules. We analyze their evolutionary dynamics and derive general mathematical results for the emergence of cooperation in any network structure. We then introduce a unifying indicator that quantifies the contribution of repeated-interaction strategies to population-level cooperation. Applying this indicator, we show that long-memory strategies evolve to promote cooperation more effectively than short-memory strategies, challenging the traditional view that extended memory offers no advantage. This work expands the study of repeated interactions beyond one-step memory strategies to the full spectrum of memory capacities. It provides a plausible explanation for the high levels of cooperation observed in human societies, which traditional one-step memory models cannot account for.

Abstract:
Dengue, a mosquito-borne viral disease common in tropical areas, is spread by Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. Temperature changes driven by climate affect vector ecology and expand regions of species coexistence. The combined effect of temperature and larval competition on mosquito dynamics and dengue transmission is unclear. We built a deterministic model with temperature-dependent parameters to study larval-stage interactions, linked with a SEIR framework for human infection. We assessed invasion potential, coexistence, and infection peaks. The basic reproduction number (R0) was calculated using the Next Generation Matrix, and the effective reproduction number (Rt) came from simulations with larval competition. Aedes albopictus invades aegypti-dominated systems when the aegypti competition coefficient is below 0.47, with neutral equilibrium from 0.47 to 0.60 and exclusion above 0.60 in stable conditions. In temperature-dependent settings, invasion extends to a coefficient of 0.75. Coexistence analysis showed aegypti dominance (~87% abundance) in stable settings, while temperature-dependent conditions led to ~50% abundance for both species. Dengue cases peaked at 156-168 in stable conditions and 195-220 in temperature-dependent ones. Stronger albopictus competition lowered peaks in both cases. Temperature boosts albopictus invasion and coexistence, while aegypti drives higher infection peaks. Balanced species abundances raise transmission risks, emphasizing the need to factor temperature and competition into vector control.

Abstract:
While monitoring biodiversity through camera traps has become an important endeavor for ecological research, identifying species in the captured image data remains a major bottleneck due to limited labeling resources. Active learning -- a machine learning paradigm that selects the most informative data to label and train a predictive model -- offers a promising solution, but typically focuses on uncertainty in the individual predictions without considering uncertainty across the entire dataset. We introduce a new active learning policy, Vendi information gain (VIG), that selects images based on their impact on dataset-wide prediction uncertainty, capturing both informativeness and diversity. We applied VIG to the Snapshot Serengeti dataset and compared it against common active learning methods. VIG needs only 3% of the available data to reach 75% accuracy, a level that baselines require more than 10% of the data to achieve. With 10% of the data, VIG attains 88% predictive accuracy, 12% higher than the best of the baselines. This improvement in performance is consistent across metrics and batch sizes, and we show that VIG also collects more diverse data in the feature space. VIG has broad applicability beyond ecology, and our results highlight its value for biodiversity monitoring in data-limited environments.

Abstract:
This paper investigates a behavioral-feedback SIR model in which the infection rate adapts dynamically based on the fractions of susceptible and infected individuals. We introduce an invariant of motion and we characterize the peak of infection. We further examine the system under a threshold constraint on the infection level. Based on this analysis, we formulate an optimal control problem to keep the infection curve below a healthcare capacity threshold while minimizing the economic cost. For this problem, we study a feasible strategy that involves applying the minimal necessary restrictions to meet the capacity constraint and characterize the corresponding cost.

Abstract:
We develop a framework for non-Markovian SIR and SIS models beyond mean field, utilizing the continuous-time random walk formalism. Using a gamma distribution for the infection and recovery inter-event times as a test case, we derive asymptotical late-time master equations with effective memory kernels and obtain analytical predictions for the final outbreak size distribution in the SIR model, and quasistationary distribution and disease lifetime in the SIS model. We show that increasing memory can greatly widen the outbreak size distribution and reduce the disease lifetime. We also show that rescaled Markovian models fail to capture fluctuations in the non-Markovian case. Overall, our findings, confirmed against numerical simulations, demonstrate that memory strongly shapes epidemic dynamics and paves the way for extending such analyses to structured populations.

Abstract:
Co-occurrence network inference algorithms have significantly advanced our understanding of microbiome communities. However, these algorithms typically analyze microbial associations within samples collected from a single environmental niche, often capturing only static snapshots rather than dynamic microbial processes. Previous studies have commonly grouped samples from different environmental niches together without fully considering how microbial communities adapt their associations when faced with varying ecological conditions. Our study addresses this limitation by explicitly investigating both spatial and temporal dynamics of microbial communities. We analyzed publicly available microbiome abundance data across multiple locations and time points, to evaluate algorithm performance in predicting microbial associations using our proposed Same-All Cross-validation (SAC) framework. SAC evaluates algorithms in two distinct scenarios: training and testing within the same environmental niche (Same), and training and testing on combined data from multiple environmental niches (All). To overcome the limitations of conventional algorithms, we propose fuser, an algorithm that, while not entirely new in machine learning, is novel for microbiome community network inference. It retains subsample-specific signals while simultaneously sharing relevant information across environments during training. Unlike standard approaches that infer a single generalized network from combined data, fuser generates distinct, environment-specific predictive networks. Our results demonstrate that fuser achieves comparable predictive performance to existing algorithms such as glmnet when evaluated within homogeneous environments (Same), and notably reduces test error compared to baseline algorithms in cross-environment (All) scenarios.

Abstract:
Indirect reciprocity promotes cooperation by allowing individuals to help others based on reputation rather than direct reciprocation. Because it relies on accurate reputation information, its effectiveness can be undermined by information gaps. We examine two forms of incomplete information: incomplete observation, in which donor actions are observed only probabilistically, and reputation fading, in which recipient reputations are sometimes classified as "Unknown". Using analytical frameworks for public assessment, we show that these seemingly similar models yield qualitatively different outcomes. Under incomplete observation, the conditions for cooperation are unchanged, because less frequent updates are exactly offset by higher reputational stakes. In contrast, reputation fading hinders cooperation, requiring higher benefit-to-cost ratios as the identification probability decreases. We then evaluate costly punishment as a third action alongside cooperation and defection. Norms incorporating punishment can sustain cooperation across broader parameter ranges without reducing efficiency in the reputation fading model. This contrasts with previous work, which found punishment ineffective under a different type of information limitation, and highlights the importance of distinguishing between types of information constraints. Finally, we review past studies to identify when punishment is effective and when it is not in indirect reciprocity.

Abstract:
The evolutionary origins of ageing and age-associated diseases continue to pose a fundamental question in biology. This study is concerned with a recently proposed framework, which conceptualises development and ageing as a continuous process, driven by genetically encoded epigenetic changes in target sets of cells. According to the Evolvable Soma Theory of Ageing (ESTA), ageing reflects the cumulative manifestation of epigenetic changes that are predominantly expressed during the post-reproductive phase. These late-acting modifications are not yet evolutionarily optimised but are instead subject to ongoing selection, functioning as somatic "experiments" through which evolution explores novel phenotypic variation. These experiments are often detrimental, leading to progressive physical decline and eventual death, while a small subset may produce beneficial adaptations, that evolution can exploit to shape future developmental trajectories. According to ESTA, ageing can be understood as evolution in action, yet old age is also the strongest risk factor for major diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and metabolic syndrome. We argue that this association is not merely correlational but causal: the same epigenetic process that drive development and ageing also underlie age-associated diseases. Growing evidence points to epigenetic regulation as a central factor in these pathologies, since no consistent patterns of genetic mutations have been identified, whereas widespread regulatory and epigenetic disruptions are observed. From this perspective, evolution is not only the driver of ageing but also the ultimate source of the diseases that accompany it, making it the root cause of most age-related pathologies.

Abstract:
Timely and robust influenza incidence forecasting is critical for public health decision-making. This paper presents MAESTRO (Multi-modal Adaptive Estimation for Temporal Respiratory Disease Outbreak), a novel, unified framework that synergistically integrates advanced spectro-temporal modeling with multi-modal data fusion, including surveillance, web search trends, and meteorological data. By adaptively weighting heterogeneous data sources and decomposing complex time series patterns, the model achieves robust and accurate forecasts. Evaluated on over 11 years of Hong Kong influenza data (excluding the COVID-19 period), MAESTRO demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, achieving a superior model fit with an R-square of 0.956. Extensive ablations confirm the significant contributions of its multi-modal and spectro-temporal components. The modular and reproducible pipeline is made publicly available to facilitate deployment and extension to other regions and pathogens, presenting a powerful tool for epidemiological forecasting.

Abstract:
On May 15, 2025, Brazil reported its first highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) outbreak in a commercial poultry breeder farm in Montenegro, Rio Grande do Sul. This study presents the outbreak timeline, control measures, along with spatial risk assessment and epidemiological model used to simulate detection delays. The transmission model considered Susceptible Exposed Infected Recovered Dead farm statuses to simulate within farm and between farm dynamics under 3 day, 5 day, and 10 day detection delays. The single infected commercial farm lost 15,650 birds, with 92% mortality due to HPAI, and additional culling of the remaining birds on Day 5 post-notification to the state animal health officials. Based on the mortality and outbreak response data, the introduction likely occurred 3 10 days before its official detection. Our field investigations suggested that wild birds were the most likely source of introduction, although biosecurity breaches could not be ruled out. Control measures implemented included movement restrictions and a control zone, from which 4,197 vehicles were inspected upon entry. Risk analysis classified 64.4% of municipalities as low risk, 35.0% as medium risk, and 0.6% as high risk. Our HPAI disease simulation results showed that the number of secondary infections would increase from a median of 4 farms (IQR 2 5) with a 3 day delay to 6 (IQR 3 22) and 34 (IQR 12 47) farms with 5 day and 10 day delays, respectively. The rapid veterinary response eliminated the outbreak within 32 days of detection, highlighting the critical role of early detection and prompt response.

Abstract:
We identify a novel scenario for hyperuniformity in a generic model of population dynamics that has been recently introduced to account for biological memory in the immune system and epigenetic inheritance. In this model, individuals' competition over a shared resource guides the population towards a critical steady state with prolonged individual life time. Here we uncover that the spatially extended model is characterized by hyperuniform density fluctuations. A hydrodynamic theory is derived by explicit coarse-graining, which shows good agreement with numerical simulations. Unlike previous models for non-equilibrium hyperuniform states, our model does not exhibit conservation laws, even when approaching criticality. Instead, we trace the emergence of hyperuniformity to the divergence of timescales close to criticality. These findings can have applications in engineering, cellular population dynamics and ecology.

Abstract:
Vaccination against the SARS-CoV-2 disease has significantly reduced its mortality rate and spread. However, despite its availability, a considerable proportion of the public has either refused or delayed getting vaccinated. This reluctance is known as vaccine hesitancy. The aim of this paper is to present a mathematical model to investigate how social interaction can impact vaccine hesitancy. The model describes the temporal transitions between different vaccination classes of the population (those vaccinated, those who are not yet vaccinated but agree to be vaccinated, and those who refuse). We apply the model to state and national survey data from the USA to estimate model parameters that quantify the rates at which public opinion on vaccination changes. Moreover, we investigate how political trends and demographic factors, such as age and education, impact these parameters. Our results show that state-level political affiliation, age, and educational level shape opinions on vaccination and have a strong influence on the temporal dynamics of attitude changes.

Abstract:
Indirect reciprocity is a key mechanism for large-scale cooperation. This mechanism captures the insight that in part, people help others to build and maintain a good reputation. To enable such cooperation, appropriate social norms are essential. They specify how individuals should act based on each others' reputations, and how reputations are updated in response to individual actions. Although previous work has identified several norms that sustain cooperation, a complete analytical characterization of all evolutionarily stable norms remains lacking, especially when assessments or actions are noisy. In this study, we provide such a characterization for the public assessment regime. This characterization reproduces known results, such as the leading eight norms, but it extends to more general cases, allowing for various types of errors and additional actions including costly punishment. We also identify norms that impose a fixed payoff on any mutant strategy, analogous to the zero-determinant strategies in direct reciprocity. These results offer a rigorous foundation for understanding the evolution of cooperation through indirect reciprocity and the critical role of social norms.

Abstract:
Mutualistic interactions, where individuals from different species can benefit from each other, are widespread across ecosystems. This study develops a general deterministic model of mutualism involving two populations, assuming that mutualism may involve both costs and benefits for the interacting individuals, leading to density-dependent effects on the dynamics of the two species. This framework aims at generalizing pre-existing models, by allowing the ecological interactions to transition from mutualistic to parasitic when the respective densities of interacting species change. Through ordinary differential equations and phase portrait analysis, we derive general principles governing these systems, identifying sufficient conditions for the emergence of certain dynamic behaviors. In particular, we show that limit cycles can arise when interactions include parasitic phases but are absent in strictly mutualistic regimes. This framework provides a general approach for characterizing the population dynamics of interacting species and highlights the effect of the transitions from mutualism to parasitism due to density dependence.

Abstract:
The sterile insect technique has emerged recently as a biologically secure and effective tool for suppressing wild mosquito pests. To improve the performance of this strategy, understanding the interaction between wild and sterile mosquitoes is critical. Although the common models for this biological problem are scalar equations, they are remarkably resistant to the mathematical analysis. In a series of papers, Dueñas, Nuñez, and Obaya have developed a powerful approach to describe the dynamical behavior of scalar equations with d-concave nonlinearities, a property typically related to the sign of the third derivative. In this paper, we show that, for periodic equations coming from population dynamics, this condition is typically associated with the positive sign of the third derivative of the inverse of the Poincaré map. This remark allows us to simplify some arguments in the periodic case and obtain a deep geometrical understanding of the global bifurcation patterns. Consequently, the dynamical behavior of the models is analyzed in terms of simple and testable conditions. Our methodology allows us to describe precisely the dynamical behavior of the common mosquito population suppression models, even incorporating seasonality. This paper generalizes and improves many recent results in the literature.

Abstract:
Calibrating agent-based epidemic models is computationally demanding. We present a supervised machine learning calibrator that learns the inverse mapping from epidemic time series to SIR parameters. A three-layer bidirectional LSTM ingests 60-day incidence together with population size and recovery rate, and outputs transmission probability, contact rate, and R0. Training uses a composite loss with an epidemiology-motivated consistency penalty that encourages R0 \* recovery rate to equal transmission probability \* contact rate.   In a 1000-scenario simulation study, we compare the calibrator with Approximate Bayesian Computation (likelihood-free MCMC). The method achieves lower error across all targets (MAE: R0 0.0616 vs 0.275; transmission 0.0715 vs 0.128; contact 1.02 vs 4.24), produces tighter predictive intervals with near nominal coverage, and reduces wall clock time from 77.4 s to 2.35 s per calibration. Although contact rate and transmission probability are partially nonidentifiable, the approach reproduces epidemic curves more faithfully than ABC, enabling fast and practical calibration. We evaluate it on SIR agent based epidemics generated with epiworldR and provide an implementation in R.

Abstract:
We propose a multi-patch model of cholera transmission integrating environmental contamination, human mobility, and nutritional vulnerability. The population is stratified by food security status, and transmission occurs via human contact, bacteria in the environment and contaminated food. We derive the basic reproduction number $\mathcal{R}_0$ analyze the stability of the disease-free equilibria and show a forward bifurcation. Numerical simulations illustrate how food insecurity amplifies outbreak severity and mortality. The model highlights the role of spatial heterogeneity and socio-environmental factors in shaping cholera dynamics. Moreover, results show the impact of sinks inside starting epidemic.

Abstract:
This work introduces a physics-informed neural networks (PINNs)-based model predictive control (MPC) framework for susceptible-infected-recovered ($SIR$) spreading models. Existing studies in MPC design for epidemic control often assume either 1) measurable states of the dynamics, where the parameters are learned, or 2) known parameters of the model, where the states are learned. In this work, we address the joint real-time estimation of states and parameters within the MPC framework using only noisy infected states, under the assumption that 1) only the recovery rate is known, or 2) only the basic reproduction number is known. Under the first assumption, we propose MPC-PINNs and two novel PINNs algorithms, all of which are integrated into the MPC framework. First, we introduce MPC-PINNs, which are designed for $SIR$ models with control. We then propose log-scaled PINNs (MPC-LS-PINNs), which incorporate a log-scaled loss function to improve robustness against noise. Next, we present split-integral PINNs (MPC-SI-PINNs), which leverage integral operators and state coupling in the neural network training process to effectively reconstruct the complete epidemic state information. Building upon these methods, we further extend our framework for the second assumption. We establish the necessary conditions and extend our PINNs algorithms, where MPC-SI-PINNs are simplified as split-PINNs (MPC-S-PINNs). By incorporating these algorithms into the MPC framework, we simultaneously estimate the epidemic states and parameters while generating optimal control strategies. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods under different settings.

Abstract:
During the COVID-19 pandemic, estimating the total deaths averted by vaccination has been of great public health interest. Instead of estimating total deaths averted by vaccination among both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, some studies empirically estimated only "directly averted" deaths among vaccinated individuals, typically suggesting that vaccines prevented more deaths overall than directly due to the indirect effect. Here, we define the causal estimand to quantify outcomes "directly averted" by vaccination$\unicode{x2014}$i.e., the impact of vaccination for vaccinated individuals, holding vaccination coverage fixed$\unicode{x2014}$for vaccination at multiple time points, and show that this estimand is a lower bound on the total outcomes averted when the indirect effect is non-negative. We develop an unbiased estimator for the causal estimand in a one-stage randomized controlled trial (RCT) and explore the bias of a popular "hazard difference" estimator frequently used in empirical studies. We show that even in an RCT, the hazard difference estimator is biased if vaccination has a non-null effect, as it fails to incorporate the greater depletion of susceptibles among the unvaccinated individuals. In simulations, the overestimation is small for averted deaths when infection-fatality rate is low, as for many important pathogens. However, the overestimation can be large for averted infections given a high basic reproduction number. Additionally, we define and compare estimand and estimators for avertible outcomes (i.e., outcomes that could have been averted by vaccination, but were not due to failure to vaccinate). Future studies can explore the identifiability of the causal estimand in observational settings.

Abstract:
Over the past decades, more than 25 phylogenetic tree balance indices and several families of such indices have been proposed in the literature -- some of which even contain infinitely many members. It is well established that different indices have different strengths and perform unequally across application scenarios. For example, power analyses have shown that the ability of an index to detect the generative model of a given phylogenetic tree varies significantly between indices. This variation in performance motivates the ongoing search for new and possibly \enquote{better} (im)balance indices. An easy way to generate a new index is to construct a compound index, e.g., a linear combination of established indices.   Two of the most prominent and widely used imbalance indices in this context are the Sackin index and the Colless index. In this study, we show that these classic indices are themselves compound in nature: they can be decomposed into more elementary components that independently satisfy the defining properties of a tree (im)balance index. We further show that the difference Colless minus Sackin results in another imbalance index that is minimized (amongst others) by all Colless minimal trees. Conversely, the difference Sackin minus Colless forms a balance index.   Finally, we compare the building blocks of which the Sackin and the Colless indices consist to these indices as well as to the stairs2 index, which is another index from the literature. Our results suggest that the elementary building blocks we identify are not only foundational to established indices but also valuable tools for analyzing disagreement among indices when comparing the balance of different trees.

Abstract:
Human cooperation persists among strangers despite theoretical predictions of difficulties in large, well-mixed populations, leaving a fundamental evolutionary puzzle. While upstream (pay-it-forward: helping others because you were helped) and downstream (rewarding-reputation: helping those with good reputations) indirect reciprocity have been independently considered as solutions, their joint dynamics in multiplayer contexts remain unexplored. We study N-player giving games with benefit b and cost c and analyze evolutionary dynamics for three strategies: unconditional cooperation (X), unconditional defection (Y), and an integrated reciprocal strategy (Z) combining unconditional forwarding with reputation-based discrimination. We show that integrating upstream and downstream reciprocity can yield a globally asymptotically stable mixed equilibrium of unconditional defectors and integrated reciprocators whenever the benefit-to-cost ratio exceeds a threshold (b/c > 2). Counterintuitively, introducing small complexity costs, rather than destabilizing, stabilizes the equilibrium by preventing not only unconditional cooperators (viewed as second-order freeloaders) but also alternative conditional strategies from invading. While the equilibrium frequency of integrated reciprocators decreases with group size N, it remains positive for any finite N. Rather than requiring uniformity, our model reveals one pathway to stable cooperation through strategic diversity. Defectors serve as "evolutionary shields" preventing system collapse while integrated reciprocators flexibly combine open and discriminative responses. This framework demonstrates how pay-it-forward chains and reputation systems can jointly maintain social polymorphism including cooperation despite cognitive limitations and group size challenges, offering a potential evolutionary foundation for behavioral diversity in human societies.

Abstract:
The COVID-19 pandemic forced the rapid development of vaccines and the implementation of mass vaccination programs around the world. However, many hesitated to take the vaccine due to concerns about its effectiveness. By looking at an ordinary differential equation (ODE) model of disease spread that incorporates a mass vaccination program, this study aims to determine the sensitivity of the cumulative count of infected individuals ($W$) and the cumulative death count ($D$) to the following model parameters: disease transmission rate ($β$), reciprocal of the disease latency period ($κ$), reciprocal of the infectious period ($γ$), death ratio ($α$), vaccine efficacy rate ($r$), and vaccine rollout rate ($δ$). This was implemented using Latin hypercube sampling and partial rank correlation coefficient. Results show that $D$ is highly sensitive to $α$ and shows increasing sensitivity to $δ$ in the long run. On the other hand, $W$ is highly sensitive to $κ$ at the beginning of the simulation, but this weakens over time. In contrast, $W$ is not very sensitive to $δ$ initially but becomes very significant in the long run. This supports the importance of the vaccine rollout rate over the vaccine efficacy rate in curbing the spread of the disease in the population. It is also worthwhile to reduce the death ratio by developing a cure for the disease or improving the healthcare system as a whole.

Abstract:
Improved hygiene and infant vaccinations have led to age specific variations in hepatitis A antibody prevalence in Korea, with lower rates among individuals in their 20s to 40s. Given that the fatality rate of hepatitis A increases for those aged 50 and older, the low immunity level among younger adults indicates a future risk of increased deaths in older age groups without additional preventive measures.We developed an age structured transmission model to assess the impact of adult vaccination, assuming it begins in 2025. The 20s age group was modeled with an additional compartment to account for hepatitis A vaccination administered to military recruits. Vaccination strategies targeting the 20s to 30s and 40s to 50s age groups were compared, considering antibody testing costs for the latter in Korea and focusing on projected deaths over approximately 50 years. When the total vaccination cost is fixed, targeting the 40s to 50s group covers 20% fewer individuals than the 20s to 30s group but yields a 1.3 to 1.5 fold greater reduction in deaths. When the total vaccine supply is fixed, targeting the 40s to 50s group is 1.2 times more expensive but yields a 1.7 to 1.8 fold greater reduction in deaths than the 20s to 30s group. Moreover, including a second dose for military personnel in the 20s to 30s group has minimal impact on reducing deaths. Preventive measures for adults may be necessary to reduce future hepatitis A related deaths. Vaccinating the 40s to 50s group would be more effective in reducing deaths than vaccinating the 20s to 30s group.

Abstract:
Understanding the spatio-temporal evolution of epidemics with multiple pathogens requires not only new theoretical models but also careful analysis of their practical consequences. Building on the Multiplex Bi-Virus Reaction-Diffusion framework (MBRD) introduced in our companion paper, we investigate how the super-infection model (MBRD-SI) and the co-infection model (MBRD-CI) behave under different epidemiological and network conditions. Through numerical experiments, we study the effects of pathogen virulence, diffusion rates, and cross-diffusion on epidemic hotspot formation and long-term prevalence. Our results highlight the role of multiplex structure in amplifying or suppressing co-circulating infections, and provide quantitative insight into conditions that drive persistent epidemic patterns. Beyond epidemiology, these findings have broader implications for multiplex contagion processes such as information diffusion and malware propagation.

Abstract:
Evaluating the timing and trajectory of sensory system innovations is crucial for understanding the increase in phylogenetic, behavioural, and ecological diversity during the Ediacaran-Cambrian transition. Elucidation of sensory adaptations has relied on either body-fossil evidence based on anatomical features or qualitative descriptions of trace-fossil morphology, leaving a gap in the record of sensory system innovations between the development of basic sensory capacities and that of more advanced sensory organs and brains. Here, we examine fossil movement trajectories of Ediacaran and Cambrian grazers for the presence of autocorrelation. Our analysis reveals a lack of temporal correlation in the studied Ediacaran trajectories and its presence in both analysed Cambrian trajectories, indicating time-tuned behaviours were in place by the early Cambrian. These results support the Cambrian Information Revolution hypothesis and indicates that increases in cognitive complexity and behavioural strategies were yet another important evolutionary innovation that occurred during the Ediacaran Cambrian transition.

Abstract:
When developers of artificial intelligence (AI) products need to decide between profit and safety for the users, they likely choose profit. Untrustworthy AI technology must come packaged with tangible negative consequences. Here, we envisage those consequences as the loss of reputation caused by media coverage of their misdeeds, disseminated to the public. We explore whether media coverage has the potential to push AI creators into the production of safe products, enabling widespread adoption of AI technology. We created artificial populations of self-interested creators and users and studied them through the lens of evolutionary game theory. Our results reveal that media is indeed able to foster cooperation between creators and users, but not always. Cooperation does not evolve if the quality of the information provided by the media is not reliable enough, or if the costs of either accessing media or ensuring safety are too high. By shaping public perception and holding developers accountable, media emerges as a powerful soft regulator -- guiding AI safety even in the absence of formal government oversight.

Abstract:
Many ecosystems can undergo important qualitative changes, including sudden transitions to alternative stable states, in response to perturbations or increments in conditions. Such 'tipping points' are often preceded by declines in aspects of ecosystem resilience, namely the capacity to recover from perturbations, that leave various spatial and temporal signatures. These so-called 'early warning signals' have been used to anticipate transitions in diverse real systems, but many of the high-throughput, autonomous monitoring technologies that are transforming ecology have yet to be fully leveraged to this end. Acoustic monitoring in particular is a powerful tool for quantifying biodiversity, tracking ecosystem health, and facilitating conservation. By deploying acoustic recorders in diverse environments, researchers have gained insights from the calls and behaviour of individual species to higher-level soundscape features that describe habitat quality and even predict species occurrence. Here, we draw on theory and practice to advocate for using acoustics to probe ecosystem resilience and identify emerging and established early warning signals of tipping points. With a focus on pragmatic considerations, we emphasise that despite limits to tipping point theory and the current scale and transferability of data, acoustics could be instrumental in understanding resilience and tipping potential across distinct ecosystems and scales.

Abstract:
Successful collective action on issues from climate change to the maintenance of democracy depends on societal properties such as cultural tightness and social cohesion. How these properties evolve is not well understood because they emerge from a complex interplay between beliefs and behaviors that are usually modeled separately. Here we address this challenge by developing a game-theoretical framework incorporating norm-utility models to study the coevolutionary dynamics of cooperative action, expressed belief, and norm-utility preferences. We show that the introduction of evolving beliefs and preferences into the Snowdrift game and Prisoner's Dilemma leads to a proliferation of evolutionary stable equilibria, each with different societal properties. In particular, we find that a declining material environment can simultaneously be associated with increased cultural tightness (defined as the degree to which individuals behave in accordance with widely held beliefs) and reduced social cohesion (defined as the degree of social homogeneity i.e. the extent to which individuals belong to a single well-defined group). Loss of social homogeneity occurs via a process of evolutionary branching, in which a population fragments into two distinct social groups with strikingly different characteristics. The groups that emerge differ not only in their willingness to cooperate, but also in their beliefs about cooperation and in their preferences for conformity and coherence of their actions and beliefs. These results have implications for our understanding of the resilience of cooperation and collective action in times of crisis.

Abstract:
Microbiomes are complex systems comprised of many interacting species. Species can survive harsh or changing conditions by rapid adaptation, a process accelerated by the exchange of genetic material between different species through horizontal gene transfer. Conjugative plasmids are ubiquitous mobile genetic elements that mediate such exchanges both within and between species. Therefore, predicting whether a plasmid can invade and be maintained by a microbial community is critical, for example when assessing the risks of antimicrobial resistance gene spread in commensal or environmental microbiomes. However, existing theory developed to assist such predictions has generally focused on the balance among plasmid costs, benefits, and infection rates, overlooking other relevant factors such as the inherent dynamics and diversity of microbiomes. Here, we hypothesize that plasmid persistence in the absence of positive selection can arise purely from the heterogeneity present in large and diverse microbial communities. We introduce a generic model that integrates population-level dynamics with plasmid conjugation. Using this model, we show that we can predict plasmid maintenance, and that the probability for a plasmid to be maintained depends on traits of the plasmid, most importantly the conjugation rate, and the species abundance distribution of the community. Then, using both empirical abundance data and extensive numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the inherent randomness of ecological interactions and conjugation rates enables plasmid persistence -- even in the absence of positive selection. Our findings thus suggest that natural microbial communities are likely to maintain plasmids indefinitely, offering a new perspective on the spread, maintenance, and ubiquity of plasmids.

A phylogenetic tree is an important way in Bioinformatics to find the evolutionary relationship among biological species. In this research, a proposed model is described for the estimation of a phylogenetic tree for a given set of data. To estimate a phylogenetic tree there are certain necessary steps have to be considered. Gene sequences are useful data resources to estimate the relationship among species at the molecular level. In this research, the approach is to create a fusion between the existing models for the estimation of phylogenetic trees and a population-based meta-heuristics approach, i.e., Genetic Algorithm. NCBI's Entrez databases are used for the acquisition of gene sequencing data. A modular parallel approach is applied to handle this dataset efficiently. This paper illustrates a proposed model to create an independent platform for phylogenetic tree estimation. Existing benchmark approaches for tree population that are used for population-based meta-heuristic search techniques to find the best possible phylogenetic tree estimation for a given set of gene sequence data.

Abstract:
Bacteria possess diverse mechanisms to regulate their motility in response to environmental and physiological signals, enabling them to navigate complex habitats and adapt their behavior. Among these mechanisms, interspecies recognition enables cells to modulate their movement based on the ecological identity of neighboring species. Here, we introduce a model in which we assume bacterial species recognizes each other and interact via local signals that either enhance or suppress the motility of neighboring cells. Through large-scale simulations and a coarse-grained stochastic model, we demonstrate the emergence of a sharp transition driven by nucleation processes: increasing the density of motility-suppressing interactions drives the system from a fully mixed, motile phase to a state characterized by large, stationary bacterial clusters. Remarkably, in systems with a large number of interacting species, this transition can be triggered solely by altering the structure of the motility-regulation interaction matrix while maintaining species and interaction densities constant. In particular, we find that heterogeneous and modular interactions promote the transition more readily than homogeneous random ones. These results contribute to the ongoing effort to understand microbial interactions, suggesting that structured, non-random ones may be key to reproducing commonly observed spatial patterns in microbial communities.

Abstract:
Cooperation often depends on individuals avoiding exploitation and interacting preferentially with other cooperators. We explore how context-dependent migration influences the evolution of cooperation in spatially structured populations. Individuals interact in small groups through public goods games and reproduce with possible dispersal. Cooperators migrate more frequently when surrounded by defectors, while defectors disperse uniformly. This behavioral asymmetry reflects realistic differences in mobility and social responsiveness. Our results show that conditional migration can promote cooperation by enabling cooperators to escape defector-rich environments and cluster together. The effectiveness of this mechanism depends on baseline migration rates, group size, and the sensitivity of cooperators to local conditions. We identify parameter ranges where cooperation is favored even under conditions that would typically hinder its evolution. These findings highlight how behavioral plasticity and dispersal strategies can interact with population structure to support the emergence of cooperation.

Abstract:
The Savannah Hypothesis and the Cambrian Information Revolution invoke the development of spatially heterogeneous resource distribution during the Ediacaran-Cambrian transition as a key driver of infaunalization and sensory evolution of mobile bilaterians, respectively. However, difficulties in detecting historical resource distribution hinders the ability to tests these theories. If external conditions crucial to organism fitness (e.g. nutrient distribution, oxygen availability) became increasingly heterogeneous across the Ediacaran-Cambrian transition, then it follows that benthic organisms dependent on these conditions would demonstrate a similar increase in the spatial variability of their movement trajectories. To investigate Ediacaran resource distribution on the seafloor we examined the morphology of Helminthoidichnites tenuis, a simple unbranched horizontal bilaterian trail, from the Ediacara Member of Southern Australia for spatial trends. Our analysis reveals a as-yet undiscovered variability in the behaviour of the Helminthoidichnites tenuis tracemaker and confirmed heterogeneity in external conditions relevant to the tracemaker in the latest Ediacaran.

Abstract:
The trace-fossil record serves as a rich dataset to examine fossil behaviour, ecologic interactions at community level, and evolutionary trends in behaviour across geological time. Behavioural adaptations are often invoked in a variety of evolutionary hypotheses; however, few methods to quantitatively compare fossil behaviour exist. Movement paths, such as trails and trackways, are well-studied in extant-organism research where they are discretized and mathematically analyzed for behavioural strategies and trends. Here, we reference modern movement ecology research and present a methodology to discretize horizontal movement paths in the fossil record. We then demonstrate the utility of this methodology and the spatiotemporal data it collects via an analysis of the trilobite trace fossil Cruziana semiplicata and assess our results in light of three previous assertions about its recorded behaviour. Our analysis reveals the presence of three morphotypes, interpreted as three distinct behavioural variations, which persisted across multiple geographic localities and are interpreted to reflect changes in external conditions, internal states, or a combination of the two. Our research highlights the immense potential of this methodology to test behavioural hypotheses and provides an open-source groundwork for future research.

Abstract:
Modern life largely transmits genetic information from mother to daughter through the duplication of single physically intact molecules that encode information. However, copying an extended molecule requires complex copying machinery and high fidelity that scales with the genome size to avoid the error catastrophe. Here, we explore these fidelity requirements in an alternative architecture, the virtual circular genome, in which no one physical molecule encodes the full genetic information. Instead, information is encoded and transmitted in a collective of overlapping and interacting segments. Using a model experimental system of a complex mixture of DNA oligomers that can partly anneal and extend off each other, we find that mutant oligomers are suppressed relative to a model without collective encoding. Through simulations and theory, we show that this suppression of mutants can be explained by competition for productive binding partners. As a consequence, information can be propagated robustly in a virtual circular genome even at mutation rates expected under prebiotic conditions.

Abstract:
Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) is a neurological disease impacting deer, elk, moose, and other cervid populations and is caused by a misfolded protein known as a prion. CWD is difficult to control due to the persistence of prions in the environment. Prions can remain infectious for more than a decade and have been found in soil as well as other environmental vectors, such as ticks and plants. Here, we provide a bifurcation analysis of a mathematical model of CWD spread in a cervid population, and use a modification of the Gillespie algorithm to explore if wolves can be used as an ecological control strategy to limit the spread of the disease in several relevant scenarios. We then analytically compute the probability that the disease spreads given one infected member enters a fully healthy population and the probability of elimination, given a fully susceptible population and remaining prions in the environment. From our analysis, we conclude that wolves can be used as an effective control strategy to limit the spread of CWD in cervid populations, and hunting or other means of lowering the susceptible population are beneficial to controlling the spread of CWD, although it is important to note that inferring biologically relevant parameters from the existing data is an ongoing challenge for this system.

Abstract:
During fieldwork in Thailand we observed nearly identical frequencies of co-located flashing fireflies and chirping crickets. Motivated by this, we perform a meta-analysis and show an abundance of evolutionarily distinct species that communicate isochronously at ~0.5-4 Hz, suggesting that this might be a frequency "hotspot." We hypothesize that this timescale may have a universal basis in the biophysics of the receiver's neurons. We test this by demonstrating that small receiver circuits constructed from elements representing typical neurons will be most responsive in the observed frequency range.

Abstract:
Fish migration is a dynamic phenomenon observed in many surface water bodies on the earth, while its understanding is still insufficient. Particularly, the biological mechanism behind fish migration is not fully understood. Moreover, its observation is often conducted visually and hence manually, raising questions of accuracy and interpretation of the data sampled. We address the two issues, mechanism and observation, of fish migration based on a recently developed mathematical model. The results obtained in this short paper show that fish migration can be characterized through a minimization principle and evaluate the error of its manual observations. The minimization principle we hypothesize is an optimal control problem where the migrating fish population dynamically changes its size and fluctuation. We numerically investigate alternating and intensive observation schemes as case studies, demonstrating that in some realistic conditions the estimate of total fish count is not reliable. We believe that this paper contributes to a deeper understanding of fish migration.

Abstract:
We investigate the impact of Hebbian learning on the contact process, a paradigmatic model for infection spreading, which has been also proposed as a simple model to capture the dynamics of inter-regional brain activity propagation as well as population spreading. Each of these contexts calls for an extension of the contact process with local learning. We introduce Hebbian learning as a positive or negative reinforcement of the activation rate between a pair of sites after each successful activation event. Learning can happen either in both directions motivated by social distancing (mutual learning model), or in only one of the directions motivated by brain and population dynamics (source or target learning models). Hebbian learning leads to a rich class of emergent behavior, where local incentives can lead to the opposite global effects. In general, positive reinforcement (increasing activation rates) leads to a loss of the active phase, while negative reinforcement (reducing activation rates) can turn the inactive phase into a globally active phase. In two dimensions and above, the effect of negative reinforcement is twofold: it promotes the spreading of activity, but at the same time gives rise to the appearance of effectively immune regions, entailing the emergence of two distinct critical points. Positive reinforcement can lead to Griffiths effects with non-universal power-law scaling, through the formation of random loops of activity, a manifestation of the ``ant mill" phenomenon.

Abstract:
The contact process is a simple infection spreading model showcasing an out-of-equilibrium phase transition between a macroscopically active and an inactive phase. Such absorbing state phase transitions are often sensitive to the presence of quenched disorder. Traditionally, a phase transition in the disordered contact process is either triggered by dilution or by locally varying the infection rate. However, when both factors play an important role, a multicritical point emerges that remains poorly understood. Here, we study the multicritical contact process by large-scale Monte Carlo simulations in two and three dimensions. The multicritical behavior is found to be universal and exhibits ultra-slow, activated dynamical scaling, with exponents consistent with those predicted by the strong disorder renormalization group method. This finding indicates that the multicritical contact process belongs to the same universality class as the multicritical quantum Ising model, opening future directions to measure quantum entanglement properties via classical simulations.

Abstract:
The mitigation of stress is a key challenge for all biological systems. Conditions of unresolvable stress have been associated with a diverse array of pathologies, from cancer to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Here, I unify insights from evolutionary and developmental biology with trauma psychology to present a novel framework for tumorigenesis which synthesizes stress-perception, tissue dysfunction, and the hallmarks of neoplastic growth. This view carries therapeutic implications, suggesting a reintegrative approach that seeks to return cancer cells to the homeostatic control of the surrounding tissue.

Abstract:
Vector-borne diseases arise from the coupled dynamics of human mobility and mosquito ecology, producing outbreaks shaped by both spatial distributions and temporal patterns of movement. Here we develop a coarse-grained hub--leaf reduction that isolates the universal principles governing epidemic vulnerability in interconnected populations. By deriving and analyzing the epidemic vulnerability equation, we show how human and vector population ratios, together with mobility parameters that regulate time spent in hub and leaf locations, jointly determine the conditions for outbreak persistence. The analysis reveals that balanced flows of individuals between patches consistently minimize vulnerability, whereas disproportionate concentrations of vectors can shift the dominant risk to specific locations. Across parameter regimes, compensatory mobility emerges as a stabilizing mechanism, while skewed host--vector ratios elevate epidemic risk. These results establish general principles for the spatiotemporal determinants of vector-borne disease spread and provide a theoretical foundation for extending minimal models to more complex epidemiological settings.

Abstract:
Bacteria often develop distinct phenotypes to adapt to environmental stress. In particular, they can produce biofilms, dense communities of bacteria that live in a complex extracellular matrix. Bacterial biofilms provide a safe haven from environmental conditions by distributing metabolic workload and allowing them to perform complex multicellular processes. While previous studies have investigated how bacterial biofilms are regulated under laboratory conditions, they have not considered (1) the data requirements necessary to estimate model parameters and (2) how bacteria respond to recurring stressors in their natural habitats. To address (1), we adapted a mechanistic population model to explore the dynamics of biofilm formation in the presence of predator stress, using synthetic data. We used a Maximum Likelihood Estimation framework to measure crucial parameters underpinning the biofilm formation dynamics. We used genetic algorithms to propose an optimal data collection schedule that minimised parameter identifiability confidence interval widths. Our sensitivity analysis revealed that we could simplify the binding dynamics and eliminate biofilm detachment. To address (2), we proposed a structured version of our model to capture the long-term behaviour and evolutionary selection. In our extended model, the subpopulations feature different maximal rates of biofilm formation. We compared the selection under different predator types and amounts and identified key parameters that affected the speed of selection via sensitivity analysis.

Abstract:
Group synchrony in the animal kingdom is usually associated with mating. Being in sync is likely advantageous, as it may help in luring the opposite sex. Yet there are also disadvantages -- such as the homogenization of the group -- which make it harder for individuals to stand-out. Here we address this tradeoff, bringing together the Kuramoto model with concepts from evolutionary game theory. We focus on the existence of self-interested ''cheaters,'' which have been extensively studied in a variety of species. In our scenario, cheating individuals take part in the synchronous group display but position themselves (in terms of phase) slightly ahead or behind the pack. This allows them to enjoy both the group benefit of advertisement and the individual benefit of being unique. But a group can only tolerate a limited number of such individuals while still achieving synchrony. We therefore incorporate a from of ''policing'' into our model: if an individual strays too far from the group's synchronous phase, they reveal themselves as dishonest and are punished. Our model offers testable predictions regarding natural population compositions, and will hopefully spur further investigation into not only how, but also why, natural systems synchronize.

Abstract:
Artificial chemistry simulations produce many intriguing emergent behaviors, but they are often difficult to steer or control. This paper proposes a method for steering the dynamics of a classic artificial chemistry model, known as AlChemy (Algorithmic Chemistry), which is based on untyped lambda calculus. Our approach leverages features that are endogenous to AlChemy without constructing an explicit external fitness function or building learning into the dynamics. We demonstrate the approach by synthesizing non-trivial lambda functions, such as Church addition and succession, from simple primitives. The results provide insight into the possibility of endogenous selection in diverse systems such as autocatalytic chemical networks and software systems.

Abstract:
Species interactions (ranging from direct predator prey relationships to indirect effects mediated by the environment) are central to ecosystem balance and biodiversity. While empirical methods for measuring these interactions exist, their interpretability and limitations remain unclear. Here we examine the empirical matrix of pairwise interactions, a widely used tool, and analyze its temporal variability. We show that apparent fluctuations in interaction strength (and even shifts in interaction signs, often interpreted as transitions between competition and facilitation) can arise intrinsically from population dynamics with fixed ecological roles. Experimental protocols further shape these estimates: the duration of observation and the type of setup in microbial growth studies (e.g., chemostats, batch cultures, or resource conditions) systematically affect measured interactions. Considering interactions across timescales enhances interpretability: short-term measurements primarily capture direct species couplings, whereas long-term observations increasingly reflect indirect community feedback. Taken together, these results establish short duration inferences, obtained either directly or extrapolated, as a principled way to disentangle direct from indirect interactions. Building on this insight, we propose a model inference approach that leverages multiple short time series rather than extended longitudinal datasets.

Abstract:
In many biological processes, the size of a population changes stochastically with time, and recent work in the context of cancer and bacterial growth have focused on the situation when the mean population size grows exponentially. Here, motivated by the evolutionary process of genetic hitchhiking in a selectively neutral population, we consider a model in which the mean size of the population increases linearly. We are interested in understanding how the fluctuations in the population size impact the first passage statistics, and study the fixation probability that a mutant reaches frequency one by a given time in a population whose size follows a conditional Wright-Fisher process. We find that at sufficiently short and long times, the fixation probability can be approximated by a model that ignores temporal correlations between the inverse of the population size, but at intermediate times, it is significantly smaller than that obtained by neglecting the correlations. Our analytical and numerical study of the correlation functions show that the conditional Wright-Fisher process of interest is neither a stationary nor a Gaussian process; we also find that the variance of the inverse population size initially increases linearly with time $t$ and then decreases as $t^{-2}$ at intermediate times followed by an exponential decay at longer times. Our work emphasizes the importance of temporal correlations in populations with fluctuating size that are often ignored in population-genetic studies of biological evolution.

Abstract:
Microbial adaptation to extreme stress, such as starvation, antimicrobial exposure, or freezing often reveals fundamental trade-offs between survival and proliferation. Understanding how populations navigate these trade-offs in fluctuating environments remains a central challenge. We develop a quantitative model to investigate the adaptation of populations of yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) subjected to cycles of growth and extreme freeze-thaw stress, focusing on the role of quiescence as a mediator of survival. Our model links key life-history traits: growth rate, lag time, quiescence probability, and stress survival, to a single underlying phenotype, motivated by the role of intracellular trehalose in the adaptation of yeast to freeze-thaw stress. Through stochastic population simulations and analytical calculation of the long-term growth rate, we identify the evolutionary attractors of the system. We find that the strength of the growth-survival trade-off depends critically on environmental parameters, such as the duration of the growth phase. Crucially, our analysis reveals that populations optimized for growth-stress cycles can often maintain viability alongside growth-optimized populations even in the absence of stress. This demonstrates that underlying physiological trade-offs do not necessarily translate into fitness trade-offs at the population level, providing general insights into the complex interplay between environmental fluctuations, physiological constraints, and evolutionary dynamics.

Abstract:
Omnivory, where species feed across multiple trophic levels, is a widespread feature of ecological networks. A key mechanism underlying such complexity is intraguild predation (IGP), in which a top predator consumes both an intermediate predator and a shared resource. Here, we show that Shilnikov homoclinic orbits emerge in a minimal intraguild predation model, triggering a cascade of homoclinic bifurcations near a saddle-focus equilibrium that culminates in chaos. Numerical simulations and Lyapunov spectrum analysis reveal multiple coexistence modes, ranging from regular oscillations to Shilnikov homoclinic orbits and chaos. Our model quantitatively reproduces patterns observed in natural omnivore networks, providing mechanistic insights into complex population fluctuations in ecological systems.

Abstract:
A central goal in ecology is to understand how biodiversity is maintained. Previous theoretical works have employed the rock-paper-scissors (RPS) game as a toy model, demonstrating that population mobility is crucial in determining the species' coexistence. One key prediction is that biodiversity is jeopardized and eventually lost when mobility exceeds a certain value--a conclusion at odds with empirical observations of highly mobile species coexisting in nature. To address this discrepancy, we introduce a reinforcement learning framework and study a spatial RPS model, where individual mobility is adaptively regulated via a Q-learning algorithm rather than held fixed. Our results show that all three species can coexist stably, with extinction probabilities remaining low across a broad range of baseline migration rates. Mechanistic analysis reveals that individuals develop two behavioral tendencies: survival priority (escaping from predators) and predation priority (remaining near prey). While species coexistence emerges from the balance of the two tendencies, their imbalance jeopardizes biodiversity. Notably, there is a symmetry-breaking of action preference in a particular state that is responsible for the divergent species densities. Furthermore, when Q-learning species interact with fixed-mobility counterparts, those with adaptive mobility exhibit a significant evolutionary advantage. Our study suggests that reinforcement learning may offer a promising new perspective for uncovering the mechanisms of biodiversity and informing conservation strategies.

Abstract:
Understanding interactions between the spread of multiple pathogens during an epidemic is crucial to assessing the severity of infections in human communities. In this paper, we introduce two new Multiplex Bi-Virus Reaction-Diffusion models (MBRD) on multiplex metapopulation networks: the super-infection model (MBRD-SI) and the co-infection model (MBRD-CI). These frameworks capture two-pathogen dynamics with spatial diffusion and cross-diffusion, allowing the prediction of infection clustering and large-scale spatial distributions. We establish conditions for Turing and Turing-Hopf instabilities in both models and provide experimental evidence of epidemic pattern formation. Beyond epidemiology, we discuss applications of the MBRD framework to information propagation, malware diffusion, and urban transportation networks.

Abstract:
Downsizing the US public health workforce throughout 2025 amplifies potential risks during public health crises. Expert judgment from public health officials represents a vital information source, distinct from traditional surveillance infrastructure, that should be valued -- not discarded. Understanding how expert knowledge functions under constraints is essential for understanding the potential impact of reduced capacity. To explore expert forecasting capabilities, 114 public health officials at the 2024 CSTE workshop generated 103 predictions plus 102 rationales of peak hospitalizations and 114 predictions of influenza H3 versus H1 dominance in Pennsylvania for the 2024/25 season. We compared expert predictions to computational models and used rationales to analyze reasoning patterns using Latent Dirichlet Allocation. Experts better predicted H3 dominance and assigned lower probability to implausible scenarios than models. Expert rationales drew on historical patterns, pathogen interactions, vaccine data, and cumulative experience. Expert public health knowledge constitutes a critical data source that should be valued equally with traditional datasets. We recommend developing a national toolkit to systematically collect and analyze expert predictions and rationales, treating human judgment as quantifiable data alongside surveillance systems to enhance crisis response capabilities.

Abstract:
Phylogenetic trees represent evolutionary relationships and can be uniquely defined by sets of finite-state biological characteristics. Despite prior work showing that sufficiently large trees can be determined by $r$-state character sets, the minimal leaf thresholds $n_r$ remain largely unknown. In this work, we establish the 3-state case as $n_3 = 8$, providing a concrete base for higher-state analyses. We then resolve the 5-state problem by constructing a counterexample for $n=15$ and proving that for $n \geq 16$, $\lceil (n-3)/4 \rceil$ 5-state characters suffice to uniquely define any tree. Our approach relies on rigorous mathematical induction with complete verification of base cases and logically consistent inductive steps, offering new insights into the minimal conditions for character-based tree identification.

Abstract:
Previous pandemics, including influenza pandemics and Covid-19, have disproportionately impacted Māori and Pacific populations in Aotearoa New Zealand. The reasons for this are multi-faceted, including differences in socioeconomic deprivation, housing conditions and household size, vaccination rates, access to healthcare, and prevalence of pre-existing health conditions. Many mathematical models that were used to inform the response to the Covid-19 pandemic did not explicitly include ethnicity or other socioeconomic variables. This limited their ability to predict, understand and mitigate inequitable impacts of the pandemic. Here, we extend a model that was developed during the Covid-19 pandemic to support the public health response by stratifying the population into four ethnicity groups: Māori, Pacific, Asian and European/other. We include three ethnicity-specific components in the model: vaccination rates, clinical severity parameters, and contact patterns. We compare model results to ethnicity-specific data on Covid-19 cases, hospital admissions and deaths between 1 January 2022 and 30 June 2023, under different model scenarios in which these ethnicity-specific components are present or absent. We find that differences in vaccination rates explain only part of the observed disparities in outcomes. While no model scenario is able to fully capture the heterogeneous temporal dynamics, our results suggest that differences between ethnicities in the per-infection risk of clinical severe disease is an important factor. Our work is an important step towards models that are better able to predict inequitable impacts of future pandemic and emerging disease threats, and investigate the ability of interventions to mitigate these.

Abstract:
Despite growth being fundamental to all aspects of cell biology, we do not yet know its organizing principles in eukaryotic cells. Classic models derived from the bacteria E. coli posit that protein-synthesis rates are set by mass-action collisions between charged tRNAs produced by metabolic enzymes and mRNA-bound ribosomes. These models show that faster growth is achieved by simultaneously raising both ribosome content and peptide elongation speed. Here, we test if these models are valid for eukaryotes by combining single-molecule tracking, spike-in RNA sequencing, and proteomics in 15 carbon- and nitrogen-limited conditions using the budding yeast S. cerevisiae. Ribosome concentration increases linearly with growth rate, as in bacteria, but the peptide elongation speed remains constant (~9 amino acids/s) and charged tRNAs are not limiting. Total mRNA concentration rises in direct proportion to ribosomes, driven by enhanced RNA polymerase II occupancy of the genome. We show that a simple kinetic model of mRNA-ribosome binding predicts both the fraction of active ribosomes, the growth rate, and responses to transcriptional perturbations. Yeast accelerate growth by coordinately and proportionally co-up-regulating total mRNA and ribosome concentrations, not by speeding elongation. Taken together, our work establishes a new framework for eukaryotic growth control and resource allocation.

Abstract:
West Nile virus (WNV) is a climate-sensitive mosquito-borne arbovirus circulating between mosquitoes of the genus Culex and birds, with a potential spillover to humans and other mammals. Recent trends in climatic change, characterized by early and/or prolonged summer seasons, increased temperatures, and above-average rainfall, probably facilitated the spread of WNV in Europe, including Germany. In this work, we formulate a spatial WNV model consisting of a system of parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs), using the concept of diffusion and advection in combination with temperature-dependent parameters, i.e., mosquito biting rate, extrinsic incubation, and mortality rate. Diffusion represents the random movement of both mosquitoes and hosts across space, while advection captures the directed movement of migratory birds. The model is first studied mathematically, and we show that it has non-negative, unique, and bounded solutions in time and space. Numerical simulations of the PDE model are performed using temperature data for Germany (2019 - 2024). Results obtained from the simulation showed a high agreement with the reported WNV cases among birds and equids in Germany. The observed spreading patterns from the year 2018 to 2022 and the year 2024 were mainly driven by temperature in combination with diffusion processes of hosts and vectors. Only during the year 2023, the additional inclusion of advection for migratory birds was important to correctly predict new hotspots in new locations in Germany.

Abstract:
We study a size--structured population model of proliferating cells in which biomass accumulation and binary division occur at rates modulated by fluctuating internal phenotypes. We quantify how fluctuations in internal variables that influence both growth and division shape the distribution of population phenotypes. We derive conditions under which the distributions of size and internal state decouple. Under this decoupling, population--level expectations are obtained from lineage-level expectations by an exponential tilting given by the Feynman--Kac formula. We further characterize weaker (ensemble-specific) versions of decoupling that hold in the lineage or the population ensemble but not both. Finally, we provide a more general interpretation of the tilted expectations in terms of the mass-weighted phenotype distribution.

Abstract:
Using past behaviors to guide future actions is essential for fostering cooperation in repeated social dilemmas. Traditional memory-based strategies that focus on recent interactions have yielded valuable insights into the evolution of cooperative behavior. However, as memory length increases, the complexity of analysis grows exponentially, since these strategies need to map every possible action sequence of a given length to subsequent responses. Due to their inherent reliance on exhaustive mapping and a lack of explicit information processing, it remains unclear how individuals can handle extensive interaction histories to make decisions under cognitive constraints. To fill this gap, we introduce coordinated reciprocity strategies ($CORE$), which incrementally evaluate the entire game history by tallying instances of consistent actions between individuals without storing round-to-round details. Once this consistency index surpasses a threshold, $CORE$ prescribes cooperation. Through equilibrium analysis, we derive an analytical condition under which $CORE$ constitutes an equilibrium. Moreover, our numerical results show that $CORE$ effectively promotes cooperation between variants of itself, and it outperforms a range of existing strategies including memory-$1$, memory-$2$, and those from a documented strategy library in evolutionary dynamics. Our work thus underscores the pivotal role of cumulative action consistency in enhancing cooperation, developing robust strategies, and offering cognitively low-burden information processing mechanisms in repeated social dilemmas.

Title: Finding Inter-species Associations on Large Citizen Science Datasets

Abstract:
Determining associations among different species from citizen science databases is challenging due to observer behavior and intrinsic density variations that give rise to correlations that do not imply species associations. This paper introduces a method that can efficiently analyze large datasets to extract likely species associations. It tiles space into small blocks chosen to be of the accuracy of the data coordinates, and reduces observations to presence/absence per tile, in order to compute pairwise overlaps. It compares these overlaps with a spatial Poisson process that serves as a null model. For each species $i$, an expected overlap $μ_i$ is estimated by averaging normalized overlaps over other species in the same vicinity. This gives a $z$-score for significance of a species-species association and a correlation index for the strength of this association. This was tested on $874,263$ iNaturalist observations spanning $15,975$ non-avian taxa in the Santa Cruz, California region ($\approx 4.68\times10^{6}$ tiles). The method recovers well-known insect host-plant obligate relationships, particularly many host-gall relationships, as well as the relationship between Yerba Santa Beetles and California Yerba Santa. This approach efficiently finds associations on $\sim10^{8}$ species pairs on modest hardware, filtering correlations arising from heterogeneous spatial prevalence and user artifacts. It produces a ranked shortlist of ecological interactions that can be further pursued. Extensions to this method are possible, such as investigating the effects of time and elevation. It could also be useful in the determination of microhabitats and biomes.

Title: Extending a Phylogeny-based Method for Detecting Signatures of Multi-level Selection for Applications in Artificial Life

Abstract:
Multilevel selection occurs when short-term individual-level reproductive interests conflict with longer-term group-level fitness effects. Detecting and quantifying this phenomenon is key to understanding evolution of traits ranging from multicellularity to pathogen virulence. Multilevel selection is particularly important in artificial life research due to its connection to major evolutionary transitions, a hallmark of open-ended evolution. Bonetti Franceschi & Volz (2024) proposed to detect multilevel selection dynamics by screening for mutations that appear more often in a population than expected by chance (due to individual-level fitness benefits) but are ultimately associated with negative longer-term fitness outcomes (i.e., smaller, shorter-lived descendant clades). Here, we use agent-based modeling with known ground truth to assess the efficacy of this approach. To test these methods under challenging conditions broadly comparable to the original dataset explored by Bonetti Franceschi & Volz (2024), we use an epidemiological framework to model multilevel selection in trade-offs between within-host growth rate and between-host transmissibility. To achieve success on our in silico data, we develop an alternate normalization procedure for identifying clade-level fitness effects. We find the method to be sensitive in detecting genome sites under multilevel selection with 30% effect sizes on fitness, but do not see sensitivity to smaller 10% mutation effect sizes. To test the robustness of this methodology, we conduct additional experiments incorporating extrinsic, time-varying environmental changes and adaptive turnover in population compositions, and find that screen performance remains generally consistent with baseline conditions. This work represents a promising step towards rigorous generalizable quantification of multilevel selection effects.

Abstract:
A normal (phylogenetic) network with $k$ reticulations displays $2^k$ phylogenetic trees. In this paper, we establish an analogous result for tree-child (phylogenetic) networks with no underlying $3$-cycles. In particular, we show that a tree-child network with $k\ge 2$ reticulations and no underlying $3$-cycles displays at least $2^{k/2}$ phylogenetic trees if $k$ is even and at least $\frac{3}{2\sqrt{2}}2^{k/2}$ if $k$ is odd. Moreover, we show that these bounds are sharp and characterise the tree-child networks that attain these bounds.

Title: How can we measure the information created by natural selection?

Abstract:
Natural selection can create information. In particular, because of the action of natural selection, we can often learn something about an environment by examining local organisms, and vice versa. For example, the characteristics of a cactus suggest that the local environment is relatively dry, and if a natural terrestrial environment is dry, then we will generally have an enhanced probability of finding drought-resistant plants (like cacti). Here, we propose a measure that can be used to quantify the information that is created by natural selection. We call the proposed quantity reproductive information, and we show that it has an intuitively satisfying relationship to standard quantitative definitions of information. Reproductive information is also approximately equal to a previously defined measure of biological adaptation. In addition, we explain how reproductive information can be measured using phenotypic characters, instead of genotypes. This could facilitate the measurement of reproductive information, and it could also allow for the quantification of the information that is created by natural selection on groups of organisms, instead of just selection on individuals. Thus, the concept of reproductive information has the potential to advance research on the "units of selection", the "major transitions in evolution", and the emergence of "superorganisms" via cooperation among group members.
