The homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-Zip) gene family, whose members play vital 
roles in plant growth and development, and participate in responding to various 
stresses, is an important class of transcription factors currently only found in 
plants. Although the HD-Zip gene family, especially the HD-Zip I subfamily, has 
been extensively studied in many plant species, the systematic report on HD-Zip 
I subfamily in cultivated tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) is lacking. In this study, 
39 HD-Zip I genes were systematically identified in N. tabacum (Nt). 
Interestingly, that 64.5% of the 31 genes with definite chromosome location 
information were found to originate from N. tomentosoformis, one of the two 
ancestral species of allotetraploid N. tabacum. Phylogenetic analysis divided 
the NtHD-Zip I subfamily into eight clades. Analysis of gene structures showed 
that NtHD-Zip I proteins contained conserved homeodomain and leucine-zipper 
domains. Three-dimensional structure analysis revealed that most NtHD-Zip I 
proteins in each clade, except for those in clade η, share a similar structure 
to their counterparts in Arabidopsis. Prediction of cis-regulatory elements 
showed that a number of elements responding to abscisic acid and different 
abiotic stresses, including low temperature, drought, and salinity, existed in 
the promoter region of NtHD-Zip I genes. The prediction of Arabidopsis 
ortholog-based protein-protein interaction network implied that NtHD-Zip I 
proteins have complex connections. The expression profile of these genes showed 
that different NtHD-Zip I genes were highly expressed in different tissues and 
could respond to abscisic acid and low-temperature treatments. Our study 
provides insights into the evolution and expression patterns of NtHD-Zip I genes 
in N. tabacum and will be useful for further functional characterization of 
NtHD-Zip I genes in the future.

In order to understand how the morphology of plant species has diversified over 
time, it is necessary to decipher how the underlying developmental programs have 
evolved. The regulatory network controlling shoot meristem activity is likely to 
have played an important role in morphological diversification and useful 
insights can be gained by comparing monocots and eudicots. These two distinct 
monophyletic groups of angiosperms diverged 130 Ma and are characterized by 
important differences in their morphology. Several studies of eudicot species 
have revealed a conserved role for NAM and CUC3 genes in meristem functioning 
and pattern formation through the definition of morphogenetic boundaries during 
development. In this study, we show that NAM- and CUC3-related genes are 
conserved in palms and grasses, their diversification having predated the 
radiation of monocots and eudicots. Moreover, the NAM-miR164 posttranscriptional 
regulatory module is also conserved in palm species. However, in contrast to the 
CUC3-related genes, which share a similar expression pattern between the two 
angiosperm groups, the expression domain of the NAM-miR164 module differs 
between monocot and eudicot species. In our studies of spatial expression 
patterns, we compared existing eudicot data with novel results from our work 
using two palm species (date palm and oil palm) and two members of the Poaceae 
(rice and millet). In addition to contrasting results obtained at the gene 
expression level, major differences were also observed between eudicot and 
monocot NAM-related genes in the occurrence of putative cis-regulatory elements 
in their promoter sequences. Overall, our results suggest that although NAM- and 
CUC3-related proteins are functionally equivalent between monocots and eudicots, 
evolutionary radiation has resulted in heterotopy through alterations in the 
expression domain of the NAM-miR164 regulatory module.

Hybrid internal-terminal exons function as either internal or terminal exons. 
Their evolutionary origins remain unclear. Here, we investigate the phylogenetic 
origin and regulation of a hybrid exon, 9A9', in the TPM1 gene encoding 
tropomyosin alpha-1. We demonstrate that exon 9A9' was originally terminal in 
non-vertebrate deuterostomes and switched to internal in vertebrates through the 
exonization of a downstream exon, 9B. While the terminal nature of exon 9A9' was 
lost in most vertebrates, it was conserved in amphibians and coelacanths where 
it behaves as a hybrid internal-terminal exon. Using Xenopus laevis as a model, 
we show that the preservation of terminal exon 9A9' in the tpm1 gene likely 
arose from evolutionary pressures to mitigate the developmental toxicity linked 
to exon 9B inclusion during neurulation. We identify two peculiarities of 
terminal exon 9A9': it lies downstream of an AG-independent intron, and its 
definition is supported by an intronic cis-regulatory element, the UTE, which 
enhances recognition of the weak cleavage-polyadenylation site. Our findings 
characterize the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of hybrid 
internal-terminal exons and reveal how evolutionary pressures can reactivate 
vestigial traits to resolve developmental challenges. This work broadens our 
understanding of alternative splicing evolution and its significance in 
vertebrate development.

The gypsy insulator can function as a promoter-specific silencer in the 
Drosophila embryo.

Berkeley 94720, USA.

The Drosophila gypsy retrotransposon disrupts gene activity by blocking the 
interactions of distal enhancers with target promoters. This enhancer-blocking 
activity is mediated by a 340 bp insulator DNA within gypsy. The insulator 
contains a cluster of binding sites for a zinc finger protein, suppressor of 
Hairy wing [su(Hw)]. Recent studies have shown that a second protein, mod(mdg4), 
is also important for normal insulator function. Mutations in mod(mdg4) exert 
paradoxical effects on different gypsy-induced phenotypes. For example, it 
enhances yellow2 but suppresses cut6. Here, we employ a stripe expression assay 
in transgenic embryos to investigate the role of mod(mdg4) in gypsy insulator 
activity. The insulator was inserted between defined enhancers and placed among 
divergently transcribed reporter genes (white and lacZ) containing distinct core 
promoter sequences. These assays indicate that mod(mdg4) is essential for the 
enhancer-blocking activity of the insulator DNA. Moreover, reductions in 
mod(mdg4)+ activity cause the insulator to function as a promoter-specific 
silencer that selectively represses white, but not lacZ. The repression of white 
does not affect the expression of the closely linked lacZ gene, suggesting that 
the insulator does not propagate changes in chromatin structure. These results 
provide an explanation for why mod(mdg4) exerts differential effects on 
different gypsy-induced mutations.

The precise spatiotemporal expression of the hematopoietic ETS transcription 
factor PU.1, a key determinant of hematopoietic cell fates, is tightly regulated 
at the chromatin level. However, how chromatin signatures are linked to this 
dynamic expression pattern across different blood cell lineages remains 
uncharacterized. Here, we performed an in-depth analysis of the relationships 
between gene expression, chromatin structure, 3D architecture, and trans-acting 
factors at PU.1 cis-regulatory elements (PCREs). By identifying phylogenetically 
conserved DNA elements within chromatin-accessible regions in primary human 
blood lineages, we discovered multiple novel candidate PCREs within the upstream 
region of the human PU.1 locus. A subset of these elements localizes within an 
8-kb-wide cluster exhibiting enhancer features, including open chromatin, 
demethylated DNA, enriched enhancer histone marks, present enhancer RNAs, and 
PU.1 occupation, presumably mediating PU.1 autoregulation. Importantly, we 
revealed the presence of a common 35-kb-wide CTCF-flanked insulated neighborhood 
that contains the PCRE cluster (PCREC), forming a chromatin territory for 
lineage-specific and PCRE-mediated chromatin interactions. These include 
functional PCRE-promoter interactions in myeloid and B cells that are absent in 
erythroid and T cells. By correlating chromatin structure and 3D architecture 
with PU.1 expression in various lineages, we were able to attribute enhancer 
versus silencer functions to individual elements. Our findings provide 
mechanistic insights into the interplay between dynamic chromatin structure and 
3D architecture in the chromatin regulation of PU.1 expression. This study lays 
crucial groundwork for additional experimental studies that validate and dissect 
the role of PCREs in epigenetic regulation of normal and malignant 
hematopoiesis.

Topologically associating domains (TADs) and chromatin architectural loops 
impact promoter-enhancer interactions, with CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) defining 
TAD borders and loop anchors. TAD boundaries and loops progressively strengthen 
upon embryonic stem (ES) cell differentiation, underscoring the importance of 
chromatin topology in ontogeny. However, the mechanisms driving this process 
remain unclear. Here we show a widespread increase in CTCF-RNA-binding protein 
(RBP) interactions upon ES to neural stem (NS) cell differentiation. While 
dispensable in ES cells, RBPs reinforce CTCF-anchored chromatin topology in NS 
cells. We identify Pantr1, a non-coding RNA, as a key facilitator of CTCF-RBP 
interactions, promoting chromatin maturation. Using acute CTCF degradation, we 
find that, through its insulator function, CTCF helps maintain neuronal gene 
silencing in NS cells by acting as a barrier to untimely gene activation during 
development. Altogether, we reveal a fundamental mechanism driving 
developmentally linked chromatin structural consolidation and the contribution 
of this process to the control of gene expression in differentiation.

Genetic and molecular analysis of the gypsy chromatin insulator of Drosophila.

Author information:
(1)Department of Biology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD 21218, USA.

Boundary or insulator elements set up independent territories of gene activity 
by establishing higher order domains of chromatin structure. The gypsy 
retrotransposon of Drosophila contains an insulator element that represses 
enhancer-promoter interactions and is responsible for the mutant phenotypes 
caused by insertion of this element. The gypsy insulator inhibits the 
interaction of promoter-distal enhancers with the transcription complex without 
affecting the functionality of promoter-proximal enhancers; in addition, these 
sequences can buffer a transgene from chromosomal position effects. Two proteins 
have been identified that bind gypsy insulator sequences and are responsible for 
their effects on transcription. The suppressor of Hairy-wing [su(Hw)] protein 
affects enhancer function both upstream and downstream of its binding site by 
causing a silencing effect similar to that of heterochromatin. The modifier of 
mdg4 [mod(mdg4)] protein interacts with su(Hw) to transform this bi-directional 
repression into the polar effect characteristic of insulators. These effects 
seem to be modulated by changes in chromatin structure.

The Drosophila GAGA factor (GAF) is a multifunctional protein implicated in 
nucleosome organization and remodeling, activation and repression of gene 
expression, long distance enhancer-promoter communication, higher order 
chromosome structure, and mitosis. This broad range of activities poses 
questions about how a single protein can perform so many seemingly different and 
unrelated functions. Current studies argue that GAF acts as a "pioneer" factor, 
generating nucleosome-free regions of chromatin for different classes of 
regulatory elements. The removal of nucleosomes from regulatory elements in turn 
enables other factors to bind to these elements and carry out their specialized 
functions. Consistent with this view, GAF associates with a collection of 
chromatin remodelers and also interacts with proteins implicated in different 
regulatory functions. In this review, we summarize the known activities of GAF 
and the functions of its protein partners.

Western Infirmary, Glasgow, UK. a.west@clinmed.gla.ac.uk

In this review, we look at the most recent studies of DNA elements that function 
over long genomic distances to regulate gene transcription and will discuss the 
mechanisms genes employ to overcome the positive and negative influences of 
their genomic neighbourhood in order to achieve accurate programmes of 
expression. Enhancer elements activate high levels of transcription of linked 
genes from distal locations. Recent technological advances have demonstrated 
chromatin loop interactions between enhancers and their target promoters. 
Moreover, there is increasing evidence that these dynamic interactions regulate 
the repositioning of genes to foci of active transcription within the nucleus. 
Enhancers have the potential to activate a number of neighbouring genes over a 
large chromosomal region, hence, their action must be restricted in order to 
prevent activation of non-target genes. This is achieved by specialized DNA 
sequences, termed enhancer blockers (or insulators), that interfere with an 
enhancer's ability to communicate with a target promoter when positioned between 
the two. Here, we summarize current models of enhancer blocking activity and 
discuss recent findings of how it can be dynamically regulated. It has become 
clear that enhancer blocking elements should not be considered only as 
structural elements on the periphery of gene loci, but as regulatory elements 
that are crucial to the outcome of gene expression. The transcription potential 
of a gene can also be susceptible to heterochromatic silencing originating from 
its chromatin environment. Insulator elements can act as barriers to the spread 
of heterochromatin. We discuss recent evidence supporting a number of 
non-exclusive mechanisms of barrier action, which mostly describe the modulation 
of chromatin structure or modification.

Chromatin looping and organization at developmentally regulated gene loci.

Noordermeer D(1), Duboule D.

Author information:

Ecole Polytechnique Frale (EPFL), Lausanne, Switzerland.

Developmentally regulated genes are often controlled by distant enhancers, 
silencers and insulators, to implement their correct transcriptional programs. 
In recent years, the development of 3C and derived techniques (4C, 5C, HiC, 
ChIA-PET, etc.) has confirmed that chromatin looping is an important mechanism 
for the transfer of regulatory information in mammalian cells. At many 
developmentally regulated gene loci, transcriptional activation is indeed 
accompanied by the formation of chromatin loops between genes and distant 
enhancers. Similarly, dynamic looping between insulator elements and changes in 
local 3D organization may be observed upon variation in transcriptional 
activity. Chromatin looping also occurs at silent gene loci, where its function 
remains less understood. In lineage-committed cells, partial 3D configurations 
are detected at loci that are activated at later stages. However, these partial 
configurations usually lack promoter-enhancer loops that accompany 
transcriptional activation, suggesting they have structural functions. 
Definitive evidence for a repressive role of chromatin looping is still lacking. 
Chromatin loops have been reported at repressed loci but, alternatively, they 
may act as a distraction for active loops. Together, these mechanisms allow 
fine-tuning of regulatory programs, thus providing further diversity in the 
transcriptional control of developmentally regulated gene loci.

Insulator DNAs, or boundary elements, functionally isolate neighbouring genes by 
blocking interactions between distal enhancers and inappropriate target 
promoters. The best-characterized insulators in Drosophila correspond to a 
340-base-pair (bp) fragment from the gypsy retrotransposon, and the scs and scs' 
sequences flanking the 87A1 hsp70 locus. Here we demonstrate that both 
insulators block the interaction of defined even-skipped (eve) stripe enhancers 
when positioned between the enhancer and the target promoter. The simultaneous 
use of two stripe enhancers (eve stripes 2 and 3) provides evidence that 
enhancers lying distal to the insulator are selectively blocked. The insertion 
of stripe-insulator-stripe sequences between two divergently transcribed 
promoters indicates that enhancers barred from acting on one basal promoter are 
fully accessible to appropriate regulatory factors for activating the other 
promoter. These results suggest that insulators do not propagate changes in 
chromatin structure. Finally, we present evidence that the gypsy insulator does 
not block interactions between a silencer element and a basal promoter. Taken 
together, these results suggest that insulators might not be restricted to the 
functional isolation of neighbouring genetic loci. Rather, they might function 
as flexible regulatory elements that modulate enhancer-promoter interactions 
within complex promoters and complex genetic loci.

SWI/SNF (BAF) complexes: From framework to a functional role in endothelial 
mechanotransduction.

Endothelial cells (ECs) are constantly subjected to an array of mechanical cues, 
especially shear stress, due to their luminal placement in the blood vessels. 
Blood flow can regulate various aspects of endothelial biology and 
pathophysiology by regulating the endothelial processes at the transcriptomic, 
proteomic, miRNomic, metabolomics, and epigenomic levels. ECs sense, respond, 
and adapt to altered blood flow patterns and shear profiles by specialized 
mechanisms of mechanosensing and mechanotransduction, resulting in qualitative 
and quantitative differences in their gene expression. Chromatin-regulatory 
proteins can regulate transcriptional activation by modifying the organization 
of nucleosomes at promoters, enhancers, silencers, insulators, and locus control 
regions. Recent research efforts have illustrated that SWI/SNF (SWItch/Sucrose 
Non-Fermentable) or BRG1/BRM-associated factor (BAF) complex regulates DNA 
accessibility and chromatin structure. Since the discovery, the gene-regulatory 
mechanisms of the BAF complex associated with chromatin remodeling have been 
intensively studied to investigate its role in diverse disease phenotypes. Thus 
far, it is evident that (1) the SWI/SNF complex broadly regulates the activity 
of transcriptional enhancers to control lineage-specific differentiation and (2) 
mutations in the BAF complex proteins lead to developmental disorders and 
cancers. It is unclear if blood flow can modulate the activity of SWI/SNF 
complex to regulate EC differentiation and reprogramming. This review emphasizes 
the integrative role of SWI/SNF complex from a structural and functional 
standpoint with a special reference to cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). The 
review also highlights how regulation of this complex by blood flow can lead to 
the discovery of new therapeutic interventions for the treatment of endothelial 
dysfunction in vascular diseases.

The transcription of each gene is tightly regulated by elements like promoters, 
enhancers, silencers and insulators. These elements determine the temporal and 
tissue-specific expression in development and disease. Drug resistance is the 
major obstacle in successfully treating cancer patients. In the recent years, it 
became evident that epigenetic changes represent one of the mechanisms that 
contribute to the onset and progression of cancer but also to the development of 
therapy resistance. The assay for transposase-accessible chromatin coupled with 
next generation sequencing (ATAC-seq) is a fast and easy technique to track 
epigenetic changes that result in different opening of the chromatin in 
regulatory regions genome-wide. The transposase cuts DNA in regions that are 
open and therefore accessible for transcription factors, regulatory RNAs and 
proteins that alter the architectural structure of the DNA and drive or inhibit 
transcription through the RNA polymerase. Here we describe a detailed protocol 
to perform an ATAC-seq of cells from culture or tissue.

Chromatin boundaries and insulators are transcriptional regulatory elements that 
modulate interactions between enhancers and promoters and protect genes from 
silencing effects by the adjacent chromatin. Originally discovered in 
Drosophila, insulators have now been found in a variety of organisms, ranging 
from yeast to humans. They have been found interspersed with regulatory 
sequences in complex genes and at the boundaries between active and inactive 
chromatin. Insulators might modulate transcription by organizing the chromatin 
fiber within the nucleus through the establishment of higher-order domains of 
chromatin structure.

episomes.

Insulators are genomic elements that define domains of transcriptional autonomy. 
Although a large number of insulators have been isolated, it is unclear whether 
these elements function by shared molecular mechanisms. Novel applications of 
FLP recombinase technology were used to dissect and compare the function of the 
Drosophila: gypsy and scs insulators. Inter actions between FLP monomers bound 
to chromosomally integrated FRT sites were unimpeded by either insulator, 
demonstrating that these insulators do not establish a chromosomal environment 
capable of disrupting all types of protein-protein interactions. The gypsy 
insulator blocked enhancer-activated transcription on FLP-generated 
extra-chromosomal episomes, whereas the scs insulator displayed silencing 
effects. These data indicate that these insulators differ in the mechanisms used 
to prevent enhancer function. That the gypsy insulator blocked enhancer-promoter 
communication within small episomes suggests that these effects may be 
accomplished without a global reorganization of chromatin structure. Instead, 
the gypsy insulator may disrupt enhancer-activated transcription by direct 
interference with transmission of the enhancer signal to the promoter.

Igf2/H19 imprinting control region (ICR): an insulator or a position-dependent 
silencer?

The imprinting control region (ICR) located far upstream of the H19 gene, in 
conjunction with enhancers, modulates the transcription of Igf2 and H19 genes in 
an allele-specific manner. On paternal inheritance, the methylated ICR silences 
the H19 gene and indirectly facilitates transcription from the distant Igf2 
promoter, whereas on the maternal chromosome the unmethylated ICR, together with 
enhancers, activates transcription of the H19 gene and thereby contributes to 
the repression of Igf2. This repression of maternal Igf2 has recently been 
postulated to be due to a chromatin boundary or insulator function of the 
unmethylated ICR. Central to the insulator model is the site-specific binding of 
a ubiquitous nuclear factor CTCF which exhibits remarkable flexibility in 
functioning as transcriptional activator or silencer. We suggest that the ICR 
positioned close to the enhancers in an episomal context might function as a 
transcriptional silencer by virtue of interaction of CTCF with its modifiers 
such as SIN3A and histone deacetylases. Furthermore, a localised folded 
chromatin structure resulting from juxtaposition of two disparate regulatory 
sequences (enhancer ICR) could be the mechanistic basis of ICR-mediated 
position-dependent (ICR-promoter) transcriptional repression in transgenic 
Drosophila.

Chromatin structure and 3D architecture define differential functions of PU.1 
cis regulatory elements in human blood cell lineages.

The precise spatio-temporal expression of the hematopoietic ETS transcription 
factor PU.1 that determines the hematopoietic cell fates is tightly regulated at 
the chromatin level. However, it remains elusive as to how chromatin signatures 
are linked to this dynamic expression pattern of PU.1 across blood cell 
lineages. Here we performed an unbiased and in-depth analysis of the 
relationship between human PU.1 expression, the presence of trans-acting 
factors, and 3D architecture at various cis-regulatory elements (CRE) proximal 
to the PU.1 locus. We identified multiple novel CREs at the upstream region of 
the gene following an integrative inspection for conserved DNA elements at the 
chromatin-accessible regions in primary human blood lineages. We showed that a 
subset of CREs localize within a 10 kb-wide cluster that exhibits that exhibit 
molecular features of a myeloid-specific super-enhancer involved in mediating 
PU.1 autoregulation, including open chromatin, unmethylated DNA, histone 
enhancer marks, transcription of enhancer RNAs, and occupancy of the PU.1 
protein itself. Importantly, we revealed the presence of common 35-kb-wide 
CTCF-bound insulated neighborhood that contains the CRE cluster, forming the 
chromatin territory for lineage-specific and CRE-mediated chromatin 
interactions. These include functional CRE-promoter interactions in myeloid and 
B cells but not in erythroid and T cells. Our findings also provide mechanistic 
insights into the interplay between dynamic chromatin structure and 3D 
architecture in defining certain CREs as enhancers or silencers in chromatin 
regulation of PU.1 expression. The study lays the groundwork for further 
examination of PU.1 CREs as well as epigenetic regulation in malignant 
hematopoiesis.

The barrier function of an insulator couples high histone acetylation levels 
with specific protection of promoter DNA from methylation.

Stably integrated transgenes flanked by the chicken beta-globin HS4 insulator 
are protected against chromosomal position effects and gradual extinction of 
expression during long-term propagation in culture. To investigate the mechanism 
of action of this insulator, we used bisulfite genomic sequencing to examine the 
methylation of individual CpG sites within insulated transgenes, and compared 
this with patterns of histone acetylation. Surprisingly, although the histones 
of the entire insulated transgene are highly acetylated, only a specific region 
in the promoter, containing binding sites for erythroid-specific transcription 
factors, is highly protected from DNA methylation. This critical region is 
methylated in noninsulated and inactive lines. MBD3 and Mi-2, subunits of the 
Mi-2/NuRD repressor complex, are bound in vivo to these silenced noninsulated 
transgenes. In contrast, insulated cell lines do not show any enrichment of 
Mi-2/NuRD proteins very late in culture. In addition to the high levels of 
histone acetylation observed across the entire insulated transgene, significant 
peaks of H3 acetylation are present over the HS4 insulator elements. Targeted 
histone acetylation by the chicken beta-globin insulator occurs independently of 
gene transcription and does not require the presence of a functional enhancer. 
We suggest that this acetylation is in turn responsible for the maintenance of a 
region of unmethylated DNA over the promoter. Whereas DNA methylation often 
leads to histone deacetylation, here acetylation appears to prevent methylation.

Modulation of thyroid hormone receptor silencing function by co-repressors and a 
synergizing transcription factor.

We have found that the thyroid hormone receptor (T3R) functionally synergizes 
with the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF). CTCF is a highly conserved zinc-finger 
protein that has been connected with multiple functions in gene regulation 
including chromatin insulator activity, transcriptional enhancement and 
silencing as well as tumour suppression. A specific property of CTCF is that 
some of the binding sites are found in the vicinity of T3R-binding sites. 
Interestingly, both factors synergize in repression as well as in activation. 
T3R-mediated repression has been shown to involve co-repressors such as the 
silencing mediator for retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptor (SMRT), N-CoR 
or Alien. These co-repressors in turn have been found to interact with Sin3A. 
Until now, the mechanisms by which CTCF synergizes with T3R in transcriptional 
repression has not been determined. Here we show that CTCF comprises autonomous 
silencing domains that mediate transcriptional repression when tethered to a 
promoter sequence. At least one of these domains, the zinc-finger region of 
CTCF, binds Sin3A without binding to SMRT or N-CoR and recruits histone 
deacetylation activity. For Sin3A we identified two different domains 
interacting independently with the CTCF zinc-finger cluster. The ability of 
regions of CTCF to retain deacetylase activity is correlated with the ability to 
bind to Sin3A and to repress transcription. Taking these results together, the 
synergy in repression mediated by T3R and CTCF might be achieved by the binding 
of multiple molecules of Sin3A to the T3R/CTCF-DNA complex, thus providing a 
large platform for the recruitment of histone deacetylases.

The correct deployment of genetic programs for development and differentiation 
relies on finely coordinated regulation of specific gene sets. Genomic 
regulatory elements play an exceptional role in this process. There are few 
types of gene regulatory elements, including promoters, enhancers, insulators 
and silencers. Alterations of gene regulatory elements may cause various 
pathologies, including cancer, congenital disorders and autoimmune diseases. The 
development of high-throughput genomic assays has made it possible to 
significantly accelerate the accumulation of information about the 
characteristic epigenetic properties of regulatory elements. In combination with 
high-throughput studies focused on the genome-wide distribution of epigenetic 
marks, regulatory proteins and the spatial structure of chromatin, this 
significantly expands the understanding of the principles of epigenetic 
regulation of genes and allows potential regulatory elements to be searched for 
in silico. However, common experimental approaches used to study the local 
characteristics of chromatin have a number of technical limitations that may 
reduce the reliability of computational identification of genomic regulatory 
sequences. Taking into account the variability of the functions of epigenetic 
determinants and complex multicomponent regulation of genomic elements activity, 
their functional verification is often required. A plethora of methods have been 
developed to study the functional role of regulatory elements on the genome 
scale. Common experimental approaches for in silico identification of regulatory 
elements and their inherent technical limitations will be described. The present 
review is focused on original high-throughput methods of enhancer activity 
reporter analysis that are currently used to validate predicted regulatory 
elements and to perform de novo searches. The methods described allow assessing 
the functional role of the nucleotide sequence of a regulatory element, to 
determine its exact boundaries and to assess the influence of the local state of 
chromatin on the activity of enhancers and gene expression. These approaches 
have contributed substantially to the understanding of the fundamental 
principles of gene regulation.

Chromatin boundaries regulate gene expression by modulating enhancer-promoter 
interactions and insulating transcriptional influences from organized chromatin. 
However, mechanistic distinctions between these two aspects of boundary function 
are not well understood. Here we show that SF1, a chromatin boundary located in 
the Drosophila Antennapedia complex (ANT-C), can insulate the transgenic 
miniwhite reporter from both enhancing and silencing effects of surrounding 
genome, a phenomenon known as chromosomal position effect or CPE. We found that 
the CPE-blocking activity associates with different SF1 sub-regions from a 
previously characterized insulator that blocks enhancers in transgenic embryos, 
and is independent of GAF-binding sites essential for the embryonic insulator 
activity. We further provide evidence that the CPE-blocking activity cannot be 
attributed to an enhancer-blocking activity in the developing eye. Our results 
suggest that SF1 contains multiple non-overlapping activities that block diverse 
transcriptional influences from embryonic or adult enhancers, and from positive 
and negative chromatin structure. Such diverse insulating capabilities are 
consistent with the proposed roles of SF1 to functionally separate fushi tarazu 
(ftz), a non-Hox gene, from the enhancers and the organized chromatin of the 
neighboring Hox genes.

Retroviruses are highly susceptible to transcriptional silencing and position 
effects imparted by chromosomal sequences at their integration site. These 
phenomena hamper the use of recombinant retroviruses as stable gene delivery 
vectors. As insulators are able to block promoter-enhancer interactions and 
reduce position effects in some transgenic animals, we examined the effect of an 
insulator on the expression and structure of randomly integrated recombinant 
retroviruses. We used the cHS4 element, an insulator from the chicken beta-like 
globin gene cluster, which has been shown to reduce position effects in 
transgenic Drosophila. A large panel of mouse erythroleukemia cells that bear a 
single copy of integrated recombinant retroviruses was generated without using 
drug selection. We show that the cHS4 increases the probability that integrated 
proviruses will express and dramatically decreases the level of de novo 
methylation of the 5' long terminal repeat. These findings support a primary 
role of methylation in the silencing of retroviruses and suggest that cHS4 could 
be useful in gene therapy applications to overcome silencing of retroviral 
vectors.

Eukaryotic genomic DNA is organized into loop structures by attachments to the 
nuclear matrix. These attachments to the nuclear matrix have been supposed to 
form the boundaries of chromosomal DNA. Insulators or boundary elements are 
defined by two characteristics: they interrupt promoter-enhancer communications 
when inserted between them, and they suppress the silencing of transgenes stably 
integrated into inactive chromosomal domains. We recently identified an 
insulator element in the upstream region of the sea urchin arylsulfatase (HpArs) 
gene that shows both enhancer blocking and suppression of position effects. 
Here, we report that Unichrom, originally identified by its G-stretch DNA 
binding capability, is a nuclear matrix protein that binds to the Ars insulator 
and canonical nuclear matrix attachment regions (MARs). We also show that 
Unichrom recognizes the minor groove of the AT-rich region within the Ars 
insulator, which may have a base-unpairing property, as well as the G-stretch 
DNA. Furthermore, Unichrom selectively interacts with poly(dG).poly(dC), 
poly(dA).poly(dT) and poly(dAT).poly(dAT), but not with poly(dGC).poly(dGC). 
Unichrom also shows high affinity for single-stranded G- and C-stretches. We 
discuss the DNA binding motif of Unichrom and the function of Unichrom in the 
nuclear matrix.

In eukaryotic cells, transcription of every protein-coding gene begins with the 
assembly of an RNA polymerase II preinitiation complex (PIC) on the promoter. 
The promoters, in conjunction with enhancers, silencers and insulators, define 
the combinatorial codes that specify gene expression patterns. Our ability to 
analyse the control logic encoded in the human genome is currently limited by a 
lack of accurate information regarding the promoters for most genes. Here we 
describe a genome-wide map of active promoters in human fibroblast cells, 
determined by experimentally locating the sites of PIC binding throughout the 
human genome. This map defines 10,567 active promoters corresponding to 6,763 
known genes and at least 1,196 un-annotated transcriptional units. Features of 
the map suggest extensive use of multiple promoters by the human genes and 
widespread clustering of active promoters in the genome. In addition, 
examination of the genome-wide expression profile reveals four general classes 
of promoters that define the transcriptome of the cell. These results provide a 
global view of the functional relationships among transcriptional machinery, 
chromatin structure and gene expression in human cells.

Polycomb domain formation depends on short and long distance regulatory cues.

BACKGROUND: Polycomb group (PcG) proteins dynamically define cellular identities 
through the epigenetic repression of key developmental genes. In Drosophila, 
cis-regulatory regions termed PcG response elements (PREs) act as nucleation 
sites for PcG proteins to create large repressive PcG domains that are marked by 
trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me3). In addition to an action 
in cis, PREs can interact over long distances, thereby enhancing PcG dependent 
silencing. How PcG domains are established, which factors limit their 
propagation in cis, and how long range interactions of PREs in trans affect the 
chromatin structure is largely unknown.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We demonstrate that the insertion of a PRE-containing 
transgene in the Drosophila genome generates an artificial PcG domain and we 
analyze its organization by quantitative ChIP and ChIP-on-chip experiments. 
Intriguingly, a boundary element and known insulator proteins do not necessarily 
interfere with spreading of H3K27me3. Instead, domain borders correlate with the 
presence of promoter regions bound by RNA Polymerase II and active chromatin 
marks. In contrast, genes that are silent during early fly development get 
included within the PcG domain and this incorporation interferes with gene 
activation at later developmental stages. Moreover, trans-interaction of the 
transgenic PRE with its homologous endogenous PRE results in increased PcG 
binding, correlating with reinforced silencing of genes within the domain 
borders.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that higher-order organization of PcG-bound 
chromatin can stabilize gene silencing within PcG domains. Further we propose 
that multi-protein complexes associated with active promoters are able to define 
the limits of PcG domains. Future work aimed to pinpoint the factors providing 
this barrier function will be required to understand the precise molecular 
mechanism by which active promoter regions can act as boundaries to stop 
spreading of H3K27me3.

Mapping DNase I hypersensitive (HS) sites is an accurate method of identifying 
the location of genetic regulatory elements, including promoters, enhancers, 
silencers, insulators, and locus control regions. We employed high-throughput 
sequencing and whole-genome tiled array strategies to identify DNase I HS sites 
within human primary CD4+ T cells. Combining these two technologies, we have 
created a comprehensive and accurate genome-wide open chromatin map. 
Surprisingly, only 16%-21% of the identified 94,925 DNase I HS sites are found 
in promoters or first exons of known genes, but nearly half of the most open 
sites are in these regions. In conjunction with expression, motif, and chromatin 
immunoprecipitation data, we find evidence of cell-type-specific 
characteristics, including the ability to identify transcription start sites and 
locations of different chromatin marks utilized in these cells. In addition, and 
unexpectedly, our analyses have uncovered detailed features of nucleosome 
structure.

It is well established that gene expression in eukaryotes is controlled by 
sequence-dependent binding of trans-acting proteins to regulatory elements like 
promoters, enhancers or silencers. A less well understood level of gene 
regulation is governed by the various structural and functional states of 
chromatin, which have been ascribed to changes in covalent modification of core 
histone proteins. And, much on how topological domains in the genome take part 
in establishing and maintaining distinct gene expression patterns is still 
unknown. Here we present a set of regulatory proteins that allow to reversibly 
alter the DNA structure in vivo and in vitro by adding low molecular weight 
effectors that control their oligomerization and DNA binding. Using this 
approach, we completely regulate the activity of an SV40 enhancer in HeLa cells 
by reversible loop formation to topologically separate it from the promoter. 
This result establishes a new mechanism for DNA-structure-dependent gene 
regulation in vivo and provides evidence supporting the structural model of 
insulator function.

We have examined the expression of cloned genes following their stable 
integration into the genome of pluripotent embryonal carcinoma stem cells. 
Transfected genes integrate into the genome as tandem arrays. Expression of 
reporter genes from these tandem arrays in embryonal carcinoma cells is 
inefficient probably because genes are subject to repeat-induced gene silencing. 
We found that expression of reporter genes was significantly enhanced if 
co-transfected with cloned fragments derived from the murine Pgk-1 gene. The 
enhanced expression required (a) that the Pgk-1 fragment carries an active 
promoter, (b) that the promoter drives transcription through a region of more 
than 12 kbp, and (c) that this transcribed region contains both introns and 
exons. Reporter gene activity did not require specific Pgk-1 DNA sequences 
suggesting that the coupled processes of transcription and RNA processing 
conferred activity on neighboring genes probably by influencing local chromatin 
structure. Consistent with this idea, the effect of the Pgk-1 gene could be 
mimicked by exposing cells to butyrate or trichostatin A, inhibitors of histone 
deacetylase. Thus, the effect of the co-transfected Pgk-1 gene is to inhibit the 
process of gene inactivation possibly by functioning like an insulator or 
boundary element in the chromatin.

gene from chromosomal position-effects.

Mutations in the suppressor of Hairy-wing [su(Hw)] locus reverse the phenotype 
of a number of tissue-specific mutations caused by insertion of a gypsy 
retrotransposon. The su(Hw) gene encodes a zinc finger protein which binds to a 
430 bp region of gypsy shown to be both necessary and sufficient for its 
mutagenic effects. su(Hw) protein causes mutations by inactivation of enhancer 
elements only when a su(Hw) binding region is located between these regulatory 
sequences and a promoter. To understand the molecular basis of enhancer 
inactivation, we tested the effects of su(Hw) protein on expression of the 
mini-white gene. We find that su(Hw) protein stabilizes mini-white gene 
expression from chromosomal position-effects in euchromatic locations by 
inactivating negative and positive regulatory elements present in flanking DNA. 
Furthermore, the su(Hw) protein partially protects transposon insertions from 
the negative effects of heterochromatin. To explain our current results, we 
propose that su(Hw) protein alters the organization of chromatin by creating a 
new boundary in a pre-existing domain of higher order chromatin structure. This 
separates enhancers and silencers distal to the su(Hw) binding region into an 
independent unit of gene activity, thereby causing their inactivation.

Expression vectors (EVs) are artificial nucleic acid molecules with a modular 
structure that allows for the transcription of DNA sequences of interest in 
either cellular or cell-free environments. These vectors have emerged as 
cross-disciplinary tools with multiple applications in an expanding Life 
Sciences market. The cis-regulatory sequences (CRSs) that control the 
transcription in EVs are typically sourced from either viruses or from 
characterized genes. However, the recent advancement in transposable elements 
(TEs) technology provides attractive alternatives that may enable a significant 
improvement in the design of EVs. Commonly known as "jumping genes," due to 
their ability to move between genetic loci, TEs are constitutive components of 
both eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomes. TEs harbor native CRSs that allow the 
regulated transcription of transposition-related genes. However, some TE-related 
CRSs display striking characteristics, which provides the opportunity to 
reconsider TEs as lead actors in the design of EVs. In this article, we provide 
a synopsis of the transcriptional control elements commonly found in EVs 
together with an extensive discussion of their advantages and limitations. We 
also highlight the latest findings that may allow for the implementation of 
TE-derived sequences in the EVs feasible, possibly improving existing vectors. 
By introducing this new concept of TEs as a source of regulatory sequences, we 
aim to stimulate a profitable discussion of the potential advantages and 
benefits of developing a new generation of EVs based on the use of TE-derived 
control sequences.

A three-dimensional chromatin state underpins the structural and functional 
basis of the genome by bringing regulatory elements and genes into close spatial 
proximity to ensure proper, cell-type-specific gene expression profiles. Here, 
we performed Hi-C chromosome conformation capture sequencing to investigate how 
three-dimensional chromatin organization is disrupted in the context of 
copy-number variation, long-range epigenetic remodeling, and atypical gene 
expression programs in prostate cancer. We find that cancer cells retain the 
ability to segment their genomes into megabase-sized topologically associated 
domains (TADs); however, these domains are generally smaller due to 
establishment of additional domain boundaries. Interestingly, a large proportion 
of the new cancer-specific domain boundaries occur at regions that display 
copy-number variation. Notably, a common deletion on 17p13.1 in prostate cancer 
spanning the TP53 tumor suppressor locus results in bifurcation of a single TAD 
into two distinct smaller TADs. Change in domain structure is also accompanied 
by novel cancer-specific chromatin interactions within the TADs that are 
enriched at regulatory elements such as enhancers, promoters, and insulators, 
and associated with alterations in gene expression. We also show that 
differential chromatin interactions across regulatory regions occur within 
long-range epigenetically activated or silenced regions of concordant gene 
activation or repression in prostate cancer. Finally, we present a novel 
visualization tool that enables integrated exploration of Hi-C interaction data, 
the transcriptome, and epigenome. This study provides new insights into the 
relationship between long-range epigenetic and genomic dysregulation and changes 
in higher-order chromatin interactions in cancer.

Chromatin insulators, which define domains of transcriptional autonomy, are 
cis-acting elements of eukaryotes. They are located at the boundaries of 
differentially regulated genes and delimit their interactions by establishing 
independent chromatin structures. They can block chromosomal enhancers or 
silencers if they are located between promoters and enhancers or silencers, and 
protect against position effect. Recent studies focus on elucidating the 
molecular mechanism of insulator functions. Loop Model is the most predominant 
hypothesis while others are assumed. Study progress in this field sheds new 
light on the regulation of gene expression.

It is thought that the H19 imprinting control region (ICR) directs the silencing 
of the maternally inherited Igf2 allele through a CTCF-dependent chromatin 
insulator. The ICR has been shown to interact physically with a silencer region 
in Igf2, differentially methylated region (DMR)1, but the role of CTCF in this 
chromatin loop and whether it restricts the physical access of distal enhancers 
to Igf2 is not known. We performed systematic chromosome conformation capture 
analyses in the Igf2/H19 region over >160 kb, identifying sequences that 
interact physically with the distal enhancers and the ICR. We found that, on the 
paternal chromosome, enhancers interact with the Igf2 promoters but that, on the 
maternal allele, this is prevented by CTCF binding within the H19 ICR. CTCF 
binding in the maternal ICR regulates its interaction with matrix attachment 
region (MAR)3 and DMR1 at Igf2, thus forming a tight loop around the maternal 
Igf2 locus, which may contribute to its silencing. Mutation of CTCF binding 
sites in the H19 ICR leads to loss of CTCF binding and de novo methylation of a 
CTCF target site within Igf2 DMR1, showing that CTCF can coordinate regional 
epigenetic marks. This systematic chromosome conformation capture analysis of an 
imprinting cluster reveals that CTCF has a critical role in the epigenetic 
regulation of higher-order chromatin structure and gene silencing over 
considerable distances in the genome.

Genetic information is organized in a complex structure composed of DNA and 
proteins together designated chromatin. Chromatin plays a dynamic role in 
transcriptional processes in that alteration of the interaction between its 
components results in the deregulation of cellular transcriptional program. 
Modification of epigenetic marks, variation in the precise positioning of 
nucleosomes, and consequent mobilization of nucleosomes regulate the access of 
various transcriptional factors to its underlying DNA template. 
Nucleosome-depleted regions, also designated open chromatin domains, are 
associated with active DNA regulatory elements, including promoters, enhancers, 
silencers, and insulators. Here, we describe the protocol of a rapid and simple 
technique entitled FAIRE (formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory 
elements). Combined with high-throughput sequencing (FAIRE-seq), this procedure 
allows isolation of nucleosome-free regions and their mapping along the genome, 
thereby providing a global view of cell-specific regulatory elements.

A new perspective is emerging in the transcription field towards understanding 
gene regulation not only at its most fundamental level but also in the context 
of chromatin, nuclear compartmentalization, and physiological processes. This 
direction is being fueled by several key observations. Among them is the 
discovery of multi-protein complexes whose components reveal a link between gene 
activity, nuclear structure, and cellular signaling pathways. This information 
will no doubt be extended by identifying expanded regulatory circuitry using the 
microchip oligonucleotide array technology. In addition to elucidating the 
regulatory consequences of these intricate connections, another frontier will be 
to analyze gene expression within chromosomes. This requires deciphering the 
mechanism of action of a variety of DNA elements that create a genetic domain 
such as locus control regions, distal enhancers, insulators, silencers, and 
matrix attachment regions. Hopefully, with the development of new assays these 
elements can be as rigorously defined as promoters have been. We can also look 
forward to capturing critical transcriptional processes by increasingly refined 
structural analyses. Thus, the scope of problems being addressed in gene 
regulation has been greatly expanded and the opportunity exists to answer very 
sophisticated questions in the future.

BACKGROUND: Binding of transcription factors to transcription factor binding 
sites (TFBSs) is key to the mediation of transcriptional regulation. Information 
on experimentally validated functional TFBSs is limited and consequently there 
is a need for accurate prediction of TFBSs for gene annotation and in 
applications such as evaluating the effects of single nucleotide variations in 
causing disease. TFBSs are generally recognized by scanning a position weight 
matrix (PWM) against DNA using one of a number of available computer programs. 
Thus we set out to evaluate the best tools that can be used locally (and are 
therefore suitable for large-scale analyses) for creating PWMs from 
high-throughput ChIP-Seq data and for scanning them against DNA.
RESULTS: We evaluated a set of de novo motif discovery tools that could be 
downloaded and installed locally using ENCODE-ChIP-Seq data and showed that 
rGADEM was the best-performing tool. TFBS prediction tools used to scan PWMs 
against DNA fall into two classes - those that predict individual TFBSs and 
those that identify clusters. Our evaluation showed that FIMO and MCAST 
performed best respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Selection of the best-performing tools for generating PWMs from 
ChIP-Seq data and for scanning PWMs against DNA has the potential to improve 
prediction of precise transcription factor binding sites within regions 
identified by ChIP-Seq experiments for gene finding, understanding regulation 
and in evaluating the effects of single nucleotide variations in causing 
disease.

Transcription Factor-DNA Binding Motifs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae: Tools and 
Resources.

Computational Biology, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina 27708.

The DNA binding specificity of transcription factors (TFs) is typically 
represented in the form of a position weight matrix (PWM), also known as a DNA 
motif. A PWM is a matrix that specifies, for each position in the DNA binding 
site of a TF, the "weight" or contribution of each possible nucleotide. DNA 
motifs can be derived from various types of TF-DNA binding data, from small 
collections of known TF binding sites to large data sets generated using 
high-throughput technologies. One drawback of this simple model of DNA binding 
specificity is that it makes the implicit assumption that individual base pairs 
within a TF binding site contribute independently to the TF-DNA binding 
affinity. Although this assumption does not always hold, PWM models have been 
shown to provide reasonable approximations to the DNA binding specificity, and 
they are still widely used in practice. DNA motifs are currently available for 
more than 150 Saccharomyces cerevisiae TFs. Here, we briefly describe how these 
models are built, we provide information on databases containing DNA motifs for 
S. cerevisiae TFs, and we introduce guidelines on how to interpret the motifs 
and use them in practice to generate hypotheses about transcriptional regulatory 
regions.

BACKGROUND: Positional weight matrix (PWM) is a de facto standard model to 
describe transcription factor (TF) DNA binding specificities. PWMs inferred from 
in vivo or in vitro data are stored in many databases and used in a plethora of 
biological applications. This calls for comprehensive benchmarking of public PWM 
models with large experimental reference sets.
RESULTS: Here we report results from all-against-all benchmarking of PWM models 
for DNA binding sites of human TFs on a large compilation of in vitro (HT-SELEX, 
PBM) and in vivo (ChIP-seq) binding data. We observe that the best performing 
PWM for a given TF often belongs to another TF, usually from the same family. 
Occasionally, binding specificity is correlated with the structural class of the 
DNA binding domain, indicated by good cross-family performance measures. 
Benchmarking-based selection of family-representative motifs is more effective 
than motif clustering-based approaches. Overall, there is good agreement between 
in vitro and in vivo performance measures. However, for some in vivo 
experiments, the best performing PWM is assigned to an unrelated TF, indicating 
a binding mode involving protein-protein cooperativity.
CONCLUSIONS: In an all-against-all setting, we compute more than 18 million 
performance measure values for different PWM-experiment combinations and offer 
these results as a public resource to the research community. The benchmarking 
protocols are provided via a web interface and as docker images. The methods and 
results from this study may help others make better use of public TF specificity 
models, as well as public TF binding data sets.

Models of transcription factor (TF) binding sites provide a basis for a wide 
spectrum of studies in regulatory genomics, from reconstruction of regulatory 
networks to functional annotation of transcripts and sequence variants. While 
TFs may recognize different sequence patterns in different conditions, it is 
pragmatic to have a single generic model for each particular TF as a baseline 
for practical applications. Here we present the expanded and enhanced version of 
HOCOMOCO (http://hocomoco.autosome.ru and 
http://www.cbrc.kaust.edu.sa/hocomoco10), the collection of models of DNA 
patterns, recognized by transcription factors. HOCOMOCO now provides position 
weight matrix (PWM) models for binding sites of 601 human TFs and, in addition, 
PWMs for 396 mouse TFs. Furthermore, we introduce the largest up to date 
collection of dinucleotide PWM models for 86 (52) human (mouse) TFs. The update 
is based on the analysis of massive ChIP-Seq and HT-SELEX datasets, with the 
validation of the resulting models on in vivo data. To facilitate a practical 
application, all HOCOMOCO models are linked to gene and protein databases 
(Entrez Gene, HGNC, UniProt) and accompanied by precomputed score thresholds. 
Finally, we provide command-line tools for PWM and diPWM threshold estimation 
and motif finding in nucleotide sequences.

BACKGROUND: Transcription factors (TFs) bind regulatory DNA regions with 
sequence specificity, form complexes and regulate gene expression. In 
cooperative TF-TF binding, two transcription factors bind onto a shared DNA 
binding site as a pair. Previous work has demonstrated pairwise TF-TF-DNA 
interactions with position weight matrices (PWMs), which may however not 
sufficiently take into account the complexity and flexibility of pairwise 
binding.
RESULTS: We propose two random forest (RF) methods for joint TF-TF binding site 
prediction: ComBind and JointRF. We train models with previously published 
large-scale CAP-SELEX DNA libraries, which comprise DNA sequences enriched for 
binding of a selected TF pair. JointRF builds a random forest with sub-sequences 
selected from CAP-SELEX DNA reads with previously proposed pairwise PWM. JointRF 
outperforms (area under receiver operating characteristics curve, AUROC, 0.75) 
the current state-of-the-art method i.e. orientation and spacing specific 
pairwise PWMs (AUROC 0.59). Thus, JointRF may be utilized to improve prediction 
accuracy for pre-determined binding preferences. However, pairwise TF binding is 
currently considered flexible; a pair may bind DNA with different orientations 
and amounts of dinucleotide gaps or overlap between the two motifs. Thus, we 
developed ComBind, which utilizes random forests by considering simultaneously 
multiple orientations and spacings of the two factors. Our approach outperforms 
(AUROC 0.78) PWMs, as well as JointRF (p<0.00195). ComBind provides an approach 
for predicting TF-TF binding sites without prior knowledge on pairwise binding 
preferences. However, more research is needed to assess ComBind eligibility for 
practical applications.
CONCLUSIONS: Random forest is well suited for modeling pairwise TF-TF-DNA 
binding specificities, and ComBind provides an improvement to pairwise binding 
site prediction accuracy.

Product Research and Infection Biology, Hans Knöll Institute, 07745 Jena,

MOTIVATION: Prediction of transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) is crucial 
for promoter modeling and network inference. Quality of the predictions is 
spoiled by numerous false positives, which persist as the main problem for all 
presently available TFBS search methods.
RESULTS: We suggest a novel approach, which is alternative to widely used 
position weight matrices (PWMs) and Hidden Markov Models. Each motif of the 
input set is used as a search template to scan a query sequence. Found motifs 
are assigned scores depending on the non-randomness of the motif's occurrence, 
the number of matching searching motifs and the number of mismatches. The 
non-randomness is estimated by comparison of observed numbers of matching motifs 
with those predicted to occur by chance. The latter can be calculated given the 
base compositions of the motif and the query sequence. The method does not 
require preliminary alignment of the input motifs, hence avoiding uncertainties 
introduced by the alignment procedure. In comparison with PWM-based tools, our 
method demonstrates higher precision by the same sensitivity and specificity. It 
also tends to outperform methods combining pattern and PWM search. Most 
important, it allows reducing the number of false positive predictions 
significantly.
AVAILABILITY: The method is implemented in a tool called SiTaR (Site Tracking 
and Recognition) and is available at http://sbi.hki-jena.de/sitar/index.php.

A DNA sequence pattern, or "motif", is an essential representation of 
DNA-binding specificity of a transcription factor (TF). Any particular motif 
model has potential flaws due to shortcomings of the underlying experimental 
data and computational motif discovery algorithm. As a part of the 
Codebook/GRECO-BIT initiative, here we evaluated at large scale the 
cross-platform recognition performance of positional weight matrices (PWMs), 
which remain popular motif models in many practical applications. We applied ten 
different DNA motif discovery tools to generate PWMs from the "Codebook" data 
comprised of 4,237 experiments from five different platforms profiling the 
DNA-binding specificity of 394 human proteins, focusing on understudied 
transcription factors of different structural families. For many of the 
proteins, there was no prior knowledge of a genuine motif. By 
benchmarking-supported human curation, we constructed an approved subset of 
experiments comprising about 30% of all experiments and 50% of tested TFs which 
displayed consistent motifs across platforms and replicates. We present the 
Codebook Motif Explorer (https://mex.autosome.org), a detailed online catalog of 
DNA motifs, including the top-ranked PWMs, and the underlying source and 
benchmarking data. We demonstrate that in the case of high-quality experimental 
data, most of the popular motif discovery tools detect valid motifs and generate 
PWMs, which perform well both on genomic and synthetic data. Yet, for each of 
the algorithms, there were problematic combinations of proteins and platforms, 
and the basic motif properties such as nucleotide composition and information 
content offered little help in detecting such pitfalls. By combining multiple 
PMWs in decision trees, we demonstrate how our setup can be readily adapted to 
train and test binding specificity models more complex than PWMs. Overall, our 
study provides a rich motif catalog as a solid baseline for advanced models and 
highlights the power of the multi-platform multi-tool approach for reliable 
mapping of DNA binding specificities.

Transcription factors (TFs) are essential regulatory proteins controlling the 
cellular transcriptional states by binding to specific DNA sequences known as 
transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) or motifs. Accurate TFBS 
identification is crucial for unraveling regulatory mechanisms driving cellular 
dynamics. Over the years, various computational approaches have been developed 
to model TFBSs, with position weight matrices (PWMs) being one of the most 
widely adopted methods. PWMs provide a probabilistic framework by representing 
nucleotide frequencies at every position within the binding site. While 
effective and interpretable, PWMs face significant limitations, such as their 
inability to capture positional dependencies or model complex interactions. To 
address these, advanced methods, like support vector machine (SVM)-based, and 
deep learning (DL)-based models, have been introduced. Leveraging human ChIP-seq 
data from ENCODE, we systematically benchmarked the predictive performance of 
PWM, SVM-, and DL-based models across different scenarios. We evaluate the 
impact of key factors such as training dataset size, sequence length, and kernel 
functions (for SVMs) on models' performance. Additionally, we explore the impact 
of synthetic versus real biological background data during model training. Our 
analysis highlights strengths and limitations of each approach under different 
conditions, providing practical guidance for selecting and tailoring models to 
specific biological datasets. To complement our analysis, we present a 
comprehensive database of pretrained SVM models for TFBS detection, trained on 
human ChIP-seq data from diverse cell lines and tissues. This resource aims to 
facilitate broader adoption of SVM-based methods in TFBS prediction and enhance 
their practical utility in regulatory genomics research.

University, Tianjin, China.

All the cell types are under strict control of how their genes are transcribed 
into expressed transcripts by the temporally dynamic orchestration of the 
transcription factor binding activities. Given a set of known binding sites 
(BSs) of a given transcription factor (TF), computational TFBS screening 
technique represents a cost efficient and large scale strategy to complement the 
experimental ones. There are two major classes of computational TFBS prediction 
algorithms based on the tertiary and primary structures, respectively. A 
tertiary structure based algorithm tries to calculate the binding affinity 
between a query DNA fragment and the tertiary structure of the given TF. Due to 
the limited number of available TF tertiary structures, primary structure based 
TFBS prediction algorithm is a necessary complementary technique for large scale 
TFBS screening. This study proposes a novel evolutionary algorithm to randomly 
mutate the weights of different positions in the binding motif of a TF, so that 
the overall TFBS prediction accuracy is optimized. The comparison with the most 
widely used algorithm, Position Weight Matrix (PWM), suggests that our algorithm 
performs better or the same level in all the performance measurements, including 
sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and Matthews correlation coefficient. Our 
data also suggests that it is necessary to remove the widely used assumption of 
independence between motif positions. The supplementary material may be found

Position weight matrix (PWM) is the traditional motif model representing the 
transcription factor (TF) binding sites. It proposes that the positions 
contribute independently to TFs binding affinity, although this hypothesis does 
not fit the data perfectly. This explains why PWM hits are missing in a 
substantial fraction of ChIP-seq peaks. To study various modes of the direct 
binding of plant TFs, we compiled the benchmark collection of 111 ChIP-seq 
datasets for Arabidopsis thaliana, and applied the traditional PWM, and two 
alternative motif models BaMM and SiteGA, proposing the dependencies of the 
positions. The variation in the stringency of the recognition thresholds for the 
models proposed that the hits of PWM, BaMM, and SiteGA models are associated 
with the sites of high/medium, any, and low affinity, respectively. At the 
medium recognition threshold, about 60% of ChIP-seq peaks contain PWM hits 
consisting of conserved core consensuses, while BaMM and SiteGA provide hits for 
an additional 15% of peaks in which a weaker core consensus is compensated 
through intra-motif dependencies. The presence/absence of these dependencies in 
the motifs of alternative/traditional models was confirmed by the dependency 
logo DepLogo visualizing the position-wise partitioning of the alignments of 
predicted sites. We exemplify the detailed analysis of ChIP-seq profiles for 
plant TFs CCA1, MYC2, and SEP3. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis revealed 
that among the three motif models, the SiteGA had the highest portions of genes 
with the significantly enriched GO terms among all predicted genes. We showed 
that both alternative motif models provide for traditional PWM greater 
extensions in predicted sites for TFs MYC2/SEP3 with condition/tissue specific 
functions, compared to those for TF CCA1 with housekeeping functions. Overall, 
the combined application of standard and alternative motif models is beneficial 
to detect various modes of the direct TF-DNA interactions in the maximal portion 
of ChIP-seq loci.

Modelling the regulatory mechanisms that determine cell fate, response to 
external perturbation, and disease state depends on measuring many factors, a 
task made more difficult by the plasticity of the epigenome. Scanning the genome 
for the sequence patterns defined by Position Weight Matrices (PWM) can be used 
to estimate transcription factor (TF) binding locations. However, this approach 
does not incorporate information regarding the epigenetic context necessary for 
TF binding. CpG methylation is an epigenetic mark influenced by environmental 
factors that is commonly assayed in human cohort studies. We developed a 
framework to score inferred TF binding locations using methylation data. We 
intersected motif locations identified using PWMs with methylation information 
captured in both whole-genome bisulfite sequencing and Illumina EPIC array data 
for six cell lines, scored motif locations based on these data, and compared 
with experimental data characterizing TF binding (ChIP-seq). We found that for 
most TFs, binding prediction improves using methylation-based scoring compared 
to standard PWM-scores. We also illustrate that our approach can be generalized 
to infer TF binding when methylation information is only proximally available, 
i.e. measured for nearby CpGs that do not directly overlap with a motif 
location. Overall, our approach provides a framework for inferring 
context-specific TF binding using methylation data. Importantly, the 
availability of DNA methylation data in existing patient populations provides an 
opportunity to use our approach to understand the impact of methylation on gene 
regulatory processes in the context of human disease.

Interpreting the functional impact of noncoding variants is an ongoing challenge 
in the field of genome analysis. With most noncoding variants associated with 
complex traits and disease residing in regulatory regions, altered transcription 
factor (TF) binding has been proposed as a mechanism of action. It is therefore 
imperative to develop methods that predict the impact of noncoding variants at 
TF binding sites (TFBSs). Here, we describe the update of our MANTA database 
that stores: 1) TFBS predictions in the human genome, and 2) the potential 
impact on TF binding for all possible single nucleotide variants (SNVs) at these 
TFBSs. TFBSs were predicted by combining experimental ChIP-seq data from ReMap 
and computational position weight matrices (PWMs) derived from JASPAR. Impact of 
SNVs at these TFBSs was assessed by means of PWM scores computed on the 
alternate alleles. The updated database, MANTA2, provides the scientific 
community with a critical map of TFBSs and SNV impact scores to improve the 
interpretation of noncoding variants in the human genome.

Modeling within-motif dependence for transcription factor binding site 
predictions.

Zhou Q(1), Liu JS.

Author information:
(1)Department of Statistics, Harvard University, 1 Oxford ST, Cambridge, MA 
02138, USA.

MOTIVATION: The position-specific weight matrix (PWM) model, which assumes that 
each position in the DNA site contributes independently to the overall 
protein-DNA interaction, has been the primary means to describe transcription 
factor binding site motifs. Recent biological experiments, however, suggest that 
there exists interdependence among positions in the binding sites. In order to 
exploit this interdependence to aid motif discovery, we extend the PWM model to 
include pairs of correlated positions and design a Markov chain Monte Carlo 
algorithm to sample in the model space. We then combine the model sampling step 
with the Gibbs sampling framework for de novo motif discoveries.
RESULTS: Testing on experimentally validated binding sites, we find that about 
25% of the transcription factor binding motifs show significant within-site 
position correlations, and 80% of these motif models can be improved by 
considering the correlated positions. Using both simulated data and real 
promoter sequences, we show that the new de novo motif-finding algorithm can 
infer the true correlated position pairs accurately and is more precise in 
finding putative transcription factor binding sites than the standard Gibbs 
sampling algorithms.

BACKGROUND: Transcription factors (TFs) play important roles in the regulation 
of gene expression. They can activate or block transcription of downstream genes 
in a manner of binding to specific genomic sequences. Therefore, motif discovery 
of these binding preference patterns is of central significance in the 
understanding of molecular regulation mechanism. Many algorithms have been 
proposed for the identification of transcription factor binding sites. However, 
it remains a challengeable problem.
RESULTS: Here, we proposed a novel motif discovery algorithm based on support 
vector machine (MD-SVM) to learn a discriminative model for TF binding sites. 
MD-SVM firstly obtains position weight matrix (PWM) from a set of training 
datasets. Then it translates the MD problem into a computational framework of 
multiple instance learning (MIL). It was applied to several real biological 
datasets. Results show that our algorithm outperforms MI-SVM in terms of both 
accuracy and specificity.
CONCLUSIONS: In this paper, we modeled the TF motif discovery problem as a MIL 
optimization problem. The SVM algorithm was adapted to discriminate positive and 
negative bags of instances. Compared to other svm-based algorithms, MD-SVM show 
its superiority over its competitors in term of ROC AUC. Hopefully, it could be 
of benefit to the research community in the understanding of molecular functions 
of DNA functional elements and transcription factors.

A sequence motif representing the DNA-binding specificity of a transcription 
factor (TF) is commonly modelled with a positional weight matrix (PWM). Focusing 
on understudied human TFs, we processed results of 4,237 experiments for 394 
TFs, assayed using five different experimental platforms. By human curation, we 
approved a subset of experiments that yielded consistent motifs across platforms 
and replicates, and evaluated quantitatively the cross-platform performance of 
PWMs obtained with ten motif discovery tools. Notably, nucleotide composition 
and information content are not correlated with motif performance and do not 
help in detecting underperformers, while motifs with low information content, in 
many cases, describe well the binding specificity assessed across different 
experimental platforms. By combining multiple PMWs into a random forest, we 
demonstrate the potential of accounting for multiple modes of TF binding. 
Finally, we present the Codebook Motif Explorer ( https://mex.autosome.org ), 
cataloguing motifs, benchmarking results, and the underlying experimental data.

BACKGROUND: Transcription factors regulate gene expression by binding to 
transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs). Most models for predicting TFBSs are 
based on position weight matrices (PWMs), which require a specific motif to be 
present in the DNA sequence and do not consider interdependencies of 
nucleotides. Novel approaches such as Transcription Factor Flexible Models or 
recurrent neural networks consequently provide higher accuracies. However, it is 
unclear whether such approaches can uncover novel non-canonical, hitherto 
unexpected TFBSs relevant to human transcriptional regulation.
RESULTS: In this study, we trained a convolutional recurrent neural network with 
HT-SELEX data for GRHL1 binding and applied it to a set of GRHL1 binding sites 
obtained from ChIP-Seq experiments from human cells. We identified 46 
non-canonical GRHL1 binding sites, which were not found by a conventional PWM 
approach. Unexpectedly, some of the newly predicted binding sequences lacked the 
CNNG core motif, so far considered obligatory for GRHL1 binding. Using 
isothermal titration calorimetry, we experimentally confirmed binding between 
the GRHL1-DNA binding domain and predicted GRHL1 binding sites, including a 
non-canonical GRHL1 binding site. Mutagenesis of individual nucleotides revealed 
a correlation between predicted binding strength and experimentally validated 
binding affinity across representative sequences. This correlation was neither 
observed with a PWM-based nor another deep learning approach.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that convolutional recurrent neural networks may 
uncover unanticipated binding sites and facilitate quantitative transcription 
factor binding predictions.

The most popular model for the search of ChIP-seq data for transcription factor 
binding sites (TFBS) is the positional weight matrix (PWM). However, this model 
does not take into account dependencies between nucleotide occurrences in 
different site positions. Currently, two recently proposed models, BaMM and 
InMoDe, can do as much. However, application of these models was usually limited 
only to comparing their recognition accuracies with that of PWMs, while none of 
the analyses of the co-prediction and relative positioning of hits of different 
models in peaks has yet been performed. To close this gap, we propose the 
pipeline called MultiDeNA. This pipeline includes stages of model training, 
assessing their recognition accuracy, scanning ChIP-seq peaks and their 
classification based on scan results. We applied our pipeline to 22 ChIP-seq 
datasets of TF FOXA2 and considered PWM, dinucleotide PWM (diPWM), BaMM and 
InMoDe models. The combination of these four models allowed a significant 
increase in the fraction of recognized peaks compared to that for the sole PWM 
model: the increase was 26.3 %. The BaMM model provided the main contribution to 
the recognition of sites. Although the major fraction of predicted peaks 
contained TFBS of different models with coincided positions, the medians of the 
fraction of peaks containing the predictions of sole models were 1.08, 0.49, 
4.15 and 1.73 % for PWM, diPWM, BaMM and InMoDe, respectively. Thus, FOXA2 BSs 
were not fully described by only a sole model, which indicates theirs 
heterogeneity. We assume that the BaMM model is the most successful in 
describing the structure of the FOXA2 BS in ChIP-seq datasets under study.

Publisher: . В настоящее время самой распространенной моделью поиска сайтов 
связывания транскрипционных факторов (ССТФ) в пиках ChIP-seq является 
позиционная весовая матрица (position weight matrix, PWM). Но эта модель не 
учитывает взаимосвязи между частотами встреч нуклеотидов в разных позициях ССТФ, 
поэтому не способна гарантировать определение всех возможных структурных 
вариантов ССТФ. На сегодняшний день уже предложены альтернативные модели, 
например BaMM и InMoDe, которые учитывают такие взаимосвязи. Однако применение 
этих моделей обычно сводилось к сравнению их точности с точностью традиционной 
модели PWM, тогда как анализ совместной встречаемости и относительного 
расположения ССТФ разных моделей в пиках не производился. В нашей работе мы 
предлагаем конвейер программ MultiDeNA, позволяющий сочетать разные модели de 
novo поиска ССТФ для выявления структурной гетерогенности ССТФ в данных 
ChIP-seq. Разработанный конвейер включает этапы построения моделей на основе 
заданного набора пиков, оценки точности распознавания моделей с помощью 
перекрестных тестов, выбора порогов, сканирования пиков ChIP-seq и классификацию 
пиков по результатам сканирования. С применением конвейера нами проведен анализ 
22 экспериментов ChIP-seq для ТФ FOXA2 с помощью четырех моделей: PWM, diPWM, 
BaMM и InMoDe. Показано, что сочетание моделей позволяет существенно увеличить 
общее количество распознанных пиков (на 26.3 %) по сравнению с применением 
только PWM; при этом основной вклад в распознавание внесла модель BaMM. В 
значительной доле пиков разные модели распознают совпадающие ССТФ; однако для 
моделей PWM, diPWM, BaMM и InMoDe медианы доли пиков, которые содержали ССТФ 
только одной модели, составили 1.08, 0.49, 4.15 и 1.73 % соответственно. Таким 
образом, совокупность ССТФ FOXA2 не описывается полностью только одной моделью, 
что свидетельствует о наличии структурной гетерогенности в ССТФ у FOXA2.

MOTIVATION: Seeking probabilistic motifs in a sequence is a common task to 
annotate putative transcription factor binding sites or other RNA/DNA binding 
sites. Useful motif representations include position weight matrices (PWMs), 
dinucleotide PWMs (di-PWMs), and hidden Markov models (HMMs). Dinucleotide PWMs 
not only combine the simplicity of PWMs-a matrix form and a cumulative scoring 
function-but also incorporate dependency between adjacent positions in the motif 
(unlike PWMs which disregard any dependency). For instance to represent binding 
sites, the HOCOMOCO database provides di-PWM motifs derived from experimental 
data. Currently, two programs, SPRy-SARUS and MOODS, can search for occurrences 
of di-PWMs in sequences.
RESULTS: We propose a Python package called dipwmsearch, which provides an 
original and efficient algorithm for this task (it first enumerates matching 
words for the di-PWM, and then searches these all at once in the sequence, even 
if the latter contains IUPAC codes). The user benefits from an easy installation 
via Pypi or conda, a comprehensive documentation, and executable scripts that 
facilitate the use of di-PWMs.
AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: dipwmsearch is available at 
https://pypi.org/project/dipwmsearch/ and 
https://gite.lirmm.fr/rivals/dipwmsearch/ under Cecill license.

We describe an effort ("Codebook") to determine the sequence specificity of 332 
putative and largely uncharacterized human transcription factors (TFs), as well 
as 61 control TFs. Nearly 5,000 independent experiments across multiple in vitro 
and in vivo assays produced motifs for just over half of the putative TFs 
analyzed (177, or 53%), of which most are unique to a single TF. The data 
highlight the extensive contribution of transposable elements to TF evolution, 
both in cis and trans, and identify tens of thousands of conserved, base-level 
binding sites in the human genome. The use of multiple assays provides an 
unprecedented opportunity to benchmark and analyze TF sequence specificity, 
function, and evolution, as further explored in accompanying manuscripts. 1,421 
human TFs are now associated with a DNA binding motif. Extrapolation from the 
Codebook benchmarking, however, suggests that many of the currently known 
binding motifs for well-studied TFs may inaccurately describe the TF's true 
sequence preferences.

Tree-based position weight matrix approach to model transcription factor binding 
site profiles.

Computational Biology, The Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United 
States of America.

Most of the position weight matrix (PWM) based bioinformatics methods developed 
to predict transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) assume each nucleotide in 
the sequence motif contributes independently to the interaction between protein 
and DNA sequence, usually producing high false positive predictions. The 
increasing availability of TF enrichment profiles from recent ChIP-Seq 
methodology facilitates the investigation of dependent structure and accurate 
prediction of TFBSs. We develop a novel Tree-based PWM (TPWM) approach to 
accurately model the interaction between TF and its binding site. The whole 
tree-structured PWM could be considered as a mixture of different 
conditional-PWMs. We propose a discriminative approach, called TPD (TPWM based 
Discriminative Approach), to construct the TPWM from the ChIP-Seq data with a 
pre-existing PWM. To achieve the maximum discriminative power between the 
positive and negative datasets, the cutoff value is determined based on the 
Matthew Correlation Coefficient (MCC). The resulting TPWMs are evaluated with 
respect to accuracy on extensive synthetic datasets. We then apply our TPWM 
discriminative approach on several real ChIP-Seq datasets to refine the current 
TFBS models stored in the TRANSFAC database. Experiments on both the simulated 
and real ChIP-Seq data show that the proposed method starting from existing PWM 
has consistently better performance than existing tools in detecting the TFBSs. 
The improved accuracy is the result of modelling the complete dependent 
structure of the motifs and better prediction of true positive rate. The 
findings could lead to better understanding of the mechanisms of TF-DNA 
interactions.

BACKGROUND: Classically, models of DNA-transcription factor binding sites 
(TFBSs) have been based on relatively few known instances and have treated them 
as sites of fixed length using position weight matrices (PWMs). Various 
extensions to this model have been proposed, most of which take account of 
dependencies between the bases in the binding sites. However, some transcription 
factors are known to exhibit some flexibility and bind to DNA in more than one 
possible physical configuration. In some cases this variation is known to affect 
the function of binding sites. With the increasing volume of ChIP-seq data 
available it is now possible to investigate models that incorporate this 
flexibility. Previous work on variable length models has been constrained by: a 
focus on specific zinc finger proteins in yeast using restrictive models; a 
reliance on hand-crafted models for just one transcription factor at a time; and 
a lack of evaluation on realistically sized data sets.
RESULTS: We re-analysed binding sites from the TRANSFAC database and found 
motivating examples where our new variable length model provides a better fit. 
We analysed several ChIP-seq data sets with a novel motif search algorithm and 
compared the results to one of the best standard PWM finders and a recently 
developed alternative method for finding motifs of variable structure. All the 
methods performed comparably in held-out cross validation tests. Known motifs of 
variable structure were recovered for p53, Stat5a and Stat5b. In addition our 
method recovered a novel generalised version of an existing PWM for Sp1 that 
allows for variable length binding. This motif improved classification 
performance.
CONCLUSIONS: We have presented a new gapped PWM model for variable length DNA 
binding sites that is not too restrictive nor over-parameterised. Our comparison 
with existing tools shows that on average it does not have better predictive 
accuracy than existing methods. However, it does provide more interpretable 
models of motifs of variable structure that are suitable for follow-up 
structural studies. To our knowledge, we are the first to apply variable length 
motif models to eukaryotic ChIP-seq data sets and consequently the first to show 
their value in this domain. The results include a novel motif for the ubiquitous 
transcription factor Sp1.

BACKGROUND: Gene expression is regulated by transcription factors binding to 
specific target DNA sites. Understanding how and where transcription factors 
bind at genome scale represents an essential step toward our understanding of 
gene regulation networks. Previously we developed a structure-based method for 
prediction of transcription factor binding sites using an integrative energy 
function that combines a knowledge-based multibody potential and two atomic 
energy terms. While the method performs well, it is not computationally 
efficient due to the exponential increase in the number of binding sequences to 
be evaluated for longer binding sites. In this paper, we present an efficient 
pentamer algorithm by splitting DNA binding sequences into overlapping fragments 
along with a simplified integrative energy function for transcription factor 
binding site prediction.
RESULTS: A DNA binding sequence is split into overlapping pentamers (5 base 
pairs) for calculating transcription factor-pentamer interaction energy. To 
combine the results from overlapping pentamer scores, we developed two methods, 
Kmer-Sum and PWM (Position Weight Matrix) stacking, for full-length binding 
motif prediction. Our results show that both Kmer-Sum and PWM stacking in the 
new pentamer approach along with a simplified integrative energy function 
improved transcription factor binding site prediction accuracy and dramatically 
reduced computation time, especially for longer binding sites.
CONCLUSION: Our new fragment-based pentamer algorithm and simplified energy 
function improve both efficiency and accuracy. To our knowledge, this is the 
first fragment-based method for structure-based transcription factor binding 
sites prediction.

BACKGROUND: Transcription factors bind DNA in specific sequence contexts. In 
addition to distinguishing one nucleobase from another, some transcription 
factors can distinguish between unmodified and modified bases. Current models of 
transcription factor binding tend not to take DNA modifications into account, 
while the recent few that do often have limitations. This makes a comprehensive 
and accurate profiling of transcription factor affinities difficult.
RESULTS: Here, we develop methods to identify transcription factor binding sites 
in modified DNA. Our models expand the standard A/C/G/T DNA alphabet to include 
cytosine modifications. We develop Cytomod to create modified genomic sequences 
and we also enhance the MEME Suite, adding the capacity to handle custom 
alphabets. We adapt the well-established position weight matrix (PWM) model of 
transcription factor binding affinity to this expanded DNA alphabet. Using these 
methods, we identify modification-sensitive transcription factor binding motifs. 
We confirm established binding preferences, such as the preference of ZFP57 and 
C/EBPβ for methylated motifs and the preference of c-Myc for unmethylated E-box 
motifs.
CONCLUSIONS: Using known binding preferences to tune model parameters, we 
discover novel modified motifs for a wide array of transcription factors. 
Finally, we validate our binding preference predictions for OCT4 using cleavage 
under targets and release using nuclease (CUT&RUN) experiments across 
conventional, methylation-, and hydroxymethylation-enriched sequences. Our 
approach readily extends to other DNA modifications. As more genome-wide 
single-base resolution modification data becomes available, we expect that our 
method will yield insights into altered transcription factor binding affinities 
across many different modifications.

The ability to predict transcription factors based on sequence information in 
regulatory elements is a key step in systems-level investigation of 
transcriptional regulation. Here, we have developed a novel tool, IMAGE, for 
precise prediction of causal transcription factors based on transcriptome 
profiling and genome-wide maps of enhancer activity. High precision is obtained 
by combining a near-complete database of position weight matrices (PWMs), 
generated by compiling public databases and systematic prediction of PWMs for 
uncharacterized transcription factors, with a state-of-the-art method for PWM 
scoring and a novel machine learning strategy, based on both enhancers and 
promoters, to predict the contribution of motifs to transcriptional activity. We 
applied IMAGE to published data obtained during 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation 
and showed that IMAGE predicts causal transcriptional regulators of this process 
with higher confidence than existing methods. Furthermore, we generated 
genome-wide maps of enhancer activity and transcripts during human mesenchymal 
stem cell commitment and adipocyte differentiation and used IMAGE to identify 
positive and negative transcriptional regulators of this process. Collectively, 
our results demonstrate that IMAGE is a powerful and precise method for 
prediction of regulators of gene expression.

Transcription is a key cell process that consists of synthesizing several copies 
of RNA from a gene DNA sequence. This process is highly regulated and closely 
linked to the ability of transcription factors to bind specifically to DNA. 
TFinder is an easy-to-use Python web portal allowing the identification of 
Individual Motifs (IM) such as Transcription Factor Binding Sites (TFBS). Using 
the NCBI API, TFinder extracts either promoter or gene terminal regulatory 
regions, through a simple query of NCBI gene name or ID. It enables simultaneous 
analysis across five different species for an unlimited number of genes. TFinder 
searches for Individual Motifs in different formats, including IUPAC codes and 
JASPAR entries. Moreover, TFinder also allows de novo generations of a Position 
Weight Matrix (PWM) and the use of already established PWM. Finally, the data 
are provided in a tabular and a graph format showing the relevance and the 
P-value of the Individual Motifs found as well as their location relative to the 
Transcription Start Site (TSS) or the terminal region of the gene. The results 
are then sent by email to users facilitating the subsequent data analysis and 
sharing. TFinder is written in Python and freely available on GitHub under the 
MIT license: https://github.com/Jumitti/TFinder. It can be accessed as a web 
application implemented in Streamlit at https://tfinder-ipmc.streamlit.app. 
Resources are available on Streamlit "Resources" tab. TFINDER strength is that 
it relies on an all-in-one intuitive tool allowing users inexperienced with 
bioinformatics tools to retrieve gene regulatory regions sequences in multiple 
species and to search for individual motifs in a huge number of genes.

Application of experimentally verified transcription factor binding sites models 
for computational analysis of ChIP-Seq data.

BACKGROUND: ChIP-Seq is widely used to detect genomic segments bound by 
transcription factors (TF), either directly at DNA binding sites (BSs) or 
indirectly via other proteins. Currently, there are many software tools 
implementing different approaches to identify TFBSs within ChIP-Seq peaks. 
However, their use for the interpretation of ChIP-Seq data is usually 
complicated by the absence of direct experimental verification, making it 
difficult both to set a threshold to avoid recognition of too many 
false-positive BSs, and to compare the actual performance of different models.
RESULTS: Using ChIP-Seq data for FoxA2 binding loci in mouse adult liver and 
human HepG2 cells we compared FoxA binding-site predictions for four 
computational models of two fundamental classes: pattern matching based on 
existing training set of experimentally confirmed TFBSs (oPWM and SiteGA) and de 
novo motif discovery (ChIPMunk and diChIPMunk). To properly select prediction 
thresholds for the models, we experimentally evaluated affinity of 64 predicted 
FoxA BSs using EMSA that allows safely distinguishing sequences able to bind TF. 
As a result we identified thousands of reliable FoxA BSs within ChIP-Seq loci 
from mouse liver and human HepG2 cells. It was found that the performance of 
conventional position weight matrix (PWM) models was inferior with the highest 
false positive rate. On the contrary, the best recognition efficiency was 
achieved by the combination of SiteGA & diChIPMunk/ChIPMunk models, properly 
identifying FoxA BSs in up to 90% of loci for both mouse and human ChIP-Seq 
datasets.
CONCLUSIONS: The experimental study of TF binding to oligonucleotides 
corresponding to predicted sites increases the reliability of computational 
methods for TFBS-recognition in ChIP-Seq data analysis. Regarding ChIP-Seq data 
interpretation, basic PWMs have inferior TFBS recognition quality compared to 
the more sophisticated SiteGA and de novo motif discovery methods. A combination 
of models from different principles allowed identification of proper TFBSs.

BACKGROUND: For many years now, binding preferences of Transcription Factors 
have been described by so called motifs, usually mathematically defined by 
position weight matrices or similar models, for the purpose of predicting 
potential binding sites. However, despite the availability of thousands of motif 
models in public and commercial databases, a researcher who wants to use them is 
left with many competing methods of identifying potential binding sites in a 
genome of interest and there is little published information regarding the 
optimality of different choices. Thanks to the availability of large number of 
different motif models as well as a number of experimental datasets describing 
actual binding of TFs in hundreds of TF-ChIP-seq pairs, we set out to perform a 
comprehensive analysis of this matter.
RESULTS: We focus on the task of identifying potential transcription factor 
binding sites in the human genome. Firstly, we provide a comprehensive 
comparison of the coverage and quality of models available in different 
databases, showing that the public databases have comparable TFs coverage and 
better motif performance than commercial databases. Secondly, we compare 
different motif scanners showing that, regardless of the database used, the 
tools developed by the scientific community outperform the commercial tools. 
Thirdly, we calculate for each motif a detection threshold optimizing the 
accuracy of prediction. Finally, we provide an in-depth comparison of different 
methods of choosing thresholds for all motifs a priori. Surprisingly, we show 
that selecting a common false-positive rate gives results that are the least 
biased by the information content of the motif and therefore most uniformly 
accurate.
CONCLUSION: We provide a guide for researchers working with transcription factor 
motifs. It is supplemented with detailed results of the analysis and the 
benchmark datasets at http://bioputer.mimuw.edu.pl/papers/motifs/ .

BACKGROUND: In eukaryotic cells, transcription factors (TFs) are thought to act 
in a combinatorial way, by competing and collaborating to regulate common target 
genes. However, several questions remain regarding the conservation of these 
combinations among different gene classes, regulatory regions and cell types.
RESULTS: We propose a new approach named TFcoop to infer the TF combinations 
involved in the binding of a target TF in a particular cell type. TFcoop aims to 
predict the binding sites of the target TF upon the nucleotide content of the 
sequences and of the binding affinity of all identified cooperating TFs. The set 
of cooperating TFs and model parameters are learned from ChIP-seq data of the 
target TF. We used TFcoop to investigate the TF combinations involved in the 
binding of 106 TFs on 41 cell types and in four regulatory regions: promoters of 
mRNAs, lncRNAs and pri-miRNAs, and enhancers. We first assess that TFcoop is 
accurate and outperforms simple PWM methods for predicting TF binding sites. 
Next, analysis of the learned models sheds light on important properties of TF 
combinations in different promoter classes and in enhancers. First, we show that 
combinations governing TF binding on enhancers are more cell-type specific than 
that governing binding in promoters. Second, for a given TF and cell type, we 
observe that TF combinations are different between promoters and enhancers, but 
similar for promoters of mRNAs, lncRNAs and pri-miRNAs. Analysis of the TFs 
cooperating with the different targets show over-representation of pioneer TFs 
and a clear preference for TFs with binding motif composition similar to that of 
the target. Lastly, our models accurately distinguish promoters associated with 
specific biological processes.
CONCLUSIONS: TFcoop appears as an accurate approach for studying TF 
combinations. Its use on ENCODE and FANTOM data allowed us to discover important 
properties of human TF combinations in different promoter classes and in 
enhancers. The R code for learning a TFcoop model and for reproducing the main 
experiments described in the paper is available in an R Markdown file at address

Dinucleotide weight matrices for predicting transcription factor binding sites: 
generalizing the position weight matrix.

BACKGROUND: Identifying transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) in silico is 
key in understanding gene regulation. TFBS are string patterns that exhibit some 
variability, commonly modelled as "position weight matrices" (PWMs). Though 
convenient, the PWM has significant limitations, in particular the assumed 
independence of positions within the binding motif; and predictions based on 
PWMs are usually not very specific to known functional sites. Analysis here on 
binding sites in yeast suggests that correlation of dinucleotides is not limited 
to near-neighbours, but can extend over considerable gaps.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: I describe a straightforward generalization of 
the PWM model, that considers frequencies of dinucleotides instead of individual 
nucleotides. Unlike previous efforts, this method considers all dinucleotides 
within an extended binding region, and does not make an attempt to determine a 
priori the significance of particular dinucleotide correlations. I describe how 
to use a "dinucleotide weight matrix" (DWM) to predict binding sites, dealing in 
particular with the complication that its entries are not independent 
probabilities. Benchmarks show, for many factors, a dramatic improvement over 
PWMs in precision of predicting known targets. In most cases, significant 
further improvement arises by extending the commonly defined "core motifs" by 
about 10 bp on either side. Though this flanking sequence shows no strong motif 
at the nucleotide level, the predictive power of the dinucleotide model suggests 
that the "signature" in DNA sequence of protein-binding affinity extends beyond 
the core protein-DNA contact region.
CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: While computationally more demanding and slower than 
PWM-based approaches, this dinucleotide method is straightforward, both 
conceptually and in implementation, and can serve as a basis for future 
improvements.

MethMotif (https://methmotif.org) is a publicly available database that provides 
a comprehensive repository of transcription factor (TF)-binding profiles, 
enriched with DNA methylation patterns. In this release, we have enhanced the 
platform, expanding our initial collection to over 700 position weight matrices 
(PWM), all of which include DNA methylation profiles. One of the key 
advancements in this release is the segregation of TF-binding motifs based on 
their cofactors and DNA methylation status. We have previously demonstrated that 
gene ontology (GO) enriched terms associated with TF target genes may differ 
based on their association with alternative cofactors and DNA methylation 
status. MethMotif provides precomputed GO annotations for each human TF of 
interest, as well as for TF-co-TF complexes, enabling a comprehensive analysis 
of TF functions in the context of their co-factors. Additionally, MethMotif has 
been updated to encompass data for two new species, Mus musculus and Arabidopsis 
thaliana, widening its applicability to a broader community. MethMotif stands 
out as the first and only TF-binding motifs database to incorporate 
context-specific PWM coupled with epigenetic information, thereby enlightening 
context-specific TF functions. This enhancement allows the community to explore 
and gain deeper insights into the regulatory mechanisms governing 
transcriptional processes.

A long-standing challenge in human regulatory genomics is that transcription 
factor (TF) DNA-binding motifs are short and degenerate, while the genome is 
large. Motif scans therefore produce many false-positive binding site 
predictions. By surveying 179 TFs across 25 families using >1,500 cyclic in 
vitro selection experiments with fragmented, naked, and unmodified genomic DNA - 
a method we term GHT-SELEX (Genomic HT-SELEX) - we find that many human TFs 
possess much higher sequence specificity than anticipated. Moreover, genomic 
binding regions from GHT-SELEX are often surprisingly similar to those obtained 
in vivo (i.e. ChIP-seq peaks). We find that comparable specificity can also be 
obtained from motif scans, but performance is highly dependent on derivation and 
use of the motifs, including accounting for multiple local matches in the scans. 
We also observe alternative engagement of multiple DNA-binding domains within 
the same protein: long C2H2 zinc finger proteins often utilize modular DNA 
recognition, engaging different subsets of their DNA binding domain (DBD) arrays 
to recognize multiple types of distinct target sites, frequently evolving via 
internal duplication and divergence of one or more DBDs. Thus, contrary to 
conventional wisdom, it is common for TFs to possess sufficient intrinsic 
specificity to independently delineate cellular targets.

Most of the human genome is thought to be non-functional, and includes large 
segments often referred to as "dark matter" DNA. The genome also encodes 
hundreds of putative and poorly characterized transcription factors (TFs). We 
determined genomic binding locations of 166 uncharacterized human TFs in living 
cells. Nearly half of them associated strongly with known regulatory regions 
such as promoters and enhancers, often at conserved motif matches and 
co-localizing with each other. Surprisingly, the other half often associated 
with genomic dark matter, at largely unique sites, via intrinsic sequence 
recognition. Dozens of these, which we term "Dark TFs", mainly bind within 
regions of closed chromatin. Dark TF binding sites are enriched for transposable 
elements, and are rarely under purifying selection. Some Dark TFs are KZNFs, 
which contain the repressive KRAB domain, but many are not: the Dark TFs also 
include known or potential pioneer TFs. Compiled literature information supports 
that the Dark TFs exert diverse functions ranging from early development to 
tumor suppression. Thus, our results sheds light on a large fraction of 
previously uncharacterized human TFs and their unappreciated activities within 
the dark matter genome.

BACKGROUND: Transcription factor (TF) binding site specificity is commonly 
represented by some form of matrix model in which the positions in the binding 
site are assumed to contribute independently to the site's activity. The 
independence assumption is known to be an approximation, often a good one but 
sometimes poor. Alternative approaches have been developed that use k-mers (DNA 
"words" of length k) to account for the non-independence, and more recently DNA 
structural parameters have been incorporated into the models. ChIP-seq data are 
often used to assess the discriminatory power of motifs and to compare different 
models. However, to measure the improvement due to using more complex models, 
one must compare to optimized matrix models.
RESULTS: We describe a program "Discriminative Additive Model Optimization" 
(DAMO) that uses positive and negative examples, as in ChIP-seq data, and finds 
the additive position weight matrix (PWM) that maximizes the Area Under the 
Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC). We compare to a recent study 
where structural parameters, serving as features in a gradient boosting 
classifier algorithm, are shown to improve the AUROC over JASPAR position 
frequency matrices (PFMs). In agreement with the previous results, we find that 
adding structural parameters gives the largest improvement, but most of the gain 
can be obtained by an optimized PWM and nearly all of the gain can be obtained 
with a di-nucleotide extension to the PWM.
CONCLUSION: To appropriately compare different models for TF bind sites, 
optimized models must be used. PWMs and their extensions are good 
representations of binding specificity for most TFs, and more complex models, 
including the incorporation of DNA shape features and gradient boosting 
classifiers, provide only moderate improvements for a few TFs.

TFClass aims at classifying eukaryotic transcription factors (TFs) according to 
their DNA-binding domains (DBDs). For this, a classification schema comprising 
four generic levels (superclass, class, family and subfamily) was defined that 
could accommodate all known DNA-binding human TFs. They were assigned to their 
(sub-)families as instances at two different levels, the corresponding TF genes 
and individual gene products (protein isoforms). In the present version, all 
mouse and rat orthologs have been linked to the human TFs, and the mouse 
orthologs have been arranged in an independent ontology. Many TFs were assigned 
with typical DNA-binding patterns and positional weight matrices derived from 
high-throughput in-vitro binding studies. Predicted TF binding sites from human 
gene upstream sequences are now also attached to each human TF whenever a PWM 
was available for this factor or one of his paralogs. TFClass is freely 
available at http://tfclass.bioinf.med.uni-goettingen.de/ through a web 
interface and for download in OBO format.

MOTIVATION: Our understanding of how genes are regulated in a concerted fashion 
is still limited. Especially, complex phenomena like cell cycle regulation in 
multicellular organisms are poorly understood. Therefore, we investigated 
conserved predicted transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) in man-mouse 
upstream regions of genes that can be associated to a particular cell cycle 
phase in HeLa cells. TFBSs were predicted from selected binding site motifs 
(represented by position weight matrices, PWMs) based on a statistical approach. 
A regulatory role for a transcription factor is more probable if its predicted 
TFBSs are enriched in upstream regions of genes, that are associated with a 
subset of cell cycle phases. We tested for this association by computing exact 
P-values for the observed phase distributions under the null distribution 
defined by the relative amount of conserved upstream sequence of genes per cell 
cycle phase. We considered non-exonic and 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) 
binding sites separately and corrected for multiple testing by taking the false 
discovery rate into account.
RESULTS: We identified 22 non-exonic and 11 5'-UTR significant PWM phase 
distributions although expecting one false discovery. Many of the corresponding 
transcription factors (e.g. members of the thyroid hormone/retinoid receptor 
subfamily) have already been associated with cell cycle regulation, 
proliferation and development. It appears that our method is a suitable tool for 
detecting putative cell cycle regulators in the realm of known human 
transcription factors.

Sequence analysis frequently requires intuitive understanding and convenient 
representation of motifs. Typically, motifs are represented as position weight 
matrices (PWMs) and visualized using sequence logos. However, in many scenarios, 
in order to interpret the motif information or search for motif matches, it is 
compact and sufficient to represent motifs by wildcard-style consensus sequences 
(such as [GC][AT]GATAAG[GAC]). Based on mutual information theory and 
Jensen-Shannon divergence, we propose a mathematical framework to minimize the 
information loss in converting PWMs to consensus sequences. We name this 
representation as sequence Motto and have implemented an efficient algorithm 
with flexible options for converting motif PWMs into Motto from nucleotides, 
amino acids, and customized characters. We show that this representation 
provides a simple and efficient way to identify the binding sites of 1156 common 
transcription factors (TFs) in the human genome. The effectiveness of the method 
was benchmarked by comparing sequence matches found by Motto with PWM scanning 
results found by FIMO. On average, our method achieves a 0.81 area under the 
precision-recall curve, significantly (P-value < 0.01) outperforming all 
existing methods, including maximal positional weight, Cavener's method, and 
minimal mean square error. We believe this representation provides a distilled 
summary of a motif, as well as the statistical justification.

Transcription factors (TFs) are proteins that promote or reduce the expression 
of genes by binding short genomic DNA sequences known as transcription factor 
binding sites (TFBS). While several tools have been developed to scan for 
potential occurrences of TFBS in linear DNA sequences or reference genomes, no 
tool exists to find them in pangenome variation graphs (VGs). VGs are 
sequence-labelled graphs that can efficiently encode collections of genomes and 
their variants in a single, compact data structure. Because VGs can losslessly 
compress large pangenomes, TFBS scanning in VGs can efficiently capture how 
genomic variation affects the potential binding landscape of TFs in a population 
of individuals. Here we present GRAFIMO (GRAph-based Finding of Individual Motif 
Occurrences), a command-line tool for the scanning of known TF DNA motifs 
represented as Position Weight Matrices (PWMs) in VGs. GRAFIMO extends the 
standard PWM scanning procedure by considering variations and alternative 
haplotypes encoded in a VG. Using GRAFIMO on a VG based on individuals from the 
1000 Genomes project we recover several potential binding sites that are 
enhanced, weakened or missed when scanning only the reference genome, and which 
could constitute individual-specific binding events. GRAFIMO is available as an 
open-source tool, under the MIT license, at

SUMMARY: The state of the art in promoter modeling for higher eukaryotes is 
predicting not single transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs), but their 
combinations. The new tool utilizes a previously developed method of distance 
distributions of TFBS pairs. We model the random distribution of distances and 
compare it with the distribution observed in the query sequences. Comparison of 
the profiles allows filtering out the 'noise' and retaining the potentially 
functional combinations. This approach has proved its usefulness as a filtering 
technique for the selection of TFBS pairs for promoter modeling and is now 
implemented as a tool in R. As an input, it can use the outputs of three 
different TFBS- and motif-predictive tools (Gibbs Sampler for motifs, Match and 
MEME/FIMO for PWM-based search). The output is a list of predicted pairs on 
overrepresented distances with assigned scores, P-values and plots showing the 
distribution of pairs in the input sequences.

Scanning through genomes for potential transcription factor binding sites 
(TFBSs) is becoming increasingly important in this post-genomic era. The 
position weight matrix (PWM) is the standard representation of TFBSs utilized 
when scanning through sequences for potential binding sites. However, many 
transcription factor (TF) motifs are short and highly degenerate, and methods 
utilizing PWMs to scan for sites are plagued by false positives. Furthermore, 
many important TFs do not have well-characterized PWMs, making identification of 
potential binding sites even more difficult. One approach to the identification 
of sites for these TFs has been to use the 3D structure of the TF to predict the 
DNA structure around the TF and then to generate a PWM from the predicted 3D 
complex structure. However, this approach is dependent on the similarity of the 
predicted structure to the native structure. We introduce here a novel approach 
to identify TFBSs utilizing structure information that can be applied to TFs 
without characterized PWMs, as long as a 3D complex structure (TF/DNA) exists. 
This approach utilizes an energy function that is uniquely trained on each 
structure. Our approach leads to increased prediction accuracy and robustness 
compared with those using a more general energy function. The software is freely 
available upon request.

BACKGROUND: Statistical modeling of transcription factor binding sites is one of 
the classical fields in bioinformatics. The position weight matrix (PWM) model, 
which assumes statistical independence among all nucleotides in a binding site, 
used to be the standard model for this task for more than three decades but its 
simple assumptions are increasingly put into question. Recent high-throughput 
sequencing methods have provided data sets of sufficient size and quality for 
studying the benefits of more complex models. However, learning more complex 
models typically entails the danger of overfitting, and while model classes that 
dynamically adapt the model complexity to data have been developed, effective 
model selection is to date only possible for fully observable data, but not, 
e.g., within de novo motif discovery.
RESULTS: To address this issue, we propose a stochastic algorithm for performing 
robust model selection in a latent variable setting. This algorithm yields a 
solution without relying on hyperparameter-tuning via massive cross-validation 
or other computationally expensive resampling techniques. Using this algorithm 
for learning inhomogeneous parsimonious Markov models, we study the degree of 
putative higher-order intra-motif dependencies for transcription factor binding 
sites inferred via de novo motif discovery from ChIP-seq data. We find that 
intra-motif dependencies are prevalent and not limited to first-order 
dependencies among directly adjacent nucleotides, but that second-order models 
appear to be the significantly better choice.
CONCLUSIONS: The traditional PWM model appears to be indeed insufficient to 
infer realistic sequence motifs, as it is on average outperformed by more 
complex models that take into account intra-motif dependencies. Moreover, using 
such models together with an appropriate model selection procedure does not lead 
to a significant performance loss in comparison with the PWM model for any of 
the studied transcription factors. Hence, we find it worthwhile to recommend 
that any modern motif discovery algorithm should attempt to take into account 
intra-motif dependencies.

prediction.

The representation and discovery of transcription factor (TF) sequence binding 
specificities is critical for understanding gene regulatory networks and 
interpreting the impact of disease-associated noncoding genetic variants. We 
present a novel TF binding motif representation, the k-mer set memory (KSM), 
which consists of a set of aligned k-mers that are overrepresented at TF binding 
sites, and a new method called KMAC for de novo discovery of KSMs. We find that 
KSMs more accurately predict in vivo binding sites than position weight matrix 
(PWM) models and other more complex motif models across a large set of ChIP-seq 
experiments. Furthermore, KSMs outperform PWMs and more complex motif models in 
predicting in vitro binding sites. KMAC also identifies correct motifs in more 
experiments than five state-of-the-art motif discovery methods. In addition, 
KSM-derived features outperform both PWM and deep learning model derived 
sequence features in predicting differential regulatory activities of expression 
quantitative trait loci (eQTL) alleles. Finally, we have applied KMAC to 1600 
ENCODE TF ChIP-seq data sets and created a public resource of KSM and PWM 
motifs. We expect that the KSM representation and KMAC method will be valuable 
in characterizing TF binding specificities and in interpreting the effects of 
noncoding genetic variations.

BACKGROUND: position weight matrix (PWM) and sequence logo are the most widely 
used representations of transcription factor binding site (TFBS) in biological 
sequences. Sequence logo - a graphical representation of PWM, has been widely 
used in scientific publications and reports, due to its easiness of human 
perception, rich information, and simple format. Different from sequence logo, 
PWM works great as a precise and compact digitalized form, which can be easily 
used by a variety of motif analysis software. There are a few available tools to 
generate sequence logos from PWM; however, no tool does the reverse. Such tool 
to convert sequence logo back to PWM is needed to scan a TFBS represented in 
logo format in a publication where the PWM is not provided or hard to be 
acquired. A major difficulty in developing such tool to convert sequence logo to 
PWM is to deal with the diversity of sequence logo images.
RESULTS: We propose logo2PWM for reconstructing PWM from a large variety of 
sequence logo images. Evaluation results on over one thousand logos from three 
sources of different logo format show that the correlation between the 
reconstructed PWMs and the original PWMs are constantly high, where median 
correlation is greater than 0.97.
CONCLUSION: Because of the high recognition accuracy, the easiness of usage, 
and, the availability of both web-based service and stand-alone application, we 
believe that logo2PWM can readily benefit the study of transcription by filling 
the gap between sequence logo and PWM.

A general pairwise interaction model provides an accurate description of in vivo 
transcription factor binding sites.

The identification of transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) on genomic DNA 
is of crucial importance for understanding and predicting regulatory elements in 
gene networks. TFBS motifs are commonly described by Position Weight Matrices 
(PWMs), in which each DNA base pair contributes independently to the 
transcription factor (TF) binding. However, this description ignores 
correlations between nucleotides at different positions, and is generally 
inaccurate: analysing fly and mouse in vivo ChIPseq data, we show that in most 
cases the PWM model fails to reproduce the observed statistics of TFBSs. To 
overcome this issue, we introduce the pairwise interaction model (PIM), a 
generalization of the PWM model. The model is based on the principle of maximum 
entropy and explicitly describes pairwise correlations between nucleotides at 
different positions, while being otherwise as unconstrained as possible. It is 
mathematically equivalent to considering a TF-DNA binding energy that depends 
additively on each nucleotide identity at all positions in the TFBS, like the 
PWM model, but also additively on pairs of nucleotides. We find that the PIM 
significantly improves over the PWM model, and even provides an optimal 
description of TFBS statistics within statistical noise. The PIM generalizes 
previous approaches to interdependent positions: it accounts for co-variation of 
two or more base pairs, and predicts secondary motifs, while outperforming 
multiple-motif models consisting of mixtures of PWMs. We analyse the structure 
of pairwise interactions between nucleotides, and find that they are sparse and 
dominantly located between consecutive base pairs in the flanking region of 
TFBS. Nonetheless, interactions between pairs of non-consecutive nucleotides are 
found to play a significant role in the obtained accurate description of TFBS 
statistics. The PIM is computationally tractable, and provides a general 
framework that should be useful for describing and predicting TFBSs beyond PWMs.

A Fast Cluster Motif Finding Algorithm for ChIP-Seq Data Sets.

Chang'An University, Xi'an 710064, China.

New high-throughput technique ChIP-seq, coupling chromatin immunoprecipitation 
experiment with high-throughput sequencing technologies, has extended the 
identification of binding locations of a transcription factor to the genome-wide 
regions. However, the most existing motif discovery algorithms are 
time-consuming and limited to identify binding motifs in ChIP-seq data which 
normally has the significant characteristics of large scale data. In order to 
improve the efficiency, we propose a fast cluster motif finding algorithm, named 
as FCmotif, to identify the (l,  d) motifs in large scale ChIP-seq data set. It 
is inspired by the emerging substrings mining strategy to find the enriched 
substrings and then searching the neighborhood instances to construct PWM and 
cluster motifs in different length. FCmotif is not following the OOPS model 
constraint and can find long motifs. The effectiveness of proposed algorithm has 
been proved by experiments on the ChIP-seq data sets from mouse ES cells. The 
whole detection of the real binding motifs and processing of the full size data 
of several megabytes finished in a few minutes. The experimental results show 
that FCmotif has advantageous to deal with the (l,  d) motif finding in the 
ChIP-seq data; meanwhile it also demonstrates better performance than other 
current widely-used algorithms such as MEME, Weeder, ChIPMunk, and DREME.

STOP: searching for transcription factor motifs using gene expression.

Hertzberg L(1), Izraeli S, Domany E.

Author information:
(1)Department of Pediatric Hemato-Oncology, The Sheba Cancer Research Center, 
Tel Hashomer, Israel.

MOTIVATION: Existing computational methods that identify transcription factor 
(TF) binding sites on a gene's promoter are plagued by significant inaccuracies. 
Binding of a TF to a particular sequence is assessed by comparing its similarity 
score, obtained from the TF's known position weight matrix (PWM), to a 
threshold. If the similarity score is above the threshold, the sequence is 
considered a putative binding site. Determining this threshold is a central part 
of the problem, for which no satisfactory biologically based solution exists.
RESULTS: We present here a method that integrates gene expression data with 
sequence-based scoring of TF binding sites, for determining a global score 
threshold for each TF. We validate our method, STOP (Searching TFs Of 
Promoters), in several ways: (1) we calculate the average expression values of 
groups of human putative target genes of each TF, and compare them to similar 
averages derived for random gene groups. The groups of putative targets show 
significantly higher relative average expression. (2) We find high consistency 
between the induced lists of putative targets in human and in mouse. (3) The 
expression patterns associated with human and mouse genes (ordered by PWM scores 
for each TF) exhibit high similarity between human and mouse, indicating that 
our method has firm biological basis. (4) Comparison of results obtained by STOP 
and PRIMA (Elkon et al., 2003) suggests that determining the score threshold 
using gene expression, as is done in STOP, is more biologically tuned.

Improved predictions of transcription factor binding sites using physicochemical 
features of DNA.

Maienschein-Cline M(1), Dinner AR, Hlavacek WS, Mu F.

Author information:
(1)Department of Chemistry, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.

Typical approaches for predicting transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) 
involve use of a position-specific weight matrix (PWM) to statistically 
characterize the sequences of the known sites. Recently, an alternative 
physicochemical approach, called SiteSleuth, was proposed. In this approach, a 
linear support vector machine (SVM) classifier is trained to distinguish TFBSs 
from background sequences based on local chemical and structural features of 
DNA. SiteSleuth appears to generally perform better than PWM-based methods. 
Here, we improve the SiteSleuth approach by considering both new physicochemical 
features and algorithmic modifications. New features are derived from Gibbs 
energies of amino acid-DNA interactions and hydroxyl radical cleavage profiles 
of DNA. Algorithmic modifications consist of inclusion of a feature selection 
step, use of a nonlinear kernel in the SVM classifier, and use of a 
consensus-based post-processing step for predictions. We also considered SVM 
classification based on letter features alone to distinguish performance gains 
from use of SVM-based models versus use of physicochemical features. The 
accuracy of each of the variant methods considered was assessed by cross 
validation using data available in the RegulonDB database for 54 Escherichia 
coli TFs, as well as by experimental validation using published ChIP-chip data 
available for Fis and Lrp.

BACKGROUND: Transcription factor (TF) binding motifs are identified by high 
throughput sequencing technologies as means to capture Protein-DNA interactions. 
These motifs are often represented by consensus sequences in form of position 
weight matrices (PWMs). With ever-increasing pool of TF binding motifs from 
multiple sources, redundancy issues are difficult to avoid, especially when 
every source maintains its own database for collection. One solution can be to 
cluster biologically relevant or similar PWMs, whether coming from experimental 
detection or in silico predictions. However, there is a lack of efficient tools 
to cluster PWMs. Assessing quality of PWM clusters is yet another challenge. 
Therefore, new methods and tools are required to efficiently cluster PWMs and 
assess quality of clusters.
RESULTS: A new Python package Affinity Based Clustering for Position Weight 
Matrices (abc4pwm) was developed. It efficiently clustered PWMs from multiple 
sources with or without using DNA-Binding Domain (DBD) information, generated a 
representative motif for each cluster, evaluated the clustering quality 
automatically, and filtered out incorrectly clustered PWMs. Additionally, it was 
able to update human DBD family database automatically, classified known human 
TF PWMs to the respective DBD family, and performed TF motif searching and motif 
discovery by a new ensemble learning approach.
CONCLUSION: This work demonstrates applications of abc4pwm in the DNA sequence 
analysis for various high throughput sequencing data using ~ 1770 human TF PWMs. 
It recovered known TF motifs at gene promoters based on gene expression profiles 
(RNA-seq) and identified true TF binding targets for motifs predicted from 
ChIP-seq experiments. Abc4pwm is a useful tool for TF motif searching, 
clustering, quality assessment and integration in multiple types of sequence 
data analysis including RNA-seq, ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq.

RankMotif++: a motif-search algorithm that accounts for relative ranks of K-mers 
in binding transcription factors.

MOTIVATION: The sequence specificity of DNA-binding proteins is typically 
represented as a position weight matrix in which each base position contributes 
independently to relative affinity. Assessment of the accuracy and broad 
applicability of this representation has been limited by the lack of extensive 
DNA-binding data. However, new microarray techniques, in which preferences for 
all possible K-mers are measured, enable a broad comparison of both motif 
representation and methods for motif discovery. Here, we consider the problem of 
accounting for all of the binding data in such experiments, rather than the 
highest affinity binding data. We introduce the RankMotif++, an algorithm 
designed for finding motifs whenever sequences are associated with a 
semi-quantitative measure of protein-DNA-binding affinity. RankMotif++ learns 
motif models by maximizing the likelihood of a set of binding preferences under 
a probabilistic model of how sequence binding affinity translates into binding 
preference observations. Because RankMotif++ makes few assumptions about the 
relationship between binding affinity and the semi-quantitative readout, it is 
applicable to a wide variety of experimental assays of DNA-binding preference.
RESULTS: By several criteria, RankMotif++ predicts binding affinity better than 
two widely used motif finding algorithms (MDScan, MatrixREDUCE) or more recently 
developed algorithms (PREGO, Seed and Wobble), and its performance is comparable 
to a motif model that separately assigns affinities to 8-mers. Our results 
validate the PWM model and provide an approximation of the precision and recall 
that can be expected in a genomic scan.

Core promoter elements play a pivotal role in the transcriptional output, yet 
they are often detected manually within sequences of interest. Here, we present 
2 contributions to the detection and curation of core promoter elements within 
given sequences. First, the Elements Navigation Tool (ElemeNT) is a 
user-friendly web-based, interactive tool for prediction and display of putative 
core promoter elements and their biologically-relevant combinations. Second, the 
CORE database summarizes ElemeNT-predicted core promoter elements near CAGE and 
RNA-seq-defined Drosophila melanogaster transcription start sites (TSSs). 
ElemeNT's predictions are based on biologically-functional core promoter 
elements, and can be used to infer core promoter compositions. ElemeNT does not 
assume prior knowledge of the actual TSS position, and can therefore assist in 
annotation of any given sequence. These resources, freely accessible at 
http://lifefaculty.biu.ac.il/gershon-tamar/index.php/resources, facilitate the 
identification of core promoter elements as active contributors to gene 
expression.

Neuron-type specific gene batteries define the morphological and functional 
diversity of cell types in the nervous system. Here, we discuss the composition 
of neuron-type specific gene batteries and illustrate gene regulatory strategies 
which determine the unique gene expression profiles and molecular composition of 
individual neuronal cell types from C. elegans to higher vertebrates. Based on 
principles learned from prokaryotic gene regulation, we argue that neuronal 
terminal gene batteries are functionally grouped into parallel-acting 
'regulons'. The theoretical concepts discussed here provide testable hypotheses 
for future experimental analysis of the exact gene-regulatory mechanisms 
employed in the generation of neuronal diversity and identity.

A sufficient supply molecular oxygen is essential for the maintenance of 
physiologic metabolism and bioenergetic homeostasis for most metazoans. For this 
reason, mechanisms have evolved for eukaryotic cells to adapt to conditions 
where oxygen demand exceeds supply (hypoxia). These mechanisms rely on the 
modification of pre-existing proteins, translational arrest and transcriptional 
changes. The hypoxia inducible factor (HIF; a master regulator of gene induction 
in response to hypoxia) is responsible for the majority of induced gene 
expression in hypoxia. However, much less is known about the mechanism(s) 
responsible for gene repression, an essential part of the adaptive 
transcriptional response. Hypoxia-induced gene repression leads to a reduction 
in energy demanding processes and the redirection of limited energetic resources 
to essential housekeeping functions. Recent developments have underscored the 
importance of transcriptional repressors in cellular adaptation to hypoxia. To 
date, at least ten distinct transcriptional repressors have been reported to 
demonstrate sensitivity to hypoxia. Central among these is the Repressor 
Element-1 Silencing Transcription factor (REST), which regulates over 200 genes. 
In this review, written to honor the memory and outstanding scientific legacy of 
Lorenz Poellinger, we provide an overview of our existing knowledge with respect 
to transcriptional repressors and their target genes in hypoxia.

Over the past decade, regulatory non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) produced by RNA Pol II 
have been revealed as meaningful players in various essential cellular 
functions. In particular, thousands of ncRNAs are produced at transcriptional 
regulatory elements such as enhancers and promoters, where they may exert 
multiple functions to regulate proper development, cellular programming, 
transcription or genomic stability. Here, we review the mechanisms involving 
these regulatory element-associated ncRNAs, and particularly enhancer RNAs 
(eRNAs) and PROMoter uPstream Transcripts (PROMPTs). We contextualize the 
mechanisms described to the processing and degradation of these short lived 
RNAs. We summarize recent findings explaining how ncRNAs operate locally at 
promoters and enhancers, or further away, either shortly after their production 
by RNA Pol II, or through post-transcriptional stabilization. Such discoveries 
lead to a converging model accounting for how ncRNAs influence cellular fate, by 
acting on transcription and chromatin structure, which may further involve 
factors participating to 3D nuclear organization.

The copper efflux regulator (CueR) is a classical member of the MerR family of 
metalloregulators and is common in gram-negative bacteria. Through its 
C-terminal effector-binding domain, CueR senses cytoplasmic copper ions to 
regulate the transcription of genes contributing to copper homeostasis, an 
essential process for survival of all cells. In this chapter, we review the 
regulatory roles of CueR in the model organism Escherichia coli and the 
mechanisms for CueR in copper binding, DNA recognition, and interplay with RNA 
polymerase in regulating transcription. In light of biochemical and structural 
analyses, we provide molecular details for how CueR represses transcription in 
the absence of copper ions, how copper ions mediate CueR conformational change 
to form holo CueR, and how CueR bends and twists promoter DNA to activate 
transcription. We also characterize the functional domains and key residues 
involved in these processes. Since CueR is a representative member of the MerR 
family, elucidating its regulatory mechanisms could help to understand the 
CueR-like regulators in other organisms and facilitate the understanding of 
other metalloregulators in the same family.

Poland.

In recent years, noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) have been shown to constitute key 
elements implicated in a number of regulatory mechanisms in the cell. They are 
present in bacteria and eukaryotes. The ncRNAs are involved in regulation of 
expression at both transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels, by mediating 
chromatin modifications, modulating transcription factor activity, and 
influencing mRNA stability, processing, and translation. Noncoding RNAs play a 
key role in genetic imprinting, dosage compensation of X-chromosome-linked 
genes, and many processes of differentiation and development.

Nutrient and hormonal regulation of pyruvate kinase gene expression.

Fukui 910-1193, Japan.

Mammalian pyruvate kinase (PK), a key glycolytic enzyme, has two genes named PKL 
and PKM, which produce the L- and R-type isoenzymes by means of alternative 
promoters, and the M1-and M2-types by mutually exclusive alternative splicing 
respectively. The expression of these genes is tissue-specific and under 
developmental, dietary and hormonal control. The L-type isoenzyme (L-PK) gene 
contains multiple regulatory elements necessary for regulation in the 5' 
flanking region, up to position -170. Both L-II and L-III elements are required 
for stimulation of L-PK gene transcription by carbohydrates such as glucose and 
fructose, although the L-III element is itself responsive to carbohydrates. The 
L-II element is also responsible for the gene regulation by polyunsaturated 
fatty acids. Nuclear factor-1 proteins and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4, which 
bind to the L-II element, may also be involved in carbohydrate and 
polyunsaturated fatty acid regulation of the L-PK gene respectively. However, 
the L-III-element-binding protein that is involved in carbohydrate regulation 
remains to be clarified, although involvement by an upstream stimulating factor 
has been proposed. Available evidence suggests that the carbohydrate signalling 
pathway to the L-PK gene includes a glucose metabolite, possibly glucose 
6-phosphate or xylulose 5-phosphate, as well as phosphorylation and 
dephosphorylation mechanisms. In addition, at least five regulatory elements 
have been identified in the 5' flanking region of the PKM gene up to position 
-279. Sp1-family proteins bind to two proximal elements, but the binding of 
proteins to other elements have not yet been clarified. Glucose may stimulate 
the transcription of the PKM gene via hexosamine derivatives. Sp1 may be 
involved in this regulation via its dephosphorylation, although the carbohydrate 
response element has not been determined precisely in the PKM gene. Thus glucose 
stimulates transcription of the PKM gene by the mechanism which is probably 
different from the L-PK gene.

California, San Diego, La Jolla 92093-0347, USA. rhampton@ucsd.edu

The mammalian cell continuously adjusts its sterol content by regulating levels 
of key sterol synthetic enzymes and levels of LDL receptors that mediate uptake 
of cholesterol-laden particles. Control is brought about by sterol-regulated 
transcription of relevant genes and by regulated degradation of the committed 
step enzyme HMG-CoA reductase (HMGR). Current work has revealed that proteolysis 
is at the heart of each of these mechanistically distinct axes. Transcriptional 
control is effected by regulated cleavage of the membrane-bound transcription 
factor sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP), and HMGR degradation 
is brought about by ubiquitin-mediated degradation. In each case, ongoing cell 
biological processes are being harnessed to bring about regulation. The 
secretory pathway plays a central role in allowing sterol-mediated control of 
transcription. The constitutively active endoplasmic reticulum (ER) quality 
control apparatus is employed to bring about regulated destruction of HMGR. This 
review describes the methods and results of various studies to understand the 
mechanisms and molecules involved in these distinct but interrelated aspects of 
sterol regulation and the intriguing similarities that appear to exist at the 
levels of protein sequence and cell biology.

Protein signaling and regulation of gene transcription in leukemia: role of the 
Casein Kinase II-Ikaros axis.

Protein signaling and regulation of gene expression are the two major mechanisms 
that regulate cellular proliferation in leukemia. Discerning the function of 
these processes is essential for understanding the pathogenesis of leukemia and 
for developing the targeted therapies. Here, we provide an overview of one of 
the mechanisms that regulates gene transcription in leukemia. This mechanism 
involves the direct interaction between Casein Kinase II (CK2) and the Ikaros 
transcription factor. Ikaros (IKZF1) functions as a master regulator of 
hematopoiesis and a tumor suppressor in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). 
Impaired Ikaros function results in the development of high-risk leukemia. 
Ikaros binds to the upstream regulatory elements of its target genes and 
regulates their transcription via chromatin remodeling. In vivo, Ikaros is a 
target for CK2, a pro-oncogenic kinase. CK2 directly phosphorylates Ikaros at 
multiple amino acids. Functional experiments showed that CK2-mediated 
phosphorylation of Ikaros, regulates Ikaros' DNA binding affinity, subcellular 
localization and protein stability. Recent studies revealed that phosphorylation 
of Ikaros by CK2 regulates Ikaros binding and repression of the terminal 
deoxytransferase (TdT) gene in normal thymocytes and in T-cell ALL. Available 
data suggest that the oncogenic activity of CK2 in leukemia involves functional 
inactivation of Ikaros and provide a rationale for CK2 inhibitors as a potential 
treatment for ALL.

How are the regulators regulated?

Falvey E(1), Schibler U.

Author information:
(1)Department of Molecular Biology, University of Geneva, Switzerland.

The cell-type-specific expression of many genes is determined at the level of 
transcription. Transcription factors, acting at promoter and enhancer elements, 
are involved in the control of this process. To understand the basis of this 
regulation it has become important to analyze the control of transcription 
factors themselves. A variety of transcriptional, translational, and 
posttranslational mechanisms have been described, and are discussed in this 
review article.

To understand the mechanisms regulating the tissue non-specific alkaline 
phosphatase (TNAP) activity during development, we characterized 
cis-transcriptional regulatory elements. In embryonic cells and tissues, TNAP 
expression was driven preferentially by the exon 1A (E1A) promoter, one of the 
two promoters previously defined. Transcriptional activity of E1A promoter was 
up-regulated by retinoic acid (RA) through a putative RA-responsive element. 
Transgenic mice analysis with lacZ reporter constructs revealed negative 
regulatory elements within 8.5 kb of E1A promoter. Promoter sequences of 
endogenous TNAP in non-expressing tissues and those carried by the 8.5 kb-lacZ 
transgene were found to be highly methylated. A 1 kb fragment of E1A promoter 
increased the methylation level of lacZ and promoter sequences. The role of RA 
and DNA methylation in defining the embryonic expression pattern of TNAP is 
discussed.

Alu element is the most successful transposon and it maintains a high level of 
content in primate genome. However, despite the fact that the expression level 
of independent Alu element is rather low under common condition, an increasing 
number of the observations for the Alu transcripts in cells and tissues have 
been reported recently. Alu transcripts play key roles in the network of gene 
expression regulation. The main functions of Alu transcript focus on gene 
regulation both at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. This review 
summarizes major functions of Alu transcripts on gene expression and highlights 
molecular mechanisms dependent on conserved sequence or secondary structure in 
order to unravel a relative ubiquitous way that Alu transcript uses to affect 
the whole genome.

To understand most cellular processes, one must understand how genetic 
information is processed. A formidable challenge is the dissection of gene 
regulatory networks to delineate how eukaryotic cells coordinate and govern 
patterns of gene expression that ultimately lead to a phenotype. In this paper, 
we review several approaches for modeling eukaryotic gene regulatory networks 
and for reverse engineering such networks from experimental observations. Since 
we are interested in elucidating the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms of 
colon cancer progression, we use this important biological problem to illustrate 
various aspects of modeling gene regulation. We discuss four important models: 
gene networks, transcriptional regulatory systems, Boolean networks, and 
dynamical Bayesian networks. We review state-of-the-art functional genomics 
techniques, such as gene expression profiling, cis-regulatory element 
identification, TF target gene identification, and gene silencing by RNA 
interference, which can be used to extract information about gene regulation. We 
can employ this information, in conjunction with appropriately designed reverse 
engineering algorithms, to construct a computational model of gene regulation 
that sufficiently predicts experimental observations. In the last part of this 
review, we focus on the problem of reverse engineering transcriptional 
regulatory networks by gene perturbations. We mathematically formulate this 
problem and discuss the role of experimental resolution in our ability to 
reconstruct accurate models of gene regulation. We conclude, by discussing a 
promising approach for inferring a transcriptional regulatory system from 
microarray data obtained by gene perturbations.

Sodium valproate (VPA) is a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, widely 
prescribed in the treatment of bipolar disorder, and yet the precise modes of 
therapeutic action for this drug are not fully understood. After exposure of the 
rat serotonergic cell line RN46A to VPA, RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis 
showed widespread changes in gene expression. Analysis by four bioinformatic 
pipelines revealed as many as 230 genes were significantly upregulated and 72 
genes were significantly downregulated. A subset of 23 differentially expressed 
genes was selected for validation using the nCounter® platform, and of these we 
obtained robust validation for ADAM23, LSP1, MAOB, MMP13, PAK3, SERPINB2, 
SNAP91, WNT6, and ZCCHC12. We investigated the effect of lithium on this subset 
and found four genes, CDKN1C, LSP1, SERPINB2, and WNT6 co-regulated by lithium 
and VPA. We also explored the effects of other HDAC inhibitors and the VPA 
analogue valpromide on the subset of 23 selected genes. Expression of eight of 
these genes, CDKN1C, MAOB, MMP13, NGFR, SHANK3, VGF, WNT6 and ZCCHC12, was 
modified by HDAC inhibition, whereas others did not appear to respond to several 
HDAC inhibitors tested. These results suggest VPA may regulate genes through 
both HDAC-dependent and independent mechanisms. Understanding the broader gene 
regulatory effects of VPA in this serotonergic cell model should provide 
insights into how this drug works and whether other HDAC inhibitor compounds may 
have similar gene regulatory effects, as well as highlighting molecular 
processes that may underlie regulation of mood.

G. L., Page, S. O., Mosley, M. J., Wilson, K. H., Worman, N. P., Campbell, S., 
Fidock, M. D., Furness, L. M., Parry-Smith, D. J., Peter, B., and Bailey, D. S. 
(1995) J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 272, 134-142) and demonstrated predominance of 
alpha1aARs in many human tissues (Price, D. T., Lefkowitz, R. J., Caron, M. G., 
Berkowitz, D., and Schwinn, D. A. (1994) Mol. Pharmacol. 45, 171-175). Several 
lines of evidence indicate that alpha1aARs are important in clinical diseases 
such as myocardial hypertrophy and benign prostatic hyperplasia. Therefore, we 
initiated studies to understand mechanisms underlying regulation of alpha1aAR 
gene transcription. A genomic clone containing 6.2 kb of 5'-untranslated region 
of the human alpha1aAR gene was recently isolated. Ribonuclease protection and 
primer extension assays indicate that alpha1aAR gene transcription occurs at 
multiple initiation sites with the major site located 696 base pairs upstream of 
the ATG, where a classic initiator sequence is located. Transfection of 
luciferase reporter constructs containing varying amounts of 5'-untranslated 
region into human SK-N-MC neuroblastoma cells indicate that a region extending 
125 base pairs upstream from the main transcription initiation site contains 
full alpha1aAR promoter activity. Furthermore, distinct activator and suppressor 
elements lie 2-3 and 3-5 kilobase pairs upstream, respectively. Although the 
alpha1aAR promoter contains neither TATA or CAAT elements, gel shift mobility 
assays targeting three GC boxes immediately upstream of the main transcription 
initiation site confirm binding of Sp1. Activity of the alpha1aAR promoter is 
cell-specific, demonstrating highest activity in cells endogenously expressing 
alpha1aARs. The human alpha1aAR gene also contains several cis regulatory 
elements, including several insulin and cAMP response elements. Consistent with 
these observations, we provide the first evidence that treatment of SK-N-MC 
cells with insulin and cAMP elevating agents leads to an increase in alpha1aAR 
expression. In conclusion, these data represent the first characterization of 
the alpha1aAR gene; our findings should facilitate further studies designed to 
understand mechanisms regulating alpha1AR subtype-specific expression in healthy 
and diseased human tissue.

Cysteine donates sulfur to macromolecules and occurs naturally in many proteins. 
Because low concentrations of cysteine are cytotoxic, its intracellular 
concentration is stringently controlled. In bacteria, cysteine biosynthesis is 
regulated by feedback inhibition of the activities of serine acetyltransferase 
(SAT) and 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (3-PGDH) and is also regulated at the 
transcriptional level by inducing the cysteine regulon using the master 
regulator CysB. Here, we describe two novel cysteine-inducible systems that 
regulate the cysteine resistance of Pantoea ananatis, a member of the family 
Enterobacteriaceae that shows great potential for producing substances useful 
for biotechnological, medical, and industrial purposes. One locus, designated 
ccdA(formerly PAJ_0331), encodes a novel cysteine-inducible cysteine 
desulfhydrase (CD) that degrades cysteine, and its expression is controlled by 
the transcriptional regulator encoded byccdR(formerly PAJ_0332 orybaO), located 
just upstream of ccdA The other locus, designated cefA (formerly PAJ_3026), 
encodes a novel cysteine-inducible cysteine efflux pump that is controlled by 
the transcriptional regulator cefR(formerly PAJ_3027), located just upstream of 
cefA To our knowledge, this is the first example where the expression of CD and 
an efflux pump is regulated in response to cysteine and is directly involved in 
imparting resistance to excess levels of cysteine. We propose that ccdA and cefA 
function as safety valves that maintain homeostasis when the intra- or 
extracellular cysteine concentration fluctuates. Our findings contribute 
important insights into optimizing the production of cysteine and related 
biomaterials by P. ananatis
IMPORTANCE: Because of its toxicity, the bacterial intracellular cysteine level 
is stringently regulated at biosynthesis. This work describes the identification 
and characterization of two novel cysteine-inducible systems that regulate, 
through degradation and efflux, the cysteine resistance of Pantoea ananatis, a 
member of the family Enterobacteriaceae that shows great potential for producing 
substances useful for industrial purposes. We propose that this novel mechanism 
for sensing and regulating cysteine levels is a safety valve enabling adaptation 
to sudden changes in intra- or extracellular cysteine levels in bacteria. Our 
findings provide important insights into optimizing the production of cysteine 
and related biomaterials by P. ananatis and also a deep understanding of 
sulfur/cysteine metabolism and regulation in this plant pathogen and related 
bacteria.

Cobalt chloride has been used as a hypoxia mimetic because it stabilizes hypoxia 
inducible factor-1α (HIF1-α) and activates gene transcription through a hypoxia 
responsive element (HRE). However, differences between hypoxia and hypoxia 
mimetic cobalt chloride in gene regulation remain elusive. Expression of 
ferritin, the major iron storage protein, is regulated at the transcriptional 
and posttranscriptional levels through DNA and RNA regulatory elements. Here we 
demonstrate that hypoxia and cobalt chloride regulate ferritin heavy chain 
(ferritin H) expression by two distinct mechanisms. Both hypoxia and cobalt 
chloride increased HIF1-α but a putative HRE in the human ferritin H gene was 
not activated. Instead, cobalt chloride but not hypoxia activated ferritin H 
transcription through an antioxidant responsive element (ARE), to which Nrf2 was 
recruited. Intriguingly, cobalt chloride downregulated ferritin H protein 
expression while it upregulated other ARE-regulated antioxidant genes in K562 
cells. Further characterization demonstrated that cobalt chloride increased 
interaction between iron regulatory proteins (IRP1 and IRP2) and iron responsive 
element (IRE) in the 5'UTR of ferritin H mRNA, resulting in translational block 
of the accumulated ferritin H mRNA. In contrast, hypoxia had marginal effect on 
ferritin H transcription but increased its translation through decreased 
IRP1-IRE interaction. These results suggest that hypoxia and hypoxia mimetic 
cobalt chloride employ distinct regulatory mechanisms through the interplay 
between DNA and mRNA elements at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional 
levels.

Combinatorial transcriptional regulation: the interaction of transcription 
factors and cell signaling molecules with homeodomain proteins in Drosophila 
development.

Patterning and cell fate specification during development require complex 
interplay among multiple families of transcription factors to establish, 
maintain, and coordinate transcriptional cascades. During these processes, 
homeodomain proteins and cell signaling proteins cooperate to generate 
tissue-and stage-specific responses. This review of physical and genetic 
interactions in Drosophila melanogaster development highlights the cross-talk 
among these protein families. Protein-protein association can modulate 
regulation by both signal transduction-regulated transcription factors and 
homeodomain proteins, as observed in Drosophila and other organisms. Enhancers 
or genes regulated by multiple transcription factors provide opportunities for 
protein-protein binding to modulate transcription factor function. Combinatorial 
regulation of several enhancers by homeodomain proteins and cell 
signaling-regulated transcription factors is discussed; detailed maps of the 
genetic interactions that pattern the embryonic midgut and the larval wing 
imaginal disc are used to illustrate the multiplicity of potential 
protein-protein interactions. These interactions potentially provide direct 
mechanisms for communication between transcription factors as well as for 
generating the requisite functional specificity.

Regulatory elements controlling the basal and drug-inducible expression of 
glutathione S-transferase Ya subunit gene.

The synthesis of the glutathione S-transferase Ya subunit is induced in the 
mammalian liver by chemicals such as phenobarbital and 3-methylcholanthrene. To 
study the mechanism of this induction, the 5'-flanking region of a mouse 
glutathione S-transferase Ya subunit gene was fused to the structural gene for 
chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. The fusion gene was introduced into hepatoma 
cells for the assay of the expressed acetyltransferase activity. At least two 
cis-regulatory elements were identified in the 5'-flanking region of the Ya 
gene: one, responsible for the basal level of expression, is present in the 
sequence up to -0.2 kb; another, responsible for the inducible expression by 
aromatic compounds such as beta-naphthoflavone and 3-methylcholanthrene, is 
located in the sequence from -0.2 kb to -1.6 kb. The inducible element was 
functional only in cells with normal aromatic compound receptors, and it 
retained responsiveness to beta-naphthoflavone when transfected into homologous 
(mouse) or heterologous (rat, human) hepatoma cells. A 150-bp region upstream 
from the transcription initiation site of the mouse Ya gene was investigated for 
cis-acting transcriptional elements that are recognized by specific DNA-binding 
proteins. We show by DNase I foot-printing assays using extracts from liver 
nuclei that the Ya gene promoter contains, in addition to the TATA and CCAAT 
boxes, a more distal element that binds a protein which is probably related to 
the family of nuclear factor 1 (NF1).

Myelin basic protein gene transcription. Identification of proximal and distal 
cis-acting regulatory elements.

Myelin basic proteins (MBPs) represent a major component of the myelin membrane 
which are exclusively expressed by glial cells in the nervous system. The cell 
type-specific expression of MBP is controlled preferentially at the level of RNA 
synthesis. To investigate the mechanisms by which the MBP gene is regulated, we 
analyzed transcriptional regulation of this gene in glial and non-glial cells. 
We have demonstrated that the 320 base pairs upstream of the MBP transcriptional 
start site contain regulatory elements that preferentially stimulate 
transcription of MBPs in glial cells. Using a test vector containing the simian 
virus 40 (SV40) early promoter placed upstream of the bacterial chloramphenicol 
acetyltransferase gene, we localized three major promoter elements within the 
5'-upstream sequence. These elements, designated MB1, MB4, and MB7, spanning 
proximal (-14 to -50) and distal (-130 to -169 and -249 to -288) positions with 
respect to the RNA initiation site, activated SV40 promoter transcription more 
than 40-fold in glial cells. The promoter distal elements, MB4 and MB7, enhanced 
SV40 promoter activity 2- and 8-fold, respectively, in L cells. Using the gel 
mobility shift assay, we have demonstrated that the MBP activators (MB1, MB4, 
and MB7) interact with multiple proteins derived from glial and L cell extract 
and result in the formation of several complexes. Comparison of band intensity 
of these complexes implies that these cells contain both unique and ubiquitous 
DNA binding proteins that recognize the DNA sequences within these activators. 
These studies suggest that the MBP promoter consists of several regulatory 
sequences in which the proximal element, MB1, and one of the distal elements, 
MB4, are selectively more active in glial cells than in L cells. Thus, these 
novel regulatory elements, in concert with other sequences, appear to stimulate 
MBP promoter transcription in glial cells.

Regulation of inducible and tissue-specific gene expression.

Maniatis T, Goodbourn S, Fischer JA.

Molecular genetics approaches have been used to identify and characterize 
cis-acting DNA sequences required for eukaryotic gene regulation. These 
sequences are modular in nature, consisting of arrays of short (10- to 12-base 
pair) recognition elements that interact with specific transcription factors. 
Some transcription factors have been extensively purified and the corresponding 
genes have been cloned, but the mechanisms by which they promote transcription 
are not yet understood. Positive and negative regulatory elements that function 
only in specific cell types or in response to extracellular inducers have been 
identified. A number of cases of inducible and tissue-specific gene expression 
involve the activation of preexisting transcription factors, rather than the 
synthesis of new proteins. This activation may involve covalent modification of 
the protein or an allosteric change in its structure. The modification of 
regulatory proteins may play a central role in the mechanisms of eukaryotic gene 
regulation.

Initiated by CREB: Resolving Gene Regulatory Programs in Learning and Memory: 
Switch in Cofactors and Transcription Regulators between Memory Consolidation 
and Maintenance Network.

Kaldun JC(1), Sprecher SG(1).

Consolidation of long-term memory is a highly and precisely regulated multistep 
process. The transcription regulator cAMP response element-binding protein 
(CREB) plays a key role in initiating memory consolidation. With time 
processing, first the cofactors are changed and, secondly, CREB gets 
dispensable. This ultimately changes the expressed gene program to genes 
required to maintain the memory. Regulation of memory consolidation also 
requires epigenetic mechanisms and control at the RNA level. At the neuronal 
circuit level, oscillation in the activity of CREB and downstream factor define 
engram cells. Together the combination of all regulation mechanisms allows 
correct memory processing while keeping the process dynamic and flexible to 
adjust to different contexts. Also see the video abstract here

AmtR, the master regulator of nitrogen control in Corynebacterium glutamicum, 
represses transcription of a number of genes during nitrogen surplus. Repression 
is released by an interaction of AmtR with signal transduction protein GlnK. As 
shown by pull-down assays and gel retardation experiments, only adenylylated 
GlnK, which is present in the cells during nitrogen limitation, is able to bind 
to AmtR. The AmtR regulon was characterized in this study by a combination of 
bioinformatics, transcriptome and proteome analyses. At least 33 genes are 
directly controlled by the repressor protein including those encoding 
transporters and enzymes for ammonium assimilation (amtA, amtB, glnA, gltBD), 
urea and creatinine metabolism (urtABCDE, ureABCEFGD, crnT, codA), a number of 
biochemically uncharacterized enzymes and transport systems (NCgl1099, NCgl1100, 
NCgl 1915-1918) as well as signal transduction proteins (glnD, glnK). For the 
AmtR regulon, an AmtR box has been defined which comprises the sequence 
tttCTATN6AtAGat/aA. Furthermore, the transcriptional organization of 
AmtR-regulated genes and operons was characterized.

Identification of two novel regulatory genes involved in pristinamycin 
biosynthesis and elucidation of the mechanism for AtrA-p-mediated regulation in 
Streptomyces pristinaespiralis.

Ecology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of 
Sciences, Shanghai, 200032, People's Republic of China.

In this study, using a transposon-based strategy, two novel regulatory genes 
were identified as being involved in the biosynthesis of both pristinamycin I 
(PI) and II (PII) in Streptomyces pristinaespiralis, including a TetR-family 
regulatory gene atrA-p (SSDG_00466) and an orphan histidine kinase gene 
SSDG_02492. The mechanism by which AtrA-p exerted a positive role in 
pristinamycin production was elucidated. We showed that deletion of atrA-p 
resulted in a delayed production of both PI and PII as well as reduced PII 
production. Transcriptional analysis integrated with electrophoretic mobility 
shift assays (EMSAs) demonstrated that AtrA-p played a positive role in 
pristinamycin production by directly activating the transcription of two 
cluster-situated regulatory genes, spbR and papR5, which encode a 
γ-butyrolactone receptor protein and a TetR-family repressor, respectively. The 
precise AtrA-p-binding sites upstream of these two targets were determined, 
which allowed the identification of a relatively conserved binding motif 
comprising two 5-nt inverted repeats separated by a variable 5-nt sequence 
(5'-GGAAT-n5-ATTCC-3') possibly required for the regulation of AtrA-like 
regulators in Streptomyces. Base substitutions of the AtrA-p-binding sites on 
the genome caused similar decreases in spbR and papR5 transcription as those 
observed in ∆atrA-p. Taken together, herein, a novel mechanism for 
AtrA-dependent regulation of antibiotic biosynthesis was revealed in S. 
pristinaespiralis, which is distinct from those of its homologs, AtrA-c from 
Streptomyces coelicolor, AtrA-g from Streptomyces griseus, and AtrA from 
Streptomyces roseosporus that perform their effects in antibiotic biosynthesis 
directly via pathway-specific activator genes or the biosynthetic structural 
genes.

Transcriptional regulation by cAMP and Ca2+ links the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger 3 to 
memory and sensory pathways.

Gabellini N(1).

nadia.gabellini@unipd.it

The signaling cascades triggered by neurotrophins such as BDNF and by several 
neurotransmitters and hormones lead to the rapid induction of gene transcription 
by increasing the intracellular concentration of cAMP and Ca2+. This review 
examines the mechanisms by which these second messengers control transcriptional 
initiation at CRE promoters via transcription factor CREB, as well as at DRE 
sites via transcriptional repressor DREAM. The regulation of the SLC8A3 gene 
encoding the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger 3 (NCX3) is taken as an example to illustrate 
both mechanisms since it includes a CRE site in the promoter and several DRE 
sites in the exon 1 sequence. The upregulation of the NCX3 by Ca2+ signals may 
be specifically required to establish the Ca2+ balance that regulates several 
physiological and pathological processes in neurons. The regulatory features and 
the expression pattern of SLC8A3 gene suggest that NCX3 activity could be 
crucial in neuronal functions such as memory formation and sensory processing.

The abnormal transcriptional regulation of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) and 
protein-coding genes (PCGs) is contributed to various biological processes and 
linked with human diseases, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. In 
this study, we developed ChIPBase v2.0 (http://rna.sysu.edu.cn/chipbase/) to 
explore the transcriptional regulatory networks of ncRNAs and PCGs. ChIPBase 
v2.0 has been expanded with ∼10 200 curated ChIP-seq datasets, which represent 
about 20 times expansion when comparing to the previous released version. We 
identified thousands of binding motif matrices and their binding sites from 
ChIP-seq data of DNA-binding proteins and predicted millions of transcriptional 
regulatory relationships between transcription factors (TFs) and genes. We 
constructed 'Regulator' module to predict hundreds of TFs and histone 
modifications that were involved in or affected transcription of ncRNAs and 
PCGs. Moreover, we built a web-based tool, Co-Expression, to explore the 
co-expression patterns between DNA-binding proteins and various types of genes 
by integrating the gene expression profiles of ∼10 000 tumor samples and ∼9100 
normal tissues and cell lines. ChIPBase also provides a ChIP-Function tool and a 
genome browser to predict functions of diverse genes and visualize various 
ChIP-seq data. This study will greatly expand our understanding of the 
transcriptional regulations of ncRNAs and PCGs.

Transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation of Shigella shuT in response 
to host-associated iron availability and temperature.

Like most bacteria, Shigella must maintain a precise balance between the 
necessity and toxicity of iron; a balance that is achieved, at least in part, by 
regulating the production of bacterial iron acquisition systems in response to 
specific environmental signals. Using the Shigella heme utilization (Shu) 
system, S. dysenteriae is able to acquire iron from heme, a potentially rich 
source of nutritional iron within the otherwise iron-limited environment of the 
human host. Investigations presented within reveal two distinct molecular 
mechanisms underlying previously uncharacterized transcriptional and 
translational regulation of shuT, a gene encoding the periplasmic-binding 
component of the Shu system. While shuT transcription is regulated in response 
to iron availability via a process dependent upon the global regulator Fur and a 
Fur-binding site located immediately downstream of the promoter, shuT 
translation is regulated in response to environmental temperature via the 
activity of an RNA thermometer located within the 5' untranslated region of the 
gene. Such complex regulation likely increases the fitness of S. dysenteriae by 
ensuring maximal ShuT production when the pathogen is within the iron-limited 
and relatively warm environment of the infected host, the only environment in 
which heme will be encountered as a potential source of essential iron.

The ferric uptake regulator (Fur) is a global regulator that influences the 
expression of virulence genes in Klebsiella pneumoniae. Bioinformatics analysis 
suggests Fur may involve in iron acquisition via the identified regulatory box 
upstream of the yersiniabactin receptor gene fyuA. To observe the impact of the 
gene fyuA on the virulence of K. pneumoniae, the gene fyuA knockout strain and 
complementation strain were constructed and then conducted a series of 
phenotypic experiments including chrome azurol S (CAS) detection, crystal violet 
staining, and wax moth virulence experiment. To examine the regulatory 
relationship between Fur and the gene fyuA, green fluorescent protein (GFP) 
reporter gene fusion assay, real-time quantitative reverse transcription 
polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), gel migration assay (EMSA), and DNase I 
footprinting assay were used to clarify the regulatory mechanism of Fur on fyuA. 
CAS detection revealed that the gene fyuA could affect the generation of iron 
carriers in K. pneumoniae. Crystal violet staining experiment showed that fyuA 
could positively influence biofilm formation. Wax moth virulence experiment 
indicated that the deletion of the fyuA could weaken bacterial virulence. GFP 
reporter gene fusion experiment and RT-qPCR analysis revealed that Fur 
negatively regulated the expression of fyuA in iron-sufficient environment. EMSA 
experiment demonstrated that Fur could directly bind to the promoter region of 
fyuA, and DNase I footprinting assay further identified the specific binding 
site sequences. The study showed that Fur negatively regulated the 
transcriptional expression of fyuA by binding to upstream of the gene promoter 
region, and then affected the virulence of K. pneumoniae.

Numerous genes contain regulatory elements located many tens of kilobases away 
from the promoter they control. Specific mechanisms must be required to ensure 
that such distant elements can find and interact with their proper targets but 
not with extraneous genes. This review explores the connections between 
transvection phenomena, the activation of domains of homeotic gene expression, 
position effect variegation and silencers. These various examples of 
long-distance effects suggest that, in all cases, related forms of chromatin 
packaging may be involved.

We have determined the nucleotide (nt) sequence of 5.5 kb including the 5' 
flanking, first untranslated exon and first intron regions of the human smooth 
muscle (SM) (aortic type) alpha-actin-(Sm alpha A)- encoding gene. The promoter 
region and a part of the first intron show remarkably high sequence conservation 
with equivalent regions of the chicken gene, and contain multiple 
transcriptional regulatory elements. From transient chloramphenicol 
acetyltransferase gene (cat) expression assays in SM cells, a DNA fragment from 
nt -123 to +49 containing two CArG boxes showed strong positive promoter 
activity, whereas a far upstream region from nt -253 to -124 showed a negative 
effect. The conserved region in the first intron also contains the CArG box and 
showed an enhancer activity. Therefore, the human SM alpha A gene is controlled 
under positive and negative mechanisms.

Selector proteins regulate the formation and identity of animal body regions, 
organs, tissues, and cell types. Recent studies have focused on the regulation 
of the DNA binding and transcriptional regulatory activity of this special class 
of transcription factors. Elucidation of the architecture of selector-regulated 
target gene enhancers and gene networks, and comparative studies of selector

In an attempt to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the regulation of 
bradykinin B2 receptor gene expression, the molecular structure of the rat gene 
including the 5'-flanking region was characterized (J. Biol. Chem. 269: 
26920-26925, 1994). In this study we show that the gene spans about 32 kb, 
including a long first intron of 25 kb. The promoter region drives reporter gene 
expression in NG108-15 neuroglioma cells, and its expression is upregulated by 
cAMP, bradykinin, phorbol esters and by coexpression of an activated ras 
oncogene but not by dexamethasone.

The information encoded in genomes supports the differentiation and function of 
the more than 200 unique cell types, which exist in various mammalian species. 
The major mechanism driving cellular differentiation and specification is 
differential gene expression regulation. Cis-acting enhancers and silencers 
appear to have key roles in regulating the expression of mammalian genes. 
However, these cis-acting elements are often located very far away from the 
regulated gene. Therefore, it is hard to find all of them and link them to the 
regulated gene. An intriguing and unresolved issue of the field is to identify 
all of the enhancers of a particular gene and link these short regulatory 
sequences to the genes they regulate and thus, reliably identify gene regulatory 
enhancer networks. Recent advances in molecular biological methods coupled with 
Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies have opened up new possibilities 
in this area of genomics. In this review we summarize the technological 
advances, bioinformatics challenges and the potential molecular mechanisms 
allowing the construction of enhancer networks operating in specific cell types 
and/or activated by various signals.

Steroid action on gene expression: possible roles of regulatory genes and 
nuclear acceptor sites.

There has been exciting progress in the understanding of the mechanism of action 
of steroid hormones. The structures and functions of the various receptor 
protein domains as well as the various domains of steroid-regulated genes, 
including steroid response elements, are currently being elucidated. The roles 
of transcription factors in the steroid-altered regulation of gene transcription 
are just being defined. The nature of the nuclear acceptor sites, i.e. 
nuclear-binding sites, for steroid receptors are under investigation. The 
composition, location, and function of these nuclear acceptor sites for steroid 
receptors is crucial for understanding the mechanism of steroid regulation of 
gene expression. Possible roles of specific, DNA-binding, chromatin proteins in 
these acceptor sites have been suggested. A very rapid action of steroids on the 
expression of proto-oncogenes that code for nuclear regulatory proteins has 
recently been described. Using this information, we have proposed a novel 
steroid action model utilizing "regulatory genes" whereby the steroids would 
rapidly alter the expression of regulatory genes (early genes) whose protein 
products would return to the nucleus to regulate the expression of structural 
genes (late genes). The latter would occur via binding of these regulatory 
proteins (e.g. transcription factors) to the steroid-regulatory elements 
neighboring these late genes. This model would explain many of the 
characteristics reported from many laboratories on the action of steroid 
hormones on gene expression.

Regulation of the Bacillus subtilis pyrimidine biosynthetic (pyr) gene cluster 
by an autogenous transcriptional attenuation mechanism.

Turner RJ(1), Lu Y, Switzer RL.

A complete transcript of the Bacillus subtilis pyr operon contains the following 
elements in 5' to 3' order: a 151-nucleotide (nt) untranslated leader; pyrR, 
encoding a 20-kDa protein; a 173-nt intercistronic region; pyrP, encoding a 
46-kDa protein; a 145-nt intercistronic region; and eight overlapping cistrons 
encoding all of the six enzymes for de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis. 
Transcription is controlled by the availability of pyrimidines via an 
attenuation mechanism. There are three transcription terminators within the 
operon, each of which is preceded by another stem-loop structure, the 
antiterminator, whose formation would prevent formation of the terminator 
stem-loop. These are located in the leader, the pyrR-pyrP intercistronic region, 
and the pyrP-pyrB intercistronic region. Northern (RNA) blot analysis has 
identified transcripts of lengths which coincide with termination at these 
proposed attenuation sites and whose relative abundances vary in the expected 
pyrimidine-dependent manner. Each antiterminator contains a 50-base conserved 
sequence in its promoter-proximal half. Various transcriptional fusions of the 
pyr promoter and surrounding sequences to promoterless reporter genes support an 
attenuation mechanism whereby when pyrimidines are abundant, the PyrR protein 
binds to the conserved sequence in the pyr mRNA and disrupts the antiterminator, 
permitting terminator hairpin formation and promoting transcription termination. 
Deletion of pyrR from the chromosome resulted in the constitutive, elevated 
expression of aspartate transcarbamylase, which is encoded by pyrB, the third 
gene in the operon. Complementation of an E. coli upp mutant, as well as direct 
enzymatic assay, has demonstrated that pyrR also confers uracil 
phosphoribosyltransferase activity. Analysis of pyrR and upp deletion mutants 
demonstrated that upp, not pyrR, encodes the quantitatively important uracil 
phosphoribosyltransferase activity. The pyrP gene probably encodes an integral 
membrane uracil permease.

Transcriptional regulation of the human Runx2/Cbfa1 gene promoter by bone 
morphogenetic protein-7.

School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.

It is well established that core binding factor Runx2/Cbfa1 is required for 
osteoblast recruitment and differentiation from mesenchymal stem cells. 
Transcriptional regulation of the Runx2/Cbfa1 gene by osteogenic factors such as 
bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) plays an important role in the stimulation of 
bone formation by these cytokines. BMP7 (also termed OP-1) is a member of the 
transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) superfamily and induces osteoblast 
differentiation from mesenchymal precursor stem cells in vitro as well as bone 
formation in vivo. This study examines the effects of BMP7 on markers of 
osteoblast differentiation and specifically on human Runx2/Cbfa1 gene 
transcription in a mouse C2C12 myoblast cell line where it induces expression of 
both alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and endogenous Runx2/Cbfa1. To further 
understand the mechanisms of human Runx2/Cbfa1 transcriptional regulation by 
BMP7, we cloned 3.0 kb of the human Runx2/Cbfa1 gene 5'-upstream flanking region 
and created a series of promoter deletions cloned into luciferase-based reporter 
vectors (Runx2/Cbfa1/Luc). Sequence data revealed six copies of the osteoblastic 
cis-acting element (OSE2) in the proximal promoter region. In C2C12 cells 
transiently transfected with Runx2/Cbfa1/Luc deletion constructs, 
transcriptional activity of Runx2/Cbfa1 was upregulated up to 2-fold after 24 h 
of BMP7 treatment. Mutational analysis demonstrated that the minimal responsive 
promoter region for BMP7-regulated transcription maps to a proximal -74 OSE2 
site. Electromobility shift assays with C2C12 cellular extracts indicate that 
BMP7 increases binding of OSE2 promoter sequences, and supershift assays with 
anti-Runx2/Cbfa1 antibodies demonstrate that Runx2/Cbfa1 is part of the 
nucleoprotein complex binding OSE2. Together, these data indicate BMP7 can 
upregulate Runx2/Cbfa1 gene expression in C2C12 myoblast cells, and suggest that 
Runx2/Cbfa1 may bind to OSE2 elements within its own promoter to autoregulate 
gene transcription in differentiating osteoblasts.

Mechanisms of mammalian zinc-regulated gene expression.

UK.

Mechanisms through which gene expression is regulated by zinc are central to 
cellular zinc homoeostasis. In this context, evidence for the involvement of 
zinc dyshomoeostasis in the aetiology of diseases, including Type 2 diabetes, 
Alzheimer's disease and cancer, highlights the importance of zinc-regulated gene 
expression. Mechanisms elucidated in bacteria and yeast provide examples of 
different possible modes of zinc-sensitive gene regulation, involving the 
zinc-regulated binding of transcriptional activators and repressors to gene 
promoter regions. A mammalian transcriptional regulatory mechanism that mediates 
zinc-induced transcriptional up-regulation, involving the transcription factor 
MTF1 (metal-response element-binding transcription factor 1), has been studied 
extensively. Gene responses in the opposite direction (reduced mRNA levels in 
response to increased zinc availability) have been observed in mammalian cells, 
but a specific transcriptional regulatory process responsible for such a 
response has yet to be identified. Examples of single zinc-sensitive 
transcription factors regulating gene expression in opposite directions are 
emerging. Although zinc-induced transcriptional repression by MTF1 is a possible 
explanation in some specific instances, such a mechanism cannot account for 
repression by zinc of all mammalian genes that show this mode of regulation, 
indicating the existence of as yet uncharacterized mechanisms of zinc-regulated 
transcription in mammalian cells. In addition, recent findings reveal a role for 
effects of zinc on mRNA stability in the regulation of specific zinc 
transporters. Our studies on the regulation of the human gene SLC30A5 (solute 
carrier 30A5), which codes for the zinc transporter ZnT5, have revealed that 
this gene provides a model system by which to study both zinc-induced 
transcriptional down-regulation and zinc-regulated mRNA stabilization.

Since the completion of genome sequences of model organisms, functional 
identification of unknown genes has become a principal challenge in biology. 
Post-genomics sciences such as transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics are 
expected to discover gene functions. This report outlines the elucidation of 
gene-to-gene and metabolite-to-gene networks via integration of metabolomics 
with transcriptomics and presents a strategy for the identification of novel 
gene functions. Metabolomics and transcriptomics data of Arabidopsis grown under 
sulfur deficiency were combined and analyzed by batch-learning self-organizing 
mapping. A group of metabolites/genes regulated by the same mechanism clustered 
together. The metabolism of glucosinolates was shown to be coordinately 
regulated. Three uncharacterized putative sulfotransferase genes clustering 
together with known glucosinolate biosynthesis genes were candidates for 
involvement in biosynthesis. In vitro enzymatic assays of the recombinant gene 
products confirmed their functions as desulfoglucosinolate sulfotransferases. 
Several genes involved in sulfur assimilation clustered with O-acetylserine, 
which is considered a positive regulator of these genes. The genes involved in 
anthocyanin biosynthesis clustered with the gene encoding a transcriptional 
factor that up-regulates specifically anthocyanin biosynthesis genes. These 
results suggested that regulatory metabolites and transcriptional factor genes 
can be identified by this approach, based on the assumption that they cluster 
with the downstream genes they regulate. This strategy is applicable not only to 
plant but also to other organisms for functional elucidation of unknown genes.

Methanotrophic bacteria show significant promise for methane bioconversion. 
Despite their ecological and biotechnological importance, the understanding of 
their transcriptional regulation and genetic regulatory elements remains 
limited. Here, we applied high-throughput sequencing to elucidate the 
transcriptional regulatory landscape of Methylosinus sporium 5, a type II 
methanotroph. With its genome sequence completion, we identified 1,983 
transcription start sites (TSSs) and 1,483 transcript 3'-ends (TEPs), which 
collectively defined 1,431 transcription units (TUs). This comprehensive 
analysis revealed diverse regulatory elements, including promoters, untranslated 
regions (UTRs), terminators, and regulatory RNAs in M. sporium 5. A consensus 
promoter motif comprizing conserved -10 (TATAHT) and -35 (TYGMSV) elements, 
recognized by the housekeeping sigma factor RpoD, was predominant, particularly 
upstream of genes involved in methane and central carbon metabolism. We also 
uncovered diverse cis-regulatory motifs associated with nitrogen metabolism and 
cell division, including binding sites for RpoN (σ54) and the transcription 
regulator CtrA. TEP analysis identified three classes of transcript ends with 
distinct sequence features and termination strengths. I-shaped intrinsic 
terminators were most prevalent, while L-shaped terminators were enriched in 
highly expressed genes, ensuring efficient transcription termination. 
Integration of TSSs and TEPs revealed functionally related genes within 
polycistronic TUs and identified previously unannotated small RNAs, including 
EcpR1 and αr45. This study provides the first genome-scale map of 
transcriptional regulation in a methanotroph, offering foundational insights 
into regulatory architecture and enabling future strain engineering for enhanced 
methane bioconversion.IMPORTANCEMethanotrophic bacteria offer a sustainable 
solution for converting methane into valuable products. However, the molecular 
mechanisms governing gene expression regulation in methanotrophs remain poorly 
understood. In this study, we applied high-throughput sequencing approaches to 
elucidate gene organization and transcriptional regulation in Methylosinus 
sporium 5 during growth on methane. By identifying key regulatory features 
including promoter sequences, diverse cis-regulatory elements, and transcript 
boundaries, we revealed the coordinated gene expression mechanisms in this 
organism. This represents the first genome-wide transcriptome architecture in a 
methanotrophic bacterium. The regulatory elements provide a valuable resource 
for future genetic engineering of M. sporium 5 and related methanotrophs. Our 
findings significantly advance the understanding of gene regulation in 
methanotrophs and support their development as microbial platforms for 
methane-based biomanufacturing.

The cDNA of a new human mesangium-predominant gene, megsin, a novel member of 
the serpin superfamily, has recently been cloned. This study investigates the 
regulatory mechanisms of megsin gene expression. A genomic clone of the human 
megsin gene was obtained by screening bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) 
library with the megsin cDNA. The analysis for exon-intron junctions of megsin 
genomic DNA demonstrated that the gene contained 8 exons and 7 introns, spanned 
20 kbp, and that the genomic structure of the serpin superfamily was highly 
conserved. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) revealed that the megsin 
gene is localized in chromosome 18q21.3, close to the other serpin genes. The 
transcriptional start site, located by primer extension analysis, was 391 bp 
upstream from the start codon. The sequence and reporter analyses on 
4021-bp-long 5'-flanking region of megsin gene demonstrated a consensus promoter 
segment within this region and a relatively strong promoter activity in human 
mesangial cells and A431, a human tumor cell line recently reported to express a 
novel serpin identical with megsin. Moreover, this study utilized site-directed 
and deletion mutagenesis analyses, and electrophoretic mobility shift assay 
identified one positive regulatory motif, an incomplete activator protein-1 
(AP-1) binding motif (CTGATTCAC) within the -120 to -112 region. This cis-acting 
element in the 5'-flanking region of megsin is involved in the activation of the 
megsin gene in mesangial cells.

Transcribed conserved non-coding elements (TCNEs), which are non-coding genomic 
elements that can regulate vital gene expression, play an unclear role in the 
development of severe diseases mainly associated with carcinogenesis. Currently, 
there are no mature tools for the identification of TCNEs. To compensate for the 
lack of a systematic interpretation of the functional characterization and 
regulatory mechanisms of TCNE spatiotemporal activities, we developed a flexible 
pipeline, called captureTCNE, to depict the landscape of TCNEs and applied it to 
our breast cancer cohort (SEU-BRCA). Meanwhile, we investigated the genome-wide 
characteristics of TCNEs and unraveled that TCNEs harbor enhancer-like chromatin 
signatures as well as participate in the transcriptional machinery to regulate 
essential genes or architect biological regulatory networks of breast cancer. 
Specifically, the TCNE transcripts could recruit RBPs, such as ENOX1 and PTBP1, 
which are involved in gene expression regulation, to participate in the 
formation of regulatory networks and the association with altered splicing 
patterns. In particular, the presence of a non-classical secondary structure, 
called RNA G-quadruplex, on TCNE transcripts contributed to the recruitment of 
RBPs associated with subtype-specific transcriptional processes related to the 
estrogen response in breast cancer. Ultimately, we also analyzed the mutational 
signatures of variant-containing TCNEs and discerned twenty-one genes as 
essential components of the regulatory mechanism of TCNEs in breast cancer. Our 
study provides an effective TCNE identification pipeline and insights into the 
regulatory mechanisms of TCNEs in breast cancer, contributing to further 
knowledge of TCNEs and the emergence of innovative therapeutic strategies for 
breast cancer.

Genetically controlled variation in alpha2beta1 expression by human blood 
platelets was previously described. Sixty-two haplotype sequences corresponding 
to the proximal 5' regulatory region (-1096 to +1) of the alpha2 gene were 
compared, and a dimorphic sequence -52C>T was identified that is located 
precisely between 2 tandem Sp1/Sp3 binding elements previously shown to be 
absolutely required for transcriptional activity of this gene in epithelial cell 
lines and the erythroleukemic cell line K562. The gene frequency of -52T in a 
random Caucasian population is approximately 0.35, and the expression of -52T 
correlates directly with reduced densities of platelet alpha2beta1. In mobility 
shift analyses, the -52T substitution attenuates complex formation with both Sp1 
and Sp3. When transfected into the erythroleukemia cell line Dami, 
promoter-luciferase constructs bearing the -52T sequence exhibit a 5-fold 
decrease in activity relative to the -52C construct. In transfected CHRF-288-11 
megakaryocytic cells, the corresponding activity decreases by 10-fold. The -52T 
sequence appears to be in linkage disequilibrium with the previously defined 
allele A3 (807C; HPA-5b), known to be associated with diminished expression of 
platelet alpha2beta1. In summary, a natural dimorphism has been identified 
within the proximal 5' regulatory region of the human integrin alpha2 gene that 
is responsible for decreased expression levels of the integrin alpha2beta1 on 
blood platelets through a mechanism that is probably mediated by the nuclear 
regulatory proteins Sp1 and Sp3.

Transcriptional control is a major mechanism for regulating gene expression. The 
complex machinery required to effect this control is still emerging from 
functional and evolutionary analysis of genomic architecture. In addition to the 
promoter, many other regulatory elements are required for spatiotemporally and 
quantitatively correct gene expression. Enhancer and repressor elements may 
reside in introns or up- and downstream of the transcription unit. For some 
genes with highly complex expression patterns--often those that function as key 
developmental control genes--the cis-regulatory domain can extend long distances 
outside the transcription unit. Some of the earliest hints of this came from 
disease-associated chromosomal breaks positioned well outside the relevant gene. 
With the availability of wide-ranging genome sequence comparisons, strong 
conservation of many noncoding regions became obvious. Functional studies have 
shown many of these conserved sites to be transcriptional regulatory elements 
that sometimes reside inside unrelated neighboring genes. Such 
sequence-conserved elements generally harbor sites for tissue-specific 
DNA-binding proteins. Developmentally variable chromatin conformation can 
control protein access to these sites and can regulate transcription. Disruption 
of these finely tuned mechanisms can cause disease. Some regulatory element 
mutations will be associated with phenotypes distinct from any identified for 
coding-region mutations.

The epithelial Na/Pi cotransporter (NaPi-II) is instrumental in maintaining 
phosphate (Pi) homeostasis in vertebrates. Hormones and metabolic factors (PTH, 
Pi availability) that acutely influence renal Pi excretion have been 
demonstrated to target NaPi-II expression. Upon stimulation, newly synthesized 
transporter molecules become integrated into the brush-border membrane to 
increase the Vmax of Pi uptake; reduction of Pi reabsorption is achieved by 
endocytosis of NaPi-II followed by lysosomal degradation of the protein. The 
long-term regulation of the protein is less well studied. Only recently, 
regulatory elements for vitamin D3 and Pi have been identified in the promoter 
region of the npt gene. However, signaling pathways leading to the activation of 
these regulatory sequences need to be established. Other reports suggested 
messenger RNA stability to play a role in the medium range regulation of NaPi-II 
expression. Recent findings in our laboratory added to the complex picture of 
npt gene regulation. We have identified npt-related endogenous antisense 
transcripts from mouse, zebrafish, and winter flounder. The two fish transcripts 
have been cloned and characterized; the mouse homolog has only very recently 
been detected. The transcripts are devoid of an open reading frame and appear in 
different splice forms. The evolutionary conservation of bidirectional 
transcription of the npt gene implies a regulatory function for the antisense 
transcript. In order to test the functional consequences of bidirectional 
transcription, we coexpressed sense and the antisense transcripts from zebrafish 
in Xenopus oocytes. Pi transport activity was reduced as a result of the 
presence of antisense RNA. Re-extraction of the RNA from injected oocytes 
followed by Northern blot revealed that the coexpression had no significant 
effect on the stability of either transcript. We concluded that the antisense 
mRNA interfered with the translation of the transporter if coexpressed in the 
Xenopus system. However, the regulatory mechanism(s) involving the npt-related 
antisense transcript is expected to be much more complicated in vivo, (i.e., 
requiring supplementary factors like double-stranded RNA recognizing proteins or 
specific RNases). It is planned to test this hypothesis by a transgenic 
zebrafish approach and/or knockout mice.

A single regulatory gene integrates control of vitamin B12 synthesis and 
propanediol degradation.

The cob operon of Salmonella typhimurium encodes enzymes required for synthesis 
of adenosyl-cobalamin (vitamin B12). The pdu operon encodes enzymes needed for 
use of propanediol as a carbon source, including an adenosyl-cobalamin-dependent 
enzyme, propanediol dehydratase. These two operons both map near min 41 of the 
S. typhimurium linkage map and are transcribed divergently. Here we report that 
the cob and pdu operons form a single regulon. Transcription of this regulon is 
induced by either glycerol or propanediol. The metabolism of these compounds is 
not required for induction. Propanediol induces the regulon either aerobically 
or anaerobically during growth on poor carbon sources. Aerobically glycerol 
induces only if its metabolism is prevented by a mutational block such as a glpK 
mutation. Under anaerobic conditions, glycerol induces in both glpK+ and glpK 
mutant strains during growth on poor carbon sources. A new class of mutations, 
pocR, prevents induction of the cob/pdu regulon by either propanediol or 
glycerol and causes a Cob- Pdu- phenotype. The pocR gene is located between the 
cob and pdu operons and appears to encode a trans-acting protein that acts as a 
positive regulator of both operons. Transcription of the pocR regulatory gene is 
induced, even without the PocR protein, during aerobic growth on poor carbon 
sources and during anaerobic respiration. With the functional PocR protein, 
transcription of the pocR gene is autoinduced by propanediol but not by 
glycerol. The growth conditions that increase pocR gene expression correlate 
with growth conditions that allow high induction of the cob/pdu regulon. A model 
for control of this regulon suggests that the PocR protein is a transcriptional 
activator of both the cob and pdu operons and that both glycerol and propanediol 
can individually serve as effectors of the PocR protein. We suggest that global 
control mechanisms cause variation in the level of the PocR protein; an 
increased level of the PocR protein permits higher induction by propanediol or 
glycerol.

regulation in yeast.

Transcriptional modules of coregulated genes play a key role in regulatory 
networks. Comparative studies show that modules of coexpressed genes are 
conserved across taxa. However, little is known about the mechanisms underlying 
the evolution of module regulation. Here, we explore the evolution of 
cis-regulatory programs associated with conserved modules by integrating 
expression profiles for two yeast species and sequence data for a total of 17 
fungal genomes. We show that although the cis-elements accompanying certain 
conserved modules are strictly conserved, those of other conserved modules are 
remarkably diverged. In particular, we infer the evolutionary history of the 
regulatory program governing ribosomal modules. We show how a cis-element 
emerged concurrently in dozens of promoters of ribosomal protein genes, followed 
by the loss of a more ancient cis-element. We suggest that this formation of an 
intermediate redundant regulatory program allows conserved transcriptional 
modules to gradually switch from one regulatory mechanism to another while 
maintaining their functionality. Our work provides a general framework for the 
study of the dynamics of promoter evolution at the level of transcriptional 
modules and may help in understanding the evolvability and increased redundancy 
of transcriptional regulation in higher organisms.

Molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of gene expression during cell 
differentiation and development.

Harrison PR(1).

One general point to emerge from this review is that each step in the pathway 
for gene expression from DNA to final polypeptide via chromosome structure, 
primary transcript, mRNA processing, stability, and translation is exploited in 
some developmental context as a means of regulation. Moreover, there is little 
evidence that the regulation of different stages in this pathway is associated 
consistently with particular classes of genes or developmental processes: for 
example, homeotic and other regulatory genes, which are important in early 
development and in determining the overall structures of organisms, are 
regulated by both transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms, as are 
many other genes encoding cell-type-specific proteins expressed late during 
terminal differentiation. There are also instances in which transcription 
factors regulating tissue-specific transcription are present constitutively but 
are activated only in certain cell types by posttranslational events, and in 
yeast, coordinate regulation of amino-acid biosynthesis genes involves the 
translation control of a transcription factor. Second, as far as transcriptional 
control is concerned, it is now clear that in most instances cell-type 
specificity arises from the activities of multiple cis-control elements that can 
act either positively or negatively: The precise way in which the gene functions 
depends on what combination of cis-control elements it possesses. A third 
somewhat negative point is that in general the mechanisms responsible for the 
coordinate expression of genes during cell differentiation and development are 
not yet understood. In view of the complexities of possible mechanisms noted 
above, it may be that closely related genes (such as those encoding the alpha- 
and beta-globins, for example) in fact come to be coordinately expressed via a 
complex, indirect route. Indeed, it is quite possible that such mechanisms will 
not be revealed simply by a reductionist approach studying relatively short 
regions of DNA and that some form of overall "systems analysis" will be 
required. Finally, what we know relates mainly to expression of genes within 
particular cell types. How groups of cells are organized into complex structures 
remains a mystery at the molecular level, although progress into the genetic 
principles involved in the regulation of such "compartments" is being made, 
mainly in insects, reviewed recently by Brower, although to some extent also in 
the mouse [discussed by Hogan and co-workers].

Transcriptional cross-regulation of the catechol and protocatechuate branches of 
the beta-ketoadipate pathway contributes to carbon source-dependent expression 
of the Acinetobacter sp. strain ADP1 pobA gene.

USA.

Transcriptional control of carbon source preferences by Acinetobacter sp. strain 
ADP1 was assessed with a pobA::lacZ fusion during growth on alternative 
substrates. The pobA-encoded enzyme catalyzes the first step in the degradation 
of 4-hydroxybenzoate, a compound consumed rapidly as a sole carbon source. If 
additional aromatic carbon sources are available, 4-hydroxybenzoate consumption 
is inhibited by unknown mechanisms. As reported here, during growth on aromatic 
substrates, pobA was not expressed despite the presence of 4-hydroxybenzoate, an 
inducer that normally causes the PobR regulator to activate pobA transcription. 
Growth on organic acids such as succinate, fumarate, and acetate allowed higher 
levels of pobA expression. In each case, pobA expression increased at the end of 
the exponential growth phase. Complex transcriptional regulation controlled 
4-hydroxybenzoate catabolism in multisubstrate environments. Additional studies 
focused on the wild-type preference for benzoate consumption prior to 
4-hydroxybenzoate consumption. These compounds are degraded via the catechol and 
protocatechuate branches of the beta-ketoadipate pathway, respectively. Here, 
mutants were characterized that degraded benzoate and 4-hydroxybenzoate 
concurrently. These mutants lacked the BenM and CatM transcriptional regulators 
that normally activate genes for benzoate catabolism. A model is presented in 
which BenM and CatM prevent pobA expression indirectly during growth on 
benzoate. These regulators may affect pobA expression by lowering the 
PcaK-mediated uptake of 4-hydroxybenzoate. Consistent with this model, BenM and 
CatM bound in vitro to an operator-promoter fragment controlling the expression 
of several pca genes, including pcaK. These studies provide the first direct 
evidence of transcriptional cross-regulation between the distinct but analogous 
branches of the beta-ketoadipate pathway.

In plants, tolerance to drought stress is a result of numerous minor effect loci 
in which transcriptional regulation contributes significantly to the observed 
phenotypes. Under severe drought conditions, a major expression quantitative 
trait loci hotspot was identified on chromosome five in potato. A putative 
Nuclear factor y subunit C4 was identified as key candidate in the regulatory 
cascade in response to drought. Further investigation of the eQTL hotspots 
suggests a role for a putative Homeobox leucine zipper protein 12 in relation to 
drought in potato. Genes strongly co-expressed with Homeobox leucine zipper 
protein 12 were plant growth regulators responsive to water deficit stress in 
Arabidopsis thaliana, implying a possible conserved mechanism. Integrative 
analysis of genetic, genomic, phenotypic and transcriptomic data provided 
insights in the downstream functional components of the drought response. The 
abscisic acid- and environmental stress-inducible protein TAS14 was highly 
induced by severe drought in potato and acts as a reliable biomarker for the 
level of stress perceived by the plant. The systems genetics approach supported 
a role for multiple genes responsive to severe drought stress of Solanum 
tuberosum. The combination of gene regulatory networks, expression quantitative 
trait loci mapping and phenotypic analysis proved useful for candidate gene 
selection.

The role of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha-responsive regulatory elements in the 
synergistic induction of indoleamine dioxygenase.

Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), which enzymatically depletes tryptophan, is 
an important antimicrobial defense mechanism against susceptible pathogens. In 
human epithelial cells, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-induced IDO expression is 
transcriptionally enhanced by tumor necrosis factor-alpha(TNF-alpha). The 
purpose of this study was to identify those regulatory mechanisms responsible 
for this synergistic transcriptional activation of IDO. Nuclear concentrations 
of signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 (Stat1) and IFN regulatory 
factor-1 (IRF-1), transcription factors that bind gamma-activated sequences 
(GAS) and IFN-stimulated response elements (ISRE), respectively, were found to 
increase after stimulation with IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha relative to stimulation 
with individual cytokines. Additionally, CCAAT enhancer binding protein-beta 
(C/EBP-beta) bound to one of three consensus C/EBP-beta sites in the IDO 
regulatory region in response to TNF-alpha alone or combined with IFN-gamma. A 
transcriptional reporter containing green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the 
control of the IDO regulatory region was used to analyze the contribution of 
these enhancer elements to synergistic IDO gene expression in response to 
IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha. Transcriptional activity following mutation of 
individual enhancers or large deletions within the regulatory region indicates 
that increased binding of IFN-gamma-transactivated factors to GAS and ISRE sites 
alone is responsible for synergistic transcriptional activation of the IDO gene.

Multiple protein factors interact with the cis-regulatory elements of the 
proximal promoter in a cell-specific manner and regulate transcription of the 
dopamine beta-hydroxylase gene.

Memphis, 38163, USA.

The dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH) gene is expressed selectively in 
noradrenergic and adrenergic neurons and neuroendocrine cells in the nervous 
system. A cAMP response element (CRE) residing at -181 to -174 bp from the 
transcription start site of the human DBH gene seems to be essential for DBH 
transcription. Potential cis-regulatory motifs such as AP1 and YY1 occur 
proximal to and overlap this CRE, endowing the area with a composite promoter 
structure. Using the DBH-expressing human neuroblastoma SK-N-BE(2)C and 
DBH-negative HeLa cell lines as model systems, we report here that this 
CRE/YY1/AP1 area interacts with multiple nuclear proteins, including CRE-binding 
protein (CREB) and transcription factor YY1 in a cell-specific manner. In 
support of the notion that multiple proteins bind to the CRE/YY1/AP1 area, DNase 
I foot-printing analysis has demonstrated that nuclear extracts protect an 
extended region (from -186 to -150 bp) relative to that protected by the 
purified CREB (from -186 to -171 bp). Site-directed mutational analysis has 
revealed differential roles of potential cis-regulatory motifs in regulation of 
DBH transcription. Strikingly, the YY1 element positively regulated basal DBH 
transcription while simultaneously regulating cAMP-mediated induction 
negatively, which is a novel mechanism of promoter function. Furthermore, three 
additional DNA-binding sites have been identified by DNase I footprint analysis 
in the upstream 260 bp promotor region of the human DBH gene, of which two sites 
are cell-specific. These results support a model whereby multiple proteins bind 
to the 5'-proximal area in a cell-specific manner and coordinately regulate the 
cell type-specific transcriptional activation of the DBH gene.

Despite extensive mapping of cis-regulatory elements (cREs) across cellular 
contexts with chromatin accessibility assays, the sequence syntax and genetic 
variants that regulate transcription factor (TF) binding and chromatin 
accessibility at context-specific cREs remain elusive. We introduce ChromBPNet, 
a deep learning DNA sequence model of base-resolution accessibility profiles 
that detects, learns and deconvolves assay-specific enzyme biases from 
regulatory sequence determinants of accessibility, enabling robust discovery of 
compact TF motif lexicons, cooperative motif syntax and precision footprints 
across assays and sequencing depths. Extensive benchmarks show that ChromBPNet, 
despite its lightweight design, is competitive with much larger contemporary 
models at predicting variant effects on chromatin accessibility, pioneer TF 
binding and reporter activity across assays, cell contexts and ancestry, while 
providing interpretation of disrupted regulatory syntax. ChromBPNet also helps 
prioritize and interpret regulatory variants that influence complex traits and 
rare diseases, thereby providing a powerful lens to decode regulatory DNA and 
genetic variation.

We present the genome-wide chromatin accessibility profiles of 410 tumor samples 
spanning 23 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We identify 
562,709 transposase-accessible DNA elements that substantially extend the 
compendium of known cis-regulatory elements. Integration of ATAC-seq (the assay 
for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing) with TCGA multi-omic data 
identifies a large number of putative distal enhancers that distinguish 
molecular subtypes of cancers, uncovers specific driving transcription factors 
via protein-DNA footprints, and nominates long-range gene-regulatory 
interactions in cancer. These data reveal genetic risk loci of cancer 
predisposition as active DNA regulatory elements in cancer, identify 
gene-regulatory interactions underlying cancer immune evasion, and pinpoint 
noncoding mutations that drive enhancer activation and may affect patient 
survival. These results suggest a systematic approach to understanding the 
noncoding genome in cancer to advance diagnosis and therapy.

Genetic perturbations of cortical development can lead to neurodevelopmental 
disease, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). To identify genomic regions 
crucial to corticogenesis, we mapped the activity of gene-regulatory elements 
generating a single-cell atlas of gene expression and chromatin accessibility 
both independently and jointly. This revealed waves of gene regulation by key 
transcription factors (TFs) across a nearly continuous differentiation 
trajectory, distinguished the expression programs of glial lineages, and 
identified lineage-determining TFs that exhibited strong correlation between 
linked gene-regulatory elements and expression levels. These highly connected 
genes adopted an active chromatin state in early differentiating cells, 
consistent with lineage commitment. Base-pair-resolution neural network models 
identified strong cell-type-specific enrichment of noncoding mutations predicted 
to be disruptive in a cohort of ASD individuals and identified frequently 
disrupted TF binding sites. This approach illustrates how cell-type-specific 
mapping can provide insights into the programs governing human development and 
disease.

Current catalogs of regulatory sequences in the human genome are still 
incomplete and lack cell type resolution. To profile the activity of gene 
regulatory elements in diverse cell types and tissues in the human body, we 
applied single-cell chromatin accessibility assays to 30 adult human tissue 
types from multiple donors. We integrated these datasets with previous 
single-cell chromatin accessibility data from 15 fetal tissue types to reveal 
the status of open chromatin for ∼1.2 million candidate cis-regulatory elements 
(cCREs) in 222 distinct cell types comprised of >1.3 million nuclei. We used 
these chromatin accessibility maps to delineate cell-type-specificity of fetal 
and adult human cCREs and to systematically interpret the noncoding variants 
associated with complex human traits and diseases. This rich resource provides a 
foundation for the analysis of gene regulatory programs in human cell types 
across tissues, life stages, and organ systems.

Massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) test the capacity of putative gene 
regulatory elements to drive transcription on a genome-wide scale. Most gene 
regulatory activity occurs within accessible chromatin, and recently described 
methods have combined assays that capture these regions-such as assay for 
transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq)-with 
self-transcribing active regulatory region sequencing (STARR-seq) to selectively 
assay the regulatory potential of accessible DNA (ATAC-STARR-seq). Here, we 
report an integrated approach that quantifies activating and silencing 
regulatory activity, chromatin accessibility, and transcription factor (TF) 
occupancy with one assay using ATAC-STARR-seq. Our strategy, including important 
updates to the ATAC-STARR-seq assay and workflow, enabled high-resolution 
testing of ∼50 million unique DNA fragments tiling ∼101,000 accessible chromatin 
regions in human lymphoblastoid cells. We discovered that 30% of all accessible 
regions contain an activator, a silencer, or both. Although few MPRA studies 
have explored silencing activity, we demonstrate that silencers occur at similar 
frequencies to activators, and they represent a distinct functional group 
enriched for unique TF motifs and repressive histone modifications. We further 
show that Tn5 cut-site frequencies are retained in the ATAC-STARR plasmid 
library compared to standard ATAC-seq, enabling TF occupancy to be ascertained 
from ATAC-STARR data. With this approach, we found that activators and silencers 
cluster by distinct TF footprint combinations, and these groups of activity 
represent different gene regulatory networks of immune cell function. 
Altogether, these data highlight the multilayered capabilities of ATAC-STARR-seq 
to comprehensively investigate the regulatory landscape of the human genome all 
from a single DNA fragment source.

Cell differentiation and function are regulated across multiple layers of gene 
regulation, including modulation of gene expression by changes in chromatin 
accessibility. However, differentiation is an asynchronous process precluding a 
temporal understanding of regulatory events leading to cell fate commitment. 
Here we developed simultaneous high-throughput ATAC and RNA expression with 
sequencing (SHARE-seq), a highly scalable approach for measurement of chromatin 
accessibility and gene expression in the same single cell, applicable to 
different tissues. Using 34,774 joint profiles from mouse skin, we develop a 
computational strategy to identify cis-regulatory interactions and define 
domains of regulatory chromatin (DORCs) that significantly overlap with 
super-enhancers. During lineage commitment, chromatin accessibility at DORCs 
precedes gene expression, suggesting that changes in chromatin accessibility may 
prime cells for lineage commitment. We computationally infer chromatin potential 
as a quantitative measure of chromatin lineage-priming and use it to predict 
cell fate outcomes. SHARE-seq is an extensible platform to study regulatory 
circuitry across diverse cells in tissues.

Cell-to-cell variation is a universal feature of life that affects a wide range 
of biological phenomena, from developmental plasticity to tumour heterogeneity. 
Although recent advances have improved our ability to document cellular 
phenotypic variation, the fundamental mechanisms that generate variability from 
identical DNA sequences remain elusive. Here we reveal the landscape and 
principles of mammalian DNA regulatory variation by developing a robust method 
for mapping the accessible genome of individual cells by assay for 
transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) integrated into a 
programmable microfluidics platform. Single-cell ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq) maps from 
hundreds of single cells in aggregate closely resemble accessibility profiles 
from tens of millions of cells and provide insights into cell-to-cell variation. 
Accessibility variance is systematically associated with specific trans-factors 
and cis-elements, and we discover combinations of trans-factors associated with 
either induction or suppression of cell-to-cell variability. We further identify 
sets of trans-factors associated with cell-type-specific accessibility variance 
across eight cell types. Targeted perturbations of cell cycle or transcription 
factor signalling evoke stimulus-specific changes in this observed variability. 
The pattern of accessibility variation in cis across the genome recapitulates 
chromosome compartments de novo, linking single-cell accessibility variation to 
three-dimensional genome organization. Single-cell analysis of DNA accessibility 
provides new insight into cellular variation of the 'regulome'.

The peripheral immune system in Alzheimer's disease (AD) has not been thoroughly 
studied with modern sequencing methods. To investigate epigenetic and 
transcriptional alterations to the AD peripheral immune system, we used 
single-cell sequencing strategies, including assay for transposase-accessible 
chromatin and RNA sequencing. We reveal a striking amount of open chromatin in 
peripheral immune cells in AD. In CD8 T cells, we uncover a cis-regulatory DNA 
element co-accessible with the CXC motif chemokine receptor 3 gene promoter. In 
monocytes, we identify a novel AD-specific RELA transcription factor binding 
site adjacent to an open chromatin region in the nuclear factor kappa B subunit 
2 gene. We also demonstrate apolipoprotein E genotype-dependent epigenetic 
changes in monocytes. Surprisingly, we also identify differentially accessible 
chromatin regions in genes associated with sporadic AD risk. Our findings 
provide novel insights into the complex relationship between epigenetics and 
genetic risk factors in AD peripheral immunity.

Cis-regulatory elements regulate gene expression and lineage specification. 
However, the potential regulation of cis-elements on mammalian embryogenesis 
remains largely unexplored. To address this question, we perform single-cell 
assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) and 
RNA-seq in embryonic day 7.5 (E7.5) and E13.5 mouse embryos. We construct the 
chromatin accessibility landscapes with cell spatial information in E7.5 
embryos, showing the spatial patterns of cis-elements and the spatial 
distribution of potentially functional transcription factors (TFs). We further 
show that many germ-layer-specific cis-elements and TFs in E7.5 embryos are 
maintained in the cell types derived from the corresponding germ layers at later 
stages, suggesting that these cis-elements and TFs are important during cell 
differentiation. We also find a potential progenitor for Sertoli and granulosa 
cells in gonads. Interestingly, both Sertoli and granulosa cells exist in male 
gonads and female gonads during gonad development. Collectively, we provide a 
valuable resource to understand organogenesis in mammals.

Successful pregnancy relies directly on the placenta's complex, dynamic, 
gene-regulatory networks. Disruption of this vast collection of intercellular 
and intracellular programs leads to pregnancy complications and developmental 
defects. In the present study, we generated a comprehensive, spatially resolved, 
multimodal cell census elucidating the molecular architecture of the first 
trimester human placenta. We utilized paired single-nucleus (sn)ATAC (assay for 
transposase accessible chromatin) sequencing and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), 
spatial snATAC-seq and RNA-seq, and in situ sequencing and hybridization mapping 
of transcriptomes at molecular resolution to spatially reconstruct the joint 
epigenomic and transcriptomic regulatory landscape. Paired analyses unraveled 
intricate tumor-like gene expression and transcription factor motif programs 
potentially sustaining the placenta in a hostile uterine environment; further 
investigation of gene-linked cis-regulatory elements revealed heightened 
regulatory complexity that may govern trophoblast differentiation and placental 
disease risk. Complementary spatial mapping techniques decoded these programs 
within the placental villous core and extravillous trophoblast cell column 
architecture while simultaneously revealing niche-establishing transcriptional 
elements and cell-cell communication. Finally, we computationally imputed 
genome-wide, multiomic single-cell profiles and spatially characterized the 
placental chromatin accessibility landscape. This spatially resolved, 
single-cell multiomic framework of the first trimester human placenta serves as 
a blueprint for future studies on early placental development and pregnancy.

Linking regulatory DNA elements to their target genes, which may be located 
hundreds of kilobases away, remains challenging. Here, we introduce Cicero, an 
algorithm that identifies co-accessible pairs of DNA elements using single-cell 
chromatin accessibility data and so connects regulatory elements to their 
putative target genes. We apply Cicero to investigate how dynamically accessible 
elements orchestrate gene regulation in differentiating myoblasts. Groups of 
Cicero-linked regulatory elements meet criteria of "chromatin hubs"-they are 
enriched for physical proximity, interact with a common set of transcription 
factors, and undergo coordinated changes in histone marks that are predictive of 
changes in gene expression. Pseudotemporal analysis revealed that most DNA 
elements remain in chromatin hubs throughout differentiation. A subset of 
elements bound by MYOD1 in myoblasts exhibit early opening in a PBX1- and 
MEIS1-dependent manner. Our strategy can be applied to dissect the architecture, 
sequence determinants, and mechanisms of cis-regulation on a genome-wide scale.

Cellular senescence is a complex multifactorial biological phenomenon that plays 
essential roles in aging, and aging-related diseases. During this process, the 
senescent cells undergo gene expression altering and chromatin structure 
remodeling. However, studies on the epigenetic landscape of senescence using 
integrated multi-omics approaches are limited. In this research, we performed 
ATAC-seq, RNA-seq and ChIP-seq on different senescent types to reveal the 
landscape of senescence and identify the prime regulatory elements. We also 
obtained 34 key genes and deduced that NAT1, PBX1 and RRM2, which interacted 
with each other, could be the potential markers of aging and aging-related 
diseases. In summary, our work provides the landscape to study accessibility 
dynamics and transcriptional regulations in cellular senescence. The application 
of this technique in different types of senescence allows us to identify the 
regulatory elements responsible for the substantial regulation of transcription, 
providing the insights into molecular mechanisms of senescence.

Nucleosome-free open chromatin often harbors transcription factor (TF)-binding 
sites that are associated with active cis-regulatory elements. However, analysis 
of open chromatin regions has rarely been applied to oomycete or fungal plant 
pathogens. In this study, we performed the assay for transposase-accessible 
chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) to identify open chromatin 
and cis-regulatory elements in Phytophthora sojae at the mycelial stage. We 
identified 10,389 peaks representing nucleosome-free regions (NFRs). The peaks 
were enriched in gene-promoter regions and associated with 40% of P. sojae 
genes; transcription levels were higher for genes with multiple peaks than genes 
with a single peak and were higher for genes with a single peak than genes 
without peak. Chromatin accessibility was positively correlated with gene 
transcription level. Through motif discovery based on NFR peaks in core promoter 
regions, 25 candidate cis-regulatory motifs with evidence of TF-binding 
footprints were identified. These motifs exhibited various preferences for 
location in the promoter region and associations with the transcription level of 
their target genes, which included some putative pathogenicity-related genes. As 
the first study revealing the landscape of open chromatin and the correlation 
between chromatin accessibility and gene transcription level in oomycetes, the 
results provide a technical reference and data resources for future studies on 
the regulatory mechanisms of gene transcription.[Formula: see text] Copyright ©

ATAC-seq (Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing) has 
gained wide popularity as a fast, straightforward, and efficient way of 
generating genome-wide maps of open chromatin and guiding identification of 
active regulatory elements and inference of DNA protein binding locations. Given 
the ubiquity of this method, uniform and standardized methods for processing and 
assessing the quality of ATAC-seq datasets are needed. Here, we describe the 
data processing pipeline used by the ENCODE (Encyclopedia of DNA Elements) 
consortium to process ATAC-seq data into peak call sets and signal tracks and to 
assess the quality of these datasets.

Understanding complex tissues requires single-cell deconstruction of gene 
regulation with precision and scale. Here, we assess the performance of a 
massively parallel droplet-based method for mapping transposase-accessible 
chromatin in single cells using sequencing (scATAC-seq). We apply scATAC-seq to 
obtain chromatin profiles of more than 200,000 single cells in human blood and 
basal cell carcinoma. In blood, application of scATAC-seq enables marker-free 
identification of cell type-specific cis- and trans-regulatory elements, mapping 
of disease-associated enhancer activity and reconstruction of trajectories of 
cellular differentiation. In basal cell carcinoma, application of scATAC-seq 
reveals regulatory networks in malignant, stromal and immune cells in the tumor 
microenvironment. Analysis of scATAC-seq profiles from serial tumor biopsies 
before and after programmed cell death protein 1 blockade identifies chromatin 
regulators of therapy-responsive T cell subsets and reveals a shared regulatory 
program that governs intratumoral CD8+ T cell exhaustion and CD4+ T follicular 
helper cell development. We anticipate that scATAC-seq will enable the unbiased 
discovery of gene regulatory factors across diverse biological systems.

A complete chart of cis-regulatory elements and their dynamic activity is 
necessary to understand the transcriptional basis of differentiation and 
function of an organ system. We generated matched epigenome and transcriptome 
measurements in 86 primary cell types that span the mouse immune system and its 
differentiation cascades. This breadth of data enable variance components 
analysis that suggests that genes fall into two distinct classes, controlled by 
either enhancer- or promoter-driven logic, and multiple regression that connects 
genes to the enhancers that regulate them. Relating transcription factor (TF) 
expression to the genome-wide accessibility of their binding motifs classifies 
them as predominantly openers or closers of local chromatin accessibility, 
pinpointing specific cis-regulatory elements where binding of given TFs is 
likely functionally relevant, validated by chromatin immunoprecipitation 
sequencing (ChIP-seq). Overall, this cis-regulatory atlas provides a trove of 
information on transcriptional regulation through immune differentiation and a 
foundational scaffold to define key regulatory events throughout the 
immunological genome.

To define the multi-cellular epigenomic and transcriptional landscape of cardiac 
cellular development, we generated single-cell chromatin accessibility maps of 
human fetal heart tissues. We identified eight major differentiation 
trajectories involving primary cardiac cell types, each associated with dynamic 
transcription factor (TF) activity signatures. We contrasted regulatory 
landscapes of iPSC-derived cardiac cell types and their in vivo counterparts, 
which enabled optimization of in vitro differentiation of epicardial cells. 
Further, we interpreted sequence based deep learning models of 
cell-type-resolved chromatin accessibility profiles to decipher underlying TF 
motif lexicons. De novo mutations predicted to affect chromatin accessibility in 
arterial endothelium were enriched in congenital heart disease (CHD) cases vs. 
controls. In vitro studies in iPSCs validated the functional impact of 
identified variation on the predicted developmental cell types. This work thus 
defines the cell-type-resolved cis-regulatory sequence determinants of heart 
development and identifies disruption of cell type-specific regulatory elements 
in CHD.

We applied a combinatorial indexing assay, sci-ATAC-seq, to profile genome-wide 
chromatin accessibility in ∼100,000 single cells from 13 adult mouse tissues. We 
identify 85 distinct patterns of chromatin accessibility, most of which can be 
assigned to cell types, and ∼400,000 differentially accessible elements. We use 
these data to link regulatory elements to their target genes, to define the 
transcription factor grammar specifying each cell type, and to discover in vivo 
correlates of heterogeneity in accessibility within cell types. We develop a 
technique for mapping single cell gene expression data to single-cell chromatin 
accessibility data, facilitating the comparison of atlases. By intersecting 
mouse chromatin accessibility with human genome-wide association summary 
statistics, we identify cell-type-specific enrichments of the heritability 
signal for hundreds of complex traits. These data define the in vivo landscape 
of the regulatory genome for common mammalian cell types at single-cell 
resolution.

In mammals, extensive chromatin reorganization is essential for reprogramming 
terminally committed gametes to a totipotent state during preimplantation 
development. However, the global chromatin landscape and its dynamics in this 
period remain unexplored. Here we report a genome-wide map of accessible 
chromatin in mouse preimplantation embryos using an improved assay for 
transposase-accessible chromatin with high throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) 
approach with CRISPR/Cas9-assisted mitochondrial DNA depletion. We show that 
despite extensive parental asymmetry in DNA methylomes, the chromatin 
accessibility between the parental genomes is globally comparable after major 
zygotic genome activation (ZGA). Accessible chromatin in early embryos is widely 
shaped by transposable elements and overlaps extensively with putative 
cis-regulatory sequences. Unexpectedly, accessible chromatin is also found near 
the transcription end sites of active genes. By integrating the maps of 
cis-regulatory elements and single-cell transcriptomes, we construct the 
regulatory network of early development, which helps to identify the key 
modulators for lineage specification. Finally, we find that the activities of 
cis-regulatory elements and their associated open chromatin diminished before 
major ZGA. Surprisingly, we observed many loci showing non-canonical, large open 
chromatin domains over the entire transcribed units in minor ZGA, supporting the 
presence of an unusually permissive chromatin state. Together, these data reveal 
a unique spatiotemporal chromatin configuration that accompanies early mammalian 
development.

Here, we present Perturb-ATAC, a method that combines multiplexed CRISPR 
interference or knockout with genome-wide chromatin accessibility profiling in 
single cells based on the simultaneous detection of CRISPR guide RNAs and open 
chromatin sites by assay of transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing 
(ATAC-seq). We applied Perturb-ATAC to transcription factors (TFs), 
chromatin-modifying factors, and noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) in ∼4,300 single cells, 
encompassing more than 63 genotype-phenotype relationships. Perturb-ATAC in 
human B lymphocytes uncovered regulators of chromatin accessibility, TF 
occupancy, and nucleosome positioning and identified a hierarchy of TFs that 
govern B cell state, variation, and disease-associated cis-regulatory elements. 
Perturb-ATAC in primary human epidermal cells revealed three sequential modules 
of cis-elements that specify keratinocyte fate. Combinatorial deletion of all 
pairs of these TFs uncovered their epistatic relationships and highlighted 
genomic co-localization as a basis for synergistic interactions. Thus, 
Perturb-ATAC is a powerful strategy to dissect gene regulatory networks in 
development and disease.

Cells require coordinated control over gene expression when responding to 
environmental stimuli. Here we apply scATAC-seq and single-cell RNA sequencing 
(scRNA-seq) in resting and stimulated human blood cells. Collectively, we 
generate ~91,000 single-cell profiles, allowing us to probe the cis-regulatory 
landscape of the immunological response across cell types, stimuli, and time. 
Advancing tools to integrate multi-omics data, we develop functional inference 
of gene regulation (FigR), a framework to computationally pair scA-TAC-seq with 
scRNA-seq cells, connect distal cis-regulatory elements to genes, and infer 
gene-regulatory networks (GRNs) to identify candidate transcription factor (TF) 
regulators. Utilizing these paired multi-omics data, we define domains of 
regulatory chromatin (DORCs) of immune stimulation and find that cells alter 
chromatin accessibility and gene expression at timescales of minutes. 
Construction of the stimulation GRN elucidates TF activity at disease-associated 
DORCs. Overall, FigR enables elucidation of regulatory interactions across 
single-cell data, providing new opportunities to understand the function of 
cells within tissues.

Mapping accessible chromatin across time scales can give insights into its 
dynamic nature, for example during cellular differentiation and tissue or 
organism development. Analysis of such data can be utilised to identify 
functional cis-regulatory elements (CRE) and transcription factor binding sites 
and, when combined with transcriptomics, can reveal gene regulatory networks 
(GRNs) of expressed genes. Chromatin accessibility mapping is a powerful 
approach and can be performed using ATAC-sequencing (ATAC-seq), whereby Tn5 
transposase inserts sequencing adaptors into genomic DNA to identify 
differentially accessible regions of chromatin in different cell populations. It 
requires low sample input and can be performed and analysed relatively quickly 
compared with other methods. The data generated from ATAC-seq, along with other 
genomic approaches, can help uncover chromatin packaging and potential 
cis-regulatory elements that may be responsible for gene expression. Here, we 
describe the ATAC-seq approach and give examples from mainly vertebrate 
embryonic development, where such datasets have identified the highly dynamic 
nature of chromatin, with differing landscapes between cellular precursors for 
different lineages.

Programs of gene transcription are controlled by cis-acting DNA elements, 
including enhancers, silencers, and promoters. Local accessibility of chromatin 
has proven to be a highly informative structural feature for identifying such 
regulatory elements, which tend to be relatively open due to their interactions 
with proteins. Recently, ATAC-seq (assay for transposase-accessible chromatin 
using sequencing) has emerged as one of the most powerful approaches for 
genome-wide chromatin accessibility profiling. This method assesses DNA 
accessibility using hyperactive Tn5 transposase, which simultaneously cuts DNA 
and inserts sequencing adaptors, preferentially in regions of open chromatin. 
ATAC-seq is a relatively simple procedure which can be applied to only a few 
thousand cells. It is well-suited to developing embryos of sea urchins and other 
echinoderms, which are a prominent experimental model for understanding the 
genomic control of animal development. In this chapter, we present a protocol 
for applying ATAC-seq to embryonic cells of sea urchins.

Upon fertilization, drastic chromatin reorganization occurs during 
preimplantation development 1 . However, the global chromatin landscape and its 
molecular dynamics in this period remain largely unexplored in humans. Here we 
investigate chromatin states in human preimplantation development using an 
improved assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput 
sequencing (ATAC-seq) 2 . We find widespread accessible chromatin regions in 
early human embryos that overlap extensively with putative cis-regulatory 
sequences and transposable elements. Integrative analyses show both conservation 
and divergence in regulatory circuitry between human and mouse early 
development, and between human pluripotency in vivo and human embryonic stem 
cells. In addition, we find widespread open chromatin regions before zygotic 
genome activation (ZGA). The accessible chromatin loci are readily found at 
CpG-rich promoters. Unexpectedly, many others reside in distal regions that 
overlap with DNA hypomethylated domains in human oocytes and are enriched for 
transcription factor-binding sites. A large portion of these regions then become 
inaccessible after ZGA in a transcription-dependent manner. Notably, such 
extensive chromatin reorganization during ZGA is conserved in mice and 
correlates with the reprogramming of the non-canonical histone mark H3K4me3, 
which is uniquely linked to genome silencing3-5. Taken together, these data not 
only reveal a conserved principle that underlies the chromatin transition during 
mammalian ZGA, but also help to advance our understanding of epigenetic 
reprogramming during human early development and in vitro fertilization.

Transcriptional control is a highly dynamic process that changes rapidly in 
response to various cellular and extracellular cues, making it difficult to 
define the mechanism of transcription factor function using slow genetic 
methods. We used a chemical-genetic approach to rapidly degrade a canonical 
transcriptional activator, PAX3-FOXO1, to define the mechanism by which it 
regulates gene expression programs. By coupling rapid protein degradation with 
the analysis of nascent transcription over short time courses and integrating 
CUT&RUN, ATAC-seq, and eRNA analysis with deep proteomic analysis, we defined 
PAX3-FOXO1 function at a small network of direct transcriptional targets. 
PAX3-FOXO1 degradation impaired RNA polymerase pause release and transcription 
elongation at most regulated gene targets. Moreover, the activity of PAX3-FOXO1 
at enhancers controlling this core network was surprisingly selective, affecting 
single elements in super-enhancers. This combinatorial analysis indicated that 
PAX3-FOXO1 was continuously required to maintain chromatin accessibility and 
enhancer architecture at regulated enhancers.

BACKGROUND: Spatiotemporal changes in the chromatin accessibility landscape are 
essential to cell differentiation, development, health, and disease. The quest 
of identifying regulatory elements in open chromatin regions across different 
tissues and developmental stages is led by large international collaborative 
efforts mostly focusing on model organisms, such as ENCODE. Recently, the 
Functional Annotation of Animal Genomes (FAANG) has been established to unravel 
the regulatory elements in non-model organisms, including cattle. Now, we can 
transition from prediction to validation by experimentally identifying the 
regulatory elements in tropical indicine cattle. The identification of 
regulatory elements, their annotation and comparison with the taurine 
counterpart, holds high promise to link regulatory regions to adaptability 
traits and improve animal productivity and welfare.
RESULTS: We generate open chromatin profiles for liver, muscle, and hypothalamus 
of indicine cattle through ATAC-seq. Using robust methods for motif discovery, 
motif enrichment and transcription factor binding sites, we identify potential 
master regulators of the epigenomic profile in these three tissues, namely HNF4, 
MEF2, and SOX factors, respectively. Integration with transcriptomic data allows 
us to confirm some of their target genes. Finally, by comparing our results with 
Bos taurus data we identify potential indicine-specific open chromatin regions 
and overlaps with indicine selective sweeps.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide insights into the identification and analysis 
of regulatory elements in non-model organisms, the evolution of regulatory 
elements within two cattle subspecies as well as having an immediate impact on 
the animal genetics community in particular for a relevant productive species 
such as tropical cattle.

BACKGROUND: Transcriptional reconfiguration is central to heart failure, the 
most common cause of which is dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). The effect of 
3-dimensional chromatin topology on transcriptional dysregulation and 
pathogenesis in human DCM remains elusive.
METHODS: We generated a compendium of 3-dimensional epigenome and transcriptome 
maps from 101 biobanked human DCM and nonfailing heart tissues through highly 
integrative chromatin immunoprecipitation (H3K27ac [acetylation of lysine 27 on 
histone H3]), in situ high-throughput chromosome conformation capture, chromatin 
immunoprecipitation sequencing, assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using 
sequencing, and RNA sequencing. We used human induced pluripotent stem 
cell-derived cardiomyocytes and mouse models to interrogate the key 
transcription factor implicated in 3-dimensional chromatin organization and 
transcriptional regulation in DCM pathogenesis.
RESULTS: We discovered that the active regulatory elements (H3K27ac peaks) and 
their connectome (H3K27ac loops) were extensively reprogrammed in DCM hearts and 
contributed to transcriptional dysregulation implicated in DCM development. For 
example, we identified that nontranscribing NPPA-AS1 (natriuretic peptide A 
antisense RNA 1) promoter functions as an enhancer and physically interacts with 
the NPPA (natriuretic peptide A) and NPPB (natriuretic peptide B) promoters, 
leading to the cotranscription of NPPA and NPPB in DCM hearts. We revealed that 
DCM-enriched H3K27ac loops largely resided in conserved high-order chromatin 
architectures (compartments, topologically associating domains) and their 
anchors unexpectedly had equivalent chromatin accessibility. We discovered that 
the DCM-enriched H3K27ac loop anchors exhibited a strong enrichment for HAND1 
(heart and neural crest derivatives expressed 1), a key transcription factor 
involved in early cardiogenesis. In line with this, its protein expression was 
upregulated in human DCM and mouse failing hearts. To further validate whether 
HAND1 is a causal driver for the reprogramming of enhancer-promoter connectome 
in DCM hearts, we performed comprehensive 3-dimensional epigenome mappings in 
human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes. We found that forced 
overexpression of HAND1 in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived 
cardiomyocytes induced a distinct gain of enhancer-promoter connectivity and 
correspondingly increased the expression of their connected genes implicated in 
DCM pathogenesis, thus recapitulating the transcriptional signature in human DCM 
hearts. Electrophysiology analysis demonstrated that forced overexpression of 
HAND1 in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes induced 
abnormal calcium handling. Furthermore, cardiomyocyte-specific overexpression of 
Hand1 in the mouse hearts resulted in dilated cardiac remodeling with impaired 
contractility/Ca2+ handling in cardiomyocytes, increased ratio of heart 
weight/body weight, and compromised cardiac function, which were ascribed to 
recapitulation of transcriptional reprogramming in DCM.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provided novel chromatin topology insights into DCM 
pathogenesis and illustrated a model whereby a single transcription factor 
(HAND1) reprograms the genome-wide enhancer-promoter connectome to drive DCM 
pathogenesis.

Cis-regulatory elements (CREs) and transcription factors (TFs) associated with 
them determine temporal and spatial domains of gene expression. Therefore, 
identification of these CREs and TFs is crucial to elucidating transcriptional 
programs across taxa. With chromatin accessibility facilitating transcription 
factor access to DNA, the identification of regions of open chromatin sheds 
light both on the function of the regulatory elements and their evolution, thus 
allowing the recognition of potential CREs. Buenrostro and colleagues have 
developed a novel method for exploring chromatin accessibility: assay for 
transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq), 
which can be used for the purpose of identifying putative CREs. This method was 
shown to have considerable advantages when compared to traditional methods such 
as sequence conservation analyses or functional assays. Here we present the 
adaptation of the ATAC-seq method to echinoderm species and discuss how it can 
be used for CRE discovery.

Despite recent advances in single-cell genomics, the lack of maps for 
single-cell candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) in non-mammal species has 
limited our exploration of conserved regulatory programs across vertebrates and 
invertebrates. Here, we developed a combinatorial-hybridization-based method for 
single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing 
(scATAC-seq) named CH-ATAC-seq, enabling the construction of single-cell 
accessible chromatin landscapes for zebrafish, Drosophila, and earthworms 
(Eisenia andrei). By integrating scATAC censuses of humans, monkeys, and mice, 
we systematically identified 152 distinct main cell types and around 0.8 million 
cell-type-specific cCREs. Our analysis provided insights into the conservation 
of neural, muscle, and immune lineages across species, while epithelial cells 
exhibited a higher organ-origin heterogeneity. Additionally, a large-scale gene 
regulatory network (GRN) was constructed in four vertebrates by integrating 
scRNA-seq censuses. Overall, our study provides a valuable resource for 
comparative epigenomics, identifying the evolutionary conservation and 
divergence of gene regulation across different species.

Active cis-regulatory elements (cREs) in eukaryotes are characterized by 
nucleosomal depletion and, accordingly, higher accessibility. This property has 
turned out to be immensely useful for identifying cREs genome-wide and tracking 
their dynamics across different cellular states and is the basis of numerous 
methods taking advantage of the preferential enzymatic cleavage/labeling of 
accessible DNA. ATAC-seq (Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using 
sequencing) has emerged as the most versatile and widely adaptable method and 
has been widely adopted as the standard tool for mapping open chromatin regions. 
Here, we discuss the current optimal practices and important considerations for 
carrying out ATAC-seq experiments, primarily in the context of mammalian 
systems.

Renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs) can initiate an adaptive response to 
completely recover from mild acute kidney injury (AKI), whereas severe injury 
often leads to persistence of maladaptive repair and progression to kidney 
fibrosis. Through profiling of active DNA regulatory elements by ATAC-seq, we 
reveal widespread, dynamic changes in the chromatin accessibility of TECs after 
ischemia-reperfusion injury. We show that injury-specific domains of regulatory 
chromatin become accessible prior to gene activation, creating poised chromatin 
states to activate the consequent gene expression program and injury response. 
We further identify RXRα as a key transcription factor in promoting adaptive 
repair. Activation of RXRα by bexarotene, an FDA-approved RXRα agonist, restores 
the chromatin state and gene expression program to protect TECs against severe 
kidney injury. Together, our findings elucidate a chromatin-mediated mechanism 
underlying differential responses of TECs to varying injuries and identify RXRα 
as a therapeutic target of acute kidney injury.

Natural evolution has resulted in reduced cold tolerance in cultivated tomato 
(Solanum lycopersicum). Herein, we perform a combined analysis of ATAC-Seq and 
RNA-Seq in cold-sensitive cultivated tomato and cold-tolerant wild tomato (S. 
habrochaites). We identify that WRKY34 has the most significant association with 
differential chromatin accessibility and expression patterns under cold stress. 
We find that a 60 bp InDel in the WRKY34 promoter causes differences in its 
transcription and cold tolerance among 376 tomato accessions. This 60 bp 
fragment contains a GATA cis-regulatory element that binds to SWIBs and GATA29, 
which synergistically suppress WRKY34 expression under cold stress. Moreover, 
WRKY34 interferes with the CBF cold response pathway through regulating 
transcription and protein levels. Our findings emphasize the importance of 
polymorphisms in cis-regulatory regions and their effects on chromatin structure 
and gene expression during crop evolution.

Cis-regulatory elements (CREs) control gene expression and are dynamic in their 
structure and function, reflecting changes in the composition of diverse 
effector proteins over time1. However, methods for measuring the organization of 
effector proteins at CREs across the genome are limited, hampering efforts to 
connect CRE structure to their function in cell fate and disease. Here we 
developed PRINT, a computational method that identifies footprints of 
DNA-protein interactions from bulk and single-cell chromatin accessibility data 
across multiple scales of protein size. Using these multiscale footprints, we 
created the seq2PRINT framework, which uses deep learning to allow precise 
inference of transcription factor and nucleosome binding and interprets 
regulatory logic at CREs. Applying seq2PRINT to single-cell chromatin 
accessibility data from human bone marrow, we observe sequential establishment 
and widening of CREs centred on pioneer factors across haematopoiesis. We 
further discover age-associated alterations in the structure of CREs in murine 
haematopoietic stem cells, including widespread reduction of nucleosome 
footprints and gain of de novo identified Ets composite motifs. Collectively, we 
establish a method for obtaining rich insights into DNA-binding protein dynamics 
from chromatin accessibility data, and reveal the architecture of regulatory 
elements across differentiation and ageing.

Regulatory elements, such as promoters and enhancers, typically show reduced 
nucleosome occupancy, which is a feature that is commonly referred to as "open 
chromatin". The distribution of open chromatin sites can provide important clues 
about the transcription factors and regulatory networks that drive gene 
expression in a given cell. Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using 
sequencing (ATAC-seq) is a rapid and robust method for mapping open chromatin 
sites. ATAC-seq data can also discern the binding sites of nucleosomes and 
transcription factors. In this chapter, we describe how to produce and assess 
the quality of ATAC-seq libraries that are generated from naïve human 
pluripotent stem cells.

The Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) is a 
fundamental epigenomics approach and has been widely used in profiling the 
chromatin accessibility dynamics in multiple species. A comprehensive reference 
of ATAC-seq datasets for mammalian tissues is important for the understanding of 
regulatory specificity and developmental abnormality caused by genetic or 
environmental alterations. Here, we report an adult mouse ATAC-seq atlas by 
producing a total of 66 ATAC-seq profiles from 20 primary tissues of both male 
and female mice. The ATAC-seq read enrichment, fragment size distribution, and 
reproducibility between replicates demonstrated the high quality of the full 
dataset. We identified a total of 296,574 accessible elements, of which 26,916 
showed tissue-specific accessibility. Further, we identified key transcription 
factors specific to distinct tissues and found that the enrichment of each motif 
reflects the developmental similarities across tissues. In summary, our study 
provides an important resource on the mouse epigenome and will be of great 
importance to various scientific disciplines such as development, cell 
reprogramming, and genetic disease.

The blueprints to development, response to the environment, and cellular 
function are largely the manifestation of distinct gene expression programs 
controlled by the spatiotemporal activity of cis-regulatory elements. Although 
biochemical methods for identifying accessible chromatin - a hallmark of active 
cis-regulatory elements - have been developed, approaches capable of measuring 
and quantifying cis-regulatory activity are only beginning to be realized. 
Massively Parallel Reporter Assays coupled to chromatin accessibility profiling 
present a high-throughput solution for testing the transcription-activating 
capacity of millions of putatively regulatory DNA sequences in parallel. 
However, clear computational pipelines for analyzing these high-throughput 
sequencing-based reporter assays are lacking. In this protocol, I layout and 
rationalize a computational framework for the processing and analysis of Assay 
for Transposase Accessible Chromatin profiling followed by Self-Transcribed 
Active Regulatory Region sequencing (ATAC-STARR-seq) data from a recent study in 
Zea mays. The approach described herein can be adapted to other sequencing-based 
reporter assays and is largely agnostic to the model organism with the 
appropriate input substitutions.

High-altitude adaptation of Tibetans represents a remarkable case of natural 
selection during recent human evolution. Previous genome-wide scans found many 
non-coding variants under selection, suggesting a pressing need to understand 
the functional role of non-coding regulatory elements (REs). Here, we generate 
time courses of paired ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data on cultured HUVECs under 
hypoxic and normoxic conditions. We further develop a variant interpretation 
methodology (vPECA) to identify active selected REs (ASREs) and associated 
regulatory network. We discover three causal SNPs of EPAS1, the key adaptive 
gene for Tibetans. These SNPs decrease the accessibility of ASREs with weakened 
binding strength of relevant TFs, and cooperatively down-regulate EPAS1 
expression. We further construct the downstream network of EPAS1, elucidating 
its roles in hypoxic response and angiogenesis. Collectively, we provide a 
systematic approach to interpret phenotype-associated noncoding variants in 
proper cell types and relevant dynamic conditions, to model their impact on gene 
regulation.

Single-cell ATAC-seq has emerged as a powerful approach for revealing candidate 
cis-regulatory elements genome-wide at cell-type resolution. However, current 
single-cell methods suffer from limited throughput and high costs. Here, we 
present a novel technique called scifi-ATAC-seq, single-cell combinatorial 
fluidic indexing ATAC-sequencing, which combines a barcoded Tn5 pre-indexing 
step with droplet-based single-cell ATAC-seq using the 10X Genomics platform. 
With scifi-ATAC-seq, up to 200,000 nuclei across multiple samples can be indexed 
in a single emulsion reaction, representing an approximately 20-fold increase in 
throughput compared to the standard 10X Genomics workflow.

Cis-regulatory elements (CREs) are non-coding DNA regions involved in the 
spatio-temporal regulation of gene expression. Gene regulatory changes drive 
animal development and play major roles during evolution of animal body plans. 
Therefore, we believe that determining CREs at different developmental stages 
and across animal lineages is critical to understand how evolution operates 
through development. The Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin followed by 
high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) is a powerful technique for the study of 
CREs that takes advantage of Tn5 transposase activity. Starting from fewer than 
105 cells, in a 1-day procedure, it is possible to detect, at a genome-wide 
level, CREs located in open chromatin regions with high resolution. Here, we 
describe a detailed step-by-step ATAC-seq protocol for invertebrate chordate 
marine embryos. We have successfully applied this technique to amphioxus and two 
species of tunicate embryos. We also show an easy workflow to analyze data 
generated with this technique. Moreover, we point out that this method and our 
bioinformatic pipeline are efficient to detect CREs associated with Wnt 
signaling pathway by simply using embryos treated with a drug that perturbs this 
pathway. This approach can be extended to other signaling pathways and also to 
embryo mutants for critical genes. Our results therefore demonstrate the power 
of ATAC-seq for the identification of CREs that play essential functions during 
animal development in a wide range of invertebrate or vertebrate animals.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Epigenetic modifications are reversible changes to a cell's 
DNA or histones that alter gene expression but not DNA sequence. The present 
review will explore epigenomic profiling and bioinformatics techniques for the 
study of kidney development and disease.
RECENT FINDINGS: Reversible DNA and histone modifications influence chromatin 
accessibility and can be measured by a variety of recent techniques including 
DNase-seq, ATAC-seq, and single cell ATAC-seq. These approaches have been used 
to demonstrate that DNA methylation is critical for nephron progenitor 
maturation, for example. New bioinformatics techniques allow the prediction of 
chromatin loops that connect regulatory elements to target genes. Recent studies 
have demonstrated that DNA elements regulate transcription in the kidney via 
long-range physical interactions and create a new framework for understanding 
how genome wide association studies risk loci contribute to kidney disease. 
Increasingly, epigenomic approaches are being combined with transcriptomic 
analyses to generate multimodal datasets.
SUMMARY: Epigenomics has expanded our knowledge of gene architecture and 
regulation. Novel tools and techniques have led to the emergence of 'multiomics' 
in which epigenomic profiling, transcriptomics, and additional methods 
complement each other to improve our understanding of kidney disease and 
development.

The state of genome-wide chromatin accessibility in cells, tissues, or organisms 
can be investigated with a technique called assay for transposase-accessible 
chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq). ATAC-seq is a powerful approach for 
profiling the epigenomic landscape of cells using very low input materials. 
Analysis of chromatin accessibility data allows for prediction of gene 
expression and identification of regulatory elements such as potential enhancers 
and specific transcription-factor binding sites. Here, we describe an optimized 
ATAC-seq protocol for the preparation of isolated nuclei and subsequent 
next-generation sequencing from whole embryos and tissues of the African 
turquoise killifish (Nothobranchius furzeri). Importantly, we provide an 
overview of a pipeline for processing and analyzing ATAC-seq data from 
killifish.

The zebrafish (Danio rerio) has been widely used in the study of human disease 
and development, and about 70% of the protein-coding genes are conserved between 
the two species1. However, studies in zebrafish remain constrained by the sparse 
annotation of functional control elements in the zebrafish genome. Here we 
performed RNA sequencing, assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using 
sequencing (ATAC-seq), chromatin immunoprecipitation with sequencing, 
whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, and chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) 
experiments in up to eleven adult and two embryonic tissues to generate a 
comprehensive map of transcriptomes, cis-regulatory elements, heterochromatin, 
methylomes and 3D genome organization in the zebrafish Tübingen reference 
strain. A comparison of zebrafish, human and mouse regulatory elements enabled 
the identification of both evolutionarily conserved and species-specific 
regulatory sequences and networks. We observed enrichment of evolutionary 
breakpoints at topologically associating domain boundaries, which were 
correlated with strong histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) and 
CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) signals. We performed single-cell ATAC-seq in 
zebrafish brain, which delineated 25 different clusters of cell types. By 
combining long-read DNA sequencing and Hi-C, we assembled the sex-determining 
chromosome 4 de novo. Overall, our work provides an additional epigenomic anchor 
for the functional annotation of vertebrate genomes and the study of 
evolutionarily conserved elements of 3D genome organization.

Primary liver cancer (PLC) consists of two main histological subtypes; 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA). The 
role of transcription factors (TFs) in malignant hepatobiliary lineage 
commitment between HCC and iCCA remains underexplored. Here, we present 
genome-wide profiling of transcription regulatory elements of 16 PLC patients 
using single-cell assay for transposase accessible chromatin sequencing. 
Single-cell open chromatin profiles reflect the compositional diversity of liver 
cancer, identifying both malignant and microenvironment component cells. TF 
motif enrichment levels of 31 TFs strongly discriminate HCC from iCCA tumors. 
These TFs are members of the nuclear/retinoid receptor, POU, or ETS motif 
families. POU factors are associated with prognostic features in iCCA. Overall, 
nuclear receptors, ETS and POU TF motif families delineate transcription 
regulation between HCC and iCCA tumors, which may be relevant to development and 
selection of PLC subtype-specific therapeutics.

We report the generation of an organism-wide catalog of 976,813 cis-acting 
regulatory elements for the bovine detected by the assay for transposase 
accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq). We regroup these regulatory 
elements in 16 components by nonnegative matrix factorization. Correlation 
between the genome-wide density of peaks and transcription start sites, 
correlation between peak accessibility and expression of neighboring genes, and 
enrichment in transcription factor binding motifs support their regulatory 
potential. Using a previously established catalog of 12,736,643 variants, we 
show that the proportion of single-nucleotide polymorphisms mapping to ATAC-seq 
peaks is higher than expected and that this is owing to an approximately 
1.3-fold higher mutation rate within peaks. Their site frequency spectrum 
indicates that variants in ATAC-seq peaks are subject to purifying selection. We 
generate eQTL data sets for liver and blood and show that variants that drive 
eQTL fall into liver- and blood-specific ATAC-seq peaks more often than expected 
by chance. We combine ATAC-seq and eQTL data to estimate that the proportion of 
regulatory variants mapping to ATAC-seq peaks is approximately one in three and 
that the proportion of variants mapping to ATAC-seq peaks that are regulatory is 
approximately one in 25. We discuss the implication of these findings on the 
utility of ATAC-seq information to improve the accuracy of genomic selection.

Eukaryotic gene regulation is a combinatorial, dynamic, and quantitative process 
that plays a vital role in development and disease and can be modeled at a 
systems level in gene regulatory networks (GRNs). The wealth of multi-omics data 
measured on the same samples and even on the same cells has lifted the field of 
GRN inference to the next stage. Combinations of (single-cell) transcriptomics 
and chromatin accessibility allow the prediction of fine-grained regulatory 
programs that go beyond mere correlation of transcription factor and target gene 
expression, with enhancer GRNs (eGRNs) modeling molecular interactions between 
transcription factors, regulatory elements, and target genes. In this review, we 
highlight the key components for successful (e)GRN inference from (sc)RNA-seq 
and (sc)ATAC-seq data exemplified by state-of-the-art methods as well as open 
challenges and future developments. Moreover, we address preprocessing 
strategies, metacell generation and computational omics pairing, transcription 
factor binding site detection, and linear and three-dimensional approaches to 
identify chromatin interactions as well as dynamic and causal eGRN inference. We 
believe that the integration of transcriptomics together with epigenomics data 
at a single-cell level is the new standard for mechanistic network inference, 
and that it can be further advanced with integrating additional omics layers and 
spatiotemporal data, as well as with shifting the focus towards more 
quantitative and causal modeling strategies.

Plant tissues and organs are composed of functionally discrete cell types that 
are all defined by the same genome sequence. Cell-type variation in part arises 
from differential accessibility of cis-regulatory elements that encode the 
blueprints for transcriptional programs underlying cell identity and function. 
Owing to technical limitations, the role of cis-regulatory elements in cell 
identity maintenance, differentiation, and functional specialization has 
remained relatively unexplored in plant systems. Single-cell profiling has 
emerged as a powerful tool to circumvent these past obstacles by enabling 
unbiased charting of transcriptional and cis-regulatory states at the resolution 
of individual cells. Here, we review state-of-the-art single-cell approaches and 
analytical frameworks that have paved the way for establishing the link between 
cellular phenotypic variation and cis-regulatory mechanisms in plants.

Cis-regulatory elements (CREs) are pivotal in orchestrating gene expression 
throughout diverse biological systems. Accurate identification and in-depth 
characterization of functional CREs are crucial for decoding gene regulation 
networks during cellular processes. In this study, we develop Kethoxal-Assisted 
Single-stranded DNA Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin with Sequencing 
(KAS-ATAC-seq) to quantitatively analyze the transcriptional activity of CREs. A 
main advantage of KAS-ATAC-seq lies in its precise measurement of ssDNA levels 
within both proximal and distal ATAC-seq peaks, enabling the identification of 
transcriptional regulatory sequences. This feature is particularly adept at 
defining Single-Stranded Transcribing Enhancers (SSTEs). SSTEs are highly 
enriched with nascent RNAs and specific transcription factors (TFs) binding 
sites that define cellular identity. Moreover, KAS-ATAC-seq provides a detailed 
characterization and functional implications of various SSTE subtypes. Our 
analysis of CREs during mouse neural differentiation demonstrates that 
KAS-ATAC-seq can effectively identify immediate-early activated CREs in response 
to retinoic acid (RA) treatment. Our findings indicate that KAS-ATAC-seq 
provides more precise annotation of functional CREs in transcription. Future 
applications of KAS-ATAC-seq would help elucidate the intricate dynamics of gene 
regulation in diverse biological processes.

A hallmark feature of active cis-regulatory elements (CREs) in eukaryotes is 
their nucleosomal depletion and, accordingly, higher accessibility to enzymatic 
treatment. This property has been the basis of a number of sequencing-based 
assays for genome-wide identification and tracking the activity of CREs across 
different biological conditions, such as DNAse-seq, ATAC-seq , NOMeseq, and 
others. However, the fragmentation of DNA inherent to many of these assays and 
the limited read length of short-read sequencing platforms have so far not 
allowed the simultaneous measurement of the chromatin accessibility state of 
CREs located distally from each other. The combination of labeling accessible 
DNA with DNA modifications and nanopore sequencing has made it possible to 
develop such assays. Here, we provide a detailed protocol for carrying out the 
SMAC-seq assay (Single-Molecule long-read Accessible Chromatin mapping 
sequencing), in its m6A-SMAC-seq and m6A-CpG-GpC-SMAC-seq variants, together 
with methods for data processing and analysis, and discuss key experimental and 
analytical considerations for working with SMAC-seq datasets.

BACKGROUND: Chromatin accessibility plays a crucial role in mediating 
transcriptional dysregulation and heterogeneity in Esophageal Squamous Cell 
Carcinoma (ESCC). Examining the chromatin accessibility of ESCC at single-cell 
level is imperative to understand how it activates oncogenes and contributes to 
the onset and metastasis of ESCC.
METHODS: We performed single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin 
sequencing (scATAC-seq) on cancerous and adjacent noncancerous tissues from four 
ESCC patients who were pathological staged as T1a, T2b, T3b, or T4a, to 
investigate whether regulatory elements are pivotal in instigating cellular 
heterogeneity during ESCC metastasis. In conjunction, we integrated these data 
with 55 scRNA-seq datasets, ChIP-seq or CUT&Tag sequencing data, Hi-C sequencing 
data, bulk RNA-seq data, and bulk ATAC-seq data from ESCC cell lines to dissect 
the mechanisms underlying the heterogeneity of ESCC and tumor microenvironment 
(TME).
RESULTS: Our study identified enhancer-specific activation within epithelial 
cells orchestrated by the three-dimensional structure of chromatin that 
regulates SERPINH1 transcription, and promotes the epithelial-mesenchymal 
transition (EMT) and metastasis of ESCC. Additionally, chromatin element 
activation facilitated the expression of TNFSF4 in CD8 + exhausted T cells, 
thereby activating Tregs. Furthermore, we observed that chromatin accessibility 
promoted the differentiation of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and cancer 
associated fibroblasts (CAFs).
CONCLUSIONS: In summary, utilizing multiomics analyses, we have revealed 
chromatin accessibility maps and illuminated the intricate molecular mechanisms 
that underlie cellular heterogeneity during ESCC metastasis, offering valuable 
insights to further advance research on tumor progression and deterioration.

We develop a large-scale single-cell ATAC-seq method by combining Tn5-based 
pre-indexing with 10× Genomics barcoding, enabling the indexing of up to 200,000 
nuclei across multiple samples in a single reaction. We profile 449,953 nuclei 
across diverse tissues, including the human cortex, mouse brain, human lung, 
mouse lung, mouse liver, and lung tissue from a club cell secretory protein 
knockout (CC16-/-) model. Our study of CC16-/- nuclei uncovers previously 
underappreciated technical artifacts derived from remnant 129 mouse strain 
genetic material, which cause profound cell-type-specific changes in regulatory 
elements near many genes, thereby confounding the interpretation of this

BACKGROUND: Inflammation resolution and cardiac repair initiation after 
myocardial infarction (MI) require timely activation of reparative signals. 
Histone lactylation confers macrophage homeostatic gene expression signatures 
via transcriptional regulation. However, the role of histone lactylation in the 
repair response post-MI remains unclear. We aimed to investigate whether histone 
lactylation induces reparative gene expression in monocytes early and remotely 
post-MI.
METHODS: Single-cell transcriptome data indicated that reparative genes were 
activated early and remotely in bone marrow and circulating monocytes before 
cardiac recruitment. Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining revealed 
increases in histone lactylation levels, including the previously identified 
histone H3K18 lactylation in monocyte-macrophages early post-MI. Through joint 
CUT&Tag and RNA-sequencing analyses, we identified Lrg1, Vegf-a, and IL-10 as 
histone H3K18 lactylation target genes. The increased modification and 
expression levels of these target genes post-MI were verified by chromatin 
immunoprecipitation-qPCR and reverse transcription-qPCR.
RESULTS: We demonstrated that histone lactylation regulates the 
anti-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic dual activities of monocyte-macrophages by 
facilitating reparative gene transcription and confirmed that histone 
lactylation favors a reparative environment and improves cardiac function 
post-MI. Furthermore, we explored the potential positive role of monocyte 
histone lactylation in reperfused MI. Mechanistically, we provided new evidence 
that monocytes undergo metabolic reprogramming in the early stage of MI and 
demonstrated that dysregulated glycolysis and MCT1 (monocarboxylate transporter 
1)-mediated lactate transport promote histone lactylation. Finally, we revealed 
the catalytic effect of IL (interleukin)-1β-dependent GCN5 (general control 
non-depressible 5) recruitment on histone H3K18 lactylation and elucidated its 
potential role as an upstream regulatory element in the regulation of monocyte 
histone lactylation and downstream reparative gene expression post-MI.
CONCLUSIONS: Histone lactylation promotes early remote activation of the 
reparative transcriptional response in monocytes, which is essential for the 
establishment of immune homeostasis and timely activation of the cardiac repair 
process post-MI.

Cell type-specific gene expression patterns and dynamics during development or 
in disease are controlled by cis-regulatory elements (CREs), such as promoters 
and enhancers. Distinct classes of CREs can be characterized by their epigenomic 
features, including DNA methylation, chromatin accessibility, combinations of 
histone modifications and conformation of local chromatin. Tremendous progress 
has been made in cataloguing CREs in the human genome using bulk transcriptomic 
and epigenomic methods. However, single-cell epigenomic and multi-omic 
technologies have the potential to provide deeper insight into cell 
type-specific gene regulatory programmes as well as into how they change during 
development, in response to environmental cues and through disease pathogenesis. 
Here, we highlight recent advances in single-cell epigenomic methods and 
analytical tools and discuss their readiness for human tissue profiling.

Innate immune memory is the phenomenon whereby innate immune cells such as 
monocytes or macrophages undergo functional reprogramming after exposure to 
microbial components such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We apply an integrated 
epigenomic approach to characterize the molecular events involved in LPS-induced 
tolerance in a time-dependent manner. Mechanistically, LPS-treated monocytes 
fail to accumulate active histone marks at promoter and enhancers of genes in 
the lipid metabolism and phagocytic pathways. Transcriptional inactivity in 
response to a second LPS exposure in tolerized macrophages is accompanied by 
failure to deposit active histone marks at promoters of tolerized genes. In 
contrast, β-glucan partially reverses the LPS-induced tolerance in vitro. 
Importantly, ex vivo β-glucan treatment of monocytes from volunteers with 
experimental endotoxemia re-instates their capacity for cytokine production. 
Tolerance is reversed at the level of distal element histone modification and 
transcriptional reactivation of otherwise unresponsive genes. VIDEO ABSTRACT.

Mammalian fertilization begins with the fusion of two specialized gametes, 
followed by major epigenetic remodeling leading to the formation of a totipotent 
embryo. During the development of the pre-implantation embryo, precise 
reprogramming progress is a prerequisite for avoiding developmental defects or 
embryonic lethality, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. For 
the past few years, unprecedented breakthroughs have been made in mapping the 
regulatory network of dynamic epigenomes during mammalian early embryo 
development, taking advantage of multiple advances and innovations in low-input 
genome-wide chromatin analysis technologies. The aim of this review is to 
highlight the most recent progress in understanding the mechanisms of epigenetic 
remodeling during early embryogenesis in mammals, including DNA methylation, 
histone modifications, chromatin accessibility and 3D chromatin organization.

Substantial epigenetic resetting during early embryo development from 
fertilization to blastocyst formation ensures zygotic genome activation and 
leads to progressive cellular heterogeneities1-3. Mapping single-cell epigenomic 
profiles of core histone modifications that cover each individual cell is a 
fundamental goal in developmental biology. Here we develop target chromatin 
indexing and tagmentation (TACIT), a method that enabled genome-coverage 
single-cell profiling of seven histone modifications across mouse early embryos. 
We integrated these single-cell histone modifications with single-cell RNA 
sequencing data to chart a single-cell resolution epigenetic landscape. 
Multimodal chromatin-state annotations showed that the onset of zygotic genome 
activation at the early two-cell stage already primes heterogeneities in 
totipotency. We used machine learning to identify totipotency gene regulatory 
networks, including stage-specific transposable elements and putative 
transcription factors. CRISPR activation of a combination of these identified 
transcription factors induced totipotency activation in mouse embryonic stem 
cells. Together with single-cell co-profiles of multiple histone modifications, 
we developed a model that predicts the earliest cell branching towards the inner 
cell mass and the trophectoderm in latent multimodal space and identifies 
regulatory elements and previously unknown lineage-specifying transcription 
factors. Our work provides insights into single-cell epigenetic reprogramming, 
multimodal regulation of cellular lineages and cell-fate priming during mouse 
pre-implantation development.

The most highly conserved noncoding elements (HCNEs) in mammalian genomes 
cluster within regions enriched for genes encoding developmentally important 
transcription factors (TFs). This suggests that HCNE-rich regions may contain 
key regulatory controls involved in development. We explored this by examining 
histone methylation in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells across 56 large HCNE-rich 
loci. We identified a specific modification pattern, termed "bivalent domains," 
consisting of large regions of H3 lysine 27 methylation harboring smaller 
regions of H3 lysine 4 methylation. Bivalent domains tend to coincide with TF 
genes expressed at low levels. We propose that bivalent domains silence 
developmental genes in ES cells while keeping them poised for activation. We 
also found striking correspondences between genome sequence and histone 
methylation in ES cells, which become notably weaker in differentiated cells. 
These results highlight the importance of DNA sequence in defining the initial 
epigenetic landscape and suggest a novel chromatin-based mechanism for 
maintaining pluripotency.

Genome-wide profiling of histone modifications can reveal not only the location 
and activity state of regulatory elements, but also the regulatory mechanisms 
involved in cell-type-specific gene expression during development and disease 
pathology. Conventional assays to profile histone modifications in bulk tissues 
lack single-cell resolution. Here we describe an ultra-high-throughput method, 
Paired-Tag, for joint profiling of histone modifications and transcriptome in 
single cells to produce cell-type-resolved maps of chromatin state and 
transcriptome in complex tissues. We used this method to profile five histone 
modifications jointly with transcriptome in the adult mouse frontal cortex and 
hippocampus. Integrative analysis of the resulting maps identified distinct 
groups of genes subject to divergent epigenetic regulatory mechanisms. Our 
single-cell multiomics approach enables comprehensive analysis of chromatin 
state and gene regulation in complex tissues and characterization of gene 
regulatory programs in the constituent cell types.

The short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) propionate and butyrate have beneficial 
health effects, are produced in large amounts by microbial metabolism and have 
been identified as unique acyl lysine histone marks. To better understand the 
function of these modifications, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation followed 
by sequencing to map the genome-wide location of four short-chain acyl histone 
marks, H3K18pr, H3K18bu, H4K12pr and H4K12bu, in treated and untreated 
colorectal cancer (CRC) and normal cells as well as in mouse intestines in vivo. 
We correlate these marks with open chromatin regions and gene expression to 
access the function of the target regions. Our data demonstrate that propionate 
and butyrate bind and act as promoters of genes involved in growth, 
differentiation and ion transport. We propose a mechanism involving direct 
modification of specific genomic regions by SCFAs resulting in increased 
chromatin accessibility and, in the case of butyrate, opposing effects on the 
proliferation of normal versus CRC cells.

The human and mouse genomes contain instructions that specify RNAs and proteins 
and govern the timing, magnitude, and cellular context of their production. To 
better delineate these elements, phase III of the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements 
(ENCODE) Project has expanded analysis of the cell and tissue repertoires of RNA 
transcription, chromatin structure and modification, DNA methylation, chromatin 
looping, and occupancy by transcription factors and RNA-binding proteins. Here 
we summarize these efforts, which have produced 5,992 new experimental datasets, 
including systematic determinations across mouse fetal development. All data are 
available through the ENCODE data portal (https://www.encodeproject.org), 
including phase II ENCODE1 and Roadmap Epigenomics2 data. We have developed a 
registry of 926,535 human and 339,815 mouse candidate cis-regulatory elements, 
covering 7.9 and 3.4% of their respective genomes, by integrating selected 
datatypes associated with gene regulation, and constructed a web-based server 
(SCREEN; http://screen.encodeproject.org) to provide flexible, user-defined 
access to this resource. Collectively, the ENCODE data and registry provide an 
expansive resource for the scientific community to build a better understanding 
of the organization and function of the human and mouse genomes.

The reference human genome sequence set the stage for studies of genetic 
variation and its association with human disease, but epigenomic studies lack a 
similar reference. To address this need, the NIH Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium 
generated the largest collection so far of human epigenomes for primary cells 
and tissues. Here we describe the integrative analysis of 111 reference human 
epigenomes generated as part of the programme, profiled for histone modification 
patterns, DNA accessibility, DNA methylation and RNA expression. We establish 
global maps of regulatory elements, define regulatory modules of coordinated 
activity, and their likely activators and repressors. We show that disease- and 
trait-associated genetic variants are enriched in tissue-specific epigenomic 
marks, revealing biologically relevant cell types for diverse human traits, and 
providing a resource for interpreting the molecular basis of human disease. Our 
results demonstrate the central role of epigenomic information for understanding 
gene regulation, cellular differentiation and human disease.

Developmental programs are controlled by transcription factors and chromatin 
regulators, which maintain specific gene expression programs through epigenetic 
modification of the genome. These regulatory events at enhancers contribute to 
the specific gene expression programs that determine cell state and the 
potential for differentiation into new cell types. Although enhancer elements 
are known to be associated with certain histone modifications and transcription 
factors, the relationship of these modifications to gene expression and 
developmental state has not been clearly defined. Here we interrogate the 
epigenetic landscape of enhancer elements in embryonic stem cells and several 
adult tissues in the mouse. We find that histone H3K27ac distinguishes active 
enhancers from inactive/poised enhancer elements containing H3K4me1 alone. This 
indicates that the amount of actively used enhancers is lower than previously 
anticipated. Furthermore, poised enhancer networks provide clues to unrealized 
developmental programs. Finally, we show that enhancers are reset during nuclear 
reprogramming.

Post-translational modifications (PTMs) on histones are a key source of 
regulation on chromatin through impacting cellular processes, including gene 
expression1. These PTMs often arise from metabolites and are thus impacted by 
metabolism and environmental cues2-7. One class of metabolically regulated PTMs 
are histone acylations, which include histone acetylation, butyrylation, 
crotonylation and propionylation3,8. As these PTMs can be derived from 
short-chain fatty acids, which are generated by the commensal microbiota in the 
intestinal lumen9-11, we aimed to define how microbes impact the host intestinal 
chromatin landscape, mainly in female mice. Here we show that in addition to 
acetylation, intestinal epithelial cells from the caecum and distal mouse 
intestine also harbour high levels of butyrylation and propionylation on lysines 
9 and 27 of histone H3. We demonstrate that these acylations are regulated by 
the microbiota and that histone butyrylation is additionally regulated by the 
metabolite tributyrin. Tributyrin-regulated gene programmes are correlated with 
histone butyrylation, which is associated with active gene-regulatory elements 
and levels of gene expression. Together, our study uncovers a regulatory layer 
of how the microbiota and metabolites influence the intestinal epithelium 
through chromatin, demonstrating a physiological setting in which histone 
acylations are dynamically regulated and associated with gene regulation.

Histone crotonylation is a recently described post-translational modification 
that occurs at multiple identified histone lysine crotonylation sites. An 
increasing number of studies have demonstrated that histone crotonylation at DNA 
regulatory elements plays an important role in the activation of gene 
transcription. However, among others, we have shown that elevated cellular 
crotonylation levels result in the inhibition of endocytosis-related gene 
expression and pro-growth gene expression, implicating the complexity of histone 
crotonylation in gene regulation. Therefore, it is important to understand how 
histone crotonylation is regulated and how it, in turn, regulates the expression 
of its target genes. In this review, we summarize the regulatory factors that 
control histone crotonylation and discuss the role of different histone 
crotonylation sites in regulating gene expression, while providing novel 
insights into the central role of histone crotonylation in gene regulation.

Louis, St. Louis, Missouri, USA.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Epigenetic modifications are reversible changes to a cell's 
DNA or histones that alter gene expression but not DNA sequence. The present 
review will explore epigenomic profiling and bioinformatics techniques for the 
study of kidney development and disease.
RECENT FINDINGS: Reversible DNA and histone modifications influence chromatin 
accessibility and can be measured by a variety of recent techniques including 
DNase-seq, ATAC-seq, and single cell ATAC-seq. These approaches have been used 
to demonstrate that DNA methylation is critical for nephron progenitor 
maturation, for example. New bioinformatics techniques allow the prediction of 
chromatin loops that connect regulatory elements to target genes. Recent studies 
have demonstrated that DNA elements regulate transcription in the kidney via 
long-range physical interactions and create a new framework for understanding 
how genome wide association studies risk loci contribute to kidney disease. 
Increasingly, epigenomic approaches are being combined with transcriptomic 
analyses to generate multimodal datasets.
SUMMARY: Epigenomics has expanded our knowledge of gene architecture and 
regulation. Novel tools and techniques have led to the emergence of 'multiomics' 
in which epigenomic profiling, transcriptomics, and additional methods 
complement each other to improve our understanding of kidney disease and 
development.

Extravasation of monocytes into tissue and to the site of injury is a 
fundamental immunological process, which requires rapid responses via post 
translational modifications (PTM) of proteins. Protein arginine 
methyltransferase 7 (PRMT7) is an epigenetic factor that has the capacity to 
mono-methylate histones on arginine residues. Here we show that in chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients, PRMT7 expression is elevated in 
the lung tissue and localized to the macrophages. In mouse models of COPD, lung 
fibrosis and skin injury, reduced expression of PRMT7 associates with decreased 
recruitment of monocytes to the site of injury and hence less severe symptoms. 
Mechanistically, activation of NF-κB/RelA in monocytes induces PRMT7 
transcription and consequential mono-methylation of histones at the regulatory 
elements of RAP1A, which leads to increased transcription of this gene that is 
responsible for adhesion and migration of monocytes. Persistent monocyte-derived 
macrophage accumulation leads to ALOX5 over-expression and accumulation of its 
metabolite LTB4, which triggers expression of ACSL4 a ferroptosis promoting gene 
in lung epithelial cells. Conclusively, inhibition of arginine mono-methylation 
might offer targeted intervention in monocyte-driven inflammatory conditions 
that lead to extensive tissue damage if left untreated.

New experimental techniques in epigenomics allow researchers to assay a 
diversity of highly dynamic features such as histone marks, DNA modifications or 
chromatin structure. The study of their fluctuations should provide insights 
into gene expression regulation, cell differentiation and disease. The Ensembl 
project collects and maintains the Ensembl regulation data resources on 
epigenetic marks, transcription factor binding and DNA methylation for human and 
mouse, as well as microarray probe mappings and annotations for a variety of 
chordate genomes. From this data, we produce a functional annotation of the 
regulatory elements along the human and mouse genomes with plans to expand to 
other species as data becomes available. Starting from well-studied cell lines, 
we will progressively expand our library of measurements to a greater variety of 
samples. Ensembl's regulation resources provide a central and easy-to-query 
repository for reference epigenomes. As with all Ensembl data, it is freely 
available at http://www.ensembl.org, from the Perl and REST APIs and from the 
public Ensembl MySQL database server at ensembldb.ensembl.org. Database URL:

Transposable elements (TEs) are the most prevalent elements in mammalian 
genomes. Although potential risks for genome stability, they are a pool of 
potential regulatory sequences, chromatin control elements, protein-coding 
genes, and substrates for evolutionary processes. Consequently, a delicate 
balance is maintained between the potential benefits and deleterious aspects of 
TEs, and this balance is mediated by the epigenetic regulatory system. In this 
review, we introduce the role of heterochromatin associated epigentic 
modifications such as histone 3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) and DNA 
methylation in the silencing of TEs as well as epigenetic modifications such as 
histone 3 lysine 4 monomethylation (H3K4me1) and histone 3 lysine 27 acetylation 
(H3K27ac) in activation of TEs. Further, we elaborate the functions of TEs as 
binding sites of transcription factors and as anchors of chromosomal 
conformation in regulation of gene expression. We introduce the impact of TEs on 
the process of cell fate determination including natural embryonic development 
in vivo and artificial cell fate transition in vitro. We discuss the main 
challenges associated with computational TEs analysis and TEs functions 
exploration, as well as the different experimental and computational strategies 
in studying these processes. In all, this article provides a comprehensive 
review of the research advances and existing problems in study of transposable 
elements in epigenetic regulatory mechanisms, gene transcriptional regulation, 
and cell fate determination, thereby providing some references for researchers 
in the fields.

转座元件是哺乳动物基因组内含量最多的元素。尽管转座元件的存在对基因组稳定性具有潜在的危险,但它们同时还是潜在的基因调控序列、蛋白质编码序列和染色质结构序列,并参与物种进化过程。因此,基因组中转座元件的有害性和有益性保持着谨慎的平衡,并且这种平衡主要由表观遗传修饰来调控。本文详细介绍了异染色质类型表观遗传修饰如H3K9me3和DNA甲基化在转座元件沉默中的功能;转座元件作为增强子元件富集激活型表观遗传修饰如H3K4me1和H3K27ac,以及作为转录因子结合靶点、染色质构象锚点等方式参与基因表达调控的模式;从体内胚胎发育到体外细胞命运转变,阐述了转座元件在细胞命运决定中的潜在功能及作用方式;最后,对转座元件领域研究存在的挑战及潜在解决方法提出了见解。总之,本文对转座元件与表观遗传、基因表达调控以及细胞命运决定等方面的研究及存在的问题进行了较全面的综述,旨在为相关领域的研究人员提供参考。.

Widespread aberrant gene expression is a pathological hallmark of polycystic 
kidney disease (PKD). Numerous pathogenic signaling cascades, including c-Myc, 
Fos, and Jun, are transactivated. However, the underlying epigenetic regulators 
are poorly defined. Here we show that H3K27ac, an acetylated modification of DNA 
packing protein histone H3 that marks active enhancers, is elevated in mouse and 
human samples of autosomal dominant PKD. Using comparative H3K27ac ChIP-Seq 
analysis, we mapped over 16000 active intronic and intergenic enhancer elements 
in Pkd1-mutant mouse kidneys. We found that the cystic kidney epigenetic 
landscape resembles that of a developing kidney, and over 90% of upregulated 
genes in Pkd1-mutant kidneys are co-housed with activated enhancers in the same 
topologically associated domains. Furthermore, we identified an evolutionarily 
conserved enhancer cluster downstream of the c-Myc gene and super-enhancers 
flanking both Jun and Fos loci in mouse and human models of autosomal dominant 
PKD. Deleting these regulatory elements reduced c-Myc, Jun, or Fos abundance and 
suppressed proliferation and 3D cyst growth of Pkd1-mutant cells. Finally, 
inhibiting glycolysis and glutaminolysis or activating Ppara in Pkd1-mutant 
cells lowerd global H3K27ac levels and its abundance on c-Myc enhancers. Thus, 
our work suggests that epigenetic rewiring mediates the transcriptomic 
dysregulation in PKD, and the regulatory elements can be targeted to slow cyst 
growth.

serves as the connection between genetic and environmental factors. Histone 
modification, an epigenetic regulatory mechanism, is implicated in the 
development of numerous diseases. The basic function of histone modification is 
to regulate cellular functions by modifying gene expression. Modulation of 
histone modification, such as regulation of enzymes pertinent to histone 
modification, can be an alternative approach for treating some diseases, 
including psoriasis. Herein, we reviewed the regulatory mechanisms and 
biological effects of histone modifications and their roles in the pathogenesis 
of psoriasis.

Lung cancer as the leading cause of cancer-related deaths can be initiated and 
progressed by the interaction between dynamically genetic and epigenetic 
elements, although mechanisms mediating lung cancer development and progression 
remain unclear. Tumor progenitor genes may contribute to lung carcinogenesis and 
cancer progression, are epigenetically disrupted at the early stages of 
malignancies even before mutations, and alter cell differentiation throughout 
tumor evolution. The present review explores potential roles and mechanisms of 
epigenetic modulators, modifiers and mediators in the development of lung 
cancer. We also overviewed potential mechanisms by which epigenetic modulators, 
modifiers and mediators control and regulate 3D nuclear architectures, and 
discussed translational efforts to epigenetic modifications for treatment of 
lung cancer. Deep understanding of epigenetic modulators, modifiers and 
mediators will benefit the discovery and development of new diagnostics and 
therapies for lung cancer.

Epigenetic mechanisms have emerged as links between prenatal environmental 
exposure and disease risk later in life. Here, we studied epigenetic changes 
associated with maternal smoking at base pair resolution by mapping DNA 
methylation, histone modifications, and transcription in expectant mothers and 
their newborn children. We found extensive global differential methylation and 
carefully evaluated these changes to separate environment associated from 
genotype-related DNA methylation changes. Differential methylation is enriched 
in enhancer elements and targets in particular "commuting" enhancers having 
multiple, regulatory interactions with distal genes. Longitudinal whole-genome 
bisulfite sequencing revealed that DNA methylation changes associated with 
maternal smoking persist over years of life. Particularly in children prenatal 
environmental exposure leads to chromatin transitions into a hyperactive state. 
Combined DNA methylation, histone modification, and gene expression analyses 
indicate that differential methylation in enhancer regions is more often 
functionally translated than methylation changes in promoters or non-regulatory 
elements. Finally, we show that epigenetic deregulation of a commuting enhancer 
targeting c-Jun N-terminal kinase 2 (JNK2) is linked to impaired lung function 
in early childhood.

Aging as an Epigenetic Phenomenon.

University, Moscow, Russia.

INTRODUCTION: Hypermethylation of genes associated with promoter CpG islands, 
and hypomethylation of CpG poor genes, repeat sequences, transposable elements 
and intergenic genome sections occur during aging in mammals. Methylation levels 
of certain CpG sites display strict correlation to age and could be used as 
"epigenetic clock" to predict biological age. Multi-substrate deacetylases SIRT1 
and SIRT6 affect aging via locus-specific modulations of chromatin structure and 
activity of multiple regulatory proteins involved in aging. Random errors in DNA 
methylation and other epigenetic marks during aging increase the transcriptional 
noise, and thus lead to enhanced phenotypic variation between cells of the same 
tissue. Such variation could cause progressive organ dysfunction observed in 
aged individuals. Multiple experimental data show that induction of NF-κB 
regulated gene sets occurs in various tissues of aged mammals. Upregulation of 
multiple miRNAs occurs at mid age leading to downregulation of enzymes and 
regulatory proteins involved in basic cellular functions, such as DNA repair, 
oxidative phosphorylation, intermediate metabolism, and others.
CONCLUSION: Strong evidence shows that all epigenetic systems contribute to the 
lifespan control in various organisms. Similar to other cell systems, epigenome 
is prone to gradual degradation due to the genome damage, stressful agents, and 
other aging factors. But unlike mutations and other kinds of the genome damage, 
age-related epigenetic changes could be fully or partially reversed to a "young" 
state.

The function of one-carbon metabolism is that of regulating the provision of 
methyl groups for biological methylation reactions including that of DNA and 
histone proteins. Methylation at specific sites into the DNA sequence and at 
histone tails are among the major epigenetic feature of mammalian genome for the 
regulation of gene expression. The enzymes within one-carbon metabolism are 
dependent from a number of vitamins or nutrients that serve either as co-factors 
or methyl acceptors or donors among which folate, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, 
betaine, choline and methionine have a major role. Several evidences show that 
there is a strict inter-relationship between one-carbon metabolism nutrients and 
epigenetic phenomena. Epigenetics is closely involved in gene transcriptional 
regulation through modifications super-imposed to the nucleotide sequence of 
DNA, such as DNA methylation, through chromatin remodeling systems that involves 
post-translational modifications of histones or through non-coding RNAs-based 
mechanisms. The epigenetic features of the genome are potentially modifiable by 
the action of several environmental factors among which nutrients cover a 
special place and interest considering their potential of influencing regulatory 
pathways at a molecular level by specific nutritional intervention and 
eventually influence disease prevention and outcomes. The present review will 
focus on the link between one-carbon nutrients and epigenetic phenomena based on 
the current knowledge from findings in cell culture, animal models and human 
studies.

Epigenetic regulatory elements associate with specific histone modifications to 
prevent silencing of telomeric genes.

In eukaryotic cells, transgene expression levels may be limited by an 
unfavourable chromatin structure at the integration site. Epigenetic regulators 
are DNA sequences which may protect transgenes from such position effect. We 
evaluated different epigenetic regulators for their ability to protect transgene 
expression at telomeres, which are commonly associated to low or inconsistent 
expression because of their repressive chromatin environment. Although to 
variable extents, matrix attachment regions (MARs), ubiquitous chromatin opening 
element (UCOE) and the chicken cHS4 insulator acted as barrier elements, 
protecting a telomeric-distal transgene from silencing. MARs also increased the 
probability of silent gene reactivation in time-course experiments. 
Additionally, all MARs improved the level of expression in non-silenced cells, 
unlike other elements. MARs were associated to histone marks usually linked to 
actively expressed genes, especially acetylation of histone H3 and H4, 
suggesting that they may prevent the spread of silencing chromatin by imposing 
acetylation marks on nearby nucleosomes. Alternatively, an UCOE was found to act 
by preventing deposition of repressive chromatin marks. We conclude that 
epigenetic DNA elements used to enhance and stabilize transgene expression all 
have specific epigenetic signature that might be at the basis of their mode of 
action.

Differentiation of stem cells into highly specialised cells requires gene 
expression changes brought about by remodelling of the chromatin architecture. 
During this lineage-commitment process, the majority of DNA needs to be packaged 
into inactive heterochromatin, allowing only a subset of regulatory elements to 
remain open and functionally required genes to be expressed. Epigenetic 
mechanisms such as DNA methylation, post-translational modifications to histone 
tails, and nucleosome positioning all potentially contribute to the changes in 
higher order chromatin structure during differentiation. The mammary gland is a 
particularly useful model to study these complex epigenetic processes since the 
majority of its development is postnatal, the gland is easily accessible, and 
development occurs in a highly reproducible manner. Inappropriate epigenetic 
remodelling can also drive tumourigenesis; thus, insights into epigenetic 
remodelling during mammary gland development advance our understanding of breast 
cancer aetiology. We review the current literature surrounding DNA methylation 
and histone modifications in the developing mammary gland and its implications 
for breast cancer.

Friedreich´s ataxia (FRDA) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by an 
abnormally expanded Guanine-Adenine-Adenine (GAA) repeat sequence within the 
first intron of the frataxin gene (FXN). The molecular mechanisms associated 
with FRDA are still poorly understood and most studies on FXN gene regulation 
have been focused on the region around the minimal promoter and the region in 
which triplet expansion occurs. Nevertheless, since there could be more 
epigenetic changes involved in the reduced levels of FXN transcripts, the aim of 
this study was to obtain a more detailed view of the possible regulatory 
elements by analyzing data from ENCODE and Roadmap consortia databases. This 
bioinformatic analysis indicated new putative regulatory regions within the FXN 
genomic locus, including exons, introns, and upstream and downstream regions. 
Moreover, the region next to the end of intron 4 is of special interest, since 
the enhancer signals in FRDA-affected tissues are weak or absent in this region, 
whilst they are strong in the rest of the analyzed tissues. Therefore, these 
results suggest that there could be a direct relationship between the absence of 
enhancer sequences in this specific region and their predisposition to be 
affected in this pathology.

Lineage plasticity, the ability of a cell to alter its identity, is an 
increasingly common mechanism of adaptive resistance to targeted therapy in 
cancer. An archetypal example is the development of neuroendocrine prostate 
cancer (NEPC) after treatment of prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD) with inhibitors 
of androgen signaling. NEPC is an aggressive variant of prostate cancer that 
aberrantly expresses genes characteristic of neuroendocrine (NE) tissues and no 
longer depends on androgens. Here, we investigate the epigenomic basis of this 
resistance mechanism by profiling histone modifications in NEPC and PRAD 
patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) using chromatin immunoprecipitation and 
sequencing (ChIP-seq). We identify a vast network of cis-regulatory elements 
(N~15,000) that are recurrently activated in NEPC. The FOXA1 transcription 
factor (TF), which pioneers androgen receptor (AR) chromatin binding in the 
prostate epithelium, is reprogrammed to NE-specific regulatory elements in NEPC. 
Despite loss of dependence upon AR, NEPC maintains FOXA1 expression and requires 
FOXA1 for proliferation and expression of NE lineage-defining genes. Ectopic 
expression of the NE lineage TFs ASCL1 and NKX2-1 in PRAD cells reprograms FOXA1 
to bind to NE regulatory elements and induces enhancer activity as evidenced by 
histone modifications at these sites. Our data establish the importance of FOXA1 
in NEPC and provide a principled approach to identifying cancer dependencies 
through epigenomic profiling.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-Seq) is the preferred 
approach to map histone modifications and identify cis-regulatory DNA elements 
throughout the genome. Multiple methods have been described to increase the 
efficiency of library preparation and to reduce hands-on time as well as costs. 
This review describes detailed steps to perform cell fixation, chromatin 
shearing, immunoprecipitation, and sequencing library preparation for a batch of 
48-96 samples with small cell numbers. The protocol implements a semiautomated 
platform to reduce technical variability and improve signal-to-noise ratio as 
well as reduce hands-on time, thus allowing large-scale epigenetic studies of 
clinical samples with limited cell numbers.

OBJECTIVE: Epigenetic modifications including histone post translational 
modifications can influence gene expression in adipocytes, potentially 
contributing to metabolic dysfunctions, obesity, and insulin resistance. Despite 
recent advances in the characterization of the mouse adipocyte epigenome, 
epigenetic characterization of adipocytes in vivo has been challenging, 
particularly across different adipose depots and of several epigenetic 
modifications.
METHODS: Here, we use specific reporter mice labelling brown, beige and white 
adipocytes, diphtheria toxin-mediated ablation of beige adipocytes, and Cleavage 
Under Targets and Tagmentation (CUT&Tag) to generate paired single mouse 
datasets of five histone marks. We perform an integrative multi-omics factor 
analysis (MOFA) of H3K4me3, H3K27me3, H3K4me1, H3K27ac and H3K9me3 in brown, 
white and beige adipocytes from three distinct mouse adipose tissue depots 
obtained during cold exposure and thermoneutrality.
RESULTS: Our analysis reveals that enhancers distinguish adipocytes by their 
tissue of origin, with H3K4me1 deposition differentiating between beige and 
brown adipocytes. Beige adipocytes poised promoters associated to thermogenic 
genes during warming. Diphtheria toxin-mediated ablation of beige adipocytes 
shows that non-beigeing white adipocytes in inguinal adipose tissue and beige 
adipocytes are not inherently epigenetically different suggesting that they 
share a common developmental progenitor.
CONCLUSIONS: These paired multimodal data comprise an extensive resource 
(https://github.com/vonMeyennLab/mAT_CE_Atlas) for the further exploration of 
the mouse adipocyte epigenome which will enable discovery of regulatory elements 
governing adipocyte identity and gene regulation.

BACKGROUND: Pepper (Capsicum annuum) is one of the earliest and most widely 
cultivated vegetable crops worldwide. While the large and complex genome of 
pepper severely hampered the understanding of its functional genome, it also 
indicates a rich yet unexplored reservoir of regulatory elements (REs). In fact, 
variations in the REs represent a major driving force in evolution and 
domestication in both plants and animals. However, identification of the REs 
remains difficult especially for plants with complex genomes.
RESULTS: Here, we present a comprehensive epigenomic landscape of Capsicum 
annuum, Zhangshugang (ST-8), including chromatin accessibility, histone 
modifications, DNA methylation, and transcriptome. We also develop comparative 
crosslinked immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry to reveal the proteome 
associated with certain chromatin features. Through integrated analysis of these 
epigenetic features, we profile promoters and enhancers involved in development, 
heat stress and cucumber mosaic virus challenges. We generate stress responsive 
expression networks composed of potential transcription activators and their 
target genes. Through population genetics analysis, we demonstrate that some 
regulatory elements show lower nucleotide diversity compare to other genomic 
regions during evolution.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that variations in the REs may contribute to more 
diversified and agronomically desired phenotypes. Our study provides a 
foundation not only for studying gene regulation, but also for targeted genetic 
and epigenetic manipulation for pepper improvement.

Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4A (HNF4A/NR2a1), a transcriptional regulator of 
hepatocyte identity, controls genes that are crucial for liver functions, 
primarily through binding to enhancers. In mammalian cells, active and primed 
enhancers are marked by monomethylation of histone 3 (H3) at lysine 4 (K4) 
(H3K4me1) in a cell type-specific manner. How this modification is established 
and maintained at enhancers in connection with transcription factors (TFs) 
remains unknown. Using analysis of genome-wide histone modifications, TF 
binding, chromatin accessibility and gene expression, we show that HNF4A is 
essential for an active chromatin state. Using HNF4A loss and gain of function 
experiments in vivo and in cell lines in vitro, we show that HNF4A affects 
H3K4me1, H3K27ac and chromatin accessibility, highlighting its contribution to 
the establishment and maintenance of a transcriptionally permissive epigenetic 
state. Mechanistically, HNF4A interacts with the mixed-lineage leukaemia 4 
(MLL4) complex facilitating recruitment to HNF4A-bound regions. Our findings 
indicate that HNF4A enriches H3K4me1, H3K27ac and establishes chromatin opening 
at transcriptional regulatory regions.

How repetitive elements, epigenetic modifications, and architectural proteins 
interact ensuring proper genome expression remains poorly understood. Here, we 
report regulatory mechanisms unveiling a central role of Alu elements (AEs) and 
RNA polymerase III transcription factor C (TFIIIC) in structurally and 
functionally modulating the genome via chromatin looping and histone 
acetylation. Upon serum deprivation, a subset of AEs pre-marked by the 
activity-dependent neuroprotector homeobox Protein (ADNP) and located near 
cell-cycle genes recruits TFIIIC, which alters their chromatin accessibility by 
direct acetylation of histone H3 lysine-18 (H3K18). This facilitates the 
contacts of AEs with distant CTCF sites near promoter of other cell-cycle genes, 
which also become hyperacetylated at H3K18. These changes ensure basal 
transcription of cell-cycle genes and are critical for their re-activation upon 
serum re-exposure. Our study reveals how direct manipulation of the epigenetic 
state of AEs by a general transcription factor regulates 3D genome folding and 
expression.

Enhancer is one kind of cis-elements regulating gene transcription, whose 
activity is tightly controlled by epigenetic enzymes and histone modifications. 
Active enhancers are classified into typical enhancers, super-enhancers and 
over-active enhancers, according to the enrichment and location of histone 
modifications. Epigenetic factors control the level of histone modifications on 
enhancers to determine their activity, such as histone methyltransferases and 
acetylases. Transcription factors, cofactors and mediators co-operate together 
and are required for enhancer functions. In turn, abnormalities in these 
trans-acting factors affect enhancer activity. Recent studies have revealed 
enhancer dysregulation as one of the important features for cancer. Variations 
in enhancer regions and mutations of enhancer regulatory genes are frequently 
observed in cancer cells, and altering the activity of onco-enhancers is able to 
repress oncogene expression, and suppress tumorigenesis and metastasis. Here we 
summarize the recent discoveries about enhancer regulation in cancer and discuss 
their potential application in diagnosis and treatment.

Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a rare connective tissue disease characterized by 
vascular remodeling, fibroblast activation and extra-cellular matrix production 
in excess and autoimmunity. Environmental factors including mainly silica and 
solvents have been assumed to contribute to the development of SSc, together 
with genetic factors including gene variants implicated in innate immunity such 
as IRF5 and STAT4, and epigenetic factors including histone post-translational 
modifications, DNA hypomethylation, and microRNAs or long- non coding RNAs 
system were reported to participate in immune activation and fibrosis processes 
in patients with SSc. A number of animal models of SSc have been set up over the 
years, including genetic and induced SSc models. These models, together with 
data obtained from human SSc patients, contributed to better understand the 
mechanisms contributing to vasculopathy and fibrosis. Alongside the 
pathophysiological process of SSc, several cellular and molecular actors are 
involved, such as dysregulations in the innate and adaptive immune cells, of the 
fibroblast, the implication of pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrosing signaling 
pathways such as the Wnt, TGF-β pathways or other cytokines, with a strong 
imprint of oxidative stress. The whole lead to the overactivity of the 
fibroblast with genetic dysregulation, apoptosis defect, hyperproduction of 
elements of extracellular matrix, and finally the phenomena of vasculopathy and 
fibrosis. These advances contribute to open new therapeutic areas through the 
design of biologics and small molecules.

Bone formation and homeostasis are controlled by environmental factors and 
endocrine regulatory cues that initiate intracellular signaling pathways capable 
of modulating gene expression in the nucleus. Bone-related gene expression is 
controlled by nucleosome-based chromatin architecture that limits the 
accessibility of lineage-specific gene regulatory DNA sequences and 
sequence-specific transcription factors. From a developmental perspective, 
bone-specific gene expression must be suppressed during the early stages of 
embryogenesis to prevent the premature mineralization of skeletal elements 
during fetal growth in utero. Hence, bone formation is initially inhibited by 
gene suppressive epigenetic regulators, while other epigenetic regulators 
actively support osteoblast differentiation. Prominent epigenetic regulators 
that stimulate or attenuate osteogenesis include lysine methyl transferases 
(e.g., EZH2, SMYD2, SUV420H2), lysine deacetylases (e.g., HDAC1, HDAC3, HDAC4, 
HDAC7, SIRT1, SIRT3), arginine methyl transferases (e.g., PRMT1, PRMT4/CARM1, 
PRMT5), dioxygenases (e.g., TET2), bromodomain proteins (e.g., BRD2, BRD4) and 
chromodomain proteins (e.g., CBX1, CBX2, CBX5). This narrative review provides a 
broad overview of the covalent modifications of DNA and histone proteins that 
involve hundreds of enzymes that add, read, or delete these epigenetic 
modifications that are relevant for self-renewal and differentiation of 
mesenchymal stem cells, skeletal stem cells and osteoblasts during osteogenesis.

Cell fate progression of pluripotent progenitors is strictly regulated, 
resulting in high human cell diversity. Epigenetic modifications also 
orchestrate cell fate restriction. Unveiling the epigenetic mechanisms 
underlying human cell diversity has been difficult. In this study, we use human 
brain and retina organoid models and present single-cell profiling of H3K27ac, 
H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 histone modifications from progenitor to differentiated 
neural fates to reconstruct the epigenomic trajectories regulating cell identity 
acquisition. We capture transitions from pluripotency through neuroepithelium to 
retinal and brain region and cell type specification. Switching of repressive 
and activating epigenetic modifications can precede and predict cell fate 
decisions at each stage, providing a temporal census of gene regulatory elements 
and transcription factors. Removing H3K27me3 at the neuroectoderm stage disrupts 
fate restriction, resulting in aberrant cell identity acquisition. Our 
single-cell epigenome-wide map of human neural organoid development serves as a 
blueprint to explore human cell fate determination.

Transcriptional activators bind DNA and recruit cofactors to modify chromatin. 
The extent to which these two events are separable is unclear. Here, using a 
custom ChIP tiling array to map chromatin modifications, we show that 
interferon-γ-induced DNA binding of signal transducer and activator of 
transcription 1 (STAT1), typically associated with the transcription factor 
interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1), causes histone acetylation (H3ac, H4ac). 
In contrast, among IRF1 sites lacking concomitant STAT1 recruitment, only 25% 
underwent inducible histone acetylation, 31% exhibited constitutive histone 
acetylation, and 44% had no histone acetylation. These latter "orphan sites" 
also lacked other activating modifications (e.g. H3K4me1, H3K4me2) and were 
typically remote from transcription start sites. In these cases the closest gene 
was typically an IFNγ-inducible locus that did not respond to IFNγ in this 
setting. Orphan sites were detected in different cell types, suggesting broad 
relevance. Despite an atypical downstream response (i.e. no histone 
modifications), IRF1 binding depended on SWI/SNF-related, matrix-associated, 
actin-dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily A, member 4 (SMARCA4 or BRG1), 
as is typical of active IRF1 enhancers. Although SMARCA4 permitted IRF1 access 
to the orphan sites, there was no corecruitment of the histone 
acetyltransferases CREB-binding protein (CBP) and p300. Orphan sites were 
constitutively unacetylated, and several were marked with repressive chromatin 
modifications (e.g. H3K27me3). In conclusion, although IRF1 can trigger 
enhanceosome formation independently of STAT1, its ability to do so depends on 
local chromatin cues.

Experimental evidence indicates that shear stress (SS) exerts a morphogenetic 
function during cardiac development of mouse and zebrafish embryos. However, the 
molecular basis for this effect is still elusive. Our previous work described 
that in adult endothelial cells, SS regulates gene expression by inducing 
epigenetic modification of histones and activation of transcription complexes 
bearing acetyltransferase activity. In this study, we evaluated whether SS 
treatment could epigenetically modify histones and influence cell 
differentiation in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. Cells were exposed to a 
laminar SS of 10 dyne per cm2/s(-1), or kept in static conditions in the 
presence or absence of the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA). 
These experiments revealed that SS enhanced lysine acetylation of histone H3 at 
position 14 (K14), as well as serine phosphorylation at position 10 (S10) and 
lysine methylation at position 79 (K79), and cooperated with TSA, inducing 
acetylation of histone H4 and phosphoacetylation of S10 and K14 of histone H3. 
In addition, ES cells exposed to SS strongly activated transcription from the 
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor 2 promoter. This effect was 
paralleled by an early induction of cardiovascular markers, including smooth 
muscle actin, smooth muscle protein 22-alpha, platelet-endothelial cell adhesion 
molecule-1, VEGF receptor 2, myocyte enhancer factor-2C (MEF2C), and 
alpha-sarcomeric actin. In this condition, transcription factors MEF2C and 
Sma/MAD homolog protein 4 could be isolated from SS-treated ES cells complexed 
with the cAMP response element-binding protein acetyltransferase. These results 
provide molecular basis for the SS-dependent cardiovascular commitment of mouse 
ES cells and suggest that laminar flow may be successfully applied for the in 
vitro production of cardiovascular precursors.

BACKGROUND: Embryonic development requires the accurate spatiotemporal execution 
of cell lineage-specific gene expression programs, which are controlled by 
transcriptional enhancers. Developmental enhancers adopt a primed chromatin 
state prior to their activation. How this primed enhancer state is established 
and maintained and how it affects the regulation of developmental gene networks 
remains poorly understood.
RESULTS: Here, we use comparative multi-omic analyses of human and mouse early 
embryonic development to identify subsets of postgastrulation lineage-specific 
enhancers which are epigenetically primed ahead of their activation, marked by 
the histone modification H3K4me1 within the epiblast. We show that epigenetic 
priming occurs at lineage-specific enhancers for all three germ layers and that 
epigenetic priming of enhancers confers lineage-specific regulation of key 
developmental gene networks. Surprisingly in some cases, lineage-specific 
enhancers are epigenetically marked already in the zygote, weeks before their 
activation during lineage specification. Moreover, we outline a generalizable 
strategy to use naturally occurring human genetic variation to delineate 
important sequence determinants of primed enhancer function.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings identify an evolutionarily conserved program of 
enhancer priming and begin to dissect the temporal dynamics and mechanisms of 
its establishment and maintenance during early mammalian development.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is complex neurobehavioral condition influenced 
by several cellular and molecular mechanisms that are often concerned with 
synaptogenesis and synaptic activity. Based on the excitation/inhibition (E/I) 
imbalance theory, ASD could be the result of disruption in excitatory and 
inhibitory synaptic transmission across the brain. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) 
is the chief regulator of executive function and can be affected by altered 
neuronal excitation and inhibition in the course of ASD. The molecular 
mechanisms involved in E/I imbalance are subject to epigenetic regulation. In 
ASD, altered enrichment and spreading of histone H3 and H4 modifications such as 
the activation-linked H3K4me2/3, H3K9ac, and H3K27ac, and repression-linked 
H3K9me2, H3K27me3, and H4K20me2 in the PFC result in dysregulation of molecules 
mediating synaptic excitation (ARC, EGR1, mGluR2, mGluR3, GluN2A, and GluN2B) 
and synaptic inhibition (BSN, EphA7, SLC6A1). Histone modifications are a 
dynamic component of the epigenetic regulatory elements with a pronounced effect 
on patterns of gene expression with regards to any biological process. The 
excitation/inhibition imbalance associated with ASD is based on the excitatory 
and inhibitory synaptic activity in different regions of the brain, including 
the PFC, the ultimate outcome of which is highly influenced by transcriptional 
activity of relevant genes.

BACKGROUND: With the maturity of next generation sequencing technology, a huge 
amount of epigenomic data have been generated by several large consortia in the 
last decade. These plenty resources leave us the opportunity about sufficiently 
utilizing those data to explore biological problems.
RESULTS: Here we developed an integrative and comparative method, CsreHMM, which 
is based on a hidden Markov model, to systematically reveal cell type-specific 
regulatory elements (CSREs) along the whole genome, and simultaneously recognize 
the histone codes (mark combinations) charactering them. This method also 
reveals the subclasses of CSREs and explicitly label those shared by a few cell 
types. We applied this method to a data set of 9 cell types and 9 chromatin 
marks to demonstrate its effectiveness and found that the revealed CSREs relates 
to different kinds of functional regulatory regions significantly. Their 
proximal genes have consistent expression and are likely to participate in cell 
type-specific biological functions.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest CsreHMM has the potential to help understand 
cell identity and the diverse mechanisms of gene regulation.

Histone 3 lysine 4 methylation (H3K4me) is a highly evolutionary conserved 
chromatin modification associated with active transcription, and its three 
methylation states-mono, di, and trimethylation-mark distinct regulatory 
elements. However, whether H3K4me plays functional roles in transcriptional 
regulation or is merely a by-product of histone methyltransferases recruited to 
actively transcribed loci is still under debate. Here, we outline the studies 
that have addressed this question in yeast, Drosophila, and mammalian systems. 
We review evidence from histone residue mutation, histone modifier manipulation, 
and epigenetic editing, focusing on the relative roles of H3K4me1 and H3K4me3. 
We conclude that H3K4me1 and H3K4me3 may have convergent functions in 
establishing open chromatin and promoting transcriptional activation during cell 
differentiation.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Cholangiocytes transit from quiescence to hyperproliferation 
during cystogenesis in polycystic liver disease (PLD), the severity of which 
displays prominent sex differences. Epigenetic regulation plays important roles 
in cell state transition. We aimed to investigate the sex-specific epigenetic 
basis of hepatic cystogenesis and to develop therapeutic strategies targeting 
epigenetic modifications for PLD treatment.
METHODS: Normal and cystic primary cholangiocytes were isolated from wild-type 
and PLD mice of both sexes. Chromatin states were characterized by analyzing 
chromatin accessibility (ATAC sequencing) and multiple histone modifications 
(chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing). Differential gene expression was 
determined by transcriptomic analysis (RNA sequencing). Pharmacologic inhibition 
of epigenetic modifying enzymes was undertaken in PLD model mice.
RESULTS: Through genome-wide profiling of chromatin dynamics, we revealed a 
profound increase of global chromatin accessibility during cystogenesis in both 
male and female PLD cholangiocytes. We identified a switch from H3K9me3 to 
H3K9ac on cis-regulatory DNA elements of cyst-associated genes and showed that 
inhibition of H3K9ac acetyltransferase or H3K9me3 demethylase slowed cyst growth 
in male, but not female, PLD mice. In contrast, we found that H3K27ac was 
specifically increased in female PLD mice and that genes associated with 
H3K27ac-gained regions were enriched for cyst-related pathways. In an integrated 
epigenomic and transcriptomic analysis, we identified an estrogen receptor 
alpha-centered transcription factor network associated with the 
H3K27ac-regulated cystogenic gene expression program in female PLD mice.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the multi-layered sex-specific epigenetic 
dynamics underlying cholangiocyte state transition and reveal a potential 
epigenetic therapeutic strategy for male PLD patients.
IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS: In the present study, we elucidate a sex-specific 
epigenetic mechanism underlying the cholangiocyte state transition during 
hepatic cystogenesis and identify epigenetic drugs that effectively slow cyst 
growth in male PLD mice. These findings underscore the importance of sex 
difference in the pathogenesis of PLD and may guide researchers and physicians 
to develop sex-specific personalized approaches for PLD treatment.

Profiling combinations of histone modifications identifies gene regulatory 
elements in different states and discovers features controlling transcriptional 
and epigenetic programs. However, efforts to map chromatin states in complex, 
heterogeneous samples are hindered by the lack of methods that can profile 
multiple histone modifications together with transcriptomes in individual cells. 
Here, we describe single-cell multitargets and mRNA sequencing (scMTR-seq), a 
high-throughput method that enables simultaneous profiling of six histone 
modifications and transcriptome in single cells. We apply scMTR-seq to uncover 
dynamic and coordinated changes in chromatin states and transcriptomes during 
human endoderm differentiation. We also use scMTR-seq to produce 
lineage-resolved chromatin maps and gene regulatory networks in mouse 
blastocysts, revealing epigenetic asymmetries at gene regulatory regions between 
the three embryo lineages and identifying Trps1 as a potential repressor in 
epiblast cells of trophectoderm-associated enhancer networks and their target 
genes. Together, scMTR-seq enables investigation of combinatorial chromatin 
landscapes in a broad range of heterogeneous samples, providing insights into 
epigenetic regulatory systems.

Regulatory elements, particularly enhancers, play a crucial role in disease 
susceptibility and progression. Enhancers are DNA sequences that activate gene 
expression and can be affected by epigenetic modifications, interactions with 
transcription factors (TFs) or changes to the enhancer DNA sequence itself. 
Altered enhancer activity impacts gene expression and contributes to disease. In 
this review, we define enhancers and the experimental techniques used to 
identify and characterize them. We also discuss recent studies that examine how 
enhancers contribute to atopic dermatitis (AD) and psoriasis. Articles in the 
PubMed database were identified (from 1 January 2010 to 28 February 2023) that 
were relevant to enhancer variants, enhancer-associated TFs and enhancer histone 
modifications in psoriasis or AD. Most enhancers associated with these 
conditions regulate genes affecting epidermal homeostasis or immune function. 
These discoveries present potential therapeutic targets to complement existing 
treatment options for AD and psoriasis.

Cancer progression is strongly affected by epigenetic events in addition to 
genetic modifications. One of the key elements in the epigenetic control of gene 
expression is histone modification through acetylation, which is regulated by 
the synergy between histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases 
(HDACs). HDACs are thought to offer considerable potential for the development 
of anticancer medications, particularly when used in conjunction with other 
anticancer medications and/or radiotherapy. Belinostat (Beleodaq, PXD101) is a 
pan-HDAC unsaturated hydroxamate inhibitor with a sulfonamide group that has 
been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment 
of refractory or relapsed peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) and solid 
malignancies or and other hematological tissues. This drug modifies histones and 
epigenetic pathways. Because HDAC and HAT imbalance can lead to downregulation 
of regulatory genes, resulting in tumorigenesis. Inhibition of HDACs by 
belinostat indirectly promotes anti-cancer therapeutic effect by provoking 
acetylated histone accumulation, re-establishing normal gene expressions in 
cancer cells and stimulating other routes such as the immune response, p27 
signaling cascades, caspase 3 activation, nuclear protein poly (ADP-ribose) 
polymerase-1 (PARP-1) degradation, cyclin A (G2/M phase), cyclin E1 (G1/S phase) 
and other events. In addition, belinostat has already been discovered to 
increase p21WAF1 in a number of cell lines (melanoma, prostate, breast, lung, 
colon, and ovary). This cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor actually has a role in 
processes that cause cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Belinostat's clinical 
effectiveness, comprising Phase I and II studies within the areas of solid and 
hematological cancers, has been evidenced through several investigative trials 
that have supported its potential to be a valuable anti-cancer drug. The purpose 
of this research was to provide insight on the specific molecular processes 
through which belinostat inhibits HDAC. The ability to investigate new 
therapeutic options employing targeted therapy and acquire a deeper 
understanding of cancer cell abnormalities may result from a better 
understanding of these particular routes.

Transitions in gene regulatory processes responsible for the emergence of 
specialized cell types and spatiotemporal regulation of developmental signaling 
prior to the divergence of Cnidaria and Bilateria are poorly understood. As a 
sister group of Bilateria, the phylum Cnidaria can provide significant insights 
into these processes. Among the cnidarians, hydrae have been studied for >250 
years to comprehend the mechanisms underlying their unique immortality and 
robust regenerative capacity. Studies on Hydra spp. and other pre-bilaterians 
alike have advanced our understanding of the evolutionary underpinnings 
governing eumetazoan tissue development, homeostasis, and regeneration. In 
addition to its regenerative potential, Hydra exhibits continuously active axial 
patterning due to its peculiar tissue dynamics. These distinctive physiological 
processes necessitate large scale gene expression changes that are governed by 
the multitude of epigenetic mechanisms operating in cells. This review 
highlights the contemporary knowledge of epigenetic regulation in Hydra with 
contemporary studies from other members of Cnidaria, as well as the interplay 
between regulatory mechanisms wherever demonstrated. The studies covered in the 
scope of this review reveal both ancestral and divergent roles played by 
conserved epigenetic mechanisms with emphasis on transcriptional regulation. 
Additionally, single-cell transcriptomics data was mined to predict the 
physiological relevance of putative gene regulatory components, which is in 
agreement with published findings and yielded insights into the possible 
functions of the gene regulatory mechanisms that are yet to be deciphered in 
Hydra, such as DNA methylation. Finally, we delineate potentially rewarding 
epigenetics research avenues that can further leverage the unique biology of 
Hydra.

During organism development, a diversity of cell types emerges with disparate, 
yet stable profiles of gene expression with distinctive cellular functions. In 
addition to gene promoters, the genome contains enhancer regulatory sequences, 
which are implicated in cellular specialization by facilitating cell-type and 
tissue-specific gene expression. Enhancers are DNA binding elements 
characterized by highly sophisticated and various mechanisms of action allowing 
for the specific interaction of general and tissue-specific transcription 
factors (TFs). However, eukaryotic organisms package their genetic material into 
chromatin, generating a physical barrier for TFs to interact with their cognate 
sequences. The ability of TFs to bind DNA regulatory elements is also modulated 
by changes in the chromatin structure, including histone modifications, histone 
variants, ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling, and the methylation status of DNA. 
Furthermore, it has recently been revealed that enhancer sequences are also 
transcribed into a set of enhancer RNAs with regulatory potential. These 
interdependent processes act in the context of a complex network of chromatin 
interactions, which together contributes to a renewed vision of how gene 
activation is coordinated in a cell-type-dependent manner. In this review, we 
describe the interplay between genetic and epigenetic aspects associated with 
enhancers and discuss their possible roles on enhancer function.

NASH is characterized by hepatic lipid accumulation and inflammation; and 
JMJD2B-a histone demethylase-upregulation has been linked to its progression. 
Pirfenidone (PFD) is an antifibrotic agent with anti-inflammatory and 
antioxidant effects recognized to decrease NASH symptoms. Herein, our aim was to 
investigate PFD-induced epigenetics mechanisms involving JMJD2B and histone 
modifications in experimental NASH. Male C57BL/6J mice were fed with normo-diet, 
or high fat/carbohydrate diet (HF) for 16 weeks. A HF-subgroup was treated with 
PFD 300 mg/kg/d from week 8th to the end of protocol. Insulin tolerance test and 
liver and fat histological and biochemical analyses were carried out. Hepatic 
transcriptome was examined. Liver proteins were studied by western blot (WB) and 
Chromatin immunoprecipitation. In vitro, lipotoxicity was induced in HepG2 cells 
and proteins were evaluated using WB. Molecular docking was used to explore 
binding of PFD to JMJD2B. Mice treated with PFD reduced weight gain, epididymal 
fat and inflammatory nodules, and steatosis in liver tissue, as well as, 
improved biochemical test. PFD modified the expression of Jmjd2b, Pparg, Fasn 
and Srebp1, and restored JMJD2B protein and H3K9me3 repressive mark, both in 
animal and cell models. PFD increased hepatic enrichment of H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 
at the promoter region of Fasn and Srebp1, and Pparg. In HepG2 cells, PFD 
reduced lipid vacuole accumulation. In silico, PFD interacted with JMJD2B 
catalytic site. PFD is an epigenetic regulator modifying JMJD2B activity, 
resulting in reduced NASH traits.

T-cell identity and epigenetic memory.

T-cell development endows cells with a flexible range of effector 
differentiation options, superimposed on a stable core of lineage-specific gene 
expression that is maintained while access to alternative hematopoietic lineages 
is permanently renounced. This combination of features could be explained by 
environmentally responsive transcription factor mobilization overlaying an 
epigenetically stabilized base gene expression state. For example, "poising" of 
promoters could offer preferential access to T-cell genes, while repressive 
histone modifications and DNA methylation of non-T regulatory genes could be 
responsible for keeping non-T developmental options closed. Here, we critically 
review the evidence for the actual deployment of epigenetic marking to support 
the stable aspects of T-cell identity. Much of epigenetic marking is dynamically 
maintained or subject to rapid modification by local action of transcription 
factors. Repressive histone marks are used in gene-specific ways that do not fit 
a simple, developmental lineage-exclusion hierarchy. We argue that epigenetic 
analysis may achieve its greatest impact for illuminating regulatory biology 
when it is used to locate cis-regulatory elements by catching them in the act of 
mediating regulatory change.

The binding of multiple transcription factors (TFs) to genomic enhancers drives 
gene expression in mammalian cells1. However, the molecular details that link 
enhancer sequence to TF binding, promoter state and transcription levels remain 
unclear. Here we applied single-molecule footprinting2,3 to measure the 
simultaneous occupancy of TFs, nucleosomes and other regulatory proteins on 
engineered enhancer-promoter constructs with variable numbers of TF binding 
sites for both a synthetic TF and an endogenous TF involved in the type I 
interferon response. Although TF binding events on nucleosome-free DNA are 
independent, activation domains recruit cofactors that destabilize nucleosomes, 
driving observed TF binding cooperativity. Average TF occupancy linearly 
determines promoter activity, and we decompose TF strength into separable 
binding and activation terms. Finally, we develop thermodynamic and kinetic 
models that quantitatively predict both the enhancer binding microstates and 
gene expression dynamics. This work provides a template for the quantitative 
dissection of distinct contributors to gene expression, including TF activation 
domains, concentration, binding affinity, binding site configuration and 
recruitment of chromatin regulators.

Transcription of genes is regulated by DNA elements such as promoters and 
enhancers, the activity of which are in turn controlled by many transcription 
factors. Owing to the highly complex combinatorial logic involved, it has been 
difficult to construct computational models that predict gene activity from DNA 
sequence. Recent advances in deep learning techniques applied to data from 
epigenome mapping and high-throughput reporter assays have made substantial 
progress towards addressing this complexity. Such models can capture the 
regulatory grammar with remarkable accuracy and show great promise in predicting 
the effects of non-coding variants, uncovering detailed molecular mechanisms of 
gene regulation and designing synthetic regulatory elements for biotechnology. 
Here, we discuss the principles of these approaches, the types of training data 
sets that are available and the strengths and limitations of different 
approaches.

The enhancer is a DNA sequence that can increase the activity of promoters and 
thus speed up the frequency of gene transcription. The enhancer plays an 
essential role in activating gene expression. Currently, gene sequencing 
technology has been developed for 30 years from the first generation to the 
third generation, and a variety of biological sequence data have increased 
significantly every year. Due to the importance of enhancer functions, it is 
very expensive to identify enhancers through biochemical experiments. Therefore, 
we need to study new methods for the identification and classification of 
enhancers. Based on the K-mer principle this study proposed a feature extraction 
method that others have not used in convolutional neural networks. Then, we 
combined it with one-hot encoding to build an efficient one-dimensional 
convolutional neural network ensemble model for predicting enhancers and their 
strengths. Finally, we used five commonly used classification problem evaluation 
indicators to compare with the models proposed by other researchers. The model 
proposed in this paper has a better performance by using the same independent 
test dataset as other models.

BACKGROUND: Fermentation processes are essential for the production of small 
molecules, heterologous proteins and other commercially important products. 
Traditional bioprocess optimisation relies on phenomenological models that focus 
on macroscale variables like biomass growth and protein yield. However, these 
models often fail to consider the crucial link between macroscale dynamics and 
the intracellular activities that drive metabolism and proteins synthesis.
RESULTS: We introduce a multiscale model that not only captures batch bioreactor 
dynamics but also incorporates a coarse-grained approach to key intracellular 
processes such as gene expression, ribosome allocation and growth. Our model 
accurately fits biomass and substrate data across various Escherichia coli 
strains, effectively predicts acetate dynamics and evaluates the expression of 
heterologous proteins. By integrating construct-specific parameters like 
promoter strength and ribosomal binding sites, our model reveals several key 
interdependencies between gene expression parameters and outputs such as protein 
yield and acetate secretion.
CONCLUSIONS: This study presents a computational model that, with proper 
parameterisation, allows for the in silico analysis of genetic constructs. The 
focus is on combinations of ribosomal binding site (RBS) strength and promoters, 
assessing their impact on production. In this way, the ability to predict 
bioreactor dynamics from these genetic constructs can pave the way for more 
efficient design and optimisation of microbial fermentation processes, enhancing 
the production of valuable bioproducts.

Targeted engineering of plant gene expression holds great promise for ensuring 
food security and for producing biopharmaceuticals in plants. However, this 
engineering requires thorough knowledge of cis-regulatory elements to precisely 
control either endogenous or introduced genes. To generate this knowledge, we 
used a massively parallel reporter assay to measure the activity of nearly 
complete sets of promoters from Arabidopsis, maize and sorghum. We demonstrate 
that core promoter elements-notably the TATA box-as well as promoter GC content 
and promoter-proximal transcription factor binding sites influence promoter 
strength. By performing the experiments in two assay systems, leaves of the 
dicot tobacco and protoplasts of the monocot maize, we detect species-specific 
differences in the contributions of GC content and transcription factors to 
promoter strength. Using these observations, we built computational models to 
predict promoter strength in both assay systems, allowing us to design highly 
active promoters comparable in activity to the viral 35S minimal promoter. Our 
results establish a promising experimental approach to optimize native promoter 
elements and generate synthetic ones with desirable features.

The binding of multiple transcription factors (TFs) to genomic enhancers 
activates gene expression in mammalian cells. However, the molecular details 
that link enhancer sequence to TF binding, promoter state, and gene expression 
levels remain opaque. We applied single-molecule footprinting (SMF) to measure 
the simultaneous occupancy of TFs, nucleosomes, and components of the 
transcription machinery on engineered enhancer/promoter constructs with variable 
numbers of TF binding sites for both a synthetic and an endogenous TF. We find 
that activation domains enhance a TF's capacity to compete with nucleosomes for 
binding to DNA in a BAF-dependent manner, TF binding on nucleosome-free DNA is 
consistent with independent binding between TFs, and average TF occupancy 
linearly contributes to promoter activation rates. We also decompose TF strength 
into separable binding and activation terms, which can be tuned and perturbed 
independently. Finally, we develop thermodynamic and kinetic models that 
quantitatively predict both the binding microstates observed at the enhancer and 
subsequent time-dependent gene expression. This work provides a template for 
quantitative dissection of distinct contributors to gene activation, including 
the activity of chromatin remodelers, TF activation domains, chromatin 
acetylation, TF concentration, TF binding affinity, and TF binding site 
configuration.

Transcriptional regulation is tightly coupled with chromosomal positioning and 
three-dimensional chromatin architecture. However, it is unclear what proportion 
of transcriptional activity is reflecting such organisation, how much can be 
informed by RNA expression alone and how this impacts disease. Here, we develop 
a computational transcriptional decomposition approach separating the proportion 
of expression associated with genome organisation from independent effects not 
directly related to genomic positioning. We show that positionally attributable 
expression accounts for a considerable proportion of total levels and is highly 
informative of topological associating domain activities and organisation, 
revealing boundaries and chromatin compartments. Furthermore, expression data 
alone accurately predict individual enhancer-promoter interactions, drawing 
features from expression strength, stabilities, insulation and distance. We 
characterise predictions in 76 human cell types, observing extensive sharing of 
domains, yet highly cell-type-specific enhancer-promoter interactions and strong 
enrichments in relevant trait-associated variants. Overall, our work 
demonstrates a close relationship between transcription and chromatin 
architecture.

BACKGROUND: LRRK2 mutations and risk variants increase susceptibility to 
inherited and idiopathic Parkinson's disease, while recent studies have 
identified potential protective variants. This, and the fact that LRRK2 mutation 
carriers develop symptoms and brain pathology almost indistinguishable from 
idiopathic Parkinson's disease, has led to enormous interest in this protein. 
LRRK2 has been implicated in a range of cellular events, but key among them is 
canonical Wnt signalling, which results in increased levels of transcriptionally 
active β-catenin. This pathway is critical for the development and survival of 
the midbrain dopaminergic neurones typically lost in Parkinson's disease.
METHODS: Here we use Lrrk2 knockout mice and fibroblasts to investigate the 
effect of loss of Lrrk2 on canonical Wnt signalling in vitro and in vivo. 
Micro-computed tomography was used to study predicted tibial strength, while 
pulldown assays were employed to measure brain β-catenin levels. A combination 
of luciferase assays, immunofluorescence and co-immunoprecipitation were 
performed to measure canonical Wnt activity and investigate the relationship 
between LRRK2 and β-catenin. TOPflash assays are also used to study the effects 
of LRRK2 kinase inhibition and pathogenic and protective LRRK2 mutations on Wnt 
signalling. Data were tested by Analysis of Variance.
RESULTS: Loss of Lrrk2 causes a dose-dependent increase in the levels of 
transcriptionally active β-catenin in the brain, and alters tibial bone 
architecture, decreasing the predicted risk of fracture. Lrrk2 knockout cells 
display increased TOPflash and Axin2 promoter activities, both basally and 
following Wnt activation. Consistently, over-expressed LRRK2 was found to bind 
β-catenin and repress TOPflash activation. Some pathogenic LRRK2 mutations and 
risk variants further suppressed TOPflash, whereas the protective R1398H variant 
increased Wnt signalling activity. LRRK2 kinase inhibitors affected canonical 
Wnt signalling differently due to off-targeting; however, specific LRRK2 
inhibition reduced canonical Wnt signalling similarly to pathogenic mutations.
CONCLUSIONS: Loss of LRRK2 causes increased canonical Wnt activity in vitro and 
in vivo. In agreement, over-expressed LRRK2 binds and represses β-catenin, 
suggesting LRRK2 may act as part of the β-catenin destruction complex. Since 
some pathogenic LRRK2 mutations enhance this effect while the protective R1398H 
variant relieves it, our data strengthen the notion that decreased canonical Wnt 
activity is central to Parkinson's disease pathogenesis.

The precise molecular mechanisms by which urate-associated genetic variants 
affect urate levels are unknown. Here, we tested for functional linkage of the 
maximally associated genetic variant rs1967017 at the PDZK1 locus to elevated 
PDZK1 expression. We performed expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and 
likelihood analyses and gene expression assays. Zebrafish were used to evaluate 
tissue-specific gene expression. Luciferase assays in HEK293 and HepG2 cells 
measured the effect of rs1967017 on transcription amplitude. Probabilistic 
Annotation Integrator analysis revealed rs1967017 as most likely to be causal 
and rs1967017 was an eQTL for PDZK1 in the intestine. The region harboring 
rs1967017 was capable of directly driving green fluorescent protein expression 
in the kidney, liver and intestine of zebrafish embryos, consistent with a 
conserved ability to confer tissue-specific expression. Small interfering RNA 
depletion of HNF4A reduced endogenous PDZK1 expression in HepG2 cells. 
Luciferase assays showed that the T allele of rs1967017 gains enhancer activity 
relative to the urate-decreasing C allele, with T allele enhancer activity 
abrogated by HNF4A depletion. HNF4A physically binds the rs1967017 region, 
suggesting direct transcriptional regulation of PDZK1 by HNF4A. Computational 
prediction of increased motif strength, together with our functional assays, 
suggests that the urate-increasing T allele of rs1967017 strengthens a binding 
site for the transcription factor HNF4A. Our and other data predict that the 
urate-raising T allele of rs1967017 enhances HNF4A binding to the PDZK1 
promoter, thereby increasing PDZK1 expression. As PDZK1 is a scaffold protein 
for many ion channel transporters, increased expression can be predicted to 
increase activity of urate transporters and alter excretion of urate.

Genome-wide chromatin annotations have permitted the mapping of putative 
regulatory elements across multiple human cell types. However, their 
experimental dissection by directed regulatory motif disruption has remained 
unfeasible at the genome scale. Here, we use a massively parallel reporter assay 
(MPRA) to measure the transcriptional levels induced by 145-bp DNA segments 
centered on evolutionarily conserved regulatory motif instances within enhancer 
chromatin states. We select five predicted activators (HNF1, HNF4, FOXA, GATA, 
NFE2L2) and two predicted repressors (GFI1, ZFP161) and measure reporter 
expression in erythroleukemia (K562) and liver carcinoma (HepG2) cell lines. We 
test 2104 wild-type sequences and 3314 engineered enhancer variants containing 
targeted motif disruptions, each using 10 barcode tags and two replicates. The 
resulting data strongly confirm the enhancer activity and cell-type specificity 
of enhancer chromatin states, the ability of 145-bp segments to recapitulate 
both, the necessary role of regulatory motifs in enhancer function, and the 
complementary roles of activator and repressor motifs. We find statistically 
robust evidence that (1) disrupting the predicted activator motifs abolishes 
enhancer function, while silent or motif-improving changes maintain enhancer 
activity; (2) evolutionary conservation, nucleosome exclusion, binding of other 
factors, and strength of the motif match are predictive of enhancer activity; 
(3) scrambling repressor motifs leads to aberrant reporter expression in cell 
lines where the enhancers are usually inactive. Our results suggest a general 
strategy for deciphering cis-regulatory elements by systematic large-scale 
manipulation and provide quantitative enhancer activity measurements across 
thousands of constructs that can be mined to develop predictive models of gene 
expression.

MOTIVATION: NGS techniques have been widely applied in genetic and epigenetic 
studies. Multiple ChIP-seq and RNA-seq profiles can now be jointly used to infer 
functional regulatory networks (FRNs). However, existing methods suffer from 
either oversimplified assumption on transcription factor (TF) regulation or slow 
convergence of sampling for FRN inference from large-scale ChIP-seq and 
time-course RNA-seq data.
RESULTS: We developed an efficient Bayesian integration method (CRNET) for FRN 
inference using a two-stage Gibbs sampler to estimate iteratively hidden TF 
activities and the posterior probabilities of binding events. A novel statistic 
measure that jointly considers regulation strength and regression error enables 
the sampling process of CRNET to converge quickly, thus making CRNET very 
efficient for large-scale FRN inference. Experiments on synthetic and benchmark 
data showed a significantly improved performance of CRNET when compared with 
existing methods. CRNET was applied to breast cancer data to identify FRNs 
functional at promoter or enhancer regions in breast cancer MCF-7 cells. 
Transcription factor MYC is predicted as a key functional factor in both 
promoter and enhancer FRNs. We experimentally validated the regulation effects 
of MYC on CRNET-predicted target genes using appropriate RNAi approaches in 
MCF-7 cells.

The artificial design and high-throughput screening (HTS) of synthetic yeast 
promoters are crucial for gene expression and metabolite biosynthesis in 
synthetic biology. It is essential to expand the screening scope and enhance the 
product identification in promoter engineering. Here, we develop a branch 
convolutional neural network (B-CNN), learning the sequence composition and 
structural properties of natural promoters, to comprehensively predict their 
relative strength and redesign the core region. It is combined with a genetic 
algorithm to identify mutant regions/sites of the alcohol oxidase 1 promoter 
(PAOX1) from Pichia pastoris (P. pastoris). Consecutive fluorescent recognition 
and automatic sorting of the GFP-expressing library of core PAOX1 were finished 
in a laboratory-designed microfluidic fluorescence-activated cell sorting 
(μFACS) system. The rigid μFACS chip was fabricated, achieving single-cell 
sorting and meeting the requirement of complicated sterilization with reduced 
volumes and improved cell throughput (7000 cells/s). After extensive exploration 
of the sorting parameters, P. pastoris with high-intensity PAOX1 (5.3× 
improvement) was successfully screened and validated by a microplate reader. The 
mutant PAOX1 was further applied for the biosynthesis of PD-L1-specific protein 
with a 30% increase in production, proving its effectiveness and feasibility. 
This study provided novel insights into the rational design and HTS of yeast 
functional components with enhanced performance.

It is crucial to understand the transcription mechanisms of miRNAs, especially 
considering the presence of peptides encoded by miRNAs. Since promoters function 
as the switch for gene transcription, precisely identifying these regions is 
essential for fully annotating miRNA transcripts. Nonetheless, existing 
computational methods still have room for improvement in the characterization of 
promoter regions. Here, we present PmiProPred, an advanced tool designed for 
predicting plant miRNA promoters from a wide spectrum of genomes. It consists of 
two core components: multi-stream deep feature extraction (MsDFE) and 
multi-stream deep feature refinement (MsDFR). The MsDFE utilizes Transformer and 
CNN to gather multi-view features, while the MsDFR focuses on aligning and 
refining them using channel and spatial attention mechanisms. Ultimately, a 
multi-layer perceptron is employed to accomplish the miRNA promoter 
identification task. Across three independent testing datasets, PmiProPred 
achieves accuracies of 94.630%, 96.659%, and 92.480%, respectively, 
substantially surpassing the latest methods. Additionally, PmiProPred is 
employed to identify potential core promoters in the upstream 2-kb regions of 
intergenic miRNAs in five plant species. We further conduct cis-regulatory 
elements mining on the predicted promoters and perform an in-depth analysis of 
the identified motifs. Altogether, PmiProPred is a robust and effective tool for 
discovering plant miRNA promoters.

Massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) functionally screen thousands of 
sequences for regulatory activity in parallel. To date, there are limited 
studies that systematically compare differences in MPRA design. Here, we screen 
a library of 2,440 candidate liver enhancers and controls for regulatory 
activity in HepG2 cells using nine different MPRA designs. We identify subtle 
but significant differences that correlate with epigenetic and sequence-level 
features, as well as differences in dynamic range and reproducibility. We also 
validate that enhancer activity is largely independent of orientation, at least 
for our library and designs. Finally, we assemble and test the same enhancers as 
192-mers, 354-mers and 678-mers and observe sizable differences. This work 
provides a framework for the experimental design of high-throughput reporter 
assays, suggesting that the extended sequence context of tested elements and to 
a lesser degree the precise assay, influence MPRA results.

Massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) can simultaneously measure the 
function of thousands of candidate regulatory sequences (CRSs) in a quantitative 
manner. In this method, CRSs are cloned upstream of a minimal promoter and 
reporter gene, alongside a unique barcode, and introduced into cells. If the CRS 
is a functional regulatory element, it will lead to the transcription of the 
barcode sequence, which is measured via RNA sequencing and normalized for 
cellular integration via DNA sequencing of the barcode. This technology has been 
used to test thousands of sequences and their variants for regulatory activity, 
to decipher the regulatory code and its evolution, and to develop genetic 
switches. Lentivirus-based MPRA (lentiMPRA) produces 'in-genome' readouts and 
enables the use of this technique in hard-to-transfect cells. Here, we provide a 
detailed protocol for lentiMPRA, along with a user-friendly Nextflow-based 
computational pipeline-MPRAflow-for quantifying CRS activity from different MPRA 
designs. The lentiMPRA protocol takes ~2 months, which includes sequencing 
turnaround time and data processing with MPRAflow.

Cis-regulatory elements (CREs) control gene expression, orchestrating tissue 
identity, developmental timing and stimulus responses, which collectively define 
the thousands of unique cell types in the body1-3. While there is great 
potential for strategically incorporating CREs in therapeutic or biotechnology 
applications that require tissue specificity, there is no guarantee that an 
optimal CRE for these intended purposes has arisen naturally. Here we present a 
platform to engineer and validate synthetic CREs capable of driving gene 
expression with programmed cell-type specificity. We take advantage of 
innovations in deep neural network modelling of CRE activity across three cell 
types, efficient in silico optimization and massively parallel reporter assays 
to design and empirically test thousands of CREs4-8. Through large-scale in 
vitro validation, we show that synthetic sequences are more effective at driving 
cell-type-specific expression in three cell lines compared with natural 
sequences from the human genome and achieve specificity in analogous tissues 
when tested in vivo. Synthetic sequences exhibit distinct motif vocabulary 
associated with activity in the on-target cell type and a simultaneous reduction 
in the activity of off-target cells. Together, we provide a generalizable 
framework to prospectively engineer CREs from massively parallel reporter assay 
models and demonstrate the required literacy to write fit-for-purpose regulatory 
code.

A growing number of variants associated with risk for neurodevelopmental 
disorders have been identified by genome-wide association and whole genome 
sequencing studies. As common risk variants often fall within large haplotype 
blocks covering long stretches of the noncoding genome, the causal variants 
within an associated locus are often unknown. Similarly, the effect of rare 
noncoding risk variants identified by whole genome sequencing on molecular 
traits is seldom known without functional assays. A massively parallel reporter 
assay (MPRA) is an assay that can functionally validate thousands of regulatory 
elements simultaneously using high-throughput sequencing and barcode technology. 
MPRA has been adapted to various experimental designs that measure gene 
regulatory effects of genetic variants within cis- and trans-regulatory elements 
as well as posttranscriptional processes. This review discusses different MPRA 
designs that have been or could be used in the future to experimentally validate 
genetic variants associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. Though MPRA has 
limitations such as it does not model genomic context, this assay can help 
narrow down the underlying genetic causes of neurodevelopmental disorders by 
screening thousands of sequences in one experiment. We conclude by describing 
future directions of this technique such as applications of MPRA for 
gene-by-environment interactions and pharmacogenetics.

The rapid improvement of descriptive genomic technologies has fueled a dramatic 
increase in hypothesized connections between cardiovascular gene expression and 
phenotypes. However, in vivo testing of these hypotheses has predominantly been 
relegated to slow, expensive, and linear generation of genetically modified 
mice. In the study of genomic cis-regulatory elements, generation of mice 
featuring transgenic reporters or cis-regulatory element knockout remains the 
standard approach. While the data obtained is of high quality, the approach is 
insufficient to keep pace with candidate identification and therefore results in 
biases introduced during the selection of candidates for validation. However, 
recent advances across a range of disciplines are converging to enable 
functional genomic assays that can be conducted in a high-throughput manner. 
Here, we review one such method, massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs), in 
which the activities of thousands of candidate genomic regulatory elements are 
simultaneously assessed via the next-generation sequencing of a barcoded 
reporter transcript. We discuss best practices for MPRA design and use, with a 
focus on practical considerations, and review how this emerging technology has 
been successfully deployed in vivo. Finally, we discuss how MPRAs are likely to 
evolve and be used in future cardiovascular research.

Massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) represent a set of high-throughput 
technologies that measure the functional effects of thousands of 
sequences/variants on gene regulatory activity. There are several different 
variations of MPRA technology and they are used for numerous applications, 
including regulatory element discovery, variant effect measurement, saturation 
mutagenesis, synthetic regulatory element generation or characterization of 
evolutionary gene regulatory differences. Despite their many designs and uses, 
there is no comprehensive database that incorporates the results of these 
experiments. To address this, we developed MPRAbase, a manually curated database 
that currently harbors 129 experiments, encompassing 17,718,677 elements tested 
across 35 cell types and 4 organisms. The MPRAbase web interface 
(http://www.mprabase.com) serves as a centralized user-friendly repository to 
download existing MPRA data for independent analysis and is designed with the 
ability to allow researchers to share their published data for rapid 
dissemination to the community.

Massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) represent a set of high-throughput 
technologies that measure the functional effects of thousands of 
sequences/variants on gene regulatory activity. There are several different 
variations of MPRA technology and they are used for numerous applications, 
including regulatory element discovery, variant effect measurement, saturation 
mutagenesis, synthetic regulatory element generation or characterization of 
evolutionary gene regulatory differences. Despite their many designs and uses, 
there is no comprehensive database that incorporates the results of these 
experiments. To address this, we developed MPRAbase, a manually curated database 
that currently harbors 130 experiments, encompassing 17,718,677 elements tested 
across 35 cell types and 4 organisms. The MPRAbase web interface serves as a 
centralized user-friendly repository to examine online the activity of 
regulatory elements across cell types and organisms, and to download MPRA data 
for independent analysis.

Deciphering the potential of noncoding loci to influence gene regulation has 
been the subject of intense research, with important implications in 
understanding genetic underpinnings of human diseases. Massively parallel 
reporter assays (MPRAs) can measure regulatory activity of thousands of DNA 
sequences and their variants in a single experiment. With increasing number of 
publically available MPRA data sets, one can now develop data-driven models 
which, given a DNA sequence, predict its regulatory activity. Here, we performed 
a comprehensive meta-analysis of several MPRA data sets in a variety of cellular 
contexts. We first applied an ensemble of methods to predict MPRA output in each 
context and observed that the most predictive features are consistent across 
data sets. We then demonstrate that predictive models trained in one cellular 
context can be used to predict MPRA output in another, with loss of accuracy 
attributed to cell-type-specific features. Finally, we show that our approach 
achieves top performance in the Fifth Critical Assessment of Genome 
Interpretation "Regulation Saturation" Challenge for predicting effects of 
single-nucleotide variants. Overall, our analysis provides insights into how 
MPRA data can be leveraged to highlight functional regulatory regions throughout 
the genome and can guide effective design of future experiments by better 
prioritizing regions of interest.

experiments.

MOTIVATION: With the rapid advances in DNA synthesis and sequencing technologies 
and the continuing decline in the associated costs, high-throughput experiments 
can be performed to investigate the regulatory role of thousands of 
oligonucleotide sequences simultaneously. Nevertheless, designing 
high-throughput reporter assay experiments such as massively parallel reporter 
assays (MPRAs) and similar methods remains challenging.
RESULTS: We introduce MPRAnator, a set of tools that facilitate rapid design of 
MPRA experiments. With MPRA Motif design, a set of variables provides fine 
control of how motifs are placed into sequences, thereby allowing the 
investigation of the rules that govern transcription factor (TF) occupancy. MPRA 
single-nucleotide polymorphism design can be used to systematically examine the 
functional effects of single or combinations of single-nucleotide polymorphisms 
at regulatory sequences. Finally, the Transmutation tool allows for the design 
of negative controls by permitting scrambling, reversing, complementing or 
introducing multiple random mutations in the input sequences or motifs.
AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: MPRAnator tool set is implemented in Python, 
Perl and Javascript and is freely available at www.genomegeek.com and 
www.sanger.ac.uk/science/tools/mpranator The source code is available on 
www.github.com/hemberg-lab/MPRAnator/ under the MIT license. The REST API allows 
programmatic access to MPRAnator using simple URLs.

As researchers and clinicians seek to identify human genomic alterations 
relevant to traits and disorders, identifying and aggregating evidence providing 
mechanistic support for associations between alterations and phenotypes remains 
challenging. In particular, the study of non-coding genomic variation remains a 
major challenge due to the lack of accurate functional annotation for activity 
in a given context and across alleles. Experimental evidence is critical for 
prioritizing and interpreting functional effects of genetic alterations. 
Massively Parallel Reporter Assays (MPRAs) have emerged as a powerful 
high-throughput approach, enabling quantification of regulatory element activity 
and allelic effects, and systematic dissection of gene regulatory logic and 
variant effects across different contexts. However, the diversity of MPRA 
designs, lack of standardized formats, and many potential processing parameters 
hamper data integration, reproducibility, and meta-analyses across studies. To 
address these challenges, the Impact of Genomic Variation on Function (IGVF) 
Consortium established an MPRA focus group to develop community standards, 
including harmonized file formats, and robust analysis pipelines for a wide 
range of library types and experimental designs. Here, we present these formats 
and comprehensive computational tools, MPRAlib and MPRAsnakeflow, for uniform 
processing from raw sequencing reads to counts, processing and visualization. 
Using diverse MPRA datasets, we characterize technical variability sources 
including barcode sequence bias, outlier barcodes, and delivery method (episomal 
vs. lentiviral). Our results establish best practices for MPRA data generation 
and analysis, facilitating robust, reproducible research and large-scale 
integration. The presented tools and standards are publicly available, providing 
a foundation for future collaborative efforts in regulatory genomics.

Cis-regulatory elements (CREs) play a pivotal role in orchestrating interactions 
with trans-regulatory factors such as transcription factors, RNA-binding 
proteins, and noncoding RNAs. These interactions are fundamental to the 
molecular architecture underpinning complex and diverse biological functions in 
living organisms, facilitating a myriad of sophisticated and dynamic processes. 
The rapid advancement in the identification and characterization of these 
regulatory elements has been marked by initiatives such as the Encyclopedia of 
DNA Elements (ENCODE) project, which represents a significant milestone in the 
field. Concurrently, the development of CRE detection technologies, exemplified 
by massively parallel reporter assays, has progressed at an impressive pace, 
providing powerful tools for CRE discovery. The exponential growth of multimodal 
functional genomic data has necessitated the application of advanced analytical 
methods. Deep learning algorithms, particularly large language models, have 
emerged as invaluable tools for deconstructing the intricate nucleotide 
sequences governing CRE function. These advancements facilitate precise 
predictions of CRE activity and enable the de novo design of CREs. A deeper 
understanding of CRE operational dynamics is crucial for harnessing their 
versatile regulatory properties. Such insights are instrumental in refining gene 
therapy techniques, enhancing the efficacy of selective breeding programs, 
pushing the boundaries of genetic innovation, and opening new possibilities in 
microbial synthetic biology.

AU-rich elements (AREs) are 3' UTR cis-regulatory elements that regulate the 
stability of mRNAs. Consensus ARE motifs have been determined, but little is 
known about how differences in 3' UTR sequences that conform to these motifs 
affect their function. Here, we use functional annotation of sequences from 3' 
UTRs (fast-UTR), a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA), to investigate the 
effects of 41,288 3' UTR sequence fragments from 4653 transcripts on gene 
expression and mRNA stability in Jurkat and Beas2B cells. Our analyses 
demonstrate that the length of an ARE and its registration (the first and last 
nucleotides of the repeating ARE motif) have significant effects on gene 
expression and stability. Based on this finding, we propose improved ARE 
classification and concomitant methods to categorize and predict the effect of 
AREs on gene expression and stability. Finally, to investigate the advantages of 
our general experimental design we examine other motifs including constitutive 
decay elements (CDEs), where we show that the length of the CDE stem-loop has a 
significant impact on steady-state expression and mRNA stability. We conclude 
that fast-UTR, in conjunction with our analytical approach, can produce improved 
yet simple sequence-based rules for predicting the activity of human 3' UTRs.

The relationship between noncoding DNA sequence and gene expression is not 
well-understood. Massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs), which quantify the 
regulatory activity of large libraries of DNA sequences in parallel, are a 
powerful approach to characterize this relationship. We present MPRA-DragoNN, a 
convolutional neural network (CNN)-based framework to predict and interpret the 
regulatory activity of DNA sequences as measured by MPRAs. While our method is 
generally applicable to a variety of MPRA designs, here we trained our model on 
the Sharpr-MPRA dataset that measures the activity of ∼500,000 constructs tiling 
15,720 regulatory regions in human K562 and HepG2 cell lines. MPRA-DragoNN 
predictions were moderately correlated (Spearman ρ = 0.28) with measured 
activity and were within range of replicate concordance of the assay. 
State-of-the-art model interpretation methods revealed high-resolution 
predictive regulatory sequence features that overlapped transcription factor 
(TF) binding motifs. We used the model to investigate the cell type and 
chromatin state preferences of predictive TF motifs. We explored the ability of 
our model to predict the allelic effects of regulatory variants in an 
independent MPRA experiment and fine map putative functional SNPs in loci 
associated with lipid traits. Our results suggest that interpretable deep 
learning models trained on MPRA data have the potential to reveal meaningful 
patterns in regulatory DNA sequences and prioritize regulatory genetic variants, 
especially as larger, higher-quality datasets are produced.

In any given cell type, dozens of transcription factors (TFs) act in concert to 
control the activity of the genome by binding to specific DNA sequences in 
regulatory elements. Despite their considerable importance, we currently lack 
simple tools to directly measure the activity of many TFs in parallel. Massively 
parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) allow the detection of TF activities in a 
multiplexed fashion; however, we lack basic understanding to rationally design 
sensitive reporters for many TFs. Here, we use an MPRA to systematically 
optimize transcriptional reporters for 86 TFs and evaluate the specificity of 
all reporters across a wide array of TF perturbation conditions. We thus 
identified critical TF reporter design features and obtained highly sensitive 
and specific reporters for 62 TFs, many of which outperform available reporters. 
The resulting collection of "prime" TF reporters can be used to uncover TF 
regulatory networks and to illuminate signaling pathways. A record of this 
paper's transparent peer review process is included in the supplemental 
information.

Massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) are a high-throughput method for 
evaluating in vitro activities of thousands of candidate cis-regulatory elements 
(CREs). In these assays, candidate sequences are cloned upstream or downstream 
from a reporter gene tagged by unique DNA sequences. However, tag sequences may 
themselves affect reporter gene expression and lead to major potential biases in 
the measured cis-regulatory activity. Here, we present a sequence-based method 
for correcting tag-sequence-specific effects and show that our method can 
significantly reduce this source of variation and improve the identification of 
functional regulatory variants by MPRAs. We also show that our model captures 
sequence features associated with post-transcriptional regulation of mRNA. Thus, 
this new method helps not only to improve detection of regulatory signals in 
MPRA experiments but also to design better MPRA protocols.

Learning to read and write the transcriptional regulatory code is of central 
importance to progress in genetic analysis and engineering. Here we describe a 
massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) that facilitates the systematic 
dissection of transcriptional regulatory elements. In MPRA, 
microarray-synthesized DNA regulatory elements and unique sequence tags are 
cloned into plasmids to generate a library of reporter constructs. These 
constructs are transfected into cells and tag expression is assayed by 
high-throughput sequencing. We apply MPRA to compare >27,000 variants of two 
inducible enhancers in human cells: a synthetic cAMP-regulated enhancer and the 
virus-inducible interferon-β enhancer. We first show that the resulting data 
define accurate maps of functional transcription factor binding sites in both 
enhancers at single-nucleotide resolution. We then use the data to train 
quantitative sequence-activity models (QSAMs) of the two enhancers. We show that 
QSAMs from two cellular states can be combined to design enhancer variants that 
optimize potentially conflicting objectives, such as maximizing induced activity 
while minimizing basal activity.

Synthetic biology and deep learning synergistically revolutionize our ability 
for decoding and recoding DNA regulatory grammar. The B-cell-specific 
transcriptional regulation is intricate, and unlock the potential of 
B-cell-specific promoters as synthetic elements is important for B-cell 
engineering. Here, we designed and pooled synthesized 23 640 B-cell-specific 
promoters that exhibit larger sequence space, B-cell-specific expression, and 
enable diverse transcriptional patterns in B-cells. By MPRA (Massively parallel 
reporter assays), we deciphered the sequence features that regulate promoter 
transcriptional, including motifs and motif syntax (their combination and 
distance). Finally, we built and trained a deep learning model capable of 
predicting the transcriptional strength of the immunoglobulin V gene promoter 
directly from sequence. Prediction of thousands of promoter variants identified 
in the global human population shows that polymorphisms in promoters influence 
the transcription of immunoglobulin V genes, which may contribute to individual 
differences in adaptive humoral immune responses. Our work helps to decipher the 
transcription mechanism in immunoglobulin genes and offers thousands of 
non-similar promoters for B-cell engineering.

Negative regulatory elements (NREs) down-regulate gene expression by inhibiting 
the activities of promoters or enhancers. The repressing activity of NREs can be 
measured globally by massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs). However, most 
existing algorithms are designed for the statistical detection of positively 
enriched signals in MPRA datasets. To identify reduced signals in MPRA 
experiments, we designed a NRE identification program, fast-NR, by integrating 
the count and graphic features of sequenced reads to detect NREs using datasets 
generated by experiments of self-transcribing active regulatory region 
sequencing (STARR-seq). Fast-NR identified hundreds of silencers in human K562 
cells that can be validated by independent methods.

Noncoding DNA contains gene regulatory elements that alter gene expression, and 
the function of these elements can be modified by genetic variation. Massively 
parallel reporter assays (MPRA) enable high-throughput identification and 
characterization of functional genetic variants, but the statistical methods to 
identify allelic effects in MPRA data have not been fully developed. In this 
study, we demonstrate how the baseline allelic imbalance in MPRA libraries can 
produce biased results, and we propose a novel, nonparametric, adaptive testing 
method that is robust to this bias. We compare the performance of this method 
with other commonly used methods, and we demonstrate that our novel adaptive 
method controls Type I error in a wide range of scenarios while maintaining 
excellent power. We have implemented these tests along with routines for 
simulating MPRA data in the Analysis Toolset for MPRA (@MPRA), an R package for 
the design and analyses of MPRA experiments. It is publicly available at 
http://github.com/redaq/atMPRA.

BACKGROUND: Massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) are an experimental 
technology for measuring the activity of thousands of candidate regulatory 
sequences or their variants in parallel, where the activity of individual 
sequences is measured from pools of sequence-tagged reporter genes. Activity is 
derived from the ratio of transcribed RNA to input DNA counts of associated tag 
sequences in each reporter construct, so-called barcodes. Recently, tools 
specifically designed to analyze MPRA data were developed that attempt to model 
the count data, accounting for its inherent variation. Of these tools, 
MPRAnalyze and mpralm are most widely used. MPRAnalyze models barcode counts to 
estimate the transcription rate of each sequence. While it has increased 
statistical power and robustness against outliers compared to mpralm, it is slow 
and has a high false discovery rate. Mpralm, a tool built on the R package 
Limma, estimates log fold-changes between different sequences. As opposed to 
MPRAnalyze, it is fast and has a low false discovery rate but is susceptible to 
outliers and has less statistical power.
RESULTS: We propose BCalm, an MPRA analysis framework aimed at addressing the 
limitations of the existing tools. BCalm is an adaptation of mpralm, but models 
individual barcode counts instead of aggregating counts per sequence. Leaving 
out the aggregation step increases statistical power and improves robustness to 
outliers, while being fast and precise. We show the improved performance over 
existing methods on both simulated MPRA data and a lentiviral MPRA library of 
166,508 target sequences, including 82,258 allelic variants. Further, BCalm adds 
functionality beyond the existing mpralm package, such as preparing count input 
files from MPRAsnakeflow, as well as an option to test for sequences with 
enhancing or repressing activity. Its built-in plotting functionalities allow 
for easy interpretation of the results.
CONCLUSIONS: With BCalm, we provide a new tool for analyzing MPRA data which is 
robust and accurate on real MPRA datasets. The package is available at

MOTIVATION: Massively Parallel Reporter Assays (MPRAs) have emerged as pivotal 
tools for systematically profiling cis-regulatory element activity, playing 
critical roles in deciphering gene regulation mechanisms and synthetic 
regulatory element engineering. However, MPRA experiments involve multi-step 
library processing procedures coupled with high-throughput sequencing. 
Operational errors during these complex workflows can lead to substantial 
resource depletion and experimental delays. Thus robust and user-friendly 
quality control methods are essential to minimize experimental failures and 
ensure reproducibility between replicates.
RESULTS: Here, we present esMPRA, an integrated quality control and analysis 
pipeline designed for MPRA experiments. Building on our experience in MPRA and 
its derivative techniques, coupled with systematic analysis of public MPRA 
datasets, we established standardized quality control metrics and developed a 
stepwise quality monitoring framework. esMPRA generates stage-specific 
diagnostic reports and provides experimental recommendations to avoid potential 
risks throughout the workflow. Designed for maximal accessibility, esMPRA 
features a one-line command-line interface and requires minimal bioinformatics 
expertise. Beyond quality assessment, the pipeline delivers processed data 
outputs, comprehensive analysis reports, and interface files compatible with 
downstream analyses, establishing an end-to-end solution for MPRA 
experimentation.
AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: esMPRA is released as an open-source software 
under the MIT license. The source code for esMPRA is available on Zenodo (DOI: 
10.5281/zenodo.15362711) and GitHub (https://github.com/WangLabTHU/esMPRA/) for 
Linux, macOS, and Windows and is available via PyPI as esMPRA. Data for testing

The master tumor suppressor p53 controls transcription of a wide-ranging gene 
network involved in apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, DNA damage repair, and 
senescence. Recent studies revealed pervasive binding of p53 to cis-regulatory 
elements (CREs), which are non-coding segments of DNA that spatially and 
temporally control transcription through the combinatorial binding of local 
transcription factors. Although the role of p53 as a strong trans-activator of 
gene expression is well known, the co-regulatory factors and local sequences 
acting at p53-bound CREs are comparatively understudied. We designed and 
executed a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to investigate the effect of 
transcription factor binding motifs and local sequence context on p53-bound CRE 
activity. Our data indicate that p53-bound CREs are both positively and 
negatively affected by alterations in local sequence context and changes to 
co-regulatory TF motifs. Our data suggest p53 has the flexibility to cooperate 
with a variety of transcription factors in order to regulate CRE activity. By 
utilizing different sets of co-factors across CREs, we hypothesize that global 
p53 activity is guarded against loss of any one regulatory partner, allowing for 
dynamic and redundant control of p53-mediated transcription.

The advent of perturbation-based massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) 
technique has facilitated the delineation of the roles of non-coding regulatory 
elements in orchestrating gene expression. However, computational efforts remain 
scant to evaluate and establish guidelines for sequence design strategies for 
perturbation MPRAs. In this study, we propose a framework for evaluating and 
comparing various perturbation strategies for MPRA experiments. Within this 
framework, we benchmark three different perturbation approaches from the 
perspectives of alteration in motif-based profiles, consistency of MPRA outputs, 
and robustness of models that predict the activities of putative regulatory 
motifs. While our analyses show very similar results across multiple 
benchmarking metrics, the predictive modeling for the approach involving random 
nucleotide shuffling shows significant robustness compared with the other two 
approaches. Thus, we recommend designing sequences by randomly shuffling the 
nucleotides of the perturbed site in perturbation-MPRA, followed by a coherence 
check to prevent the introduction of other variations of the target motifs. In 
summary, our evaluation framework and the benchmarking findings create a 
resource of computational pipelines and highlight the potential of 
perturbation-MPRA in predicting non-coding regulatory activities.

For the vast majority of genes in sequenced genomes, there is limited 
understanding of how they are regulated. Without such knowledge, it is not 
possible to perform a quantitative theory-experiment dialogue on how such genes 
give rise to physiological and evolutionary adaptation. One category of 
high-throughput experiments used to understand the sequence-phenotype 
relationship of the transcriptome is massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs). 
However, to improve the versatility and scalability of MPRAs, we need a "theory 
of the experiment" to help us better understand the impact of various biological 
and experimental parameters on the interpretation of experimental data. These 
parameters include binding site copy number, where a large number of specific 
binding sites may titrate away transcription factors, as well as the presence of 
overlapping binding sites, which may affect analysis of the degree of mutual 
dependence between mutations in the regulatory region and expression levels. To 
that end, in this paper we create tens of thousands of synthetic gene expression 
outputs for bacterial promoters using both equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium 
models. These models make it possible to imitate the summary statistics 
(information footprints and expression shift matrices) used to characterize the 
output of MPRAs and thus to infer the underlying regulatory architecture. 
Specifically, we use a more refined implementation of the so-called 
thermodynamic models in which the binding energies of each sequence variant are 
derived from energy matrices. Our simulations reveal important effects of the 
parameters on MPRA data and we demonstrate our ability to optimize MPRA 
experimental designs with the goal of generating thermodynamic models of the 
transcriptome with base-pair specificity. Further, this approach makes it 
possible to carefully examine the mapping between mutations in binding sites and 
their corresponding expression profiles, a tool useful not only for developing a 
theory of transcription, but also for exploring regulatory evolution.

Enhancers control gene expression, orchestrating plant development, and 
responses to stimuli. However, the regulatory codes of enhancers that confer 
tissue-specific expression in plants remain largely unexplored. Using massively 
parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) in tomato tissues, we tested the enhancer 
activity of 11,180 promoter fragments derived from fruit-specific genes. We 
discovered 2,436 active fruit enhancer sequences, a subset of which showed 
differential activity between fruit and leaves, suggesting that they can drive 
fruit-specific gene expression in tomato. We dissected the sequence determinants 
of fruit enhancers using deep learning. Guided by the regulatory rules learned 
from our MPRA dataset, we designed synthetic enhancers and experimentally 
validated their ability to specifically target tomato fruit. Our study provides 
a comprehensive landscape of functional enhancers in tomato fruit, facilitating 
the de novo design of synthetic enhancers for tissue-specific gene expression in 
plants.

BACKGROUND: STARR-seq and other massively-parallel reporter assays are widely 
used to discover functional enhancers in transfected cell models, which can be 
confounded by plasmid vector-induced type-I interferon immune responses and lack 
the multicellular environment and endogenous chromatin state of complex 
mammalian tissues.
RESULTS: We describe HDI-STARR-seq, which combines STARR-seq plasmid library 
delivery to the liver, by hydrodynamic tail vein injection (HDI), with reporter 
RNA transcriptional initiation driven by a minimal Albumin promoter, which we 
show is essential for mouse liver STARR-seq enhancer activity assayed 7 days 
after HDI. Importantly, little or no vector-induced innate type-I interferon 
responses were observed. Comparisons of HDI-STARR-seq activity between male and 
female mouse livers and in livers from males treated with an activating ligand 
of the transcription factor (TF) CAR (Nr1i3) identified many condition-dependent 
enhancers linked to condition-specific gene expression. Further, thousands of 
active liver enhancers were identified using a high complexity STARR-seq library 
comprised of ~ 50,000 genomic regions released by DNase-I digestion of mouse 
liver nuclei. When compared to stringently inactive library sequences, the 
active enhancer sequences identified were highly enriched for liver open 
chromatin regions with activating histone marks (H3K27ac, H3K4me1, H3K4me3), 
were significantly closer to gene transcriptional start sites, and were 
significantly depleted of repressive (H3K27me3, H3K9me3) and transcribed region 
histone marks (H3K36me3).
CONCLUSION: HDI-STARR-seq offers substantial improvements over current 
methodologies for large scale, functional profiling of enhancers, including 
condition-dependent enhancers, in liver tissue in vivo, and can be adapted to 
characterize enhancer activities in a variety of species and tissues by 
selecting suitable tissue- and species-specific promoter sequences.

The integrative analysis of high-throughput reporter assays, machine learning, 
and profiles of epigenomic chromatin state in a broad array of cells and tissues 
has the potential to significantly improve our understanding of noncoding 
regulatory element function and its contribution to human disease. Here, we 
report results from the CAGI 5 regulation saturation challenge where 
participants were asked to predict the impact of nucleotide substitution at 
every base pair within five disease-associated human enhancers and nine 
disease-associated promoters. A library of mutations covering all bases was 
generated by saturation mutagenesis and altered activity was assessed in a 
massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) in relevant cell lines. Reporter 
expression was measured relative to plasmid DNA to determine the impact of 
variants. The challenge was to predict the functional effects of variants on 
reporter expression. Comparative analysis of the full range of submitted 
prediction results identifies the most successful models of transcription factor 
binding sites, machine learning algorithms, and ways to choose among or 
incorporate diverse datatypes and cell-types for training computational models. 
These results have the potential to improve the design of future studies on more 
diverse sets of regulatory elements and aid the interpretation of 
disease-associated genetic variation.

INTRODUCTION: Synthetic biology revolutionizes our ability to decode and recode 
genetic systems. The capability to reconstruct and flexibly manipulate 
multi-gene systems is critical for understanding cellular behaviors and has 
significant applications in therapeutics.
OBJECTIVES: This study aims to construct a diverse library of synthetic tunable 
promoters (STPs) to enable flexible control of multi-gene expression in 
mammalian cells.
METHODS: We designed and constructed synthetic tunable promoters (STPs) that 
incorporate both a universal activation site (UAS) and a specific activation 
site (SAS), enabling multi-level expression control via the CRISPR activation 
(CRISPRa) system. To evaluate promoter activity, we utilized Massively Parallel 
Reporter Assays (MPRA) to assess the basal strengths of the STPs and their 
activation responses. Next, we constructed a three-gene reporter system to 
assess the capacity of the synthetic promoters for achieving multilevel control 
of single-gene expression within multi-gene systems.
RESULTS: The promoter library contains 24,960 unique non-redundant promoters 
with distinct sequence characteristics. MPRA revealed a wide range of promoter 
activities, showing different basal strengths and distinct activation levels 
when activated by the CRISPRa system. When regulated by targeting the SAS, the 
STPs exhibited orthogonality, allowing multilevel control of single-gene 
expression within multi-gene systems without cross-interference. Furthermore, 
the combinatorial activation of STPs in a multi-gene system enlarged the scope 
of expression levels achievable, providing fine-tuned control over gene 
expression.
CONCLUSION: We provide a diverse collection of synthetic tunable promoters, 
offering a valuable toolkit for the construction and manipulation of multi-gene 
systems in mammalian cells, with applications in gene therapy and biotechnology.

Exposure to stressful life events increases the risk for psychiatric disorders. 
Mechanistic insight into the genetic factors moderating the impact of stress can 
increase our understanding of disease processes. Here, we test 3,662 single 
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from preselected expression quantitative trait 
loci in massively parallel reporter assays to identify genetic variants that 
modulate the activity of regulatory elements sensitive to glucocorticoids, 
important mediators of the stress response. Of the tested SNP sequences, 547 
were located in glucocorticoid-responsive regulatory elements of which 233 
showed allele-dependent activity. Transcripts regulated by these functional 
variants were enriched for those differentially expressed in psychiatric 
disorders in the postmortem brain. Phenome-wide Mendelian randomization analysis 
in 4,439 phenotypes revealed potentially causal associations specifically in 
neurobehavioral traits, including major depression and other psychiatric 
disorders. Finally, a functional gene score derived from these variants was 
significantly associated with differences in the physiological stress response, 
suggesting that these variants may alter disease risk by moderating the 
individual set point of the stress response.

Most of the single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with insulin 
resistance (IR)-relevant phenotypes by genome-wide association studies (GWASs) 
are located in noncoding regions, complicating their functional interpretation. 
Here, we utilized an adapted STARR-seq to evaluate the regulatory activities of 
5,987 noncoding SNPs associated with IR-relevant phenotypes. We identified 876 
SNPs with biased allelic enhancer activity effects (baaSNPs) across 133 loci in 
three IR-relevant cell lines (HepG2, preadipocyte, and A673), which showed 
pervasive cell specificity and significant enrichment for cell-specific open 
chromatin regions or enhancer-indicative markers (H3K4me1, H3K27ac). Further 
functional characterization suggested several transcription factors (TFs) with 
preferential allelic binding to baaSNPs. We also incorporated multi-omics data 
to prioritize 102 candidate regulatory target genes for baaSNPs and revealed 
prevalent long-range regulatory effects and cell-specific IR-relevant biological 
functional enrichment on them. Specifically, we experimentally verified the 
distal regulatory mechanism at IRS1 locus, in which rs952227-A reinforces IRS1 
expression by long-range chromatin interaction and preferential binding to the 
transcription factor HOXC6 to augment the enhancer activity. Finally, based on 
our STARR-seq screening data, we predicted the enhancer activity of 227,343 
noncoding SNPs associated with IR-relevant phenotypes (fasting insulin adjusted 
for BMI, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides) from the largest available GWAS 
summary statistics. We further provided an open resource 
(http://www.bigc.online/fnSNP-IR) for better understanding genetic regulatory 
mechanisms of IR-relevant phenotypes.

Determining the rules of transcriptional regulation, associated with a complex 
transcription factor grammar, is fundamental to understand the control of most 
biological processes, disease mechanisms, and evolution. High-throughput 
reporter assays, such as MPRAs and STARR-seq, have enabled systematic functional 
annotations of genomes and have provided large substrates for training machine 
learning models to determine these rules, predict the activity of native and 
synthetic elements, and design elements for different applications. This review 
provides an overview of high-throughput reporter assays and their applications 
for the study of enhancers, promoters, silencers and insulators. We discuss how 
these assays help identify causal disease-associated non-coding variants and 
design synthetic elements with desired features for functional studies or 
therapeutic purposes.

The majority of the mouse genome is composed of non-coding regions, which harbor 
numerous regulatory sequences essential for gene regulation. While extensive 
research focuses on enhancers that activate gene expression, the role of 
silencers that repress gene expression remains less explored. In this study, the 
first genome-wide identification of silencers in the mouse genome is conducted. 
In mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and embryonic stem cells (mESCs), 89 596 
and 115 165 silencers are identified, respectively. These silencers are 
ubiquitously distributed across the genome and are predominantly associated with 
low-expression genes. Additionally, these silencers are mainly cell-specific and 
function by binding to repressive transcription factors (TFs). Further, these 
silencers are notably enriched with the histone modification H3K9me3. It is 
observed that the transformation between dual-function silencers and enhancers 
is correlated with intracellular transcription factor concentrations, 
accompanied by changes in epigenetic modifications. In terms of biological 
effects, we have identified silencers that can enhance the induction efficiency 
of MEFs and influence the pluripotency of mESCs. Collectively, this work offers 
the first comprehensive silencer landscape in the mouse genome and provides 
strong evidence for the role of silencers in the induction of induced 
pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs).

Steroid hormones act as important developmental switches, and their nuclear 
receptors regulate many genes. However, few hormone-dependent enhancers have 
been characterized, and important aspects of their sequence architecture, 
cell-type-specific activating and repressing functions, or the regulatory roles 
of their chromatin structure have remained unclear. We used STARR-seq, a 
recently developed enhancer-screening assay, and ecdysone signaling in two 
different Drosophila cell types to derive genome-wide hormone-dependent 
enhancer-activity maps. We demonstrate that enhancer activation depends on 
cis-regulatory motif combinations that differ between cell types and can predict 
cell-type-specific ecdysone targeting. Activated enhancers are often not 
accessible prior to induction. Enhancer repression following hormone treatment 
seems independent of receptor motifs and receptor binding to the enhancer, as we 
show using ChIP-seq, but appears to rely on motifs for other factors, including 
Eip74. Our strategy is applicable to study signal-dependent enhancers for 
different pathways and across organisms.

Cis-regulomes underlying immune-cell-specific genomic states have been 
extensively analyzed by structure-based chromatin profiling. By coupling such 
approaches with a high-throughput enhancer screen (self-transcribing active 
regulatory region sequencing (STARR-seq)), we assembled a functional 
cis-regulome for lipopolysaccharide-activated B cells. Functional enhancers, in 
contrast with accessible chromatin regions that lack enhancer activity, were 
enriched for enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) and preferentially interacted in vivo with B 
cell lineage-determining transcription factors. Interestingly, preferential 
combinatorial binding by these transcription factors was not associated with 
differential enrichment of their sites. Instead, active enhancers were resolved 
by principal component analysis (PCA) from all accessible regions by co-varying 
transcription factor motif scores involving a distinct set of signaling-induced 
transcription factors. High-resolution chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) 
analysis revealed multiplex, activated enhancer-promoter configurations 
encompassing numerous multi-enhancer genes and multi-genic enhancers engaged in 
the control of divergent molecular pathways. Motif analysis of pathway-specific 
enhancers provides a catalog of diverse transcription factor codes for 
biological processes encompassing B cell activation, cycling and 
differentiation.

Enhancer sequences control gene expression and comprise binding sites (motifs) 
for different transcription factors (TFs). Despite extensive genetic and 
computational studies, the relationship between DNA sequence and regulatory 
activity is poorly understood, and de novo enhancer design has been challenging. 
Here, we built a deep-learning model, DeepSTARR, to quantitatively predict the 
activities of thousands of developmental and housekeeping enhancers directly 
from DNA sequence in Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells. The model learned 
relevant TF motifs and higher-order syntax rules, including functionally 
nonequivalent instances of the same TF motif that are determined by 
motif-flanking sequence and intermotif distances. We validated these rules 
experimentally and demonstrated that they can be generalized to humans by 
testing more than 40,000 wildtype and mutant Drosophila and human enhancers. 
Finally, we designed and functionally validated synthetic enhancers with desired 
activities de novo.

Cis-regulatory elements (CREs) play a pivotal role in orchestrating interactions 
with trans-regulatory factors such as transcription factors, RNA-binding 
proteins, and noncoding RNAs. These interactions are fundamental to the 
molecular architecture underpinning complex and diverse biological functions in 
living organisms, facilitating a myriad of sophisticated and dynamic processes. 
The rapid advancement in the identification and characterization of these 
regulatory elements has been marked by initiatives such as the Encyclopedia of 
DNA Elements (ENCODE) project, which represents a significant milestone in the 
field. Concurrently, the development of CRE detection technologies, exemplified 
by massively parallel reporter assays, has progressed at an impressive pace, 
providing powerful tools for CRE discovery. The exponential growth of multimodal 
functional genomic data has necessitated the application of advanced analytical 
methods. Deep learning algorithms, particularly large language models, have 
emerged as invaluable tools for deconstructing the intricate nucleotide 
sequences governing CRE function. These advancements facilitate precise 
predictions of CRE activity and enable the de novo design of CREs. A deeper 
understanding of CRE operational dynamics is crucial for harnessing their 
versatile regulatory properties. Such insights are instrumental in refining gene 
therapy techniques, enhancing the efficacy of selective breeding programs, 
pushing the boundaries of genetic innovation, and opening new possibilities in 
microbial synthetic biology.

Promoters are core elements in regulating gene expression. The design and 
optimization of functional promoters is crucial for enhancing metabolic pathway 
construction and advancing gene therapy. Deep learning-based methods have shown 
great potential in promoter design. However, existing studies mainly focus on 
designing strong promoters, neglecting the practical need for promoters with 
varying regulatory intensities. Here, we propose a novel promoter design method, 
PromoDGDE, to design promoters with desirable expression levels and apply it to 
the promoter design of Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It uses 
Diffusion-GAN to learn the feature distribution of natural sequences and 
generate new promoters. Then, reinforcement learning and evolutionary algorithms 
are combined to dynamically optimize the synthetic sequences. In silico analyze 
results demonstrate that PromoDGDE outperforms existing methods, generating 
promoters that not only possess biological significance but also achieve the 
intended function. In vivo experiment results demonstrate that the synthetic 
promoters exhibit expression activity, with over 60% of the sequences showing 
the expected regulatory effects. These results confirm the practical 
effectiveness of PromoDGDE and demonstrate its ability to provide an efficient 
and flexible solution for complex design needs in synthetic biology.

Enhancers control gene expression and have crucial roles in development and 
homeostasis1-3. However, the targeted de novo design of enhancers with 
tissue-specific activities has remained challenging. Here we combine deep 
learning and transfer learning to design tissue-specific enhancers for five 
tissues in the Drosophila melanogaster embryo: the central nervous system, 
epidermis, gut, muscle and brain. We first train convolutional neural networks 
using genome-wide single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with 
sequencing (ATAC-seq) datasets and then fine-tune the convolutional neural 
networks with smaller-scale data from in vivo enhancer activity assays, yielding 
models with 13% to 76% positive predictive value according to cross-validation. 
We designed and experimentally assessed 40 synthetic enhancers (8 per tissue) in 
vivo, of which 31 (78%) were active and 27 (68%) functioned in the target tissue 
(100% for central nervous system and muscle). The strategy of combining 
genome-wide and small-scale functional datasets by transfer learning is 
generally applicable and should enable the design of tissue-, cell type- and 
cell state-specific enhancers in any system.

Rational design of plant cis-regulatory DNA sequences without expert 
intervention or prior domain knowledge is still a daunting task. Here, we 
developed PhytoExpr, a deep learning framework capable of predicting both mRNA 
abundance and plant species using the proximal regulatory sequence as the sole 
input. PhytoExpr was trained over 17 species representative of major clades of 
the plant kingdom to enhance its generalizability. Via input perturbation, 
quantitative functional annotation of the input sequence was achieved at 
single-nucleotide resolution, revealing an abundance of predicted high-impact 
nucleotides in conserved noncoding sequences and transcription factor binding 
sites. Evaluation of maize HapMap3 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) by 
PhytoExpr demonstrates an enrichment of predicted high-impact SNPs in cis-eQTL. 
Additionally, we provided two algorithms that harnessed the power of PhytoExpr 
in designing functional cis-regulatory variants, and de novo creation of 
species-specific cis-regulatory sequences through in silico evolution of random 
DNA sequences. Our model represents a general and robust approach for functional 
variant discovery in population genetics and rational design of regulatory 
sequences for genome editing and synthetic biology.

Engineered promoters are key components that allow engineered expression of 
genes in the cell-factory design. Promoters having exceptional strength are 
attractive candidates for designing metabolic engineering strategies for 
tailoring de novo production strategies that require directed evolution methods 
by engineering with de novo synthetic biology tools. Engineered promoter 
variants (EPVs) of naturally occurring promoters (NOPs) can be designed using 
metabolic engineering strategies and synthetic biology tools if the genes 
encoding the activating transcription factors (TFs) exist in the genome and are 
expressed and synthesized at non-limiting concentrations within the cell. The 
hybrid-architectured EPV design method targets an essential and predetermined 
part of the general transcription machinery. That is cis-acting DNA site(s) in 
coordination with the trans-acting factor(s) that must bind for the regulated 
transcription machinery activation. The method needs genomic and functional 
information that can lead to the discovery of the master TF(s) and synthetic 
cis-acting DNA elements, enabling the engineering of binding of master regulator 
TF(s). The method aims to generate EPVs that combine the advantages of being an 
exceptional stronger EPV(s) than the NOPs and permit "green-and-clean 
production" on a non-toxic carbon source, such as ethanol or glucose. By 
introducing our recent work on the engineering of ADH2 hybrid-promoter 
architectures to enhance recombinant protein expression on ethanol, we provide 
the method and protocol for the design of ADH2 hybrid-promoter architectures 
that can be adapted to other promoters in different substrate utilization 
pathways in Pichia pastoris (syn. Komagataella phaffii), as well as in other 
yeasts.

Production of useful chemicals by industrial microorganisms has been attracting 
more and more attention. Microorganisms screened from their natural environment 
usually suffer from low productivity, low stress resistance, and accumulation of 
by-products. In order to overcome these disadvantages, rational engineering of 
microorganisms to achieve specific industrial goals has become routine. Rapid 
development of metabolic engineering and synthetic biology strategies provide 
novel methods to improve the performance of industrial microorganisms. Rational 
regulation of gene expression by specific promoters is essential to engineer 
industrial microorganisms for high-efficiency production of target chemicals. 
Identification, modification, and application of suitable promoters could 
provide powerful switches at the transcriptional level for fine-tuning of a 
single gene or a group of genes, which are essential for the reconstruction of 
pathways. In this review, the characteristics of promoters from eukaryotic, 
prokaryotic, and archaea microorganisms are briefly introduced. Identification 
of promoters based on both traditional biochemical and systems biology routes 
are summarized. Besides rational modification, de novo design of promoters to 
achieve gradient, dynamic, and logic gate regulation are also introduced. 
Furthermore, flexible application of static and dynamic promoters for the 
rational engineering of industrial microorganisms is highlighted. From the 
perspective of powerful promoters in industrial microorganisms, this review will 
provide an extensive description of how to regulate gene expression in 
industrial microorganisms to achieve more useful goals.

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) associated with dysfunction of retinal 
pigment epithelial (RPE) cells is the most common cause of untreatable 
blindness. To advance gene therapy as a viable treatment for AMD there is a need 
for technologies that enable controlled, RPE-specific expression of therapeutic 
genes. Here we describe design, construction and testing of compact synthetic 
promoters with a pre-defined transcriptional activity and RPE cell specificity. 
Initial comparative informatic analyses of RPE and photoreceptor (PR) cell 
transcriptomic data identified conserved and overrepresented transcription 
factor regulatory elements (TFREs, 8-19 bp) specifically associated with 
transcriptionally active RPE genes. Both RPE-specific TFREs and those derived 
from the generically active cytomegalovirus-immediate early (CMV-IE) promoter 
were then screened in vitro to identify sequence elements able to control 
recombinant gene transcription in model induced pluripotent stem (iPS)-derived 
and primary human RPE cells. Two libraries of heterotypic synthetic promoters 
varying in predicted RPE specificity and transcriptional activity were designed 
de novo using combinations of up to 20 discrete TFREs in series (323-602 bp) and 
their transcriptional activity in model RPE cells was compared to that of the 
endogenous BEST1 promoter (661 bp, plus an engineered derivative) and the highly 
active generic CMV-IE promoter (650 bp). Synthetic promoters with a 
highpredicted specificity, comprised predominantly of endogenous TFREs exhibited 
a range of activities up to 8-fold that of the RPE-specific BEST1 gene promoter. 
Moreover, albeit at a lower predicted specificity, synthetic promoter 
transcriptional activity in model RPE cells was enhanced beyond that of the 
CMV-IE promoter when viral elements were utilized in combination with endogenous 
RPE-specific TFREs, with a reduction in promoter size of 15%. Taken together, 
while our data reveal an inverse relationship between synthetic promoter 
activity and cell-type specificity, cell context-specific control of recombinant 
gene transcriptional activity may be achievable.

Despite its success in several clinical trials, cancer immunotherapy remains 
limited by the rarity of targetable tumor-specific antigens, tumor-mediated 
immune suppression, and toxicity triggered by systemic delivery of potent 
immunomodulators. Here, we present a proof-of-concept immunomodulatory gene 
circuit platform that enables tumor-specific expression of immunostimulators, 
which could potentially overcome these limitations. Our design comprised de novo 
synthetic cancer-specific promoters and, to enhance specificity, an RNA-based 
AND gate that generates combinatorial immunomodulatory outputs only when both 
promoters are mutually active. These outputs included an immunogenic 
cell-surface protein, a cytokine, a chemokine, and a checkpoint inhibitor 
antibody. The circuits triggered selective T cell-mediated killing of cancer 
cells, but not of normal cells, in vitro. In in vivo efficacy assays, lentiviral 
circuit delivery mediated significant tumor reduction and prolonged mouse 
survival. Our design could be adapted to drive additional immunomodulators, 
sense other cancers, and potentially treat other diseases that require precise 
immunological programming.

protein, MB-16.

To improve soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merrill] seed nutritional quality, a 
synthetic gene, MB-16 was introduced into the soybean genome to boost seed 
methionine content. MB-16, an 11 kDa de novo protein enriched in the essential 
amino acids (EAAs) methionine, threonine, lysine and leucine, was originally 
developed for expression in rumen bacteria. For efficient seed expression, 
constructs were designed using the soybean codon bias, with and without the KDEL 
ER retention sequence, and β-conglycinin or cruciferin seed specific protein 
storage promoters. Homozygous lines, with single locus integrations, were 
identified for several transgenic events. Transgene transmission and MB-16 
protein expression were confirmed to the T5 and T7 generations, respectively. 
Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of developing seed showed that the transcript 
peaked in growing seed, 5-6 mm long, remained at this peak level to the 
full-sized green seed and then was significantly reduced in maturing yellow 
seed. Transformed events carrying constructs with the rumen bacteria codon 
preference showed the same transcription pattern as those with the soybean codon 
preference, but the transcript levels were lower at each developmental stage. 
MB-16 protein levels, as determined by immunoblots, were highest in full-sized 
green seed but the protein virtually disappeared in mature seed. However, amino 
acid analysis of mature seed, in the best transgenic line, showed a significant 
increase of 16.2 and 65.9 % in methionine and cysteine, respectively, as 
compared to the parent. This indicates that MB-16 elevated the sulfur amino 
acids, improved the EAA seed profile and confirms that a de novo synthetic gene 
can enhance the nutritional quality of soybean.

Enhancers serve as pivotal regulators of gene expression throughout various 
biological processes by interacting with transcription factors (TFs). While 
transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) are widely acknowledged as key 
determinants of TF binding and enhancer activity, the significant role of their 
surrounding context sequences remains to be quantitatively characterized. Here 
we propose the concept of transcription factor binding unit (TFBU) to modularly 
model enhancers by quantifying the impact of context sequences surrounding TFBSs 
using deep learning models. Based on this concept, we develop DeepTFBU, a 
comprehensive toolkit for enhancer design. We demonstrate that designing TFBS 
context sequences can significantly modulate enhancer activities and produce 
cell type-specific responses. DeepTFBU is also highly efficient in the de novo 
design of enhancers containing multiple TFBSs. Furthermore, DeepTFBU enables 
flexible decoupling and optimization of generalized enhancers. We prove that 
TFBU is a crucial concept, and DeepTFBU is highly effective for rational 
enhancer design.

Engineered promoters are key components in the cell-factory design, allowing 
precise and enhanced expression of genes. Promoters having exceptional strength 
are attractive candidates for designing metabolic engineering strategies for 
tailoring de novo production strategies that require directed evolution methods 
by engineering with de novo synthetic biology tools. Here, the custom-designed 
AOX1 hybrid-promoter architectures in coordination with targeted transcription 
factors are shown, transcriptionally rewired the expression over methanol-free 
substrate-utilization pathway(s) and converted methanol-dependent Pichia 
pastoris alcohol oxidase 1(AOX1) promoter (PAOX1 ) expression into a non-toxic 
carbon-source-regulated system. AOX1 promoter variants are engineered by 
replacing specified cis-regulatory DNA elements with synthetic Adr1, Cat8, and 
Aca2 cis-acting DNA elements for Mxr1, Cat8, and Aca1 binding, respectively. 
Applications of the engineered-promoters are validated for eGFP expression and 
extracellular human serum albumin production. The hybrid-promoter architecture 
designed with single Cat8 cis-acting DNA element deregulates the expression on 
ethanol. Compared with PAOX1 on methanol, the expression on ethanol is increased 
with i) PAOX1/Cat8-L3 (designed with single Cat8 cis-acting element) to 74%, ii) 
PAOX1/Adr1-L3/Cat8-L3 (designed with single- Cat8 and Adr1 cis-acting elements) 
to 85%, and for further consolidation of deregulated expression iii) PeAOX1 
(designed with triplet- Cat8 and Adr1 cis-acting elements) 1.30-fold, at t = 20 
h of batch cultivations.

Biological computing circuits can enhance our ability to control cellular 
functions and have potential applications in tissue engineering and medical 
treatments. Transcriptional activator-like effectors (TALEs) represent 
attractive components of synthetic gene regulatory circuits, as they can be 
designed de novo to target a given DNA sequence. We here demonstrate that TALEs 
can perform Boolean logic computation in mammalian cells. Using a split-intein 
protein-splicing strategy, we show that a functional TALE can be reconstituted 
from two inactive parts, thus generating two-input AND logic computation. We 
further demonstrate three-piece intein splicing in mammalian cells and use it to 
perform three-input AND computation. Using methods for random as well as 
targeted insertion of these relatively large genetic circuits, we show that 
TALE-based logic circuits are functional when integrated into the genome of 
mouse embryonic stem cells. Comparing construct variants in the same genomic 
context, we modulated the strength of the TALE-responsive promoter to improve 
the output of these circuits. Our work establishes split TALEs as a tool for 
building logic computation with the potential of controlling expression of 
endogenous genes or transgenes in response to a combination of cellular signals.

Enhancers control gene expression, orchestrating plant development, and 
responses to stimuli. However, the regulatory codes of enhancers that confer 
tissue-specific expression in plants remain largely unexplored. Using massively 
parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) in tomato tissues, we tested the enhancer 
activity of 11,180 promoter fragments derived from fruit-specific genes. We 
discovered 2,436 active fruit enhancer sequences, a subset of which showed 
differential activity between fruit and leaves, suggesting that they can drive 
fruit-specific gene expression in tomato. We dissected the sequence determinants 
of fruit enhancers using deep learning. Guided by the regulatory rules learned 
from our MPRA dataset, we designed synthetic enhancers and experimentally 
validated their ability to specifically target tomato fruit. Our study provides 
a comprehensive landscape of functional enhancers in tomato fruit, facilitating 
the de novo design of synthetic enhancers for tissue-specific gene expression in 
plants.

Transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs), secreted by the pathogenic 
bacteria Xanthomonas, specifically activate expression of targeted genes in 
plants. Here, we designed synthetic TALEs that bind to the flanking regions of 
the TATA-box motif on the CaMV 35S promoter for the purpose of understanding the 
engineerable 'hot-spots' for increasing transgene expression. We demonstrated 
that transient expression of de novo-engineered TALEs using agroinfiltration 
could significantly increase reporter gene expression in stable transgenic 
tobacco expressing the orange fluorescent protein reporter gene pporRFP under 
the control of synthetic inducible, minimal or full-length 35S promoters. 
Moreover, the additive effects of a combination of two different synthetic TALEs 
could significantly enhance the activation effects of TALEs on reporter gene 
expression more than when each TALE was used individually. We also studied the 
effects of the C-terminal domain and the activation domain of synthetic TALEs, 
as well as the best 'hot-spots' on the 35S promoter on targeted transgene 
activation. Furthermore, TALE activation of the Arabidopsis MYB transcription 
factor AtPAP1 (PRODUCTION OF ANTHOCYANIN PIGMENT 1) in stable transgenic tobacco 
gave rise to a dark purple colour on infiltrated leaves when driven by four 
copies of cis-regulatory elements of pathogenesis-related gene (PR1) with 
enhancer motifs B and A1 from the 35S promoter. These results provide novel 
insights into the potential applications of synthetic TALEs for targeted gene 
activation of transgenes in plants.

Gene therapy is a promising emerging therapeutic modality for the treatment of 
cardiovascular diseases and hereditary diseases that afflict the heart. Hence, 
there is a need to develop robust cardiac-specific expression modules that allow 
for stable expression of the gene of interest in cardiomyocytes. We therefore 
explored a new approach based on a genome-wide bioinformatics strategy that 
revealed novel cardiac-specific cis-acting regulatory modules (CS-CRMs). These 
transcriptional modules contained evolutionary-conserved clusters of putative 
transcription factor binding sites that correspond to a "molecular signature" 
associated with robust gene expression in the heart. We then validated these 
CS-CRMs in vivo using an adeno-associated viral vector serotype 9 that drives a 
reporter gene from a quintessential cardiac-specific α-myosin heavy chain 
promoter. Most de novo designed CS-CRMs resulted in a >10-fold increase in 
cardiac gene expression. The most robust CRMs enhanced cardiac-specific 
transcription 70- to 100-fold. Expression was sustained and restricted to 
cardiomyocytes. We then combined the most potent CS-CRM4 with a synthetic heart 
and muscle-specific promoter (SPc5-12) and obtained a significant 20-fold 
increase in cardiac gene expression compared to the cytomegalovirus promoter. 
This study underscores the potential of rational vector design to improve the 
robustness of cardiac gene therapy.

In synthetic biology, the precise control of gene expression is challenging due 
to the limited orthogonality of expression elements. Here, to address this issue 
and improve the reusability of genetic elements, we developed a bicistronic 
expression cassette in Corynebacterium glutamicum based on a leaderless promoter 
lacking a 5'UTR. The created leaderless bicistronic design (BCD) significantly 
improved the orthogonality of expression elements across different genes of 
interest. We also explored the importance of the fore-cistron and SD motif in 
maintaining the strength of leaderless BCDs. Additionally, we established a 
library containing 55,901 fore-cistrons and demonstrated that the regulatory 
range of gene expression in leaderless BCDs can be broader by modifying the 
fore-cistron sequence. This study provides a novel synthetic biology tool based 
on leaderless BCD for fine-tuning gene expression in C. glutamicum using 
fore-cistrons. Moreover, the strategy developed here can also be applied to 
improve the performance of other leaderless promoters in other bacteria.

With the development of high-throughput biology techniques and artificial 
intelligence, it has become increasingly feasible to design and construct 
artificial biological parts, modules, circuits, and even whole systems. To 
overcome the limitations of native promoters in controlling gene expression, 
artificial promoter design aims to synthesize short, inducible, and 
conditionally controlled promoters to coordinate the expression of multiple 
genes in diverse plant metabolic and signaling pathways. Synthetic promoters are 
versatile and can drive gene expression accurately with smart responses; they 
show potential for enhancing desirable traits in crops, thereby improving crop 
yield, nutritional quality, and food security. This review first illustrates the 
importance of synthetic promoters, then introduces promoter architecture and 
thoroughly summarizes advances in synthetic promoter construction. Restrictions 
to the development of synthetic promoters and future applications of such 
promoters in synthetic plant biology and crop improvement are also discussed.

BACKGROUND: The construction and application of synthetic genetic circuits is 
frequently improved if gene expression can be orthogonally controlled, relative 
to the host. In plants, orthogonality can be achieved via the use of 
CRISPR-based transcription factors that are programmed to act on natural or 
synthetic promoters. The construction of complex gene circuits can require 
multiple, orthogonal regulatory interactions, and this in turn requires that the 
full programmability of CRISPR elements be adapted to non-natural and 
non-standard promoters that have few constraints on their design. Therefore, we 
have developed synthetic promoter elements in which regions upstream of the 
minimal 35S CaMV promoter are designed from scratch to interact via programmed 
gRNAs with dCas9 fusions that allow activation of gene expression.
RESULTS: A panel of three, mutually orthogonal promoters that can be acted on by 
artificial gRNAs bound by CRISPR regulators were designed. Guide RNA expression 
targeting these promoters was in turn controlled by either Pol III (U6) or 
ethylene-inducible Pol II promoters, implementing for the first time a fully 
artificial Orthogonal Control System (OCS). Following demonstration of the 
complete orthogonality of the designs, the OCS was tied to cellular metabolism 
by putting gRNA expression under the control of an endogenous plant signaling 
molecule, ethylene. The ability to form complex circuitry was demonstrated via 
the ethylene-driven, ratiometric expression of fluorescent proteins in single 
plants.
CONCLUSIONS: The design of synthetic promoters is highly generalizable to large 
tracts of sequence space, allowing Orthogonal Control Systems of increasing 
complexity to potentially be generated at will. The ability to tie in several 
different basal features of plant molecular biology (Pol II and Pol III 
promoters, ethylene regulation) to the OCS demonstrates multiple opportunities 
for engineering at the system level. Moreover, given the fungibility of the core 
35S CaMV promoter elements, the derived synthetic promoters can potentially be 
utilized across a variety of plant species.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae has become a key microbial cell factory for producing 
biofuels, recombinant proteins, and natural products. The development of 
efficient cell factories relies on the precise control and fine-tuning of gene 
expression, underscoring the pivotal role of promoters in pathway engineering. 
However, natural promoters often have limited transcriptional capacity and thus 
fall short of the metabolic engineering requirements. This chapter provides 
protocols and guidelines for constructing and evaluating synthetic promoters in 
S. cerevisiae. Moreover, these protocols are applicable for creating and testing 
various synthetic promoters in other host systems.

Control of gene expression is crucial to optimize metabolic pathways and 
synthetic gene networks. Promoters and terminators are stretches of DNA upstream 
and downstream (respectively) of genes that control both the rate at which the 
gene is transcribed and the rate at which mRNA is degraded. As a result, both of 
these elements control net protein expression from a synthetic construct. Thus, 
it is highly important to discover and engineer promoters and terminators with 
desired characteristics. This chapter highlights various approaches taken to 
catalogue these important synthetic elements. Specifically, early strategies 
have focused largely on semi-rational techniques such as saturation mutagenesis 
to diversify native promoters and terminators. Next, in an effort to reduce the 
length of the synthetic biology design cycle, efforts in the field have turned 
towards the rational design of synthetic promoters and terminators. In this 
vein, we cover recently developed methods such as hybrid engineering, high 
throughput characterization, and thermodynamic modeling which allow finer 
control in the rational design of novel promoters and terminators. Emphasis is 
placed on the methodologies used and this chapter showcases the utility of these 
methods across multiple host organisms.

Relationship between promoter sequence and its strength in gene expression.

Computational Systems Biology, School of Mathematical Sciences, Fudan 
University, 200433, Shanghai, China.

Promoter strength, or activity, is important in genetic engineering and 
synthetic biology. A constitutive promoter with a certain strength for one given 
RNA can often be reused for other RNAs. Therefore, the strength of one promoter 
is mainly determined by its nucleotide sequence. One of the main difficulties in 
genetic engineering and synthetic biology is how to control the expression of a 
certain protein at a given level. One usually used way to achieve this goal is 
to choose one promoter with a suitable strength which can be employed to 
regulate the rate of transcription, which then leads to the required level of 
protein expression. For this purpose, so far, many promoter libraries have been 
established experimentally. However, theoretical methods to predict the strength 
of one promoter from its nucleotide sequence are desirable. Such methods are not 
only valuable in the design of promoter with specified strength, but also 
meaningful to understand the mechanism of promoter in gene transcription. In 
this study, through various tests, a theoretical model is presented to describe 
the relationship between promoter strength and nucleotide sequence. Our analysis 
shows that promoter strength is greatly influenced by nucleotide groups with 
three adjacent nucleotides in their sequences. Meanwhile, nucleotides in 
different regions of promoter sequence have different effects on promoter 
strength. Based on experimental data for E. coli promoters, our calculations 
indicate that nucleotides in the -10 region, the -35 region, and the 
discriminator region of a promoter sequence are more important for determining 
promoter strength than those in the spacing region. With model parameter values 
obtained by fitting to experimental data, four promoter libraries are 
theoretically built for the corresponding experimental environments under which 
data for promoter strength in gene expression has been measured previously.

Synthetic promoters are particularly relevant for application not only in yeast 
expression systems designed for high-level heterologous protein production but 
also in other applications such as metabolic engineering, cell biological 
research, and stage-specific gene expression control. By designing synthetic 
promoters, researcher can create customized expression systems tailored to 
specific needs, whether it is maximizing protein production or precisely 
controlling gene expression at different stages of a process. While recognizing 
the limitations of endogenous promoters, they also provide important information 
needed to design synthetic promoters. In this review, emphasis will be placed on 
some key approaches to identify endogenous, and to generate synthetic promoters 
in yeast expression systems. It shows the connection between endogenous and 
synthetic promoters, highlighting how their interplay contributes to promoter 
development. Furthermore, this review illustrates recent developments in 
biotechnological advancements and discusses how this field will evolve in order 
to develop custom-made promoters for diverse applications. This review offers 
detailed information, explores the transition from endogenous to synthetic 
promoters, and presents valuable perspectives on the next generation of promoter 
design strategies.

The availability of different host chassis will greatly expand the range of 
applications in synthetic biology. Members of the Acetobacteraceae family of 
Gram-negative bacteria form an attractive class of nonmodel microorganisms that 
can be exploited to produce industrial chemicals, food and beverage, and 
biomaterials. One such biomaterial is bacterial cellulose, which is a strong and 
ultrapure natural polymer used in tissue engineering scaffolds, wound dressings, 
electronics, food additives, and other products. However, despite the potential 
of Acetobacteraceae in biotechnology, there has been considerably little effort 
to fundamentally reprogram the bacteria for enhanced performance. One limiting 
factor is the lack of a well-characterized, comprehensive toolkit to control 
expression of genes in biosynthetic pathways and regulatory networks to optimize 
production and cell viability. Here, we address this shortcoming by building an 
expanded genetic toolkit for synthetic biology applications in Acetobacteraceae. 
We characterized the performance of multiple natural and synthetic promoters, 
ribosome binding sites, terminators, and degradation tags in three different 
strains, namely, Gluconacetobacter xylinus ATCC 700178, Gluconacetobacter 
hansenii ATCC 53582, and Komagataeibacter rhaeticus iGEM. Our quantitative data 
revealed strain-specific and common design rules for the precise control of gene 
expression in these industrially relevant bacterial species. We further applied 
our tools to synthesize a biodegradable cellulose-chitin copolymer, adjust the 
structure of the cellulose film produced, and implement CRISPR interference for 
ready down-regulation of gene expression. Collectively, our genetic parts will 
enable the efficient engineering of Acetobacteraceae bacteria for the 
biomanufacturing of cellulose-based materials and other commercially valuable 
products.

This paper reviews the importance, prospective and development of synthetic 
promoters reported in planta. A review of the synthetic promoters developed in 
planta would help researchers utilize the available resources and design new 
promoters to benefit fundamental research and agricultural applications. The 
demand for promoters for the improvement and application of transgenic 
techniques in research and agricultural production is increasing. 
Native/naturally occurring promoters have some limitations in terms of their 
induction conditions, transcription efficiency and size. The strength and 
specificity of native promoter can be tailored by manipulating its 
'cis-architecture' by the use of several recombinant DNA technologies. Newly 
derived chimeric promoters with specific attributes are emerging as an efficient 
tool for plant molecular biology. In the last three decades, synthetic promoters 
have been used to regulate plant gene expression. To better understand synthetic 
promoters, in this article, we reviewed promoter structure, the scope of 
cis-engineering, strategies for their development, their importance in plant 
biology and the total number of such promoters (188) developed in planta to 
date; we then categorized them under different functional regimes as biotic 
stress-inducible, abiotic stress-inducible, light-responsive, 
chemical-inducible, hormone-inducible, constitutive and tissue-specific. 
Furthermore, we identified a set of 36 synthetic promoters that control multiple 
types of expression in planta. Additionally, we illustrated the differences 
between native and synthetic promoters and among different synthetic promoter in 
each group, especially in terms of efficiency and induction conditions. As a 
prospective of this review, the use of ideal synthetic promoters is one of the 
prime requirements for generating transgenic plants suitable for promoting 
sustainable agriculture and plant molecular farming.

The ascomycete Trichoderma reesei is one of the main fungal producers of 
cellulases and xylanases based on its high production capacity. Its enzymes are 
applied in food, feed, and textile industry or in lignocellulose hydrolysis in 
biofuel and biorefinery industry. Over the last years, the demand to expand the 
molecular toolbox for T. reesei to facilitate genetic engineering and improve 
the production of heterologous proteins grew. An important instrument to modify 
the expression of key genes are promoters to initiate and control their 
transcription. To date, the most commonly used promoter for T. reesei is the 
strong inducible promoter of the main cellobiohydrolase cel7a. Beside this one, 
there is a number of alternative inducible promoters derived from other 
cellulase- and xylanase encoding genes and a few constitutive promoters. With 
the advances in genomics and transcriptomics the identification of new 
constitutive and tunable promoters with different expression strength was 
simplified. In this review, we will discuss new developments in the field of 
promoters and compare their advantages and disadvantages. Synthetic expression 
systems constitute a new option to control gene expression and build up complex 
gene circuits. Therefore, we will address common structural features of 
promoters and describe options for promoter engineering and synthetic design of 
promoters. The availability of well-characterized gene expression control tools 
is essential for the analysis of gene function, detection of bottlenecks in gene 
networks and yield increase for biotechnology applications.

Numerous studies have sought to characterize promoter function, determine 
principles to guide their engineering, and create promoters with stronger

promoter architecture and highlight recent advances in the field, focusing on 
the novel applications of inducible promoter design and engineering towards 
metabolic engineering and cellular therapeutic development. Additionally, we

INTRODUCTION: Synthetic biology revolutionizes our ability to decode and recode 
genetic systems. The capability to reconstruct and flexibly manipulate 
multi-gene systems is critical for understanding cellular behaviors and has 
significant applications in therapeutics.
OBJECTIVES: This study aims to construct a diverse library of synthetic tunable 
promoters (STPs) to enable flexible control of multi-gene expression in 
mammalian cells.
METHODS: We designed and constructed synthetic tunable promoters (STPs) that 
incorporate both a universal activation site (UAS) and a specific activation 
site (SAS), enabling multi-level expression control via the CRISPR activation 
(CRISPRa) system. To evaluate promoter activity, we utilized Massively Parallel 
Reporter Assays (MPRA) to assess the basal strengths of the STPs and their 
activation responses. Next, we constructed a three-gene reporter system to 
assess the capacity of the synthetic promoters for achieving multilevel control 
of single-gene expression within multi-gene systems.
RESULTS: The promoter library contains 24,960 unique non-redundant promoters 
with distinct sequence characteristics. MPRA revealed a wide range of promoter 
activities, showing different basal strengths and distinct activation levels 
when activated by the CRISPRa system. When regulated by targeting the SAS, the 
STPs exhibited orthogonality, allowing multilevel control of single-gene 
expression within multi-gene systems without cross-interference. Furthermore, 
the combinatorial activation of STPs in a multi-gene system enlarged the scope 
of expression levels achievable, providing fine-tuned control over gene 
expression.
CONCLUSION: We provide a diverse collection of synthetic tunable promoters, 
offering a valuable toolkit for the construction and manipulation of multi-gene 
systems in mammalian cells, with applications in gene therapy and biotechnology.

We describe an innovative experimental and computational approach to control the 
expression of a protein in a population of yeast cells. We designed a simple 
control algorithm to automatically regulate the administration of inducer 
molecules to the cells by comparing the actual protein expression level in the 
cell population with the desired expression level. We then built an automated 
platform based on a microfluidic device, a time-lapse microscopy apparatus, and 
a set of motorized syringes, all controlled by a computer. We tested the 
platform to force yeast cells to express a desired fixed, or time-varying, 
amount of a reporter protein over thousands of minutes. The computer 
automatically switched the type of sugar administered to the cells, its 
concentration and its duration, according to the control algorithm. Our approach 
can be used to control expression of any protein, fused to a fluorescent 
reporter, provided that an external molecule known to (indirectly) affect its 
promoter activity is available.

Precise control of gene expression using an artificial gene circuit is a major 
challenge in the application of synthetic biology. Here, we designed a 
hypoxia-responsive transgene expression system by combining a hypoxia-inducible 
RTP801 promoter and a tetracycline-responsive transactivator fused with an 
oxygen-dependent degradation domain (TA-ODD). The reporter gene expression was 
highly induced by hypoxia when a transactivator-expression plasmid, 
pRTP801/TA-ODD, harboring a TA-ODD gene driven by the RTP801 promoter, was 
cotransfected with a reporter plasmid, pTRE/EGFP, harboring an EGFP gene 
controlled under the transactivator-responsive promoter. A stable cell line into 
which the expression units RTP801/TA-ODD and TRE/EGFP had been introduced 
responded to hypoxia and expressed the reporter gene in an 
oxygen-concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, the cells demonstrated 
potential as sensors to detect hypoxic conditions in a three-dimensional tissue 
culture in vitro. These results indicate that the hypoxia-responsive transgene 
expression system is useful for constructing cell-based hypoxia detection 
systems.

Design of de novo synthetic regulatory DNA is a promising avenue to control gene 
expression in biotechnology and medicine. Using mutagenesis typically requires 
screening sizable random DNA libraries, which limits the designs to span merely 
a short section of the promoter and restricts their control of gene expression. 
Here, we prototype a deep learning strategy based on generative adversarial 
networks (GAN) by learning directly from genomic and transcriptomic data. Our 
ExpressionGAN can traverse the entire regulatory sequence-expression landscape 
in a gene-specific manner, generating regulatory DNA with prespecified target 
mRNA levels spanning the whole gene regulatory structure including coding and 
adjacent non-coding regions. Despite high sequence divergence from natural DNA, 
in vivo measurements show that 57% of the highly-expressed synthetic sequences 
surpass the expression levels of highly-expressed natural controls. This 
demonstrates the applicability and relevance of deep generative design to expand 
our knowledge and control of gene expression regulation in any desired organism, 
condition or tissue.

Inducible promoters are essential for precise control of target gene expression 
in synthetic biological systems. However, engineering eukaryotic promoters is 
often more challenging than engineering prokaryotic promoters due to their 
greater mechanistic complexity. In this study, we describe a simple and reliable 
approach for constructing strongly inducible synthetic promoters with minimum 
leakiness in yeasts. The results indicate that the leakiness of yeast-inducible 
synthetic promoters is primarily the result of cryptic transcriptional 
activation of heterologous sequences that may be avoided by appropriate 
insulation and operator mutagenesis. Our promoter design approach has 
successfully generated robust, inducible promoters that achieve a > 103-fold 
induction in reporter gene expression. The utility of these promoters is 
demonstrated by using them to produce various biologics with titers up to 2 g/L, 
including antigens designed to raise specific antibodies against a SARS-CoV-2 
omicron variant through chicken immunization.

The Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis exhibits complex spatial and 
temporal gene expression signals. Although optogenetic tools are ideal for 
studying such processes, none has been engineered for this organism. Here, we 
port a cyanobacterial light sensor pathway comprising the green/red 
photoreversible two-component system CcaSR, two metabolic enzymes for production 
of the chromophore phycocyanobilin (PCB), and an output promoter to control 
transcription of a gene of interest into B. subtilis. Following an initial 
non-functional design, we optimize expression of pathway genes, enhance PCB 
production via a translational fusion of the biosynthetic enzymes, engineer a 
strong chimeric output promoter, and increase dynamic range with a miniaturized 
photosensor kinase. Our final design exhibits over 70-fold activation and rapid 
response dynamics, making it well-suited to studying a wide range of gene 
regulatory processes. In addition, the synthetic biology methods we develop to 
port this pathway should make B. subtilis easier to engineer in the future.

The design and development of synthetic biology applications in a workflow often 
involve connecting modular components. Whereas computer-aided design tools are 
picking up in synthetic biology as in other areas of engineering, the methods 
for verifying the correct functioning of living technologies are still in their 
infancy. Especially, fine-tuning for the right promoter strength to match the 
design specifications is often a lengthy and expensive experimental process. In 
particular, the relationship between signal fidelity and noise in synthetic 
promoter design can be a key parameter that can affect the healthy functioning 
of the engineered organism. To this end, based on our previous work on synthetic 
promoters for the E. coli PhoBR two-component system, we make a case for using 
chemical reaction network models for computational verification of various 
promoter designs before a lab implementation. We provide an analysis of this 
system with extensive stochastic simulations at a single-cell level to assess 
the signal fidelity and noise relationship. We then show how quasi-steady-state 
analysis via ordinary differential equations can be used to navigate between 
models with different levels of detail. We compare stochastic simulations with 
our full and reduced models by using various metrics for assessing noise. Our 
analysis suggests that strong promoters with low unbinding rates can act as 
control tools for filtering out intrinsic noise in the PhoBR context. Our 
results confirm that even simpler models can be used to determine promoters with 
specific signal to noise characteristics.

When expressing complex biotherapeutic proteins, traditional expression plasmids 
and methods may not always yield sufficient levels of high-quality product. 
High-strength viral promoters commonly used for recombinant protein (rProtein) 
production in mammalian cells allow for maximal expression, but provide limited 
scope to alter their transcription dynamics. However, synthetic promoters 
designed to provide tunable transcriptional activity offer a plasmid engineering 
approach to more precisely regulate product quality, yield or to reduce product 
related contaminants. We substituted the viral promoter CMV with synthetic 
promoters that offer different transcriptional activities to express our gene of 
interest in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Stable pools were established and 
the benefits of regulating transgene transcription on the quality of 
biotherapeutics were examined in stable pool fed-batch overgrow experiments. 
Specific control of gene expression of the heavy chain (HC):light chain (LC) of 
a Fab, and the ratio between the two HCs in a Duet mAb reduced levels of 
aberrant protein contaminants; and the controlled expression of the helper gene 
XBP-1s improved expression of a difficult-to-express mAb. This synthetic 
promoter technology benefits applications that require custom activity. Our work 
highlights the advantages of employing synthetic promoters for production of 
more complex rProteins.

Synthetic biology enables the creative combination of engineering and molecular 
biology for exploration of fundamental aspects of biological phenomena. However, 
there are limited resources available for such applications in the educational 
context, where straightforward setup, easily measurable phenotypes and 
extensibility are of particular importance. We developed unigems, a set of ten 
plasmids that enable classroom-based investigation of gene-expression control 
and biological logic gates to facilitate teaching synthetic biology and genetic 
engineering. It is built on a high-copy plasmid backbone and is easily 
extensible thanks to a common primer set that facilitates Gibson assembly of 
PCR-generated or synthesized DNA parts into the target vector. It includes two 
reporter genes with either two constitutive (high- or low-level) or two 
inducible (lactose- or arabinose-) promoters, as well as a single-plasmid 
implementation of an AND logic gate. The set can readily be employed in 
undergraduate teaching settings, during outreach events and for training of iGEM 
teams. All plasmids have been deposited in Addgene.

Cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) is a universal second messenger that is 
synthesized from guanosine triphosphate (GTP) by guanylyl cyclases (GCs) and 
hydrolyzed into guanosine monophosphate (GMP) by phosphodiesterases (PDEs). 
Small-molecule drugs that induce high cGMP levels in specialized tissues by 
boosting GC activity or inhibiting PDE activity have become the predominant 
treatment strategy for a wide range of medical conditions, including congestive 
heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, atherosclerosis-based claudication and 
erectile dysfunction. By fusing the cGMP receptor protein (CRP) of 
Rhodospirillum centenum to the Herpes simplex-derived transactivation domain 
VP16, we created a novel synthetic mammalian cGMP-sensing transcription factor 
(GTA) that activates synthetic promoters (PGTA) containing newly identified 
GTA-specific operator sites in a concentration-dependent manner. In cell lines 
expressing endogenous natriuretic peptide receptor A (NPR-A) (HeLa), 
GTA/PGTA-driven transgene expression was induced by B-type natriuretic peptide 
(BNP; Nesiritide(®)) in a concentration-dependent manner, which activated 
NPR-A׳s intracellular GC domain and triggered a corresponding cGMP surge. 
Ectopic expression of NPR-A in NPR-A-negative cell lines (HEK-293T) produced 
high cGMP levels and mediated maximum GTA/PGTA-driven transgene expression, 
which was suppressed by co-expression of PDEs (PDE-3A, PDE-5A and PDE-9A) and 
was re-triggered by the corresponding PDE inhibitor drugs (Pletal(®), Perfan(®), 
Primacor(®) (PDE-3A), Viagra(®), Levitra(®), Cialis(®) (PDE-5A) and BAY73-6691 
(PDE-9A)). Mice implanted with microencapsulated designer cells co-expressing 
the GTA/PGTA device with NPR-A and PDE-5A showed control of blood SEAP levels 
through administration of sildenafil (Viagra(®)). Designer cells engineered for 
PDE inhibitor-modulated transgene expression may provide a cell-based 
PDE-targeting drug discovery platform and enable drug-adjusted gene- and 
cell-based therapies.

Synthetic gene circuits for metabolic control: design trade-offs and

A grand challenge in synthetic biology is to push the design of biomolecular 
circuits from purely genetic constructs towards systems that interface different 
levels of the cellular machinery, including signalling networks and metabolic 
pathways. In this paper, we focus on a genetic circuit for feedback regulation 
of unbranched metabolic pathways. The objective of this feedback system is to 
dampen the effect of flux perturbations caused by changes in cellular demands or 
by engineered pathways consuming metabolic intermediates. We consider a 
mathematical model for a control circuit with an operon architecture, whereby 
the expression of all pathway enzymes is transcriptionally repressed by the 
metabolic product. We address the existence and stability of the steady state, 
the dynamic response of the network under perturbations, and their dependence on 
common tuneable knobs such as the promoter characteristic and ribosome binding 
site (RBS) strengths. Our analysis reveals trade-offs between the steady state 
of the enzymes and the intermediates, together with a separation principle 
between promoter and RBS design. We show that enzymatic saturation imposes 
limits on the parameter design space, which must be satisfied to prevent 
metabolite accumulation and guarantee the stability of the network. The use of 
promoters with a broad dynamic range and a small leaky expression enlarges the 
design space. Simulation results with realistic parameter values also suggest 
that the control circuit can effectively upregulate enzyme production to 
compensate flux perturbations.

The expression of metabolic proteins is controlled by genetic circuits, matching 
metabolic demands and changing environmental conditions. Ideally, this 
regulation brings about a competitive level of metabolic fitness. Understanding 
how cells can achieve a robust (close-to-optimal) functioning of metabolism by 
appropriate control of gene expression aids synthetic biology by providing 
design criteria of synthetic circuits for biotechnological purposes. It also 
extends our understanding of the designs of genetic circuitry found in nature 
such as metabolite control of transcription factor activity, promoter 
architectures and transcription factor dependencies, and operon composition (in 
bacteria). Here, we review, explain and illustrate an approach that allows for 
the inference and design of genetic circuitry that steers metabolic networks to 
achieve a maximal flux per unit invested protein across dynamic conditions. We 
discuss how this approach and its understanding can be used to rationalize 
Escherichia coli's strategy to regulate the expression of its ribosomes and 
infer the design of circuitry controlling gene expression of amino-acid 
biosynthesis enzymes. The inferred regulation indeed resembles E. coli's 
circuits, suggesting that these have evolved to maximize amino-acid production 
fluxes per unit invested protein. We end by an outlook of the use of this 
approach in metabolic engineering applications.

Synthetic strategies for optically controlling gene expression may enable the 
precise spatiotemporal control of genes in any combination of cells that cannot 
be targeted with specific promoters. We develop an improved genetic code 
expansion system in Caenorhabditis elegans and use it to create a 
photoactivatable Cre recombinase. We laser-activate Cre in single neurons within 
a bilaterally symmetric pair to selectively switch on expression of a 
loxP-controlled optogenetic channel in the targeted neuron. We use the system to 
dissect, in freely moving animals, the individual contributions of the 
mechanosensory neurons PLML/PLMR to the C. elegans touch response circuit, 
revealing distinct and synergistic roles for these neurons. We thus demonstrate 
how genetic code expansion and optical targeting can be combined to break the 
symmetry of neuron pairs and dissect behavioural outputs of individual neurons 
that cannot be genetically targeted.

Plain Language Summary: Animal behaviour and movement emerges from the 
stimulation of nerve cells that are connected together like a circuit. 
Researchers use various tools to investigate these neural networks in model 
organisms such as roundworms, fruit flies and zebrafish. The trick is to 
activate some nerve cells, but not others, so as to isolate their specific role 
within the neural circuit. One way to do this is to switch genes on or off in 
individual cells as a way to control their neuronal activity. This can be 
achieved by building a photocaged version of the enzyme Cre recombinase which is 
designed to target specific genes. The modified Cre recombinase contains an 
amino acid (the building blocks of proteins) that inactivates the enzyme. When 
the cell is illuminated with UV light, a part of the amino acid gets removed 
allowing Cre recombinase to turn on its target gene. However, cells do not 
naturally produce these photocaged amino acids. To overcome this, researchers 
can use a technology called genetic code expansion which provides cells with the 
tools they need to build proteins containing these synthetic amino acids. 
Although this technique has been used in live animals, its application has been 
limited due to the small amount of proteins it produces. Davis et al. therefore 
set out to improve the efficiency of genetic code expansion so that it can be 
used to study single nerve cells in freely moving roundworms. In the new system, 
named LaserTAC, individual cells are targeted with UV light that ‘uncages’ the 
Cre recombinase enzyme so it can switch on a gene for a protein that controls 
neuronal activity. Davis et al. used this approach to stimulate a pair of 
neurons sensitive to touch to see how this impacted the roundworm’s behaviour. 
This revealed that individual neurons within this pair contribute to the touch 
response in different ways. However, input from both neurons is required to 
produce a robust reaction. These findings show that the LaserTAC system can be 
used to manipulate gene activity in single cells, such as neurons, using light. 
It allows researchers to precisely control in which cells and when a given gene 
is switched on or off. Also, with the improved efficiency of the genetic code 
expansion, this technology could be used to modify proteins other than Cre 
recombinase and be applied to other artificial amino acids that have been 
developed in recent years.

Gene expression plays a central role in the orchestration of cellular processes. 
The use of inducible promoters to change the expression level of a gene from its 
physiological level has significantly contributed to the understanding of the 
functioning of regulatory networks. However, from a quantitative point of view, 
their use is limited to short-term, population-scale studies to average out 
cell-to-cell variability and gene expression noise and limit the nonpredictable 
effects of internal feedback loops that may antagonize the inducer action. Here, 
we show that, by implementing an external feedback loop, one can tightly control 
the expression of a gene over many cell generations with quantitative accuracy. 
To reach this goal, we developed a platform for real-time, closed-loop control 
of gene expression in yeast that integrates microscopy for monitoring gene 
expression at the cell level, microfluidics to manipulate the cells' 
environment, and original software for automated imaging, quantification, and 
model predictive control. By using an endogenous osmostress responsive promoter 
and playing with the osmolarity of the cells environment, we show that long-term 
control can, indeed, be achieved for both time-constant and time-varying target 
profiles at the population and even the single-cell levels. Importantly, we 
provide evidence that real-time control can dynamically limit the effects of 
gene expression stochasticity. We anticipate that our method will be useful to 
quantitatively probe the dynamic properties of cellular processes and drive 
complex, synthetically engineered networks.

Escherichia coli gene expression knockdown using synthetic small RNA (sRNA) can 
be fine-tuned by altering sRNA sequences to modulate target mRNA-binding 
ability, but this requires thorough checking for off-target effects. Here, we 
present an sRNA gene expression knockdown system fine-tuned by using different 
promoters to modulate synthetic sRNA abundance. Our approach entails selecting 
knockdown target genes resulting from in silico flux response analysis and those 
related to product biosynthesis then screening strains transformed with a 
library of synthetic sRNA-promoter combinations for enhanced production. We 
engineered two E. coli strains, both utilizing fine-tuned repression of argF and 
glnA through our approach; one produced putrescine (42.3 ± 1.0 g/L) and the 
other L-proline (33.8 ± 1.6 g/L) by fed-batch culture. Fine-tuned gene knockdown 
by controlling sRNA abundance will be useful for rapid design of microbial 
strains through simultaneously optimizing expression of multiple genes at a 
systems level, as it overcomes the difficulties of constructing and testing many 
different sRNAs and checking their cross-reactivity.

Promoters are among the most-important and most-basic tools for the control of 
metabolic pathways. However, previous research mainly focused on the screening 
and characterization of some native promoters in Bacillus subtilis. To develop a 
broadly applicable promoter system for this important platform organism, we 
created a de novo synthetic promoter library (SPL) based on consensus sequences 
by analyzing the microarray transcriptome data of B. subtilis 168. A total of 
214 potential promoters spanning a gradient of strengths was isolated and 
characterized by a green fluorescence assay. Among these, a detailed intensity 
analysis was conducted on nine promoters with different strengths by 
reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and sodium dodecyl 
sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Furthermore, 
reconstructed promoters and promoter cassettes (tandem promoter cluster) were 
designed via statistical model-based analysis and tandem dual promoters, which 
showed strength that was increased 1.2- and 2.77-fold compared to that of 
promoter P43, respectively. Finally, the SPL was employed in the production of 
inosine and acetoin by repressing and over-expressing the relevant metabolic 
pathways, yielding a 700% and 44% increase relative to the respective control 
strains. This is the first report of a de novo synthetic promoter library for B. 
subtilis, which is independent of any native promoter. The strategy of improving 
and fine-tuning promoter strengths will contribute to future metabolic 
engineering and synthetic biology projects in B. subtilis.

Modularity in controlling gene expression artificially is becoming an essential 
aspect of synthetic biology. Artificial transcriptional control of gene 
expression is one of the most well-developed methods for the design of novel 
synthetic regulatory networks. Such networks are intended to help understand 
natural cellular phenomena and to enable new biotechnological applications. 
Promoter sequence manipulation with cis-regulatory elements is a key approach to 
control gene expression transcriptionally. Here, we have designed a promoter 
that can be both activated and repressed, as a contribution to the library of 
synthetic biological 'parts'. Starting with the minimal cytochrome C (minCYC) 
promoter in yeast, we incorporated five steroid hormone responsive elements 
(SHREs) and one lac operator site, respectively, upstream and downstream of the 
TATA box. This allows activation through the testosterone-responsive androgen 
receptor, and repression through the LacI repressor. Exposure to varying 
concentrations of testosterone (to vary activation) and IPTG (to vary 
repression) demonstrated the ability to tune the promoter's output curve over a 
wide range. By integrating activating and repressing signals, the promoter 
permits a useful form of signal integration, and we are optimistic that it will 
serve as a component in future regulatory networks, including feedback 
controllers.

Genetic tools are a prerequisite to engineer cellular factories for synthetic 
biology and biotechnology. Methylorubrum extorquens AM1 is an important platform 
organism of a future C1-bioeconomy. However, its application is currently 
limited by the availability of genetic tools. Here we systematically tested 
repABC regions to maintain extrachromosomal DNA in M. extorquens. We used three 
elements to construct mini-chromosomes that are stably inherited at single copy 
number and can be shuttled between Escherichia coli and M. extorquens. These 
mini-chromosomes are compatible among each other and with high-copy number 
plasmids of M. extorquens. We also developed a set of inducible promoters of 
wide expression range, reaching levels exceeding those currently available, 
notably the PmxaF-promoter. In summary, we provide a set of tools to control the 
dynamic expression and copy number of genetic elements in M. extorquens, which 
opens new ways to unleash the metabolic and biotechnological potential of this 
organism for future applications.

Synthetic promoters can control a gene's timing, location, and expression level. 
The PromoterCAD web server ( http://promotercad.org ) allows the design of 
synthetic promoters to control plant gene expression, by novel arrangement of 
cis-regulatory elements. Recently, we have expanded PromoterCAD's scope with 
additional plant and animal data: (1) PLACE (Plant Cis-acting Regulatory DNA 
Elements), including various sized sequence motifs; (2) PEDB (Mammalian 
Promoter/Enhancer Database), including gene expression data for mammalian 
tissues. The plant PromoterCAD data now contains 22 000 Arabidopsis thaliana 
genes, 2 200 000 microarray measurements in 20 growth conditions and 79 tissue 
organs and developmental stages, while the new mammalian PromoterCAD data 
contains 679 Mus musculus genes and 65 000 microarray measurements in 96 tissue 
organs and cell types ( http://promotercad.org/mammal/ ). This work presents 
step-by-step instructions for adding both regulatory motif and gene expression 
data to PromoterCAD, to illustrate how users can expand PromoterCAD 
functionality for their own applications and organisms.

Microalgae hold enormous potential to provide a safe and sustainable source of 
high-value compounds, acting as carbon-fixing biofactories that could help to 
mitigate rapidly progressing climate change. Bioengineering microalgal strains 
will be key to optimizing and modifying their metabolic outputs, and to render 
them competitive with established industrial biotechnology hosts, such as 
bacteria or yeast. To achieve this, precise and tuneable control over transgene 
expression will be essential, which would require the development and rational 
design of synthetic promoters as a key strategy. Among green microalgae, 
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii represents the reference species for bioengineering 
and synthetic biology; however, the repertoire of functional synthetic promoters 
for this species, and for microalgae generally, is limited in comparison to 
other commercial chassis, emphasizing the need to expand the current microalgal 
gene expression toolbox. Here, we discuss state-of-the-art promoter analyses, 
and highlight areas of research required to advance synthetic promoter 
development in C. reinhardtii. In particular, we exemplify high-throughput 
studies performed in other model systems that could be applicable to microalgae, 
and propose novel approaches to interrogating algal promoters. We lastly outline 
the major limitations hindering microalgal promoter development, while providing 
novel suggestions and perspectives for how to overcome them.

Synthetic biology, the synthesis of engineering and biology, has rapidly matured 
and has dramatically increased the complexity of artificial gene circuits in 
recent years. The deployment of intricate synthetic gene circuits in mammalian 
cells requires the establishment of very precise and orthogonal control of 
transgene expression. In this chapter, we describe methods of modulating the 
expression of transgenes at the transcriptional level. Using cAMP-response 
element-binding protein (CREB)-dependent promoters as examples, a tool for the 
precise tuning of gene expression by using different core promoters and by 
varying the binding affinity of transcription factor operator sites is 
described.

To successfully engineer mammalian cells for a desired purpose, multiple 
recombinant genes are required to be coexpressed at a specific and optimal 
ratio. In this study, we hypothesized that synthetic promoters varying in 
transcriptional activity could be used to create single multigene expression 
vectors coexpressing recombinant genes at a predictable relative stoichiometry. 
A library of 27 multigene constructs was created comprising three discrete 
fluorescent reporter gene transcriptional units in fixed series, each under the 
control of either a relatively low, medium, or high transcriptional strength 
synthetic promoter in every possible combination. Expression of each reporter 
gene was determined by absolute quantitation qRT-PCR in CHO cells. The synthetic 
promoters did generally function as designed within a multigene vector context; 
however, significant divergences from predicted promoter-mediated 
transcriptional activity were observed. First, expression of all three genes 
within a multigene vector was repressed at varying levels relative to 
coexpression of identical reporter genes on separate single gene vectors at 
equivalent gene copies. Second, gene positional effects were evident across all 
constructs where expression of the reporter genes in positions 2 and 3 was 
generally reduced relative to position 1. Finally, after accounting for general 
repression, synthetic promoter transcriptional activity within a local multigene 
vector format deviated from that expected. Taken together, our data reveal that 
mammalian synthetic promoters can be employed in vectors to mediate expression 
of multiple genes at predictable relative stoichiometries. However, empirical 
validation of functional performance is a necessary prerequisite, as vector and 
promoter design features can significantly impact performance.

A novel inducible gene expression system using p-isopropyl benzoate (cumate) as 
an inducer was developed for the industrial production hosts, Bacillus subtilis 
and Bacillus megaterium. Cumate is non-toxic to the host, inexpensive, and 
carbon source-independent inducer which provides an economical option for 
large-scale production of valuable proteins and chemicals from Bacillus strains. 
The synthetic cumate-inducible system was constructed by combining the strong 
constitutive Bacillus promoter Pveg with regulatory elements of the Pseudomonas 
putida, CymR repressor, and its operator sequence CuO. The designed expression 
cassette containing a sfGFP reporter under the cumate-inducible promoter was 
assembled into a Bacillus-E. coli shuttle and gene expression investigated in 
the two Bacillus strains. Characterization of gene expression levels, expression 
kinetics, and dose-response to cumate inducer concentration confirmed 
high-level, but tightly controlled GFP reporter expression in tunable, cumate 
concentration-dependent manner. Unexpectedly, this expression system works 
equally well for Escherichia coli, resulting in a platform that can be used both 
in gram-positive and gram-negative expression host. Its tight regulation and 
controllable expression makes this system useful for metabolic engineering, 
synthetic biology studies as well industrial protein production.

Promoters play a central role in controlling gene regulation; however, a small 
set of promoters is used for most genetic construct design in the yeast 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Generating and utilizing models that accurately 
predict protein expression from promoter sequences would enable rapid generation 
of useful promoters and facilitate synthetic biology efforts in this model 
organism. We measure the gene expression activity of over 675,000 sequences in a 
constitutive promoter library and over 327,000 sequences in an inducible 
promoter library. Training an ensemble of convolutional neural networks jointly 
on the two data sets enables very high (R2 > 0.79) predictive accuracies on 
multiple sequence-activity prediction tasks. We describe model-guided design 
strategies that yield large, sequence-diverse sets of promoters exhibiting 
activities higher than those represented in training data and similar to current 
best-in-class sequences. Our results show the value of model-guided design as an 
approach for generating useful DNA parts.

Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (C. reinhardtii) is a single-cell green alga that can 
be easily genetically manipulated. With its favorable characteristics of rapid 
growth, low cost, non-toxicity, and the ability for post-translational protein 
modification, C. reinhardtii has emerged as an attractive option for the 
biosynthesis of various valuable products. To enhance the expression level of 
exogenous genes and overcome the silencing of foreign genes by C. reinhardtii, 
synthetic promoters such as the chimeric promoter AR have been constructed and 
evaluated. In this study, a synthetic promoter GA was constructed by hybridizing 
core fragments from the natural promoters of the acyl carrier protein gene 
(ACP2) and the glutamate dehydrogenase gene (GDH2). The GA promoter exhibited a 
significant increase (7 times) in expressing GUS, over the AR promoter as 
positive control. The GA promoter also displayed a strong responsiveness to blue 
light (BL), where the GUS expression was doubled compared to the white light 
(WL) condition. The ability of the GA promoter was further tested in the 
expression of another exogenous cadA gene, responsible for catalyzing the 
decarboxylation of lysine to produce cadaverine. The cadaverine yield driven by 
the GA promoter was increased by 1-2 times under WL and 2-3 times under BL as 
compared to the AR promoter. This study obtained, for the first time, a blue 
light-responsive GDH2 minimal fragment in C. reinhardtii, which delivered a 
doubling effect under BL when used alone or in hybrid. Together with the strong 
GA synthetic promoter, this study offered useful tools of synthetic biology to 
the algal biotechnology field.

Cell metabolism in living organisms is largely regulated at the transcriptional 
level, and the promoters are regarded as basic regulatory elements responsible 
for transcription initiation. Promoter engineering is an important technique to 
regulate gene expression and optimize metabolite biosynthesis in metabolic 
engineering and synthetic biology. The rational and precise control of gene 
expression in the multi-gene pathways can significantly affect the metabolic 
flux distribution and maximize the production of specific metabolites. Thus, 
many efforts have been made to identify natural promoters, construct inducible 
or hybrid promoters, and design artificial promoters for fine-tuning specific 
gene expression at the transcriptional level and improving production levels of 
the metabolites of interest. In this review, we will briefly introduce the 
architecture and function of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic promoters, and 
provide an overview of several major approaches for promoter engineering. The 
recent achievements and advances by promoter engineering for the optimization of 
metabolite biosynthetic pathways in multiple widely-used model microorganism, 
including Escherichia coli, Corynebacterium glutamicum and Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae, will also be extensively discussed.

Inducible expression systems represent the founding technology for the emergence 
of synthetic biology in mammalian cells. The core molecules in these systems are 
bacterial regulator proteins that bind to or dissociate from a cognate DNA 
operator sequence in response to an exogenous stimulus like a small-molecule 
inducer. In this chapter, we describe a generic protocol of how bacterial 
regulator proteins can be applied to the design, construction, and optimization 
of an inducible expression system in mammalian cells. By choosing regulator 
proteins with an appropriate small-molecule inducer, this protocol provides a 
straightforward approach for establishing biosensors, cell-to-cell communication 
systems, or tools to control gene expression in vivo.

An important aim of synthetic biology is to uncover the design principles of 
natural biological systems through the rational design of gene and protein 
circuits. Here, we highlight how the process of engineering biological systems - 
from synthetic promoters to the control of cell-cell interactions - has 
contributed to our understanding of how endogenous systems are put together and 
function. Synthetic biological devices allow us to grasp intuitively the ranges 
of behaviour generated by simple biological circuits, such as linear cascades 
and interlocking feedback loops, as well as to exert control over natural 
processes, such as gene expression and population dynamics.

Next-generation DNA vectors for cancer immunotherapies and vaccine development 
require promoters eliciting predefined transcriptional activities specific to 
target cell types, such as dendritic cells (DCs), which underpin immune 
response. In this study, we describe the de novo design of DC-specific synthetic 
promoters via in silico assembly of cis-transcription factor response elements 
(TFREs) that harness the DC transcriptional landscape. Using computational 
genome mining approaches, candidate TFREs were identified within promoter 
sequences of highly expressed DC-specific genes or those exhibiting an 
upregulated expression during DC maturation. Individual TFREs were then screened 
in vitro in a target DC line and off-target cell lines derived from skeletal 
muscle, fibroblast, epithelial, and endothelial cells using homotypic (TFRE 
repeats in series) reporter constructs. Based on these data, a library of 
heterotypic promoter assemblies varying in the TFRE composition, copy number, 
and sequential arrangement was constructed and tested in vitro to identify 
DC-specific promoters. Analysis of the transcriptional activity and specificity 
of these promoters unraveled underlying design rules, primarily TFRE 
composition, which govern the DC-specific synthetic promoter activity. Using 
these design rules, a second library of exclusively DC-specific promoters 
exhibiting varied transcriptional activities was generated. All DC-specific 
synthetic promoter assemblies exhibited >5-fold activity in the target DC line 
relative to off-target cell lines, with transcriptional activities ranging from 
8 to 67% of the nonspecific human cytomegalovirus (hCMV-IE1) promoter. We show 
that bioinformatic analysis of a mammalian cell transcriptional landscape is an 
effective strategy for de novo design of cell-type-specific synthetic promoters 
with precisely controllable transcriptional activities.

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) associated with dysfunction of retinal 
pigment epithelial (RPE) cells is the most common cause of untreatable 
blindness. To advance gene therapy as a viable treatment for AMD there is a need 
for technologies that enable controlled, RPE-specific expression of therapeutic 
genes. Here we describe design, construction and testing of compact synthetic 
promoters with a pre-defined transcriptional activity and RPE cell specificity. 
Initial comparative informatic analyses of RPE and photoreceptor (PR) cell 
transcriptomic data identified conserved and overrepresented transcription 
factor regulatory elements (TFREs, 8-19 bp) specifically associated with 
transcriptionally active RPE genes. Both RPE-specific TFREs and those derived 
from the generically active cytomegalovirus-immediate early (CMV-IE) promoter 
were then screened in vitro to identify sequence elements able to control 
recombinant gene transcription in model induced pluripotent stem (iPS)-derived 
and primary human RPE cells. Two libraries of heterotypic synthetic promoters 
varying in predicted RPE specificity and transcriptional activity were designed 
de novo using combinations of up to 20 discrete TFREs in series (323-602 bp) and 
their transcriptional activity in model RPE cells was compared to that of the 
endogenous BEST1 promoter (661 bp, plus an engineered derivative) and the highly 
active generic CMV-IE promoter (650 bp). Synthetic promoters with a 
highpredicted specificity, comprised predominantly of endogenous TFREs exhibited 
a range of activities up to 8-fold that of the RPE-specific BEST1 gene promoter. 
Moreover, albeit at a lower predicted specificity, synthetic promoter 
transcriptional activity in model RPE cells was enhanced beyond that of the 
CMV-IE promoter when viral elements were utilized in combination with endogenous 
RPE-specific TFREs, with a reduction in promoter size of 15%. Taken together, 
while our data reveal an inverse relationship between synthetic promoter 
activity and cell-type specificity, cell context-specific control of recombinant 
gene transcriptional activity may be achievable.

Inducible gene expression systems can be used to control the expression of a 
gene of interest by means of a small-molecule. One of the most common designs 
involves engineering a small-molecule responsive transcription factor (TF) and 
its cognate promoter, which often results in a compromise between minimal 
uninduced background expression (leakiness) and maximal induced expression. 
Here, we focus on an alternative strategy using quantitative synthetic biology 
to mitigate leakiness while maintaining high expression, without modifying 
neither the TF nor the promoter. Through mathematical modelling and experimental 
validations, we design the CASwitch, a mammalian synthetic gene circuit based on 
combining two well-known network motifs: the Coherent Feed-Forward Loop (CFFL) 
and the Mutual Inhibition (MI). The CASwitch combines the CRISPR-Cas 
endoribonuclease CasRx with the state-of-the-art Tet-On3G inducible gene system 
to achieve high performances. To demonstrate the potentialities of the CASwitch, 
we apply it to three different scenarios: enhancing a whole-cell biosensor, 
controlling expression of a toxic gene and inducible production of 
Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV) vectors.

Most of the gene expression systems available for Gram-negative bacteria are 
afflicted by relatively high levels of basal (i.e. leaky) expression of the 
target gene(s). This occurrence affects the system dynamics, ultimately reducing 
the output and productivity of engineered pathways and synthetic circuits. In 
order to circumvent this problem, we have designed a novel expression system 
based on the well-known XylS/Pm transcriptional regulator/promoter pair from the 
soil bacterium Pseudomonas putida mt-2, in which the key functional elements are 
physically decoupled. By integrating the xylS gene into the chromosome of the 
platform strain KT2440, while placing the Pm promoter into a set of standard 
plasmid vectors, the inducibility of the system (i.e. the output difference 
between the induced and uninduced state) improved up to 170-fold. We further 
combined this modular system with an extra layer of post-translational control 
by means of conditional proteolysis. In this setup, the target gene is tagged 
with a synthetic motif dictating protein degradation. When the system features 
were characterized using the monomeric superfolder GFP as a model protein, the 
basal levels of fluorescence were brought down to zero (i.e. below the limit of 
detection). In all, these novel expression systems constitute an alternative 
tool to altogether suppress leaky gene expression, and they can be easily 
adapted to other vector formats and plugged-in into different Gram-negative 
bacterial species at the user's will.

A significant limitation of numerous current genetic engineering therapy 
approaches is their limited control over the strength, timing, or cellular 
context of their therapeutic effect. Synthetic gene/genetic circuits are 
synthetic biology approaches that can control the generation, transformation, or 
depletion of a specific DNA, RNA, or protein and provide precise control over 
gene expression and cellular behavior. They can be designed to perform logical 
operations by carefully selecting promoters, repressors, and other genetic 
components. Patent search was performed in Espacenet, resulting in 38 selected 
patents with 15 most frequent international classifications. Patent embodiments 
were categorized into applications for the delivery of therapeutic molecules, 
treatment of infectious diseases, treatment of cancer, treatment of bleeding, 
and treatment of metabolic disorders. The logic gates of selected genetic 
circuits are described to comprehensively demonstrate their therapeutic 
applications. Synthetic gene circuits can be customized for precise control of 
therapeutic interventions, leading to personalized therapies that respond 
specifically to individual patient needs, enhancing treatment efficacy and 
minimizing side effects. They can be highly sensitive biosensors that provide 
real-time therapy by accurate monitoring various biomarkers or pathogens and 
appropriately synthesizing a therapeutic molecule. Synthetic gene circuits may 
also lead to the development of advanced regenerative therapies and to 
implantable biodevices that produce on-demand bioactive molecules. However, this 
technology faces challenges for commercial profitability. The genetic circuit 
designs need adjustments for specific applications, and may have disadvantages 
like toxicity from multiple regulators, homologous recombination, context 
dependency, resource overuse, and environmental variability.

Transcription rates are regulated by the interactions between RNA polymerase, 
sigma factor, and promoter DNA sequences in bacteria. However, it remains 
unclear how non-canonical sequence motifs collectively control transcription 
rates. Here, we combine massively parallel assays, biophysics, and machine 
learning to develop a 346-parameter model that predicts site-specific 
transcription initiation rates for any σ70 promoter sequence, validated across 
22132 bacterial promoters with diverse sequences. We apply the model to predict 
genetic context effects, design σ70 promoters with desired transcription rates, 
and identify undesired promoters inside engineered genetic systems. The model 
provides a biophysical basis for understanding gene regulation in natural 
genetic systems and precise transcriptional control for engineering synthetic 
genetic systems.

Synthetic biology research and its industrial applications rely on deterministic 
spatiotemporal control of gene expression. Recently, electrochemical control of 
gene expression has been demonstrated in electrogenetic systems 
(redox-responsive promoters used alongside redox inducers and electrodes), 
allowing for the direct integration of electronics with biological processes. 
However, the use of electrogenetic systems is limited by poor activity, 
tunability, and standardization. In this work, we developed a strong, 
unidirectional, redox-responsive promoter before deriving a mutant promoter 
library with a spectrum of strengths. We constructed genetic circuits with these 
parts and demonstrated their activation by multiple classes of redox molecules. 
Last, we demonstrated electrochemical activation of gene expression under 
aerobic conditions using a novel, modular bioelectrochemical device. These 
genetic and electrochemical tools facilitate the design and improve the 
performance of electrogenetic systems. Furthermore, the genetic design 
strategies used can be applied to other redox-responsive promoters to further 
expand the available tools for electrogenetics.

Topological barriers control in nature the transcription machinery, thereby 
perturbing gene expression. Here we introduce synthetically designed DNA 
templates that include built-in topological barriers for switchable, 
triggered-controlled transcription of RNA aptamers. This is exemplified with the 
design of transcription templates that include reversible and switchable 
topological barriers consisting of a Sr2+-ion-stabilized G-quadruplex and its 
separation by kryptofix [2.2.2], KP, for the switchable transcription of the 
malachite green (MG) RNA aptamer, the T-A·T triplex barrier being separated by a 
fuel-strand for the cyclic triggered transcription of the 
3,5-difluoro-4-hydroxybenzylidene imidazolinone (DFHBI)-binding aptamer, and the 
use of a photoactivated cis/trans azobenzene-modified nucleic acid barrier for 
the switchable "ON"/"OFF" transcription of the MG RNA aptamer. By applying a 
mixture of topologically triggered templates consisting of the photoresponsive 
barrier and the T-A·T triplex barrier, the gated transcription of the MG aptamer 
or the DFHBI-binding aptamer is demonstrated. In addition, a Sr2+-ion/KP 
topologically triggered DNA tetrahedra promoter-transcription scaffold, for the 
replication of the MG RNA aptamer, and T7 RNA polymerase are integrated into 
DNA-based carboxymethyl cellulose hydrogel microcapsules acting as cell-like 
assemblies. The switchable, reversible transcription of the MG RNA aptamer in a 
cell-like containment is introduced.

The internal environment of growing cells is variable and dynamic, making it 
difficult to introduce reliable parts, such as promoters, for genetic 
engineering. Here, we applied control-theoretic ideas to design promoters that 
maintained constant levels of expression at any copy number. Theory predicts 
that independence to copy number can be achieved by using an incoherent 
feedforward loop (iFFL) if the negative regulation is perfectly non-cooperative. 
We engineered iFFLs into Escherichia coli promoters using 
transcription-activator-like effectors (TALEs). These promoters had 
near-identical expression in different genome locations and plasmids, even when 
their copy number was perturbed by genomic mutations or changes in growth medium 
composition. We applied the stabilized promoters to show that a three-gene 
metabolic pathway to produce deoxychromoviridans could retain function without 
re-tuning when the stabilized-promoter-driven genes were moved from a plasmid 
into the genome.

Streptomycetes are Gram-positive bacteria with the capacity to produce copious 
bioactive secondary metabolites, which are the main source of medically and 
industrially relevant drugs. However, genetic manipulation of Streptomyces 
strains is much more difficult than other model microorganisms like Escherichia 
coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Recently, CRISPR/Cas9 or dCas9-mediated 
genetic manipulation tools have been developed and facilitated Streptomyces 
genome editing. However, till now, CRISPR/dCas9-based interference system 
(CRISPRi) is only designed to repress single gene expression. Herein, the 
authors developed a novel CRISPRi system for multiplex gene repression in the 
model strain Streptomyces coelicolor. In this system, the integrative plasmid 
pSET152 is used as the backbone for the expression of the dCas9/sgRNA complex 
and both dCas9 and sgRNAs are designed to be under the control of constitutive 
promoters. Using the integrative CRISPRi system, the authors achieved efficient 
repression of multiple genes simultaneously; the mRNA levels of four targets are 
reduced to 2-32% of the control. Furthermore, it is successfully employed for 
functional gene screening, and an orphan response regulator (RR) (encoded by 
SCO2013) containing an RNA-binding ANTAR domain is identified being involved in 
bacterial growth. Collectively, this integrative CRISPRi system is very 
effective for multiplex gene repression in S. coelicolor, which could be 
extended to other Streptomyces strains for functional gene screening as well as 
for metabolic engineering.

Synthetic biology has successfully advanced our ability to design and implement 
complex, time-varying genetic circuits to control the expression of recombinant 
proteins. However, these circuits typically require the production of regulatory 
genes whose only purpose is to coordinate expression of other genes. When 
designing very small genetic constructs, such as viral genomes, we may want to 
avoid introducing such auxiliary gene products while nevertheless encoding 
complex expression dynamics. To this end, here we demonstrate that varying only 
the placement and strengths of promoters, terminators, and RNase cleavage sites 
in a computational model of a bacteriophage genome is sufficient to achieve 
solutions to a variety of basic gene expression patterns. We discover these 
genetic solutions by computationally evolving genomes to reproduce desired gene 
expression time-course data. Our approach shows that non-trivial patterns can be 
evolved, including patterns where the relative ordering of genes by abundance 
changes over time. We find that some patterns are easier to evolve than others, 
and comparable expression patterns can be achieved via different genetic 
architectures. Our work opens up a novel avenue to genome engineering via 
fine-tuning the balance of gene expression and gene degradation rates.

Artificial gene circuits have been proposed to be embedded into microbial cells 
that function as switches, timers, oscillators, and the Boolean logic gates. 
Building more complex systems from these basic gene circuit components is one 
key advance for biologic circuit design and synthetic biology. However, the 
behavior of bioengineered gene circuits remains unstable and uncertain. In this 
study, a nonlinear stochastic system is proposed to model the biological systems 
with intrinsic parameter fluctuations and environmental molecular noise from the 
cellular context in the host cell. Based on evolutionary systems biology 
algorithm, the design parameters of target gene circuits can evolve to specific 
values in order to robustly track a desired biologic function in spite of 
intrinsic and environmental noise. The fitness function is selected to be 
inversely proportional to the tracking error so that the evolutionary biological 
circuit can achieve the optimal tracking mimicking the evolutionary process of a 
gene circuit. Finally, several design examples are given in silico with the 
Monte Carlo simulation to illustrate the design procedure and to confirm the 
robust performance of the proposed design method. The result shows that the 
designed gene circuits can robustly track desired behaviors with minimal errors 
even with nontrivial intrinsic and external noise.

With the rise of new DNA part libraries and technologies for assembling DNA, 
synthetic biologists are increasingly constructing and screening combinatorial 
libraries to optimize their biological designs. As combinatorial libraries are 
used to generate data on design performance, new rules for composing biological 
designs will emerge. Most formal frameworks for combinatorial design, however, 
do not yet support formal comparison of design composition, which is needed to 
facilitate automated analysis and machine learning in massive biological design 
spaces. To address this need, we introduce a combinatorial design framework 
called GOLDBAR. Compared with existing frameworks, GOLDBAR enables synthetic 
biologists to intersect and merge the rules for entire classes of biological 
designs to extract common design motifs and infer new ones. Here, we demonstrate 
the application of GOLDBAR to refine/validate design spaces for TetR-homologue 
transcriptional logic circuits, verify the assembly of a partial nif gene 
cluster, and infer novel gene clusters for the biosynthesis of rebeccamycin. We 
also discuss how GOLDBAR could be used to facilitate grammar-based machine 
learning in synthetic biology.

Discovering DNA regulatory sequence motifs and their relative positions is vital 
to understanding the mechanisms of gene expression regulation. Although deep 
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved great success in predicting 
cis-regulatory elements, the discovery of motifs and their combinatorial 
patterns from these CNN models has remained difficult. We show that the main 
difficulty is due to the problem of multifaceted neurons which respond to 
multiple types of sequence patterns. Since existing interpretation methods were 
mainly designed to visualize the class of sequences that can activate the 
neuron, the resulting visualization will correspond to a mixture of patterns. 
Such a mixture is usually difficult to interpret without resolving the mixed 
patterns. We propose the NeuronMotif algorithm to interpret such neurons. Given 
any convolutional neuron (CN) in the network, NeuronMotif first generates a 
large sample of sequences capable of activating the CN, which typically consists 
of a mixture of patterns. Then, the sequences are "demixed" in a layer-wise 
manner by backward clustering of the feature maps of the involved convolutional 
layers. NeuronMotif can output the sequence motifs, and the syntax rules 
governing their combinations are depicted by position weight matrices organized 
in tree structures. Compared to existing methods, the motifs found by 
NeuronMotif have more matches to known motifs in the JASPAR database. The 
higher-order patterns uncovered for deep CNs are supported by the literature and 
ATAC-seq footprinting. Overall, NeuronMotif enables the deciphering of 
cis-regulatory codes from deep CNs and enhances the utility of CNN in genome 
interpretation.

While machine learning models have been successfully applied to predicting gene 
expression from promoter sequences, it remains a great challenge to derive 
intuitive interpretation of the model and reveal DNA motif grammar such as motif 
cooperation and distance constraint between motif sites. Previous interpretation 
approaches are often time-consuming or have difficulty to learn the combinatory 
rules. In this work, we designed interpretable neural network models to predict 
the mRNA expression levels from DNA sequences. By applying the Contextual 
Regression framework we developed, we extracted weighted features to cluster 
samples into different groups, which have different gene expression levels. We 
performed motif analysis in each cluster and found motifs with active or 
repressive regulation on gene expression. By comparing the co-occurrence 
locations of discovered motifs, we also uncovered multiple grammars of motif 
combination including communities of cooperative motifs and distance constraints 
between motif pairs. These results revealed new insights of the regulatory 
architecture of promoter sequences.

Massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) functionally screen thousands of 
sequences for regulatory activity in parallel. To date, there are limited 
studies that systematically compare differences in MPRA design. Here, we screen 
a library of 2,440 candidate liver enhancers and controls for regulatory 
activity in HepG2 cells using nine different MPRA designs. We identify subtle 
but significant differences that correlate with epigenetic and sequence-level 
features, as well as differences in dynamic range and reproducibility. We also 
validate that enhancer activity is largely independent of orientation, at least 
for our library and designs. Finally, we assemble and test the same enhancers as 
192-mers, 354-mers and 678-mers and observe sizable differences. This work 
provides a framework for the experimental design of high-throughput reporter 
assays, suggesting that the extended sequence context of tested elements and to 
a lesser degree the precise assay, influence MPRA results.

Understanding the grammar of enhancers and how they regulate gene expression is 
key for both basic research and for the pharma and biotech industries. The 
design and characterization of synthetic enhancers can expand the known 
regulatory space. This is achieved by the utilization of DNA Oligo Libraries 
(OLs), which facilitates screening of as many as millions of synthetic enhancer 
variants simultaneously. This review includes the latest commercial DNA OL 
synthesis technology and its capabilities, and a general 'know-how' guide for 
the design, construction, and analysis of OL-based synthetic enhancer 
characterization experiments. Specifically, we focus on synthetic-enhancer-based 
massively parallel reporter assay, Sort-seq methodologies (e.g. flow cytometry, 
deep sequencing), and a brief description of machine learning-based attempts for 
OL-analysis and follow-up validation experiments.

A growing number of variants associated with risk for neurodevelopmental 
disorders have been identified by genome-wide association and whole genome 
sequencing studies. As common risk variants often fall within large haplotype 
blocks covering long stretches of the noncoding genome, the causal variants 
within an associated locus are often unknown. Similarly, the effect of rare 
noncoding risk variants identified by whole genome sequencing on molecular 
traits is seldom known without functional assays. A massively parallel reporter 
assay (MPRA) is an assay that can functionally validate thousands of regulatory 
elements simultaneously using high-throughput sequencing and barcode technology. 
MPRA has been adapted to various experimental designs that measure gene 
regulatory effects of genetic variants within cis- and trans-regulatory elements 
as well as posttranscriptional processes. This review discusses different MPRA 
designs that have been or could be used in the future to experimentally validate 
genetic variants associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. Though MPRA has 
limitations such as it does not model genomic context, this assay can help 
narrow down the underlying genetic causes of neurodevelopmental disorders by 
screening thousands of sequences in one experiment. We conclude by describing 
future directions of this technique such as applications of MPRA for 
gene-by-environment interactions and pharmacogenetics.

Large-scale sequencing efforts have been undertaken to understand the mutational 
landscape of the coding genome. However, the vast majority of variants occur 
within non-coding genomic regions. We designed an integrative computational and 
experimental framework to identify recurrently mutated non-coding regulatory 
regions that drive tumor progression. Applying this framework to sequencing data 
from a large prostate cancer patient cohort revealed a large set of candidate 
drivers. We used (1) in silico analyses, (2) massively parallel reporter assays, 
and (3) in vivo CRISPR interference screens to systematically validate 
metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) drivers. One identified 
enhancer region, GH22I030351, acts on a bidirectional promoter to simultaneously 
modulate expression of the U2-associated splicing factor SF3A1 and chromosomal 
protein CCDC157. SF3A1 and CCDC157 promote tumor growth in vivo. We nominated a 
number of transcription factors, notably SOX6, to regulate expression of SF3A1 
and CCDC157. Our integrative approach enables the systematic detection of 
non-coding regulatory regions that drive human cancers.

Correct pre-mRNA processing in higher eukaryotes vastly depends on splice site 
recognition. Beyond conserved 5'ss and 3'ss motifs, splicing regulatory elements 
(SREs) play a pivotal role in this recognition process. Here, we present in 
silico designed sequences with arbitrary a priori prescribed splicing regulatory 
HEXplorer properties that can be concatenated to arbitrary length without 
changing their regulatory properties. We experimentally validated in silico 
predictions in a massively parallel splicing reporter assay on more than 3000 
sequences and exemplarily identified some SRE binding proteins. Aiming at a 
unified 'functional splice site strength' encompassing both U1 snRNA 
complementarity and impact from neighboring SREs, we developed a novel RNA-seq 
based 5'ss usage landscape, mapping the competition of pairs of high confidence 
5'ss and neighboring exonic GT sites along HBond and HEXplorer score coordinate 
axes on human fibroblast and endothelium transcriptome datasets. These RNA-seq 
data served as basis for a logistic 5'ss usage prediction model, which greatly 
improved discrimination between strong but unused exonic GT sites and annotated 
highly used 5'ss. Our 5'ss usage landscape offers a unified view on 5'ss and SRE 
neighborhood impact on splice site recognition, and may contribute to improved 
mutation assessment in human genetics.

Genome mapping studies have generated a nearly complete collection of genes for 
the human genome, but we still lack an equivalently vetted inventory of human 
regulatory sequences. Cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) play important roles in 
controlling when, where, and how much a gene is expressed. We developed a 
training data-free CRM-prediction algorithm, the Mammalian Regulatory MOdule 
Detector (MrMOD) for accurate CRM prediction in mammalian genomes. MrMOD 
provides genome position-fixed CRM models similar to the fixed gene models for 
the mouse and human genomes using only genomic sequences as the inputs with one 
adjustable parameter - the significance p-value. Importantly, MrMOD predicts a 
comprehensive set of high-resolution CRMs in the mouse and human genomes 
including all types of regulatory modules not limited to any tissue, cell type, 
developmental stage, or condition. We computationally validated MrMOD 
predictions used a compendium of 21 orthogonal experimental data sets including 
thousands of experimentally defined CRMs and millions of putative regulatory 
elements derived from hundreds of different tissues, cell types, and stimulus 
conditions obtained from multiple databases. In ovo transgenic reporter assay 
demonstrates the power of our prediction in guiding experimental design. We 
analyzed CRMs located in the chromosome 17 using unsupervised machine learning 
and identified groups of CRMs with multiple lines of evidence supporting their 
functionality, linking CRMs with upstream binding transcription factors and 
downstream target genes. Our work provides a comprehensive base pair resolution 
annotation of the functional regulatory elements and non-functional regions in 
the mammalian genomes.

Enhancers are a class of cis-regulatory elements that can increase gene 
transcription by forming loops in intergenic regions, introns and exons. 
Enhancers, as well as their associated target genes, and transcription factors 
(TFs) that bind to them, are highly associated with human disease and biological 
processes. Although some enhancer databases have been published, most only focus 
on enhancers identified by high-throughput experimental techniques. Therefore, 
it is highly desirable to construct a comprehensive resource of manually curated 
enhancers and their related information based on low-throughput experimental 
evidences. Here, we established a comprehensive manually-curated enhancer 
database for human and mouse, which provides a resource for experimentally 
supported enhancers, and to annotate the detailed information of enhancers. The 
current release of ENdb documents 737 experimentally validated enhancers and 
their related information, including 384 target genes, 263 TFs, 110 diseases and 
153 functions in human and mouse. Moreover, the enhancer-related information was 
supported by experimental evidences, such as RNAi, in vitro knockdown, western 
blotting, qRT-PCR, luciferase reporter assay, chromatin conformation capture 
(3C) and chromosome conformation capture-on-chip (4C) assays. ENdb provides a 
user-friendly interface to query, browse and visualize the detailed information 
of enhancers. The database is available at http://www.licpathway.net/ENdb.

STUDY DESIGN: Experimental animal study.
OBJECTIVES: To validate the anti-apoptosis effect of microRNA-21 in neurons 
after spinal cord injury (SCI) and explore the mechanism.
SETTING: Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, People's 
Republic of China.
METHODS: In situ hybridization was used to detect the expression of miR-21 in 
spinal cord neurons (n = 24). In a rat contusion SCI model (n = 48), we 
upregulated the miR-21 level around the injured area using miR-21 lentiviral 
vectors and evaluated the therapeutic effect with histology and behavioural 
scores. In neuronal cells, oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) was exerted to 
imitate SCI, and we explored the biomechanism using molecular biology and a 
dual-luciferase reporter assay.
RESULTS: miR-21 was expressed in spinal cord neurons and was found to improve 
neuronal survival and promote functional recovery in rat SCI models. The in 
vitro results in PC-12 cells revealed that the augmentation of endogenous miR-21 
was able to reduce neuronal cell death after OGD. In addition, overexpression of 
miR-21 was able to reduce cellular apoptosis via decreasing PDCD4 protein 
levels, and caspase-3 activity was also influenced. Transfection of miR-21 into 
293T cells was able to decrease luciferase activity in a reporter assay system, 
including the 3' untranslated region of PDCD4.
CONCLUSIONS: miR-21 may have a protective role in neuronal apoptosis after SCI. 
PDCD4 may be a functional target gene involved in the miR-21-mediated 
anti-apoptotic effect through an miR-21/PDCD4/caspase-3 pathway.

Enhancers control gene expression, orchestrating plant development, and 
responses to stimuli. However, the regulatory codes of enhancers that confer 
tissue-specific expression in plants remain largely unexplored. Using massively 
parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) in tomato tissues, we tested the enhancer 
activity of 11,180 promoter fragments derived from fruit-specific genes. We 
discovered 2,436 active fruit enhancer sequences, a subset of which showed 
differential activity between fruit and leaves, suggesting that they can drive 
fruit-specific gene expression in tomato. We dissected the sequence determinants 
of fruit enhancers using deep learning. Guided by the regulatory rules learned 
from our MPRA dataset, we designed synthetic enhancers and experimentally 
validated their ability to specifically target tomato fruit. Our study provides 
a comprehensive landscape of functional enhancers in tomato fruit, facilitating 
the de novo design of synthetic enhancers for tissue-specific gene expression in 
plants.

Gene therapy progress and prospects--vectorology: design and production of

Adeno-associated virus (AAV) derived vectors are considered highly eligible 
vehicles for human gene therapy. Not only do they possess many great potential 
for clinical applications due to their wide range of tissue targets but also 
their excellent preclinical safety profile makes them particularly suitable 
candidates for treating serious diseases. Initial clinical trials have yielded 
encouraging results and prompted further improvements in their design and 
methods of production. Many studies have been performed to modify the tropism of 
recombinant (r)AAV by capsid modification. However, the precise control of 
spatial and temporal gene expression, which may be important in determining the 
safety and efficacy of gene transfer, lies in a rational choice and a subtle 
combination of various regulatory genetic elements to be inserted into the 
expression cassette. Moreover, new strategies based on such genetic sequences 
open new perspectives for enhancing vector genome persistence, disrupting or 
reducing pathogenic gene expression and even targeting genes.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are key regulatory elements encoded by the genome. A single 
miRNA can downregulate the expression of multiple genes involved in diverse 
functions. Because cancer is a disease with multiple gene aberrations, 
developing novel approaches to identify and modulate miRNA pathways may result 
in a breakthrough for cancer treatment. With a special focus on glioblastoma 
(GBM), this review provides an up-to-date summary of miRNA biogenesis, the role 
of miRNA in cancer resistance, and essential tools for modulating miRNA 
expression, as well as of clinically promising RNAi delivery systems and how 
they can be adapted for therapy.

It has become apparent that the clinical success anticipated in the field of 
gene therapy has been limited by progress in several of the fundamental areas of 
genetics, molecular and cellular biology relevant to its application. Whilst a 
great deal of effort has been made in the evaluation of transgenes, it is only 
more recently with the advance of vector systems that attention has begun to be 
focused upon the means and control of transgene expression. Until recently, the 
majority of constructs have employed ubiquitous viral promoters to drive 
expression from simple gene expression cassettes using viral promoters and 
lacking introns, 3' untranslated regions (UTRs), locus control regions (LCR's), 
matrix attachment regions (MAR's) and other such genetic components. It has 
consequently emerged that these elements may have a key role in determining the 
levels and longevity of gene expression attainable in vivo, irrespective of the 
vector system utilised. The majority of gene therapy applications would also 
benefit from the specific optimisation of 'tailor-made' expression cassettes to 
optimise their therapeutic efficacy. In conjunction with modification of vector 
tropism and strategies to limit their immunogenicity, this should create vectors 
suitable for the clinical application of gene therapy. This review aims to 
highlight some of the principle considerations of gene expression in vivo, and 
the means by which it may most effectively be achieved, whether this is via the 
minimal modification of an existing eukaryotic promoter or by the more extensive 
design of a novel promoter and associated elements.

The use of plasmid DNA for vaccination and therapy is a relatively novel 
technology, with advantages and limitations as with other gene transfer 
techniques. The technology is based on DNA vectors designed for administering 
genes coding for relevant proteins into a given organism, fulfilling 
requirements of the regulatory agencies that once properly formulated and 
delivered the desired vaccine/therapeutic effect can be achieved. Starting from 
conventional plasmid DNA vectors currently tested in clinical trials, 
improvement resulted in bacterial element-less vectors, increasing the 
complexity of the developmental process. The present review focuses on systems 
described for generating these nonviral DNA vectors for immunization and therapy 
from bacterial hosts (conventional and conditionally replicating plasmids, 
nonreplicating minicircles, and linear dumbbell-shaped expression cassettes) in 
vivo or in vitro. Additionally, nontherapeutic genetic sequences with a negative 
or positive effect according to the specific application are described, bringing 
a better comprehension of the technology's state of the art.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a complex and progressive disease 
characterized by pulmonary arterial remodeling. Despite that current combination 
therapy has shown improvement in morbidity and mortality, a better deciphering 
of the underlying pathological mechanisms and novel therapeutic targets is 
urgently needed to combat PAH. MicroRNA, the critical element in 
post-transcription mechanisms, mediates cellular functions mainly by tuning 
downstream target gene expression. Meanwhile, upstream regulators can regulate 
miRNAs in synthesis, transcription, and function. In vivo and in vitro studies 
have suggested that miRNAs and their regulators are involved in PAH. However, 
the miRNA-related regulatory mechanisms governing pulmonary vascular remodeling 
and right ventricular dysfunction remain elusive. Hence, this review summarized 
the controversial roles of miRNAs in PAH pathogenesis, focused on different 
miRNA-upstream regulators, including transcription factors, regulatory networks, 
and environmental stimuli, and finally proposed the prospects and challenges for 
the therapeutic application of miRNAs and their regulators in PAH treatment.

Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vectors are increasingly popular tools 
for gene therapy applications. Their non-pathogenic status, low inflammatory 
potential, availability of viral serotypes with different tissue tropisms, and 
prospective long-lasting gene expression are important attributes that make 
rAAVs safe and efficient therapeutic options. Over the last three decades, 
several groups have engineered recombinant AAV-producing platforms, yielding 
high titers of transducing vector particles. Current specific productivity 
yields from different platforms range from 103 to 105 vector genomes (vg) per 
cell, and there is an ongoing effort to improve vector yields in order to 
satisfy high product demands required for clinical trials and future 
commercialization.Crucial aspects of vector production include the molecular 
design of the rAAV-producing host cell line along with the design of AAV genes, 
promoters, and regulatory elements. Appropriately, configuring and balancing the 
expression of these elements not only contributes toward high productivity, it 
also improves process robustness and product quality. In this mini-review, the 
rational design of rAAV-producing expression systems is discussed, with special 
attention to molecular strategies that contribute to high-yielding, 
biomanufacturing-amenable rAAV production processes. Details on molecular 
optimization from four rAAV expression systems are covered: adenovirus, 
herpesvirus, and baculovirus complementation systems, as well as a recently 
explored yeast expression system.

Cancer cells display pervasive changes in DNA methylation, disrupted patterns of 
histone posttranslational modification, chromatin composition or organization 
and regulatory element activities that alter normal programs of gene expression. 
It is becoming increasingly clear that disturbances in the epigenome are 
hallmarks of cancer, which are targetable and represent attractive starting 
points for drug creation. Remarkable progress has been made in the past decades 
in discovering and developing epigenetic-based small molecule inhibitors. 
Recently, epigenetic-targeted agents in hematologic malignancies and solid 
tumors have been identified and these agents are either in current clinical 
trials or approved for treatment. However, epigenetic drug applications face 
many challenges, including low selectivity, poor bioavailability, instability 
and acquired drug resistance. New multidisciplinary approaches are being 
designed to overcome these limitations, e.g., applications of machine learning, 
drug repurposing, high throughput virtual screening technologies, to identify 
selective compounds with improved stability and better bioavailability. We 
provide an overview of the key proteins that mediate epigenetic regulation that 
encompass histone and DNA modifications and discuss effector proteins that 
affect the organization of chromatin structure and function as well as presently 
available inhibitors as potential drugs. Current anticancer small-molecule 
inhibitors targeting epigenetic modified enzymes that have been approved by 
therapeutic regulatory authorities across the world are highlighted. Many of 
these are in different stages of clinical evaluation. We also assess emerging 
strategies for combinatorial approaches of epigenetic drugs with immunotherapy, 
standard chemotherapy or other classes of agents and advances in the design of 
novel epigenetic therapies.

Mechanisms of retroviral integration and mutagenesis.

Author information:

Modena, Italy.

Gene transfer vectors derived from oncoretroviruses or lentiviruses are the most 
robust and reliable tools to stably integrate therapeutic transgenes in human 
cells for clinical applications. Integration of these vectors in the genome may, 
however, have undesired effects caused by insertional deregulation of gene 
expression at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level. The occurrence 
of severe adverse events in several clinical trials involving the 
transplantation of stem cells genetically corrected with retroviral vectors 
showed that insertional mutagenesis is not just a theoretical event, and that 
retroviral transgenesis is associated with a finite risk of genotoxicity. In 
addressing these issues, the gene therapy community offered a spectacular 
example of how scientific knowledge and technology can be put to work to 
understand the causes of unpredicted side effects, design new vectors, and 
develop tools and models to predict their safety and efficacy. As an added 
benefit, these efforts brought new basic knowledge on virus-host interactions 
and on the biology and dynamics of human somatic stem cells. This review 
summarizes the current knowledge on the interactions between retroviruses and 
the human genome and addresses the impact of target site selection on the safety 
of retroviral vector-mediated gene therapy.

BACKGROUND: Zishenhuoxue decoction (ZSHX), a Chinese herbal medicine, exhibits 
myocardial and vascular endothelial protective properties. The intricate 
regulatory mechanisms underlying myocardial ischemic injury and its association 
with dysfunctional mitochondrial quality surveillance (MQS) remain elusive.
HYPOTHESIS/PURPOSE: To study the protective effect of ZSHX on ischemic 
myocardial injury in mice using a TMBIM6 gene-modified animal model and 
mitochondrial quality control-related experiments.
STUDY DESIGN: Using model animals and myocardial infarction surgery-induced 
ischemic myocardial injury TMBIM6 gene-modified mouse models, the 
pharmacological activity of ZSHX in inhibiting ischemic myocardial injury and 
mitochondrial homeostasis disorder in vivo was tested.
METHODS: Our focal point entailed scrutinizing the impact of ZSHX on ischemic 
myocardial impairment through the prism of TMBIM6. This endeavor was undertaken 
utilizing mice characterized by heart-specific TMBIM6 knockout (TMBIM6CKO) and 
their counterparts, the TMBIM6 transgenic (TMBIM6TG) and VDAC1 transgenic 
(VDAC1TG) mice.
RESULTS: ZSHX demonstrated dose-dependent effectiveness in mitigating ischemic 
myocardial injury and enhancing mitochondrial integrity. TMBIM6CKO hindered 
ZSHX's cardio-therapeutic and mitochondrial protective effects, while ZSHX's 
benefits persisted in TMBIM6TG mice. TMBIM6CKO also blocked ZSHX's regulation of 
mitochondrial function in HR-treated cardiomyocytes. Hypoxia disrupted the MQS 
in cardiomyocytes, including calcium overload, excessive fission, mitophagy 
issues, and disrupted biosynthesis. ZSHX counteracted these effects, thereby 
normalizing MQS and inhibiting calcium overload and cardiomyocyte necroptosis. 
Our results also showed that hypoxia-induced TMBIM6 blockade resulted in the 
over-activation of VDAC1, a major mitochondrial calcium uptake pathway, while 
ZSHX could increase the expression of TMBIM6 and inhibit VDAC1-mediated calcium 
overload and MQS abnormalities.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that ZSHX regulates mitochondrial calcium 
homeostasis and MQS abnormalities through a TMBIM6-VDAC1 interaction mechanism, 
which helps to treat ischemic myocardial injury and provides myocardial 
protection. This study also offers insights for the clinical translation and 
application of mitochondrial-targeted drugs in cardiomyocytess.

The common IVSI-110 (G>A) β-thalassemia mutation is a paradigm for intronic 
disease-causing mutations and their functional repair by non-homologous end 
joining-mediated disruption. Such mutation-specific repair by disruption of 
aberrant regulatory elements (DARE) is highly efficient, but to date, no 
systematic analysis has been performed to evaluate disease-causing mutations as 
therapeutic targets. Here, DARE was performed in highly characterized erythroid 
IVSI-110(G>A) transgenic cells and the disruption events were compared with 
published observations in primary CD34+ cells. DARE achieved the functional 
correction of β-globin expression equally through the removal of causative 
mutations and through the removal of context sequences, with disruption events 
and the restriction of indel events close to the cut site closely resembling 
those seen in primary cells. Correlation of DNA-, RNA-, and protein-level 
findings then allowed the extrapolation of findings to other mutations by in 
silico analyses for potential repair based on the clustered regularly 
interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) 9, 
Cas12a, and transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) platforms. 
The high efficiency of DARE and unexpected freedom of target design render the 
approach potentially suitable for 14 known thalassemia mutations besides 
IVSI-110(G>A) and put it forward for several prominent mutations causing other 
inherited diseases. The application of DARE, therefore, has a wide scope for 
sustainable personalized advanced therapy medicinal product development for 
thalassemia and beyond.

Applicator and electrode design for in vivo DNA delivery by electroporation.

Rabussay D(1).

Author information:
(1)Inovio Biomedical Corp., San Diego, CA, USA.

As in vivo electroporation advances from the preclinical phase to clinical 
studies and eventually to routine medical practice, the design of 
electroporation devices becomes increasingly important. Achieving safety and 
efficacy levels that meet regulatory requirements, as well as user and patient 
friendliness, are major design considerations. In addition, the devices will 
have to be economical to manufacture. This chapter will focus on the design of 
applicators and electrodes, the pieces of hardware in direct contact with the 
user and the patient, and thus key elements responsible for the safety and 
efficacy of the procedure. The two major foreseeable applications of the 
technology in the DNA field are for gene therapy and DNA vaccination. Design 
requirements differ considerably for these applications and for the diseases to 
be treated or prevented. In addition to the trend of device differentiation, 
there is also a trend to build devices capable of performing both the step of 
delivering the DNA to the target tissue and the subsequent step of 
electroporation. This chapter presents the electrical and biological principles 
underlying applicator and electrode design, gives an overview of existing 
devices, and discusses their advantages and disadvantages. The chapter also 
outlines major design considerations, including regulatory pathways, and points 
out potential future developments.

Target validation is a crucial element of drug discovery. Especially given the 
wealth of potential targets emerging from cancer genome sequencing and 
functional genetic screens, and also considering the time and cost of downstream 
drug discovery efforts, it is essential to build confidence in a proposed 
target, ideally using different technical approaches. We argue that 
complementary biological and chemical biology strategies are essential for 
robust target validation. We discuss recent progress in the discovery and 
application of high quality chemical tools and other chemical biology approaches 
to target validation in cancer. Among other topical examples, we highlight the 
emergence of designed irreversible chemical tools to study potential target 
proteins and oncogenic pathways that were hitherto regarded as poorly druggable.

INTRODUCTION: Copy number alterations of chromosome 9p, or parts thereof, impair 
immune response and confer immune-checkpoint therapy (ICT) resistance by direct 
elimination of immune-regulatory genes on this arm, notably interferon (IFN)-γ 
(at 9p24.1) and type I IFN (IFN-I) cluster (9p21.3) genes. Nevertheless, the 
primary 9p-loss human tumor immune readout is indirect (CXCL9/10 depletion at 
4q21.1), and molecular alteration of chromosomes with engineered tandem 
elements-engineered 9p21.3-syntenic deletions in mice, Cdkn2a/b±Mtap (ΔS) versus 
larger Cdkn2a/b+Mtap+IFN-I (ΔL), revealed the causal link of IFN-I, primarily 
IFNϵ, to immune evasion.
METHODS: This report updates and explicates the rapidly emerging body of 
clinical 9p ICT-cohort data and executes human (tumor, cell line) and 
mouse-model intrinsic 9p, IFN-I, and tumor-immune microenvironment CXCL9/10 
deconvolution, mediation, and experimental studies. We analyzed CXCL9/10-CXCR3 
cell sources and regulation by 9p deletion (size and depth) and mouse spatial 
single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) syntenic chr4qC4 IFN-I (ΔS versus ΔL 
immune-evasive model) studies of immune-cell type, subtype, and subcluster 
Cxcl9/10+ numbers, fractions, and per-cell expression.
RESULTS: Chr9p (9p, 9p21.3, 9p24.1) copy number loss is associated with 
immune-cold, programmed cell death protein 1 axis ICT-resistant human 
papillomavirus-negative head and neck squamous cancer, nonsquamous NSCLC, 
melanoma, urothelial cancer, and mesothelioma (13 reports, 36 ICT cohorts; <4 
y). IFN-I has been associated with IFNα and ICT resistance. In human 
papillomavirus-negative head and neck squamous cancer, IFNE was the most highly 
expressed (and suppressed in 9p loss) IFN-I gene in tumors and cell lines, 
driven by 9p21.3 (q = 0.03; versus 9p24.1, q = 0.27); direct link to effector 
T-cell suppression (CD8 strongest, p = 0.006; mediation analysis), exhibited 
striking TP53 mutation co-occurrence and IFN-response pathway depletion. 
Progressively deep 9p21.3 loss (wild-type, shallow, deep) correlated with 
progressive IFNE and CXCL9/10-CXCR3 suppression; 9p21.3 ΔS (versus ΔL) IFN-I 
impact on CD8, NK (CD4, B, CD103) levels. Pan-tumor IFNE loss/tumor-immune 
microenvironment patterns were profoundly tissue-specific (Z ≤ 1.95 in 4/34 
tumor types). IFN-intact ΔS (versus ΔL) KPC pancreatic model was linked to 
Cxcl9/10+ dendritic cell (DC), macrophage, and neutrophil number (confirmed in 
KPL-3M nonsquamous NSCLC), and macrophage per-cell expression. DC and macrophage 
subclustering revealed heterogeneity at the level of M1, Ccl5, and conventional 
type 1 DC (cDC1), particularly high in ΔS.
CONCLUSION: IFNϵ is the elusive, cell-intrinsic 9p21 IFN-I signal to human CD8 
T-cell, myeloid DC, CXCL9/10, murine DC, and macrophage subtype and subcluster 
Cxcl9/10 expression. 9p-loss IFN-I and IFN-γ pathway (e.g., JAK2) genes at p21 
and p24 lack the capacity of endogenous CXCL9/10 induction in an immune-desert, 
ICT-resistant state. These findings, 9p-loss/ICT-resistance data, and DC vaccine 
lung trials have led to a DC-CXCL9/10 vaccine, designed to bypass the severe 
chemokine deficit in 9p-loss tumors.

DNA-based therapeutics and DNA delivery systems: a comprehensive review.

06269, USA.

The past several years have witnessed the evolution of gene medicine from an 
experimental technology into a viable strategy for developing therapeutics for a 
wide range of human disorders. Numerous prototype DNA-based biopharmaceuticals 
can now control disease progression by induction and/or inhibition of genes. 
These potent therapeutics include plasmids containing transgenes, 
oligonucleotides, aptamers, ribozymes, DNAzymes, and small interfering RNAs. 
Although only 2 DNA-based pharmaceuticals (an antisense oligonucleotide 
formulation, Vitravene, (USA, 1998), and an adenoviral gene therapy treatment, 
Gendicine (China, 2003), have received approval from regulatory agencies; 
numerous candidates are in advanced stages of human clinical trials. Selection 
of drugs on the basis of DNA sequence and structure has a reduced potential for 
toxicity, should result in fewer side effects, and therefore should eventually 
yield safer drugs than those currently available. These predictions are based on 
the high selectivity and specificity of such molecules for recognition of their 
molecular targets. However, poor cellular uptake and rapid in vivo degradation 
of DNA-based therapeutics necessitate the use of delivery systems to facilitate 
cellular internalization and preserve their activity. This review discusses the 
basis of structural design, mode of action, and applications of DNA-based 
therapeutics. The mechanisms of cellular uptake and intracellular trafficking of 
DNA-based therapeutics are examined, and the constraints these transport 
processes impose on the choice of delivery systems are summarized. Finally, the 
development of some of the most promising currently available DNA delivery 
platforms is discussed, and the merits and drawbacks of each approach are 
evaluated.

Synthetic biology is a promising multidisciplinary field that brings together 
experts in scientific disciplines from cell biology to engineering with the goal 
of constructing elements that do not occur in nature for use in various 
applications, such as the development of novel approaches to improving 
healthcare management. Current disease treatment strategies are typically based 
on the diagnosis of phenotypic changes, which are often the result of an 
accumulation of endogenous metabolic defects in the human body. These defects 
occur when the tight regulation of physiological processes is disturbed by 
genetic alterations, protein function losses, or environmental changes. Such 
disturbances can result in the development of serious disorders that are often 
associated with aberrant physiological levels of certain biomolecules (e.g., 
metabolites, cytokines, and growth factors), which may lead to specific 
pathogenic states. However, these aberrant levels can also serve as biomarkers 
for the precise detection and specification of disease types. Clinical 
interventions are often conducted during the late stages of disease pathogenesis 
because of a lack of early detection of these physiological disturbances, which 
results in disease treatment rather than prevention. Therefore, advanced 
therapeutic tools must be developed to link therapeutic intervention to early 
diagnosis. Recent advances in the field of synthetic biology have enabled the 
design of complex gene circuits that can be linked to a host's metabolism to 
autonomously detect disease-specific biomarkers and then reprogrammed to produce 
and release therapeutic substances in a self-sufficient and automatic fashion, 
thereby restoring the physiological balance of the host and preventing the 
progression of the disease. This concept offers a unique opportunity to design 
treatment protocols that could replace conventional strategies, especially for 
diseases with complex and recurrent dynamics, such as chronic diseases. WIREs

Transcription factors as molecular targets: molecular mechanisms of decoy ODN 
and their design.

Recent progress in cellular and molecular research has provided a new technique 
to inhibit target gene expression based on DNA technology such as antisense 
oligonucleotides (ODN) or decoy ODN. Especially, application of an antisense 
strategy to regulate the transcription of disease-related genes in vivo has 
important therapeutic potential to treat or cure a variety of diseases and 
abnormal physiological conditions. On the other hand, recently, a successful 
ODN-based approach termed decoy ODN has used synthetic ODN containing an 
enhancer element that can penetrate cells, to bind to sequence-specific 
DNA-binding proteins and interfere with transcription in vitro and in vivo. 
Transfection of cis-element double-stranded decoy ODN has been reported as a new 
powerful tool in a new class of anti-gene strategies to treat various diseases 
as gene therapy or as a research tool to examine the molecular mechanisms of 
expression of a specific gene. Transfection of double-stranded ODN corresponding 
to the cis-sequence will result in attenuation of the authentic cis-trans 
interaction, leading to removal of trans-factors from the endogenous 
cis-elements with subsequent modulation of gene expression. To date, we have 
chosen several target transcription factors such as NFkappaB (nuclear 
factor-kappaB) and E2F to prevent the progression of diseases, and negative 
regulatory element (NRE) for the renin gene and angiotensinogen gene-activating 
element (AGE) for the angiotensinogen gene to examine the molecular mechanisms 
of gene expression. In this section, we introduce the principles of the decoy 
strategy and how to design decoy ODN.

In clinical gene transfer applications, lentiviral vectors (LV) have rapidly 
become the primary means to achieve permanent and stable expression of a gene of 
interest or alteration of gene expression in target cells. This status can be 
attributed primarily to the ability of the LV to (1) transduce dividing as well 
as quiescent cells, (2) restrict or expand tropism through envelope 
pseudo-typing, and (3) regulate gene expression within different cell lineages 
through internal promoter selection. Recent progress in viral vector design such 
as the elimination of unnecessary viral elements, split packaging, and 
self-inactivating vectors has established a significant safety profile for these 
vectors. The level of GMP compliance required for the manufacture of LV is 
dependent upon their intended use, stage of drug product development, and 
country where the vector will be used as the different regulatory authorities 
who oversee the clinical usage of such products may have different requirements. 
As such, successful GMP manufacture of LV requires a combination of diverse 
factors including: regulatory expertise, compliant facilities, validated and 
calibrated equipments, starting materials of the highest quality, trained 
production personnel, scientifically robust production processes, and a quality 
by design approach. More importantly, oversight throughout manufacturing by an 
independent Quality Assurance Unit who has the authority to reject or approve 
the materials is required. We describe here the GMP manufacture of LV at our 
facility using a four plasmid system where 293T cells from an approved Master 
Cell Bank (MCB) are transiently transfected using polyethylenimine (PEI). 
Following transfection, the media is changed and Benzonase added to digest 
residual plasmid DNA. Two harvests of crude supernatant are collected and then 
clarified by filtration. The clarified supernatant is purified and concentrated 
by anion exchange chromatography and tangential flow filtration. The final 
product is then diafiltered directly into the sponsor defined final formulation 
buffer and aseptically filled.

Translation, a core process in central dogma, is essential for gene expression 
and determination of biological phenotypes. High-throughput RNA-seq, Ribo-seq, 
and RNC-seq have enabled large-scale measurement of translation efficiency 
dynamics, yet systematic quantification and integration of translation 
efficiency (TE), initiation efficiency (translation ratio, TR), and elongation 
speed (elongation velocity index, EVI) at both gene and transcript levels across 
diverse biological contexts remain limited, even though their context-specific 
regulation-together with associated UTR features-plays key roles in development, 
homeostasis, and disease. To address this gap, we present TEDD 
(https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/tedd), a comprehensive database for exploring human TE, 
TR, and EVI with a focus on regulatory 5'/3' UTR features. TEDD integrates 1518 
RNA-seq, Ribo-seq, and RNC-seq samples from 143 human projects (279 datasets) 
covering 24 tissues/cell types, 74 cell lines, and 52 conditions. Metrics are 
calculated at both gene and transcript levels, paired with detailed UTR 
annotations for fine-grained investigation of translational regulation. With 
user-friendly browsing, search, and download functions, TEDD offers an 
integrated online platform for multi-dimensional comparisons across genes, 
transcripts, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes/Gene Ontology-defined gene 
sets, and UTR elements, providing a valuable resource for studying translational 
control and supporting basic and translational applications in messenger RNA 
vaccine design, synthetic biology, gene therapy, and enzyme engineering.

BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent arthritic disease 
characterized by cartilage degradation and low-grade inflammation, for which 
there remains a lack of efficacious therapeutic interventions. Notably, 
mitigating the impact of oxidative stress (OS) and inflammatory factors could 
help alleviate or hinder the advancement of OA. Given the benefits of both 
quercetin (Que) and Magnesium ion (Mg2+) in OA treatment, coupled with the 
structural properties of Que, we have innovatively developed the Que-Mg2+ 
nanoparticles (NPs), aiming to deliver both Que and Mg2+ simultaneously and 
achieve enhanced therapeutic outcomes for OA. Moreover, to avoid the adverse 
reactions linked to frequent injections, sodium alginate (SA) microspheres 
encapsulating Que-Mg2+ NPs (Que-Mg@SA) were designed to treat the H2O2-induced 
OA cell model.
METHODS: Que-Mg@SA microspheres were synthesized using the ionotropic gelation 
technique, with calcium chloride acting as the cross-linking agent. 
Comprehensive characterization of the Que-Mg@SA was conducted through 
transmission electron microscope (TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), optical 
microscope, and scanning electron microscope (SEM), which provided detailed 
insights into their size, zeta potential, morphology, and micromorphology. 
Additionally, the microsphere swelling rate and Que release were evaluated. The 
biocompatibility of Que-Mg@SA microspheres, along with their impact on 
chondrocyte viability, were detected through CCK-8 assay and live/dead cell 
staining. Furthermore, the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of 
Que-Mg@SA were evaluated by examining the ROS scavenging ability and 
pro-inflammatory factors levels, respectively. Finally, the regulatory influence 
of Que-Mg@SA microspheres on extracellular matrix (ECM) metabolism in OA was 
assessed by immunofluorescence staining and Western blot.
RESULTS: Characterization results revealed that Que-Mg NPs exhibit nanoscale 
diameter, exceptional stability, and good dispersibility, while Que-Mg@SA 
possesses high entrapment efficiency (EE%) and loading efficiency (LE%), 
pronounced hygroscopic properties, and sustained drug-release capabilities. 
Additionally, in vitro cellular assays revealed that the biocompatible Que-Mg@SA 
microspheres significantly restored chondrocyte viability, scavenged 
H2O2-induced excessive ROS, reduced the levels of inflammatory cytokines, 
upregulated cartilage anabolic gene expression, downregulated cartilage 
catabolic protease gene expression, and maintained the metabolic balance of 
cartilage tissue.
CONCLUSION: The functionalized Que-Mg@SA microspheres developed in our study 
hold great promise as a drug delivery system for OA and potentially other 
biomedical applications.

Allogeneic dermal progenitor fibroblasts constitute cytotherapeutic contenders 
for modern cutaneous regenerative medicine. Based on advancements in the 
relevant scientific, technical, and regulatory fields, translational 
developments have slowly yet steadily led to the clinical application of such 
biologicals and derivatives. To set the appropriate general context, the first 
aim of this study was to provide a current global overview of approved cell and 
gene therapy products, with an emphasis on cytotherapies for cutaneous 
application. Notable advances were shown for North America, Europe, Iran, Japan, 
and Korea. Then, the second and main aim of this study was to perform a 
retrospective analysis on the various applications of dermal progenitor 
fibroblasts and derivatives, as clinically used under the Swiss progenitor cell 
transplantation program for the past three decades. Therein, the focus was set 
on the extent and versatility of use of the therapies under consideration, their 
safety parameters, as well as formulation options for topical application. 
Quantitative and illustrative data were summarized and reported for over 300 
patients treated with various cell-based or cell-derived preparations (e.g., 
progenitor biological bandages or semi-solid emulsions) in Lausanne since 1992. 
Overall, this study shows the strong current interest in biological-based 
approaches to cutaneous regenerative medicine from a global developmental 
perspective, as well as the consolidated local clinical experience gathered with 
a specific and safe allogeneic cytotherapeutic approach. Taken together, these 
current and historical elements may serve as tangible working bases for the 
further optimization of local and modern translational pathways for the 
provision of topical cytotherapeutic care.

Nanogel (NG) drug delivery systems have emerged as promising tools for targeted 
and controlled drug release, revolutionizing treatment approaches across various 
diseases. Their unique physicochemical properties, such as nano size, high 
surface area, biocompatibility, stability, and tunable drug release, make 
them ideal carriers for a wide range of therapeutic agents. Nanogels (NGs), 
characterized by their 3D network of crosslinked polymers, offer unique edges 
like high drug loading capacity, controlled release, and targeted delivery. 
Additionally, the diverse applications of NGs in medical therapeutics highlight 
their versatility and potential impact on improving patient outcomes. Their 
application spans cancer treatment, infectious diseases, and chronic conditions, 
allowing for precise drug delivery to specific tissues or cells, minimizing side 
effects, and enhancing therapeutic efficacy. Despite their potential, challenges 
such as scalability, manufacturing reproducibility, and regulatory hurdles must 
be addressed. Achieving clinical translation requires overcoming these obstacles 
to ensure therapeutic payloads' safe and efficient delivery. Strategies such as 
surface modification and incorporating stimuli-responsive elements enhanced NG 
performance and addressed specific therapeutic challenges. Advances in 
nanotechnology, biomaterials, and targeted drug design offer opportunities to 
improve the performance of NGs and address current limitations. Tailoring NGs 
for exploring combination therapies and integrating diagnostics for real-time 
monitoring represent promising avenues for future research. In conclusion, NG 
drug delivery systems have demonstrated tremendous potential in diverse disease 
applications. Overcoming challenges and leveraging emerging technologies will 
pave the way for their widespread clinical implementation, ushering in a new era 
of precision medicine and improved patient care.

Retroviruses are useful tools for the efficient delivery of genes to mammalian 
cells, owing to their ability to stably integrate into the host cell genome. 
Over the past few decades, retroviral vectors have been used in gene therapy 
clinical trials for the treatment of a number of inherited diseases and cancers. 
The earliest retrovirus vectors were based on simple oncogenic gammaretroviruses 
such as Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV) which, when pseudotyped with 
envelope proteins from other viruses such as the gibbon ape leukemia virus 
envelope protein (GALV) or vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSV-G), can 
efficiently introduce genes to a wide range of host cells. However, 
gammaretroviral vectors have the disadvantage that they are unable to 
efficiently transduce nondividing or slowly dividing cells. As a result, 
specific protocols have been developed to activate cells through the use of 
growth factors and cytokines. In the case of hematopoietic stem cells, 
activation has to be carefully controlled so that pluripotency is maintained. 
For many applications, gammaretroviral vectors are being superseded by 
lentiviral vectors based on human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) which 
has additional accessory proteins that enable integration in the absence of cell 
division. In addition, retroviral and lentiviral vector design has evolved to 
address a number of safety concerns. These include separate expression of the 
viral genes in trans to prevent recombination events leading to the generation 
of replication-competent viruses. Further, the development of self-inactivating 
(SIN) vectors reduces the potential for transactivation of neighboring genes and 
allows the incorporation of regulatory elements that may target gene expression 
more physiologically to particular cell types.

Earlier we had shown that the MDM2 inhibitor (MI-219) belonging to the 
spiro-oxindole family can synergistically enhance the efficacy of platinum 
chemotherapeutics leading to 50% tumor free survival in a genetically complex 
pancreatic ductaladenocarcinoma (PDAC) xenograft model. In this report, we have 
taken a systems and network modeling approach in order to understand central 
mechanisms behind MI219-oxaliplatin synergy with validation in PDAC, colon and 
breast cancer cell lines. Microarray profiling of drug treatments (MI-219, 
oxaliplatin or their combination) in capan-2 cells reveal a similar unique set 
of gene alterations that is duplicated in other solid tumor cells. As single 
agent, MI-219 or oxaliplatin induced alterations in 48 and 761 genes 
respectively. The combination treatment resulted in 767 gene alterations with 
emergence of 286 synergy unique genes. Ingenuity network modeling of combination 
and synergy unique genes showed the crucial role of five key local networks 
CREB, CARF, EGR1, NF-kB and E-Cadherin. Compared to single agents the 
combination treatment super induced p53 and p21 confirming functional synergy. 
Further, the network signatures were validated at the protein level in all three 
cell lines. Individually silencing central nodes in these five hubsinterfered 
with MI-219-oxaliplatin activity confirming their critical role in aiding p53 
mediated apoptotic response. We anticipate that our MI219-oxaliplatin network 
blueprints can be clinically translated in the rationale design and application 
of this unique therapeutic combination in a genetically pre-defined subset of 
patients.

MOTIVATION: Assessment of genetic mutations is an essential element in the 
modern era of personalized cancer treatment. Our strategy is focused on 
'multiple network analysis' in which we try to improve cancer diagnostics by 
using biological networks. Genetic alterations in some important hubs or in 
driver genes such as BRAF and TP53 play a critical role in regulating many 
important molecular processes. Most of the studies are focused on the analysis 
of the effects of single mutations, while tumors often carry mutations of 
multiple driver genes. The aim of this work is to define an innovative 
bioinformatics pipeline focused on the design and analysis of networks (such as 
biomedical and molecular networks), in order to: (1) improve the disease 
diagnosis; (2) identify the patients that could better respond to a given drug 
treatment; and (3) predict what are the primary and secondary effects of gene 
mutations involved in human diseases.
RESULTS: By using our pipeline based on a multiple network approach, it has been 
possible to demonstrate and validate what are the joint effects and changes of 
the molecular profile that occur in patients with metastatic colorectal 
carcinoma (mCRC) carrying mutations in multiple genes. In this way, we can 
identify the most suitable drugs for the therapy for the individual patient. 
This information is useful to improve precision medicine in cancer patients. As 
an application of our pipeline, the clinically significant case studies of a 
cohort of mCRC patients with the BRAF V600E-TP53 I195N missense combined 
mutation were considered.
AVAILABILITY: The procedures used in this paper are part of the Cytoscape Core, 
available at (www.cytoscape.org). Data used here on mCRC patients have been 
published in [55].

discussion of this case study and other cases is available at the journal site

The ability to safely control transgene expression with simple synthetic gene 
switches is critical for effective gene- and cell-based therapies. In the 
present study, the signaling pathway controlled by human transient receptor 
potential (TRP) melastatin 8 (hTRPM8), a TRP channel family member1, is 
harnessed to control transgene expression. Human TRPM8 signaling is stimulated 
by menthol, an innocuous, natural, cooling compound, or by exposure to a cool 
environment (15-18 °C). By functionally linking hTRPM8-induced signaling to a 
synthetic promoter containing elements that bind nuclear factor of activated T 
cells, a synthetic gene circuit was designed that can be adjusted by exposure to 
either a cool environment or menthol. It was shown that this gene switch is 
functional in various cell types and human primary cells, as well as in mice 
implanted with engineered cells. In response to transdermal delivery of menthol, 
microencapsulated cell implants harboring this gene circuit, coupled to 
expression of either of two therapeutic proteins, insulin or a modified, activin 
type IIB, receptor ligand trap protein (mActRIIBECD-hFc), could alleviate 
hyperglycemia in alloxan-treated mice (a model of type 1 diabetes) or reverse 
muscle atrophy in dexamethasone-treated mice (a model of muscle wasting), 
respectively. This fully human-derived orthogonal transgene switch should be 
amenable to a wide range of clinical applications.

Translation of mRNAs is a tightly regulated process in gene expression. In mRNA, 
the 5' untranslated region (5' UTR) controls ribosome recruitment and frequently 
contains structured elements that modulate translation efficacy. This study 
investigates stable structural motifs within the 5' UTR of DDX23 mRNA, encoding 
a protein relevant for anticancer therapy, as potential regulators and targets 
for antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs). Despite bioinformatic predictions and 
transcriptomic validations suggesting RNA G-quadruplex (rG4) formation, 
comprehensive structural analysis using a light-up assay and CD, UV, and NMR 
spectroscopy revealed that most putative rG4-forming sequences do not fold into 
stable rG4 structures, although one of them exists in an equilibrium between rG4 
and an alternative, likely hairpin, conformation. Reporter assays using a robust 
G4 stabilizer also argue against the significant regulatory role of rG4s in 
DDX23 mRNA translation. Instead, we identified and characterized a stable 
hairpin structure with potential regulatory function. Based on these findings, 
we designed fully locked nucleic acid (LNA)-modified ASOs to target this hairpin 
and regions flanking the upstream open reading frame (uORF) and start codon of 
the coding sequence. A reporter assay demonstrated that cap-proximal targeting 
achieved robust translation inhibition up to 80%. In contrast, targeting the 
efficiently translated uORF was ineffective, presumably due to steric hindrances 
from the ribosomal complex. The study yields crucial design principles for 
translation-regulating ASOs: avoid targeting regions shielded by efficient uORF 
translation and carefully tune ASO-RNA duplex stability to surpass endogenous 
structures without disrupting regulatory mechanisms. These findings provide 
insights into the regulation of DDX23 expression and establish a framework for 
developing ASO-based therapeutics with broad implications for mRNA targeting in 
anticancer applications.

Multidrug-resistant bacterial infections pose a severe global health threat, 
highlighting the urgent need for innovative therapeutic options beyond 
traditional antibiotics. Phage therapy, which employs bacteriophages to infect 
and eradicate pathogenic bacteria, specifically offers a promising solution. 
However, the lack of well-characterized therapeutic phages has limited their 
broader clinical use. A critical aspect of activating the lytic potential of 
dormant prophages involves the strategic manipulation of transcription factor 
binding sites (TFBS), which function as pivotal regulatory nodes governing the 
transition between lysogenic dormancy and lytic activation. Our platform 
utilizes advanced bioinformatics tools to accurately identify and analyze TFBS, 
facilitating the targeted redesign or replacement of these sites to disrupt 
host-mediated repression. By systematically simulating modifications of these 
regulatory 'switches,' our platform computationally predicts reduced repressor 
activity, suggesting the potential for prophage activation and bacterial cell 
lysis. This novel methodology not only broadens the spectrum of therapeutic 
bacteriophages but also establishes a basis for individualized phage-based 
therapies, presenting a robust strategy to address the escalating challenge of 
antibiotic-resistant infections. By enabling the precise identification and 
engineering of TFBS, our platform signifies a transformative advancement in 
phage biology, effectively bridging the divide between computational analysis 
and therapeutic application.

OBJECTIVES: Salubrious effects of the green coffee bean are purportedly 
secondary to high concentrations of chlorogenic acid. Chlorogenic acid has a 
molecular structure similar to bioflavonoids that activate transepithelial Cl(-) 
transport in sinonasal epithelia. In contrast to flavonoids, the drug is freely 
soluble in water. The objective of this study is to evaluate the Cl(-) secretory 
capability of chlorogenic acid and its potential as a therapeutic activator of 
mucus clearance in sinus disease.
STUDY DESIGN: Basic research.
SETTING: Laboratory.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Chlorogenic acid was tested on primary murine nasal septal 
epithelial (MNSE) (CFTR(+/+) and transgenic CFTR(-/-)) and human sinonasal 
epithelial (HSNE) (CFTR(+/+) and F508del/F508del) cultures under pharmacologic 
conditions in Ussing chambers to evaluate effects on transepithelial Cl(-) 
transport. Cellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), phosphorylation of 
the CFTR regulatory domain (R-D), and CFTR mRNA transcription were also 
measured.
RESULTS: Chlorogenic acid stimulated transepithelial Cl(-) secretion (change in 
short-circuit current [ΔISC = µA/cm(2)]) in MNSE (13.1 ± 0.9 vs 0.1 ± 0.1; P < 
.05) and HSNE (34.3 ± 0.9 vs 0.0 ± 0.1; P < .05). The drug had a long duration 
until peak effect at 15 to 30 minutes after application. Significant inhibition 
with INH-172 as well as absent stimulation in cultures lacking functional CFTR 
suggest effects are dependent on CFTR-mediated pathways. However, the absence of 
elevated cellular cAMP and phosphorylation the CFTR R-D indicates chlorogenic 
acid does not work through a PKA-dependent mechanism.
CONCLUSION: Chlorogenic acid is a water-soluble agent that promotes 
CFTR-mediated Cl(-) transport in mouse and human sinonasal epithelium. 
Translating activators of mucociliary transport to clinical use provides a new 
therapeutic approach to sinus disease. Further in vivo evaluation is planned.

Identifying tissue-specific molecular signatures of active regulatory elements 
is critical to understanding gene regulatory mechanisms. In this study, 
transcription start sites (TSS) and enhancers were identified using Cap analysis 
of gene expression (CAGE) across endometrial stromal cell (ESC) samples obtained 
from women with (n = 4) and without endometriosis (n = 4). ESC TSSs and 
enhancers were compared to those reported in other tissue and cell types in 
FANTOM5 and were integrated with RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data from the same samples 
for regulatory activity and network analyses. CAGE tag count differences between 
women with and without endometriosis were statistically tested and tags within 
close proximity to genetic variants associated with endometriosis risk were 
identified. Over 90% of tag clusters mapping to promoters were observed in cells 
and tissues in FANTOM5. However, some potential cell-type-specific promoters and 
enhancers were also observed. Regions of open chromatin identified using 
ATAC-seq provided further evidence of the active transcriptional regions 
identified by CAGE. Despite the small sample number, there was evidence of 
differences associated with endometriosis at 210 consensus clusters, including 
IGFBP5, CALD1 and OXTR. ESC TSSs were also located within loci associated with 
endometriosis risk from genome-wide association studies. This study provides 
novel evidence of transcriptional differences in endometrial stromal cells 
associated with endometriosis and provides a valuable cell-type specific 
resource of active TSSs and enhancers in endometrial stromal cells.

Tissue- or cell type- specific expression of transgenes is often essential for 
interrogation of biological phenomenon or predictable engineering of 
multicellular organisms but can be stymied by cryptic enhancers that make 
identification of promoters that generate desired expression profiles 
challenging. In plants the months-to-years long timeline associated with 
prototyping putative tissue-specific promoters in transgenic lines deepens this 
challenge. We have developed a novel strategy called Ribozyme Enabled Tissue 
Specificity (RETS) that leverages the knowledge of where and when genes are 
expressed derived from transcriptomic studies to enable tissue-specific 
expression without needing characterized promoters. It uses a split 
self-splicing ribozyme based on a group I intron from Tetrahymena thermophila to 
enable conditional reconstitution of a transgene mRNA in the presence of a 
secondary tissue-specific mRNA of choice. We elucidate the design features that 
enable flexible swapping of transgenes and targets, enhancing transgene 
expression, and circumventing host RNA interference responses. We then show that 
these innovations enable tissue-specific and dose-dependent expression of 
transgenes in Arabidopsis thaliana. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of RETS 
both for creating genetically encoded biosensors to study the spatiotemporal 
patterns of gene expression in planta as well as for engineering tissue-specific 
changes in organ size. RETS provides a novel avenue to study expression patterns 
of native loci with non-destructive imaging, complementing the weakness of 
existing approaches. Additionally, the spatiotemporal control of transgene 
expression afforded by RETS enables precision engineering of plant phenotypes 
which will facilitate enhancing crops without the trade-offs associated with 
constitutive expression.

Generating tamoxifen-inducible Cre alleles to investigate myogenesis in mice.

USA.

Gene inactivation has become the gold standard for determining gene function in 
the mouse. Many genes inactivated in the germ line cause early lethality that 
precludes phenotypic assessment at a later time point. Conditional gene 
inactivation using Cre recombinase expressed via a tissue specific 
promoter/enhancer allows phenotypic analyses of selected tissues, but lacks 
temporal control. Recent development of the tamoxifen-inducible Cre-ER (T2) 
offers both cell type-specific and temporal control of conditional gene 
inactivation. As an example, we describe the design and step-wise construction 
of a Cre-ER (T2) knock-in allele at the Pax7 locus using the recombineering 
method - Pax7 is selectively expressed in embryonic muscle progenitors and adult 
muscle stem cells. The resulting Pax7-Cre- ER (T2) (Pax7 (CE)) allele has been 
successfully applied to embryos and adults for tamoxifen-regulated myogenic 
lineage tracing and gene inactivation (Nature 460:627-631, 2009; Genesis 
48:424-436, 2010).

BACKGROUND: Structural variants (SVs) that disrupt topologically associating 
domains (TADs) can cause disease by rewiring enhancer-promoter interactions. 
Duplications involving GPR101 are known to cause X-linked acrogigantism (X-LAG) 
by enabling aberrant expression of GPR101 through hijacking of enhancers at 
VGLL1. However, not all GPR101-containing duplications are pathogenic, 
presenting a diagnostic challenge, especially in the prenatal setting.
METHODS: We evaluated POSTRE, a tool designed to predict the regulatory impact 
of SVs, to distinguish pathogenic from benign GPR101 duplications. We analyzed 
six non-pathogenic duplications, and 27 known X-LAG associated pathogenic 
duplications. Tissue-specific enhancer maps built using H3K27ac ChIP-seq and 
ATAC-seq data as well as gene expression data derived from human anterior 
pituitary samples were integrated into POSTRE to enable predictions in a X-LAG 
relevant tissue context.
RESULTS: POSTRE correctly classified all 33 duplications as benign or 
pathogenic. In addition, one X-LAG case with mild clinical features (e.g., 
severe GH hypersecretion in the absence of pituitary tumorigenesis) was found to 
include only 2/5 VGLL1 enhancers (also predicted to be the weakest enhancers), 
whereas all 26 typical X-LAG cases had ≥4 enhancers duplicated. This suggests 
that milder enhancer hijacking at VGLL1 could explain the different clinical 
features of X-LAG in this individual.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the utility of POSTRE to support diagnostic 
pipelines when interpreting SVs affecting chromatin architecture in pituitary 
disease. By accurately modelling enhancer adoption in a cell type-specific 
context, POSTRE could help to reduce uncertainty in genetic counselling and

Cis-regulatory elements (CREs) control gene expression, orchestrating tissue 
identity, developmental timing and stimulus responses, which collectively define 
the thousands of unique cell types in the body1-3. While there is great 
potential for strategically incorporating CREs in therapeutic or biotechnology 
applications that require tissue specificity, there is no guarantee that an 
optimal CRE for these intended purposes has arisen naturally. Here we present a 
platform to engineer and validate synthetic CREs capable of driving gene 
expression with programmed cell-type specificity. We take advantage of 
innovations in deep neural network modelling of CRE activity across three cell 
types, efficient in silico optimization and massively parallel reporter assays 
to design and empirically test thousands of CREs4-8. Through large-scale in 
vitro validation, we show that synthetic sequences are more effective at driving 
cell-type-specific expression in three cell lines compared with natural 
sequences from the human genome and achieve specificity in analogous tissues 
when tested in vivo. Synthetic sequences exhibit distinct motif vocabulary 
associated with activity in the on-target cell type and a simultaneous reduction 
in the activity of off-target cells. Together, we provide a generalizable 
framework to prospectively engineer CREs from massively parallel reporter assay 
models and demonstrate the required literacy to write fit-for-purpose regulatory 
code.

Small activating RNA (saRNA)-mediated gene activation has opened a new avenue 
for upregulating the expression of target genes by promoting endogenous 
transcription, a phenomenon known as RNA activation (RNAa). RNAa is distinct 
from the established RNAi mechanistic framework, although AGO2 is required by 
both. The precise mechanism of RNAa is currently disputable and has become a 
bottleneck in the development of this new technology. saRNA may achieve 
activation of target genes by directly binding to DNA targets in promoter, or 
interacting with antisense transcripts transcribed from overlapping promoter 
sequences, or by silencing other genes. In this chapter, we focused on recent 
development in our understanding of the target-recognition mechanism in RNAa. 
Conflicting results on saRNA targets are also discussed. Despite that the target 
mechanism of RNAa is more complex than expected and not completely understood so 
far, independent lines of evidence have suggested that saRNAs work by an 
"on-site" mechanism by binding to target genomic DNA in a 
"seed-region"-dependent manner. Finally, "off-target" effects of saRNA are 
observed and should be carefully controlled in designing experiments for and 
interpreting results from RNAa-related studies.

CRISPR-Cas is a powerful genome editing technology and has a great potential for 
in vivo gene therapy. Successful translational application of CRISPR-Cas to 
biomedicine still faces many safety concerns, including off-target side effect, 
cell fitness problem after CRISPR-Cas treatment, and on-target genome editing 
side effect in undesired tissues. To solve these issues, it is needed to design 
sgRNA with high cell-specific efficacy and specificity. Existing single-guide 
RNA (sgRNA) design tools mainly depend on a sgRNA sequence and the local 
information of the targeted genome, thus are not sufficient to account for the 
difference in the cellular response of the same gene in different cell types. To 
incorporate cell-specific information into the sgRNA design, we develop novel 
interpretable machine learning models, which integrate features learned from 
advanced transformer-based deep neural network with cell-specific gene property 
derived from biological network and gene expression profile, for the prediction 
of CRISPR-Cas9 and CRISPR-Cas12a efficacy and specificity. In benchmark studies, 
our models significantly outperform state-of-the-art algorithms. Furthermore, we 
find that the network-based gene property is critical for the prediction of 
cell-specific post-treatment cellular response. Our results suggest that the 
design of efficient and safe CRISPR-Cas needs to consider cell-specific 
information of genes. Our findings may bolster developing more accurate 
predictive models of CRISPR-Cas across a broad spectrum of biological conditions 
as well as provide new insight into developing efficient and safe CRISPR-based 
gene therapy.

The rapid advancement of genome editing technologies has opened up new 
possibilities in the field of medicine. Nuclease-based techniques such as the 
CRISPR/Cas9 system are now used to target genetically linked disorders that were 
previously hard-to-treat. The CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing approach wields several 
advantages over its contemporary editing systems, notably in the ease of 
component design, implementation and the option of multiplex genome editing. 
While results from the early phase clinical trials have been encouraging, the 
small patient population recruited into these trials hinders a conclusive 
assessment on the safety aspects of the CRISPR/Cas9 therapy. Potential safety 
concerns include the lack of fidelity in the CRISPR/Cas9 system which may lead 
to unintended DNA modifications at non-targeted gene loci. This review focuses 
modifications to the CRISPR/Cas9 components that can mitigate off-target effects 
in in vitro and preclinical models and its translatability to gene therapy in 
patient populations.

Genetic tools derived from the Cas9 RNA-guided nuclease are providing essential 
capabilities to study and engineer bacteria. While the importance of off-target 
effects was noted early in Cas9's application to mammalian cells, off-target 
cleavage by Cas9 in bacterial genomes is easily avoided due to their smaller 
size. Despite this, several studies have reported experimental setups in which 
Cas9 expression was toxic, even when using the catalytic dead variant of Cas9 
(dCas9). Specifically, dCas9 was shown to be toxic when in complex with guide 
RNAs sharing specific PAM (protospacer adjacent motif)-proximal sequence motifs. 
Here, we demonstrate that this toxicity is caused by off-target binding of Cas9 
to the promoter of essential genes, with silencing of off-target genes occurring 
with as little as 4 nt of identity in the PAM-proximal sequence. Screens 
performed in various strains of Escherichia coli and other enterobacteria show 
that the nature of toxic guide RNAs changes together with the evolution of 
sequences at off-target positions. These results highlight the potential for 
Cas9 to bind to hundreds of off-target positions in bacterial genomes, leading 
to undesired effects. This phenomenon must be considered in the design and 
interpretation of CRISPR-Cas experiments in bacteria.

Neurologic diseases tend to target various areas of the central nervous system 
(CNS) and can therefore result in paralysis, dementia, and death. 
Neurodegenerative diseases distinguish themselves from other diseases by 
affecting nerve cells, which unlike many other cells in our body cannot 
regenerate when severely injured. The discovery of RNA interference (RNAi) has 
enabled scientist to design new therapeutic approaches based on specific gene 
silencing rather than the canonical gene therapy through gene augmentation. Two 
types of molecules can be used for viral vector-mediated gene silencing: short 
hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) and artificial microRNAs (miRNAs) that have the ability to 
enter the RNAi pathway. Although both shRNAs and miRNAs can be used to silence 
genes, they enter the RNAi pathway at different points. Unlike shRNAs, miRNAs 
require an additional cleavage step inside the nucleus before being exported to 
the cytoplasm. These molecules can then be incorporated into the RNA-induced 
silencing complex (RISC) which utilizes sequence complementarity to recognize 
target mRNAs and activate either translational repression, in the case of 
partial complementarity, or induce mRNA cleavage in the case of complete 
complementarity. Elevated amounts of shRNAs, which are commonly driven by strong 
polymerase III promoters, can cause saturation of the endogenous RNAi machinery 
due to competition between endogenous and artificial molecules. Switching to a 
DNA polymerase II promoter is an alternative to reduce shRNA production, thereby 
reducing toxicity. Even though the molecules are designed to target specific 
mRNAs there may be off-target effects due to nonspecific binding that must be 
accounted for during the design process. In this chapter we discuss the design 
and in vitro screening of shRNAs and artificial miRNAs.

Next-generation DNA vectors for cancer immunotherapies and vaccine development 
require promoters eliciting predefined transcriptional activities specific to 
target cell types, such as dendritic cells (DCs), which underpin immune 
response. In this study, we describe the de novo design of DC-specific synthetic 
promoters via in silico assembly of cis-transcription factor response elements 
(TFREs) that harness the DC transcriptional landscape. Using computational 
genome mining approaches, candidate TFREs were identified within promoter 
sequences of highly expressed DC-specific genes or those exhibiting an 
upregulated expression during DC maturation. Individual TFREs were then screened 
in vitro in a target DC line and off-target cell lines derived from skeletal 
muscle, fibroblast, epithelial, and endothelial cells using homotypic (TFRE 
repeats in series) reporter constructs. Based on these data, a library of 
heterotypic promoter assemblies varying in the TFRE composition, copy number, 
and sequential arrangement was constructed and tested in vitro to identify 
DC-specific promoters. Analysis of the transcriptional activity and specificity 
of these promoters unraveled underlying design rules, primarily TFRE 
composition, which govern the DC-specific synthetic promoter activity. Using 
these design rules, a second library of exclusively DC-specific promoters 
exhibiting varied transcriptional activities was generated. All DC-specific 
synthetic promoter assemblies exhibited >5-fold activity in the target DC line 
relative to off-target cell lines, with transcriptional activities ranging from 
8 to 67% of the nonspecific human cytomegalovirus (hCMV-IE1) promoter. We show 
that bioinformatic analysis of a mammalian cell transcriptional landscape is an 
effective strategy for de novo design of cell-type-specific synthetic promoters 
with precisely controllable transcriptional activities.

RNA interference (RNAi) is an extremely useful tool for inhibiting gene 
expression. It can be triggered by transfected synthetic small interfering RNA 
(siRNA) or by expressed small hairpin RNA (shRNA). The cellular machinery 
processes the latter into siRNA in vivo. shRNA is preferred or required in 
genetic screens and specific RNAi approaches in gene therapy settings. Despite 
its many successes, the field of shRNAs faces many challenges. Insufficient 
knockdowns and off-target effects become obstacles for shRNA usage in many 
applications. Numerous failures are triggered by pitfalls in shRNA design that 
is often associated with impoverished biogenesis. Here, based on current 
understanding of the miRNA maturation pathway, we discuss the principles of 
different shRNA design (pre-miRNA-like, pri-miRNA-like and Ago-shRNA) with an 
emphasis on the RNA structure. We also provide detailed instructions for an 
optimal design of pre-miRNA-like shRNA.

Neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's 
disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis 
(ALS), are characterized by progressive neuronal degeneration and dysfunction. 
Of recent interest, a series of studies have been targeting the role of 
non-coding RNAs, particularly miRNAs and lncRNAs, in regulating gene expression 
and influencing cellular pathways that may play a critical role in the 
pathogenesis of these diseases. miRNAs regulate many biological processes by 
degrading or repressing the translation of target mRNAs, whereas lncRNAs act as 
scaffolds, sponges, and guides to control gene expression and cellular 
activities. Both miRNAs and lncRNAs participate in neurodegenerative mechanisms 
such as protein aggregation, inflammation, oxidative stress, and 
neuroinflammation. While targeting miRNAs and lncRNAs holds promise for 
potential therapeutic benefits, problems persist with their efficient delivery, 
specificity, and off-target effects. New techniques like viral vectors, lipid 
nanoparticles, and CRISPR-based gene editing will further enhance the 
development of therapies based on miRNA and lncRNA. Moreover, their interaction 
with regulatory networks may present new avenues toward understanding disease 
mechanisms and guiding therapeutic design. This review covers the role of miRNAs 
and lncRNAs in neurodegenerative disorders, their therapeutic potential, 
challenges, and future directions in ncRNA-based treatment approaches.

Synthetic networks require complex intertwined genetic regulation often relying 
on transcriptional activation or repression of target genes. CRISPRi-based 
transcription factors facilitate the programmable modulation of endogenous or 
synthetic promoter activity and the process can be optimised by using software 
to select appropriate gRNAs and limit non-specific gene modulation. Here, we 
develop a computational software pipeline, gDesigner, that enables the automated 
selection of orthogonal gRNAs with minimized off-target effects and promoter 
crosstalk. We next engineered a Lachnospiraceae bacterium Cas12a 
(dLbCas12a)-based repression system that downregulates target gene expression by 
means of steric hindrance of the cognate promoter. Finally, we generated a 
library of orthogonal synthetic dCas12a-repressed promoters and experimentally 
demonstrated it in HEK293FT, U2OS and H1299 cells lines. Our system expands the 
toolkit of mammalian synthetic promoters with a new complementary and orthogonal 
CRISPRi-based system, ultimately enabling the design of synthetic promoter 
libraries for multiplex gene perturbation that facilitate the understanding of 
complex cellular phenotypes.

RNA switches regulated by specific inducer molecules have become a powerful 
synthetic biology tool for precise gene regulation in mammalian systems. The 
engineered RNA switches can be integrated with natural RNA-mediated gene 
regulatory functions as a modular and customizable approach to probe and control 
cellular behavior. RNA switches have been used to advance synthetic biology 
applications, including gene therapy, bio-production, and cellular 
reprogramming. This review explores recent progress in the design and functional 
implementation of synthetic riboswitches in mammalian cells based on diverse RNA 
regulation mechanisms by highlighting recent studies and emerging technologies. 
We also discuss challenges such as off-target effects, system stability, and 
ligand delivery in complex biological environments. In conclusion, this review 
emphasizes the potential of synthetic riboswitches as a platform for 
customizable gene regulation in diverse biomedical applications.

cis-acting regulatory sequences and trans-acting factors. In the process of 
using a variety of reporter assays designed to study regulation of the rhodopsin 
(rho) promoter, we discovered that rhodopsin promoter-driven reporter expression 
could be activated by certain species of shRNA in a gene-target-independent but 
shRNA sequence-specific manner, suggesting involvement of a specific shRNA 
associated pathway. Interestingly, the shRNA-mediated increase of rhodopsin 
promoter activity was synergistically enhanced by the rhodopsin transcriptional 
regulators CRX and NRL. Additionally, the effect was cell line-dependent, 
suggesting that this pathway requires the expression of cell-type specific 
factors. Since microRNA (miRNA) and interferon response-mediated processes have 
been implicated in RNAi off-target phenomena, we performed miRNA and gene 
expression profiling on cells transfected with shRNAs that do target a specific 
gene but have varied effects on rho reporter expression in order to identify 
transcripts whose expression levels are associated with shRNA induced rhodopsin 
promoter reporter activity. We identified a total of 50 miRNA species, and by 
microarray analysis, 320 protein-coding genes, some of which were predicted 
targets of the identified differentially expressed miRNAs, whose expression was 
altered in the presence of shRNAs that stimulated rhodopsin-promoter activity in 
a non-gene-targeting manner. Consistent with earlier studies on shRNA off-target 
effects, a number of interferon response genes were among those identified to be 
upregulated. Taken together, our results confirm the importance of considering 
off-target effects when interpreting data from RNAi experiments and extend prior 
results by focusing on the importance of including multiple and carefully 
designed controls in the design and analysis of the effects of shRNA on 
transient transfection-based transcriptional assays.

Genetic design automation (GDA) tools hold promise to speed-up circuit design in 
synthetic biology. Their widespread adoption is hampered by their limited 
predictive power, resulting in frequent deviations between the in silico and in 
vivo performance of a genetic circuit. Context effects, i.e., the change in 
overall circuit functioning, due to the intracellular environment of the host 
and due to cross-talk among circuits components are believed to be a major 
source for the aforementioned deviations. Incorporating these effects in 
computational models of GDA tools is challenging but is expected to boost their 
predictive power and hence their deployment. Using fine-grained thermodynamic 
models of promoter activity, we show in this work how to account for two major 
components of cellular context effects: (i) crosstalk due to limited specificity 
of used regulators and (ii) titration of circuit regulators to off-target 
binding sites on the host genome. We show how we can compensate the incurred 
increase in computational complexity through dedicated branch-and-bound 
techniques during the technology mapping process. Using the synthesis of several 
combinational logic circuits based on Cello's device library as a case study, we 
analyze the effect of different intensities and distributions of crosstalk on 
circuit performance and on the usability of a given device library.

DNA methylation is an important epigenetic modification involved in gene 
regulation and transposable element silencing. Changes in DNA methylation can be 
heritable and, thus, can lead to the formation of stable epialleles. A 
well-characterized example of a stable epiallele in plants is fwa, which 
consists of the loss of DNA cytosine methylation (5mC) in the promoter of the 
FLOWERING WAGENINGEN (FWA) gene, causing up-regulation of FWA and a heritable 
late-flowering phenotype. Here we demonstrate that a fusion between the 
catalytic domain of the human demethylase TEN-ELEVEN TRANSLOCATION1 (TET1cd) and 
an artificial zinc finger (ZF) designed to target the FWA promoter can cause 
highly efficient targeted demethylation, FWA up-regulation, and a heritable 
late-flowering phenotype. Additional ZF-TET1cd fusions designed to target 
methylated regions of the CACTA1 transposon also caused targeted demethylation 
and changes in expression. Finally, we have developed a CRISPR/dCas9-based 
targeted demethylation system using the TET1cd and a modified SunTag system. 
Similar to the ZF-TET1cd fusions, the SunTag-TET1cd system is able to target 
demethylation and activate gene expression when directed to the FWA or CACTA1 
loci. Our study provides tools for targeted removal of 5mC at specific loci in 
the genome with high specificity and minimal off-target effects. These tools 
provide the opportunity to develop new epialleles for traits of interest, and to 
reactivate expression of previously silenced genes, transgenes, or transposons.

Dynamic systems biology aims to identify the molecular mechanisms governing cell 
fate decisions through the analysis of living cells. Large scale molecular 
information from living cells can be obtained from reporter constructs that 
provide activities for either individual transcription factors or multiple 
factors binding to the full promoter following CRISPR/Cas9 directed insertion of 
luciferase. In this report, we investigated the design criteria to obtain 
reporters that are specific and responsive to transcription factor (TF) binding 
and the integration of TF binding activity with genetic reporter activity. The 
design of TF reporters was investigated for the impact of consensus binding site 
spacing sequence and off-target binding on the reporter sensitivity using a 
library of 25 SMAD3 activity reporters with spacers of random composition and 
length. A spacer was necessary to quantify activity changes after TGFβ 
stimulation. TF binding site prediction algorithms (BEEML, FIMO and DeepBind) 
were used to predict off-target binding, and nonresponsiveness to a SMAD3 
reporter was correlated with a predicted competitive binding of constitutively 
active p53. The network of activity of the SMAD3 reporter was inferred from 
measurements of TF reporter library, and connected with large-scale genetic 
reporter activity measurements. The integration of TF and genetic reporters 
identified the major hubs directing responses to TGFβ, and this method provided 
a systems-level algorithm to investigate cell signaling.

We have recently demonstrated that genetic inactivation of EWSR1 : : FLI1 by 
CRISPR/Cas9, successfully blocks cell proliferation in a cell model of Ewing 
sarcoma. However, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing can exhibit off-target 
effects, and thus, precise regulation of Cas9 expression in target cells is 
essential to develop gene-editing strategies to inactivate EWSR1 : : FLI1 in 
Ewing sarcoma cells. In this study, we demonstrate that Cas9 can be specifically 
expressed in Ewing sarcoma cells when located downstream a promoter consisting 
of GGAA repeats and a consensus TATA box (GGAAprom). Under these conditions, 
Cas9 is selectively expressed in Ewing sarcoma cells that express EWSR1 : : FLI1 
oncoproteins, but not in cells expressing wild-type FLI1. Consequently, Ewing 
sarcoma cells infected with GGAAprom>Cas9 and a specific gRNA designed to 
inactivate EWSR1 : : FLI1, showed successful EWSR1 : : FLI1 inactivation and the 
subsequent blockade of cell proliferation. Notably, GGAAprom>Cas9 can be 
efficiently delivered to Ewing sarcoma cells via adenoviral vectors both in 
vitro and in vivo, highlighting the potential of this approach for Ewing sarcoma 
treatment. Our results demonstrate that the CRISPR/Cas9 machinery is safe and 
specific for Ewing sarcoma cells when driven under a GGAAprom, paving the way 
for the development of cancer gene therapies based on the selective expression 
of genes with therapeutic potential.

RNA interference (RNAi) is a post-transcriptional gene silencing mechanism that 
mediates the sequence-specific degradation of targeted RNA and thus provides a 
tremendous opportunity for development of oligonucleotide-based drugs. Here, we 
report on the design and validation of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting 
highly conserved regions of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) genome. To aim for 
therapeutic applications by optimizing the RNAi efficacy and reducing potential 
side effects, we considered different factors such as target RNA variations, 
thermodynamics and accessibility of the siRNA and target RNA, and off-target 
effects. This aim was achieved using an in silico design and selection protocol 
complemented by an automated MysiRNA-Designer pipeline. The protocol included 
the design and filtration of siRNAs targeting highly conserved and accessible 
regions within the HCV internal ribosome entry site, and adjacent core sequences 
of the viral genome with high-ranking efficacy scores. Off-target analysis 
excluded siRNAs with potential binding to human mRNAs. Under this strict 
selection process, two siRNAs (HCV353 and HCV258) were selected based on their 
predicted high specificity and potency. These siRNAs were tested for antiviral 
efficacy in HCV genotype 1 and 2 replicon cell lines. Both in silico-designed 
siRNAs efficiently inhibited HCV RNA replication, even at low concentrations and 
for short exposure times (24h); they also exceeded the antiviral potencies of 
reference siRNAs targeting HCV. Furthermore, HCV353 and HCV258 siRNAs also 
inhibited replication of patient-derived HCV genotype 4 isolates in infected 
Huh-7 cells. Prolonged treatment of HCV replicon cells with HCV353 did not 
result in the appearance of escape mutant viruses. Taken together, these results 
reveal the accuracy and strength of our integrated siRNA design and selection 
protocols. These protocols could be used to design highly potent and specific 
RNAi-based therapeutic oligonucleotide interventions.

Efficacy and safety considerations constitute essential steps during development 
of in vivo gene therapies. Herein, we evaluated efficacy and safety of splice 
factor-based treatments to correct mutation-induced splice defects in an Opa1 
mutant mouse line. We applied adeno-associated viruses to the retina. The 
viruses transduced retinal cells with an engineered U1 snRNA splice factor 
designed to correct the Opa1 splice defect. We found the treatment to be 
efficient in increasing wild-type Opa1 transcripts. Correspondingly, Opa1 
protein levels increased significantly in treated eyes. Measurements of retinal 
morphology and function did not reveal therapy-related side-effects supporting 
the short-term safety of the treatment. Alterations of potential off-target 
genes were not detected. Our data suggest that treatments of splice defects 
applying engineered U1 snRNAs represent a promising in vivo therapeutic 
approach. The therapy increased wild-type Opa1 transcripts and protein levels 
without detectable morphological, functional or genetic side-effects in the 
mouse eye. The U1 snRNA-based therapy can be tailored to specific disease gene 
mutations, hence, raising the possibility of a wider applicability of this 
promising technology towards treatment of different inherited retinal diseases.

RNA interference (RNAi) mediated by small interfering RNA (siRNA) is now widely 
used to knock down gene expression in a sequence-specific manner, making it a 
powerful tool not only for studying gene functions but also for therapeutic 
applications. siRNA decreases the expression level of the intended target gene 
with complete complementarity by cleaving its mRNA. However, the efficacy of 
each siRNA widely varies depending on its sequence in mammalian cells; only a 
limited fraction of randomly designed siRNAs is functional. Moreover, off-target 
silencing effects arise when the siRNA has partial complementarity in the seed 
region with unintended genes. Here, we describe the rational designing of 
functional, off-target effect-reduced siRNAs using siDirect 2.0 Web server 
(http://siDirect2.RNAi.jp/). By using the default parameters, siDirect 2.0 can 
design at least one qualified siRNA for >94% of human mRNA sequences in the 
RefSeq database.

Suicide genes have been widely investigated for their utility as therapeutic 
agents and as tools for in vitro negative selection strategies. Several methods 
for delivery of suicide genes have been explored. Two important considerations 
for delivery are the quantity of delivered cargo and the ability to target the 
cargo to specific cells. Delivery using a lentiviral vector is particularly 
attractive due to the ability to encode the gene within the viral genome, as 
well as the ability to limit off-target effects by using cell type-specific 
glycoproteins. Here, we present the design and validation of a diphtheria toxin 
A (DTA)-encoding lentiviral vector expressing DTA under the control of a 
constituitive promoter to allow for expression of DTA in a variety of cell 
types, with specificity provided via selection of glycoproteins for pseudotyping 
of the lentiviral particles. DTA exerts its toxic activity through inhibition of 
eukaryotic translation elongation factor 2 (eEF2) via adenosine diphosphate 
(ADP)-ribosylation of a modified histidine residue, diphthamide, at His715, 
which blocks protein translation and leads to cell death. Thus, we also detail 
development of DTA-resistant cell lines, engineered through CRISPR/Cas9-mediated 
knockout of the diphthamide 1 (DPH1) gene, which enable both robust virus 
production by transfection and evaluation of DTA-expressing virus infectivity.

Highly Specific Inhibition of c-Myc Oncogene Expression through Shifting the 
G-Quadruplex toward a Triplex Structure.

Lisowiec-Wąchnicka J, Zielińska K, Pasternak A.

G-quadruplexes act as transcriptional triggers in oncogenes, and small molecules 
targeting them show anticancer potential but lack sequence specificity, risking 
off-target effects. Here, we introduce original fold-back triplex-forming 
oligonucleotides (FTFOs) as precise alternatives. Physicochemical and biological 
analyses revealed that FTFOs unfold the c-Myc G-quadruplex and repress oncogene 
regulatory element by forming noncanonical triplexes that block G-quadruplex DNA 
from interacting with transcription factors. Derived design rules enabled the 
identification of FTFOs that reduce c-Myc expression in the Del4 plasmid by up 
to 80%, significantly impairing cancer cell growth, confluence, mobility, and 
endogenous c-Myc expression. This work presents FTFOs as an innovative 
sequence-specific strategy for arresting G-quadruplex structures via triplex 
formation and suppressing oncogene activity, offering a promising avenue for 
targeted anticancer therapy.

Retinal gene therapy is leading the neurological gene therapy field, with 32 
ongoing clinical trials of recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV)-based 
therapies. Importantly, over 50% of those trials are using restricted promoters 
from human genes. Promoters that restrict expression have demonstrated increased 
efficacy and can limit the therapeutic to the target cells thereby reducing 
unwanted off-target effects. Retinal ganglion cells are a critical target in 
ocular gene therapy; they are involved in common diseases such as glaucoma, rare 
diseases such as Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy, and in revolutionary 
optogenetic treatments. Here, we used computational biology and mined the human 
genome for the best genes from which to develop a novel minimal promoter 
element(s) designed for expression in restricted cell types (MiniPromoter) to 
improve the safety and efficacy of retinal ganglion cell gene therapy. Gene 
selection included the use of the first available droplet-based single-cell RNA 
sequencing (Drop-seq) dataset, and promoter design was bioinformatically driven 
and informed by a wide range of genomics datasets. We tested seven promoter 
designs from four genes in rAAV for specificity and quantified expression 
strength in retinal ganglion cells in mouse, and then the single best in 
nonhuman primate retina. Thus, we developed a new human-DNA MiniPromoter, Ple345 
(NEFL), which in combination with intravitreal delivery in rAAV9 showed specific 
and robust expression in the retinal ganglion cells of the nonhuman-primate 
rhesus macaque retina. In mouse, we also developed MiniPromoters expressing in 
retinal ganglion cells, the hippocampus of the brain, a pan neuronal pattern in 
the brain, and peripheral nerves. As single-cell transcriptomics such as 
Drop-seq become available for other cell types, many new opportunities for 
additional novel restricted MiniPromoters will present.

Promoting gene therapy: expression systems for transgenes and 
posttranscriptional gene silencing.

Unwalla HJ(1), Rossi JJ.

Hope, Graduate School of Biological Sciences, Duarte, CA 91010, USA.

In this review, we have discussed expression systems employed for both transgene 
expression and post-transcriptional gene silencing. Although constitutive 
expression systems can function well for gene therapy protocols for simple 
Mendelian disorders, other protocols may require carefully designed systems that 
either ensure targeting to cells of interest or alternatively, transcription 
that is tightly regulated and conditionally activated. Indeed, it is of utmost 
importance to regulate expression of potentially immunogenic proteins, such as 
those encoded by suicide genes, to limit their immunogenic potential. Meanwhile, 
RNAi may be employed for therapeutic silencing of aberrant cellular or viral 
genes, but the potential for off-target effects due to activation of 
double-stranded RNA response pathways or undesired targeting of partial 
complementary sequences may necessitate carefully controlled and regulated 
expression of short hairpin RNAs. As we exhaust the current repertoire of simple 
promoter systems for transgene expression or for RNAi, we need to develop newer 
systems that combine the high activity of viral promoters with cell type 
specificity or conditionally active cis-elements. Novel combinations of promoter 
elements should be one approach for creating such regulated promoters.

Antisense oligonucleotide (ASO)-mediated exon skipping is an effective method 
for generating truncated proteins by altering mRNA splicing. This technique, 
enabling in situ truncation of proteins, provides a rapid way to investigate the 
functions of specific domains encoded by the targeted exon(s). In this 
methodological chapter, we focus on the mouse transcription factor ARID3A 
(AT-rich interactive domain 3A), which contains a DNA-binding domain (ARID 
domain) and a nuclear matrix-binding domain (Rekles Beta domain). We describe 
the design of an ASO targeting the donor splice site of Arid3a exon 8, which 
primarily encodes the Rekles beta domain, to generate a truncated protein 
lacking nuclear matrix-binding capacity while preserving an open reading frame. 
The ASO is specifically designed to hybridize only with Arid3a pre-mRNA, thus 
minimizing off-target effects. The effect of the ASO is evaluated first by 
RT-PCR to measure the proportion of alternative transcripts with skipped exon. 
Alternative transcripts can be subsequently characterized by Sanger sequencing. 
RT-qPCR is then performed outside the targeted exon to ensure that the overall 
transcription of the gene is unaffected and to exclude RNA degradation. Finally, 
protein analysis techniques, such as cellular imaging using immunofluorescence 
labeling, are used to assess the production of the truncated protein. This 
ASO-mediated exon skipping approach provides a reliable method for exploring the 
functional importance of specific protein domains.

Transcriptional gene silencing (TGS) can be achieved by small RNAs targeted to 
upstream promoter regions. Previously we characterized siRNAs targeted to the 
HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter at site 247, and found that a 21-base 
antisense strand of siRNA-247 (LTR-247as) suppressed LTR-mediated expression. To 
characterize the specificity of LTR-247as, vectors expressing antisense RNAs 
targeted to a region spanning 50 bases up- and downstream of the 247 target site 
were generated. LTR-247as+7, a approximately 22 base antisense RNA that is 
shifted by only seven bases upstream of LTR-247as, showed a significant increase 
in LTR-driven reporter gene expression that was independent of cell type and 
active chromatin methyl-marks. Promoter-targeting siRNAs have been recently 
shown to induce gene activation. However, here we demonstrate gene activation 
via a sequence-specific off-target effect. Microarray analysis of 
LTR-247as+7-treated cultures resulted in the deregulation of approximately 185 
genes. A gene of unknown function, C10orf76, was responsive to inhibition by 
LTR-247as+7 and the loss of C10orf76 resulted in the upregulation of several 
genes that were activated by LTR-247as+7. These data suggest caution when using 
short antisense RNAs or siRNAs designed to target promoter sequences, since 
promoter-targeted RNAs may have unintended inhibitory effects against factors 
with suppressive gene activity.

A general method for the dynamic control of single gene expression in 
eukaryotes, with no off-target effects, is a long-sought tool for molecular and 
systems biologists. We engineered two artificial transcription factors (ATFs) 
that contain Cys(2)His(2) zinc-finger DNA-binding domains of either the mouse 
transcription factor Zif268 (9 bp of specificity) or a rationally designed array 
of four zinc fingers (12 bp of specificity). These domains were expressed as 
fusions to the human estrogen receptor and VP16 activation domain. The ATFs can 
rapidly induce a single gene driven by a synthetic promoter in response to 
introduction of an otherwise inert hormone with no detectable off-target 
effects. In the absence of inducer, the synthetic promoter is inactive and the 
regulated gene product is not detected. Following addition of inducer, 
transcripts are induced >50-fold within 15 min. We present a quantitative 
characterization of these ATFs and provide constructs for making their 
implementation straightforward. These new tools allow for the elucidation of 
regulatory network elements dynamically, which we demonstrate with a major 
metabolic regulator, Gcn4p.

Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) may apply to gene therapy, regenerative 
medicine in place of embryonic stem cells (ESCs). However, the application of 
SSCs was severely limited by the low induction efficiency and the lack of 
thorough analysis of the regulatory mechanisms of SSCs formation. Current 
evidences have demonstrated multiple marker genes of germ cells, while genes 
that specifically regulate the formation of SSCs have not been explored. In our 
study, cadherin-like and PC-esterase domain containing 1 (Cped1) expressed 
specifically in SSCs based on RNA-seq data analysis. To study the function of 
Cped1 in the formation of SSCs, we successfully established a CRISPR/Cas9 
knockout system. The gene disruption frequency is 37% in DF1 and 25% in ESCs 
without off-target effects. Knockout of Cped1 could significantly inhibit the 
formation of SSCs in vivo and in vitro The fragment of -1050 to -1 bp had the 
activity as Cped1 gene promoter. Histone acetylation could regulate the 
expression of Cped1. We added 5-azaeytidi (DNA methylation inhibitors) and TSA 
(histone deacetylase inhibitors) respectively during the cultivation of SSCs. 
TSA was validated to promote the transcription of Cped1. Dual-luciferase 
reporter assay revealed that active control area of the chicken Cped1 gene is 
-296 to -1 bp. There are Cebpb, Sp1, and Sox2 transcription factor binding sites 
in this region. Point-mutation experiment results showed that Sox2 negatively 
regulates the transcription of Cped1. Above results demonstrated that Cped1 is a 
key gene that regulates the formation of SSCs. Histone acetylation and 
transcription factor Sox2 participate in the regulation of Cped1.

Targeted DNA Methylation Using Modified DNA Probes: A Potential Therapeutic Tool 
for Depression and Stress-Related Disorders.

Epigenetic modifications play a crucial role in gene regulation and have been 
implicated in various physiological processes and disease conditions. DNA 
methylation (DNAm) has been implicated in the etiology and progression of many 
stress-related psychiatric behaviors, such as depression. The ability to 
manipulate DNAm may provide a means to reverse and treat such disorders. 
Although CRISPR-based technologies have enabled locus-specific DNAm editing, 
their clinical applicability may be limited due to immunogenicity concerns and 
off-target effects. In this study, we introduce a novel approach for targeted 
DNAm manipulation using single-stranded methylated DNA probes. The probes were 
designed against the GRE of FKBP5 and the promoter region of MAOA. In both human 
embryonic kidney HEK293 and mouse pituitary AtT-20 cells, transfection with 
their respective methylated probes significantly increased DNAm at targeted CpG 
sites in a persistent and dose-dependent manner. Importantly, the induced 
methylation effectively attenuated glucocorticoid-induced upregulation of FKBP5 
gene expression. Alteration of methylation was specific to single-stranded 
probes, as double-stranded methylated probes and unmethylated probes showed no 
significant effects. Some limitations include the need to further characterize 
factors that influence probe efficiency, such as probe length and CpG density; 
develop an efficient in vivo probe delivery system; and perform a more extensive 
consideration of possible off-target effects. Despite these limitations, our 
findings suggest that methylated DNA probes have the potential to function as a 
simple tool for targeted epigenetic manipulation and serve as a safer 
alternative to CRISPR-based epigenome editing tools for the treatment of 
stress-related disorders such as depression.

Podocyte injury is a key event in glomerular disease leading to proteinuria and 
opening the path toward glomerular scarring. As a consequence, glomerular 
research strives to discover molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways 
affecting podocyte health. The hNphs2.Cre mouse model has been a valuable tool 
to manipulate podocyte-specific genes and to label podocytes for lineage tracing 
and purification. Here we designed a novel podocyte-specific tricistronic Cre 
mouse model combining codon improved Cre expression and fluorescent cell 
labeling with mTomato under the control of the endogenous Nphs2 promoter using 
viral T2A-peptides. Independent expression of endogenous podocin, codon improved 
Cre, and mTomato was confirmed by immunofluorescence, fluorescent activated cell 
sorting and protein analyses. Nphs2pod.T2A.ciCre.T2A.mTomato/wild-type mice 
developed normally and did not show any signs of glomerular disease or 
off-target effects under basal conditions and in states of disease. 
Nphs2pod.T2A.ciCre.T2A.mTomato/wild-type-mediated gene recombination was 
superior to conventional hNphs2.Cre mice-mediated gene recombination. Last, we 
compared Cre efficiency in a disease model by mating 
Nphs2pod.T2A.ciCre.T2A.mTomato/wild-type and hNphs2.Cre mice to Phb2fl/fl mice. 
The podocyte-specific Phb2 knockout by Nphs2pod.T2A.ciCre.T2A.mTomato/wild-type 
mice resulted in an aggravated glomerular injury as compared to a 
podocyte-specific Phb2 gene deletion triggered by hNphs2.Cre. Thus, we generated 
the first tricistronic podocyte mouse model combining enhanced Cre recombinase 
efficiency and fluorescent labeling in podocytes without the need for additional 
matings with conventional reporter mouse lines.

Transcription factors (TFs) bind at multiple sites in the genome and regulate 
expression of many genes. Regulating TF binding in a gene specific manner 
remains a formidable challenge in drug discovery because the same binding motif 
may be present at multiple locations in the genome. Here, we present 
Onco-Regulon (http://www.scfbio-iitd.res.in/software/onco/NavSite/index.htm), an 
integrated database of regulatory motifs of cancer genes clubbed with Unique 
Sequence-Predictor (USP) a software suite that identifies unique sequences for 
each of these regulatory DNA motifs at the specified position in the genome. USP 
works by extending a given DNA motif, in 5'→3', 3' →5' or both directions by 
adding one nucleotide at each step, and calculates the frequency of each 
extended motif in the genome by Frequency Counter programme. This step is 
iterated till the frequency of the extended motif becomes unity in the genome. 
Thus, for each given motif, we get three possible unique sequences. Closest 
Sequence Finder program predicts off-target drug binding in the genome. 
Inclusion of DNA-Protein structural information further makes Onco-Regulon a 
highly informative repository for gene specific drug development. We believe 
that Onco-Regulon will help researchers to design drugs which will bind to an 
exclusive site in the genome with no off-target effects, theoretically.Database

Glycogen synthase kinase-3beta regulates post-myocardial infarction remodeling 
and stress-induced cardiomyocyte proliferation in vivo.

Woulfe KC(1), Gao E, Lal H, Harris D, Fan Q, Vagnozzi R, DeCaul M, Shang X,

University, Philadelphia, PA 19107, USA.

RATIONALE: Numerous studies have proposed that glycogen synthase kinase 
(GSK)-3beta is a central regulator of the hypertrophic response of 
cardiomyocytes. However, all of this work has relied on overexpression of 
GSK-3beta, expression of constitutively active mutants, or small molecule 
inhibitors with documented off-target effects. Genetic loss of function 
approaches have not been used in the adult mouse because germ-line deletion of 
GSK-3beta is embryonic-lethal.
OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to define the role played by GSK-3beta in 
pressure overload (PO)-induced hypertrophy and remodeling following myocardial 
infarction (MI).
METHODS AND RESULTS: We used a mouse model that allows inducible, 
cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of GSK-3beta in the adult knockout. 
Surprisingly, we find that knockout mice exposed to PO induced by thoracic 
aortic constriction exhibit a normal hypertrophic response. Thus, in contrast to 
virtually all prior published studies, GSK-3beta appears to play at most a minor 
role in the hypertrophic response to PO stress. However, GSK-3beta does regulate 
post-MI remodeling because the GSK-3beta knockouts had less left ventricular 
dilatation and better-preserved left ventricular function at up to 8 weeks 
post-MI despite demonstrating significantly more hypertrophy in the remote 
myocardium. Deletion of GSK-3beta also led to increased cardiomyocyte 
proliferation following PO and MI.
CONCLUSIONS: Deletion of GSK-3beta protects against post-MI remodeling and 
promotes stress-induced cardiomyocyte proliferation in the adult heart. These 
studies suggest that inhibition of GSK-3beta could be a strategy to both prevent 
remodeling and to promote cardiac regeneration in pathological states.

Identifying regulational alterations in gene regulatory networks by state space 
representation of vector autoregressive models and variational annealing.

BACKGROUND: In the analysis of effects by cell treatment such as drug dosing, 
identifying changes on gene network structures between normal and treated cells 
is a key task. A possible way for identifying the changes is to compare 
structures of networks estimated from data on normal and treated cells 
separately. However, this approach usually fails to estimate accurate gene 
networks due to the limited length of time series data and measurement noise. 
Thus, approaches that identify changes on regulations by using time series data 
on both conditions in an efficient manner are demanded.
METHODS: We propose a new statistical approach that is based on the state space 
representation of the vector autoregressive model and estimates gene networks on 
two different conditions in order to identify changes on regulations between the 
conditions. In the mathematical model of our approach, hidden binary variables 
are newly introduced to indicate the presence of regulations on each condition. 
The use of the hidden binary variables enables an efficient data usage; data on 
both conditions are used for commonly existing regulations, while for condition 
specific regulations corresponding data are only applied. Also, the similarity 
of networks on two conditions is automatically considered from the design of the 
potential function for the hidden binary variables. For the estimation of the 
hidden binary variables, we derive a new variational annealing method that 
searches the configuration of the binary variables maximizing the marginal 
likelihood.
RESULTS: For the performance evaluation, we use time series data from two 
topologically similar synthetic networks, and confirm that our proposed approach 
estimates commonly existing regulations as well as changes on regulations with 
higher coverage and precision than other existing approaches in almost all the 
experimental settings. For a real data application, our proposed approach is 
applied to time series data from normal Human lung cells and Human lung cells 
treated by stimulating EGF-receptors and dosing an anticancer drug termed 
Gefitinib. In the treated lung cells, a cancer cell condition is simulated by 
the stimulation of EGF-receptors, but the effect would be counteracted due to 
the selective inhibition of EGF-receptors by Gefitinib. However, gene expression 
profiles are actually different between the conditions, and the genes related to 
the identified changes are considered as possible off-targets of Gefitinib.
CONCLUSIONS: From the synthetically generated time series data, our proposed 
approach can identify changes on regulations more accurately than existing 
methods. By applying the proposed approach to the time series data on normal and 
treated Human lung cells, candidates of off-target genes of Gefitinib are found. 
According to the published clinical information, one of the genes can be related 
to a factor of interstitial pneumonia, which is known as a side effect of 
Gefitinib.

Studies of 3D chromatin organization have suggested that chromosomes are 
hierarchically organized into large compartments composed of smaller domains 
called topologically associating domains (TADs). Recent evidence suggests that 
compartments are smaller than previously thought and that the transcriptional or 
chromatin state is responsible for interactions leading to the formation of 
small compartmental domains in all organisms. In vertebrates, CTCF forms loop 
domains, probably via an extrusion process involving cohesin. CTCF loops 
cooperate with compartmental domains to establish the 3D organization of the 
genome. The continuous extrusion of the chromatin fibre by cohesin may also be 
responsible for the establishment of enhancer-promoter interactions and 
stochastic aspects of the transcription process. These observations suggest that 
the 3D organization of the genome is an emergent property of chromatin and its 
components, and thus may not be only a determinant but also a consequence of its 
function.

BACKGROUND: Transcriptional reconfiguration is central to heart failure, the 
most common cause of which is dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). The effect of 
3-dimensional chromatin topology on transcriptional dysregulation and 
pathogenesis in human DCM remains elusive.
METHODS: We generated a compendium of 3-dimensional epigenome and transcriptome 
maps from 101 biobanked human DCM and nonfailing heart tissues through highly 
integrative chromatin immunoprecipitation (H3K27ac [acetylation of lysine 27 on 
histone H3]), in situ high-throughput chromosome conformation capture, chromatin 
immunoprecipitation sequencing, assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using 
sequencing, and RNA sequencing. We used human induced pluripotent stem 
cell-derived cardiomyocytes and mouse models to interrogate the key 
transcription factor implicated in 3-dimensional chromatin organization and 
transcriptional regulation in DCM pathogenesis.
RESULTS: We discovered that the active regulatory elements (H3K27ac peaks) and 
their connectome (H3K27ac loops) were extensively reprogrammed in DCM hearts and 
contributed to transcriptional dysregulation implicated in DCM development. For 
example, we identified that nontranscribing NPPA-AS1 (natriuretic peptide A 
antisense RNA 1) promoter functions as an enhancer and physically interacts with 
the NPPA (natriuretic peptide A) and NPPB (natriuretic peptide B) promoters, 
leading to the cotranscription of NPPA and NPPB in DCM hearts. We revealed that 
DCM-enriched H3K27ac loops largely resided in conserved high-order chromatin 
architectures (compartments, topologically associating domains) and their 
anchors unexpectedly had equivalent chromatin accessibility. We discovered that 
the DCM-enriched H3K27ac loop anchors exhibited a strong enrichment for HAND1 
(heart and neural crest derivatives expressed 1), a key transcription factor 
involved in early cardiogenesis. In line with this, its protein expression was 
upregulated in human DCM and mouse failing hearts. To further validate whether 
HAND1 is a causal driver for the reprogramming of enhancer-promoter connectome 
in DCM hearts, we performed comprehensive 3-dimensional epigenome mappings in 
human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes. We found that forced 
overexpression of HAND1 in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived 
cardiomyocytes induced a distinct gain of enhancer-promoter connectivity and 
correspondingly increased the expression of their connected genes implicated in 
DCM pathogenesis, thus recapitulating the transcriptional signature in human DCM 
hearts. Electrophysiology analysis demonstrated that forced overexpression of 
HAND1 in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes induced 
abnormal calcium handling. Furthermore, cardiomyocyte-specific overexpression of 
Hand1 in the mouse hearts resulted in dilated cardiac remodeling with impaired 
contractility/Ca2+ handling in cardiomyocytes, increased ratio of heart 
weight/body weight, and compromised cardiac function, which were ascribed to 
recapitulation of transcriptional reprogramming in DCM.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provided novel chromatin topology insights into DCM 
pathogenesis and illustrated a model whereby a single transcription factor 
(HAND1) reprograms the genome-wide enhancer-promoter connectome to drive DCM 
pathogenesis.

The composition of muscle fibers, characterized by distinct contractile and 
metabolic properties, significantly influences meat quality and glucose 
homeostasis. However, the mechanisms by which three-dimensional (3D) genome 
topology integrates with epigenetic states to regulate muscle fiber 
specification and transformation remain poorly understood. Here, we present an 
integrative analysis of the transcriptome, epigenome, and 3D genome architecture 
in the slow-twitch glycolytic extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and fast-twitch 
oxidative soleus (SOL) muscles of the pig (Sus scrofa). Global remodeling of 
enhancer-promoter (E-P) interactions emerged as a central driver of 
transcriptional reprogramming associated with muscle contraction and glucose 
metabolism. We identified tissue-specific super-enhancers (SEs) that regulate 
muscle fiber-type specification through cooperation of chromatin looping and 
transcription factors such as KLF5. Notably, the SE-driven activation of STARD7 
facilitated the transformation of glycolytic fibers into oxidative fibers by 
mitigating reactive oxygen species levels and suppressing ERK MAPK signaling. 
This study elucidates the principles of 3D genome organization in the epigenetic 
regulation of muscle fiber specification and transformation, providing a 
foundation for novel therapeutic strategies targeting metabolic disorders and 
enhancing meat quality.

Sirtuins are pro-longevity genes with chromatin modulation potential, but how 
these properties are connected is not well understood. Here, we generated a 
panel of isogeneic human stem cell lines with SIRT1-SIRT7 knockouts and found 
that any sirtuin deficiency leads to accelerated cellular senescence. Through 
large-scale epigenomic analyses, we show how sirtuin deficiency alters genome 
organization and that genomic regions sensitive to sirtuin deficiency are 
preferentially enriched in active enhancers, thereby promoting interactions 
within topologically associated domains and the formation of de novo 
enhancer-promoter loops. In all sirtuin-deficient human stem cell lines, we 
found that chromatin contacts are rewired to promote aberrant activation of the 
placenta-specific gene PAPPA, which controls the pro-senescence effects 
associated with sirtuin deficiency and serves as a potential aging biomarker. 
Based on our survey of the 3D chromatin architecture, we established connections 
between sirtuins and potential target genes, thereby informing the development 
of strategies for aging interventions.

Three-dimensional (3D) genome folding has a fundamental role in the regulation 
of developmental genes by facilitating or constraining chromatin interactions 
between cis-regulatory elements (CREs). Polycomb response elements (PREs) are a 
specific kind of CRE involved in the memory of transcriptional states in 
Drosophila melanogaster. PREs act as nucleation sites for Polycomb group (PcG) 
proteins, which deposit the repressive histone mark H3K27me3, leading to the 
formation of a class of topologically associating domain (TAD) called a Polycomb 
domain. PREs can establish looping contacts that stabilize the gene repression 
of key developmental genes during development. However, the mechanism by which 
PRE loops fine-tune gene expression is unknown. Using clustered regularly 
interspaced short palindromic repeats and Cas9 genome engineering, we 
specifically perturbed PRE contacts or enhancer function and used complementary 
approaches including 4C-seq, Hi-C and Hi-M to analyze how chromatin architecture 
perturbation affects gene expression. Our results suggest that the PRE loop at 
the dac gene locus acts as a constitutive 3D chromatin scaffold during 
Drosophila development that forms independently of gene expression states and 
has a versatile function; it restricts enhancer-promoter communication and 
contributes to enhancer specificity.

The dynamics of three-dimensional (3D) genome organization are essential to 
transcriptional regulation. While enhancers regulate spatiotemporal gene 
expression, chromatin looping is a means for enhancer-promoter interactions 
yielding cell-type-specific gene expression. Further, non-canonical DNA 
secondary structures, such as G-quadruplexes (G4s), are related to increased 
gene expression. However, the role of G4s in promoter-distal regulatory 
elements, such as super-enhancers (SE), and in chromatin looping has remained 
elusive. Here we show that mature microRNA 9 (miR-9) is enriched at promoters 
and SE of genes that are inducible by transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFB1) 
signaling. Moreover, we find that miR-9 is required for formation of G4s, 
promoter-super-enhancer looping and broad domains of the euchromatin histone 
mark H3K4me3 at TGFB1-responsive genes. Our study places miR-9 in the same 
functional context with G4s and promoter-enhancer interactions during 3D genome 
organization and transcriptional activation induced by TGFB1 signaling, a 
critical signaling pathway in cancer and fibrosis.

Enhancers can regulate the promoters of their target genes over very large 
genomic distances. It is widely assumed that mechanisms of enhancer action 
involve the reorganization of three-dimensional chromatin architecture, but this 
is poorly understood. The predominant model involves physical enhancer-promoter 
interaction by looping out the intervening chromatin. However, studying the 
enhancer-driven activation of the Sonic hedgehog gene (Shh), we have identified 
a change in chromosome conformation that is incompatible with this simple 
looping model. Using super-resolution 3D-FISH and chromosome conformation 
capture, we observe a decreased spatial proximity between Shh and its enhancers 
during the differentiation of embryonic stem cells to neural progenitors. We 
show that this can be recapitulated by synthetic enhancer activation, is impeded 
by chromatin-bound proteins located between the enhancer and the promoter, and 
appears to involve the catalytic activity of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase. Our 
data suggest that models of enhancer-promoter communication need to encompass 
chromatin conformations other than looping.

It remains unclear why acute depletion of CTCF (CCCTC-binding factor) and 
cohesin only marginally affects expression of most genes despite substantially 
perturbing three-dimensional (3D) genome folding at the level of domains and 
structural loops. To address this conundrum, we used high-resolution Micro-C and 
nascent transcript profiling in mouse embryonic stem cells. We find that 
enhancer-promoter (E-P) interactions are largely insensitive to acute (3-h) 
depletion of CTCF, cohesin or WAPL. YY1 has been proposed as a structural 
regulator of E-P loops, but acute YY1 depletion also had minimal effects on E-P 
loops, transcription and 3D genome folding. Strikingly, live-cell, 
single-molecule imaging revealed that cohesin depletion reduced transcription 
factor (TF) binding to chromatin. Thus, although CTCF, cohesin, WAPL or YY1 is 
not required for the short-term maintenance of most E-P interactions and gene 
expression, our results suggest that cohesin may facilitate TFs to search for 
and bind their targets more efficiently.

Transcription reprogramming during cell differentiation involves targeting 
enhancers to genes responsible for establishment of cell fates. To understand 
the contribution of CTCF-mediated chromatin organization to cell lineage 
commitment, we analyzed 3D chromatin architecture during the differentiation of 
human embryonic stem cells into pancreatic islet organoids. We find that CTCF 
loops are formed and disassembled at different stages of the differentiation 
process by either recruitment of CTCF to new anchor sites or use of pre-existing 
sites not previously involved in loop formation. Recruitment of CTCF to new 
sites in the genome involves demethylation of H3K9me3 to H3K9me2, demethylation 
of DNA, recruitment of pioneer factors, and positioning of nucleosomes flanking 
the new CTCF sites. Existing CTCF sites not involved in loop formation become 
functional loop anchors via the establishment of new cohesin loading sites 
containing NIPBL and YY1 at sites between the new anchors. In both cases, 
formation of new CTCF loops leads to strengthening of enhancer promoter 
interactions and increased transcription of genes adjacent to loop anchors. 
These results suggest an important role for CTCF and cohesin in controlling gene 
expression during cell differentiation.

Healthy brain functioning requires a continuous fine-tuning of gene expression, 
involving changes in the epigenetic landscape and 3D chromatin organization. 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and 
frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are three multifactorial neurodegenerative 
diseases (NDDs) that are partially explained by genetics (gene mutations and 
genetic risk factors) and influenced by non-genetic factors (i.e., aging, 
lifestyle, and environmental conditions). Examining comprehensive studies of 
global and locus-specific (epi)genomic and transcriptomic alterations in human 
and mouse brain samples at the cell-type resolution has uncovered important 
phenomena associated with AD. First, DNA methylation and histone marks at 
promoters contribute to transcriptional dysregulation of genes that are directly 
implicated in AD pathogenesis (i.e., APP), neuroplasticity and cognition (i.e., 
PSD95), and microglial activation (i.e., TREM2). Second, the presence of AD 
genetic risk variants in cell-type-specific distal enhancers (i.e., BIN1 in 
microglia) alters transcription, presumably by disrupting associated 
enhancer-promoter interactions and chromatin looping. Third, epigenomic erosion 
is associated with widespread transcriptional disruption and cell identity loss. 
And fourth, aging, high cholesterol, air pollution, and pesticides have emerged 
as potential drivers of AD by inducing locus-specific and global epigenetic 
modifications that impact key AD-related pathways. Epigenetic studies in ALS/FTD 
also provide evidence that genetic and non-genetic factors alter gene expression 
profiles in neurons and astrocytes through aberrant epigenetic mechanisms. We 
additionally overview the recent development of potential new therapeutic 
strategies involving (epi)genetic editing and the use of small 
chromatin-modifying molecules (epidrugs).

In animals, memory formation and recall are essential for their survival and for 
adaptations to a complex and often dynamically changing environment. During 
memory formation, experiences prompt the activation of a selected and sparse 
population of cells (engram cells) that undergo persistent physical and/or 
chemical changes allowing long-term memory formation, which can last for 
decades. Over the past few decades, important progress has been made on 
elucidating signaling mechanisms by which synaptic transmission leads to the 
induction of activity-dependent gene regulation programs during the different 
phases of learning (acquisition, consolidation, and recall). But what are the 
molecular mechanisms that govern the expression of immediate-early genes (IEGs; 
c-fos, Npas4) and plasticity-related genes (PRGs; Dlg4/PSD95 and Grin2b/NR2B) in 
memory ensemble? Studies in relatively simple in vitro and in vivo neuronal 
model systems have demonstrated that synaptic activity during development, or 
when induced by chemical stimuli (i.e., cLTP, KCl, picrotoxin), activates the 
NMDAR-Ca2+-CREB signaling pathway that upregulates gene expression through 
changes in the epigenetic landscape (i.e., histone marks and DNA methylation) 
and/or 3D chromatin organization. The data support a model in which epigenetic 
modifications in promoters and enhancers facilitate the priming and activation 
of these regulatory regions, hence leading to the formation of enhancer-promoter 
interactions (EPIs) through chromatin looping. The exploration of whether 
similar molecular mechanisms drive gene expression in learning and memory has 
presented notable challenges due to the distinct phases of learning and the 
activation of only sparse population of cells (the engram). Consequently, such 
studies demand precise temporal and spatial control. By combining 
activity-dependent engram tagging strategies (i.e., TRAP mice) with multi-omics 
analyses (i.e., RNA-seq, ChiP-seq, ATAC-seq, and Hi-C), it has been recently 
possible to associate changes in the epigenomic landscape and/or 3D genome 
architecture with transcriptional waves in engram cells of mice subjected to 
contextual fear conditioning (CFC), a relevant one-shot Pavlovian learning task. 
These studies support the role of specific epigenetic mechanisms and of the 3D 
chromatin organization during the control of gene transcription waves in engram 
cells. Advancements in our comprehension of the molecular mechanisms driving 
memory ensemble will undoubtedly play a crucial role in the development of 
better-targeted strategies to tackle cognitive diseases, including Alzheimer's 
disease and frontotemporal dementia, among other information-processing 
disorders.

The chromatin organization in the 3D nuclear space is essential for genome 
functionality. This spatial organization encompasses different topologies at 
diverse scale lengths with chromosomes occupying distinct volumes and individual 
chromosomes folding into compartments, inside which the chromatin fiber is 
packed in large domains (as the topologically associating domains, TADs) and 
forms short-range interactions (as enhancer-promoter loops). The widespread 
adoption of high-throughput techniques derived from chromosome conformation 
capture (3C) has been instrumental in investigating the nuclear organization of 
chromatin. In particular, Hi-C has the potential to achieve the most 
comprehensive characterization of chromatin 3D structures, as in principle it 
can detect any pair of restriction fragments connected as a result of ligation 
by proximity. However, the analysis of the enormous amount of genomic data 
produced by Hi-C techniques requires the application of complex, multistep 
computational procedures that may constitute a difficult task also for expert 
computational biologists. In this chapter, we describe the computational 
analysis of Hi-C data obtained from the lymphoblastoid cell line GM12878, 
detailing the processing of raw data, the generation and normalization of the 
Hi-C contact map, the detection of TADs and chromatin interactions, and their 
visualization and annotation.

3D genome mapping aims at connecting the physics of chromatin folding to the 
underlying biological events, and applications of various chromosomal 
conformation capture (3C) assays continue to discover critical roles of genome 
folding in regulating nuclear functions. To interrogate the full spectrum of 
chromatin folding ranging from the level of nucleosomes to full chromosomes in 
mammals, we developed an enhanced 3C-based method called Micro-C. The protocol 
employs Micrococcal nuclease (MNase) to fragment the genome, which overcomes the 
resolution limit of restriction enzyme-based methods, enabling the estimation of 
contact frequencies between proximal nucleosomes. Such improvements successfully 
resolve the fine-scale level of chromatin folding, including enhancer-promoter 
or promoter-promoter interactions, genic and nucleosomal folding, and boost the 
signal-to-noise ratio in detecting loops and substructures underlying TADs. In 
this chapter, we will thoroughly discuss the details of the Micro-C protocol and 
critical parameters to consider for generating high-quality Micro-C maps.

Three-dimensional (3D) chromatin interactions, such as enhancer-promoter 
interactions (EPIs), loops, topologically associating domains (TADs), and A/B 
compartments, play critical roles in a wide range of cellular processes by 
regulating gene expression. Recent development of chromatin conformation capture 
technologies has enabled genome-wide profiling of various 3D structures, even 
with single cells. However, current catalogs of 3D structures remain incomplete 
and unreliable due to differences in technology, tools, and low data resolution. 
Machine learning methods have emerged as an alternative to obtain missing 3D 
interactions and/or improve resolution. Such methods frequently use genome 
annotation data (ChIP-seq, DNAse-seq, etc.), DNA sequencing information (k-mers 
and transcription factor binding site (TFBS) motifs), and other genomic 
properties to learn the associations between genomic features and chromatin 
interactions. In this review, we discuss computational tools for predicting 
three types of 3D interactions (EPIs, chromatin interactions, and TAD 
boundaries) and analyze their pros and cons. We also point out obstacles to the 
computational prediction of 3D interactions and suggest future research 
directions.

The establishment, maintenance and dynamic regulation of three-dimensional (3D) 
chromatin structures provide an important means for partitioning of genome into 
functionally distinctive domains, which helps to define specialized gene 
expression programs associated with developmental stages and cell types. 
Increasing evidence supports critical roles for intrinsically disordered regions 
(IDRs) harbored within transcription factors (TFs) and chromatin-modulatory 
proteins in inducing phase separation, a phenomenon of forming membrane-less 
condensates through partitioning of biomolecules. Such a process is also 
critically involved in the establishment of high-order chromatin structures and 
looping. IDR- and phase separation-driven 3D genome (re)organization often goes 
wrong in disease such as cancer. This review discusses about recent advances in 
understanding how phase separation of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) 
modulates chromatin looping and gene expression.

Mammalian genomes are organized and regulated through long-range chromatin 
interactions. Structural loops formed by CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) and cohesin 
fold the genome into domains, while enhancers interact with promoters across 
vast genomic distances to regulate gene expression. Although genomics and 
fixed-cell imaging approaches help illuminate many aspects of chromatin 
interactions, temporal information is usually lost. Here, we discuss how 3D 
super-resolution live-cell imaging (SRLCI) can resolve open questions on the 
dynamic formation and dissolution of chromatin interactions. We discuss SRLCI 
experimental design, implementation strategies, and data interpretation and 
highlight associated pitfalls. We conclude that, while technically demanding, 
SRLCI approaches will likely emerge as a critical tool to dynamically probe 3D 
genome structure and function and to study enhancer-promoter interactions and 
chromatin looping.

Developmental gene regulation requires input from enhancers spread over large 
genomic distances. Our understanding of long-range enhancer-promoter (E-P) 
communication, characterized as loops, remains incomplete without addressing the 
role of intervening chromatin. Here, we examine the topology of the entire Sonic 
hedgehog (Shh) regulatory domain in individual alleles from the mouse embryonic 
forebrain. Through sequential Oligopaint labeling and super-resolution 
microscopy, we find that the Shh locus maintains a compact structure that adopts 
several diverse configurations independent of Shh expression. The most frequent 
configuration contained distal E-P contacts at the expense of those more 
proximal to Shh, consistent with an interconnected loop. Genetic perturbations 
demonstrate that this long-range E-P communication operates by 
Shh-expression-independent and dependent mechanisms, involving CTCF binding 
sites and active enhancers, respectively. We propose a model whereby gene 
regulatory elements secure long-range E-P interactions amid an inherent 
architectural framework to coordinate spatiotemporal patterns of gene 
expression.

Mammalian chromosomes are organized at different length scales within the cell 
nucleus. Topologically Associating Domains (TADs) are structural units of 3D 
genome organization with functions in gene regulation, DNA replication, 
recombination and repair. Whereas TADs were initially interpreted as insulated 
domains, recent studies are revealing that these domains should be interpreted 
as dynamic collections of actively extruding loops. This process of loop 
extrusion is subsequently blocked at dedicated TAD boundaries, thereby promoting 
intra-domain interactions over their surroundings. In this review, we discuss 
how mammalian TAD structure can emerge from this dynamic process and we discuss 
recent evidence that TAD boundaries can have regulatory functions.

Several thousand sex-differential distal enhancers have been identified in mouse 
liver; however, their links to sex-biased genes and the impact of any 
sex-differences in nuclear organization and chromatin interactions are unknown. 
To address these issues, we first characterized 1847 mouse liver genomic regions 
showing significant sex differential occupancy by cohesin and CTCF, two key 3D 
nuclear organizing factors. These sex-differential binding sites were primarily 
distal to sex-biased genes but rarely generated sex-differential TAD 
(topologically associating domain) or intra-TAD loop anchors, and were sometimes 
found in TADs without sex-biased genes. A substantial subset of sex-biased 
cohesin-non-CTCF binding sites, but not sex-biased cohesin-and-CTCF binding 
sites, overlapped sex-biased enhancers. Cohesin depletion reduced the expression 
of male-biased genes with distal, but not proximal, sex-biased enhancers by 
>10-fold, implicating cohesin in long-range enhancer interactions regulating 
sex-biased genes. Using circularized chromosome conformation capture-based 
sequencing (4C-seq), we showed that sex differences in distal sex-biased 
enhancer-promoter interactions are common. Intra-TAD loops with sex-independent 
cohesin-and-CTCF anchors conferred sex specificity to chromatin interactions 
indirectly, by insulating sex-biased enhancer-promoter contacts and by bringing 
sex-biased genes into closer proximity to sex-biased enhancers. Furthermore, 
sex-differential chromatin interactions involving sex-biased gene promoters, 
enhancers, and lncRNAs were associated with sex-biased binding of cohesin and/or 
CTCF. These studies elucidate how 3D genome organization impacts sex-biased gene 
expression in a non-reproductive tissue through both direct and indirect effects 
of cohesin and CTCF looping on distal enhancer interactions with 
sex-differentially expressed genes.

Precise spatiotemporal regulation of gene expression is critical for the 
development and functioning of complex, multicellular organisms. Enhancers play 
a fundamental role in the regulation of gene expression, but the molecular 
underpinnings of enhancer-mediated gene activation remain poorly understood. 
Many mammalian genes are dependent on the activity of multiple enhancers, which 
can be separated from their target genes by large genomic distances. Accurate 
gene regulation therefore relies on specific interactions between enhancers and 
their target genes in 3D nuclear space. In this review, we discuss recent 
insights into the mechanisms by which enhancers cooperate to regulate precise 
and robust gene expression levels. We also review recent progress in our 
understanding of the molecular drivers of specific 3D interactions between 
enhancers and their target genes. We conclude by discussing current models of 
the molecular mechanisms by which enhancers activate gene expression in their 3D 
chromatin context.

CTCF is a highly conserved zinc-finger DNA-binding protein that mediates 
interactions between distant sequences in the genome. As a consequence, CTCF 
regulates enhancer-promoter interactions and contributes to the 
three-dimensional organization of the genome. Recent studies indicate that CTCF 
is developmentally regulated, suggesting that it plays a role in cell 
type-specific genome organization. Here, we review these studies and discuss how 
CTCF functions during the development of various cell and tissue types, ranging 
from embryonic stem cells and gametes, to neural, muscle and cardiac cells. We 
propose that the lineage-specific control of CTCF levels, and its partnership 
with lineage-specific transcription factors, allows for the control of cell 
type-specific gene expression via chromatin looping.

BACKGROUND: CTCF is a key insulator-binding protein, and mammalian genomes 
contain numerous CTCF sites, many of which are organized in tandem.
RESULTS: Using CRISPR DNA-fragment editing, in conjunction with chromosome 
conformation capture, we find that CTCF sites, if located between enhancers and 
promoters in the protocadherin (Pcdh) and β-globin clusters, function as an 
enhancer-blocking insulator by forming distinct directional chromatin loops, 
regardless whether enhancers contain CTCF sites or not. Moreover, computational 
simulation in silico and genetic deletions in vivo as well as dCas9 blocking in 
vitro revealed balanced promoter usage in cell populations and stochastic 
monoallelic expression in single cells by large arrays of tandem CTCF sites in 
the Pcdh and immunoglobulin heavy chain (Igh) clusters. Furthermore, CTCF 
insulators promote, counter-intuitively, long-range chromatin interactions with 
distal directional CTCF sites, consistent with the cohesin "loop extrusion" 
model. Finally, gene expression levels are negatively correlated with CTCF 
insulators located between enhancers and promoters on a genome-wide scale. Thus, 
single CTCF insulators ensure proper enhancer insulation and promoter activation 
while tandem CTCF topological insulators determine balanced spatial contacts and 
promoter choice.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings have interesting implications on the role of 
topological chromatin insulators in 3D genome folding and developmental gene 
regulation.

It is now widely appreciated that the spatial organization of the genome is 
nonrandom, and its complex 3D folding has important consequences for many genome 
processes. Recent developments in multiplexed, super-resolution microscopy have 
enabled an unprecedented view of the polymeric structure of chromatin - from the 
loose folds of whole chromosomes to the detailed loops of cis-regulatory 
elements that regulate gene expression. Facilitated by the use of robotics, 
microfluidics, and improved approaches to super-resolution, thousands to 
hundreds of thousands of individual cells can now be analyzed in an individual 
experiment. This has led to new insights into the nature of genomic structural 
features identified by sequencing, such as topologically associated domains 
(TADs), and the nature of enhancer-promoter interactions underlying 
transcriptional regulation. We review these recent improvements.

Three-Dimensional (3D) chromatin interactions, such as enhancer-promoter 
interactions (EPIs), loops, Topologically Associating Domains (TADs), and A/B 
compartments play critical roles in a wide range of cellular processes by 
regulating gene expression. Recent development of chromatin conformation capture 
technologies has enabled genome-wide profiling of various 3D structures, even 
with single cells. However, current catalogs of 3D structures remain incomplete 
and unreliable due to differences in technology, tools, and low data resolution. 
Machine learning methods have emerged as an alternative to obtain missing 3D 
interactions and/or improve resolution. Such methods frequently use genome 
annotation data (ChIP-seq, DNAse-seq, etc.), DNA sequencing information (k-mers, 
Transcription Factor Binding Site (TFBS) motifs), and other genomic properties 
to learn the associations between genomic features and chromatin interactions. 
In this review, we discuss computational tools for predicting three types of 3D 
interactions (EPIs, chromatin interactions, TAD boundaries) and analyze their 
pros and cons. We also point out obstacles of computational prediction of 3D 
interactions and suggest future research directions.

Genome-wide mapping of chromatin interactions at high resolution remains 
experimentally and computationally challenging. Here we used a low-input "easy 
Hi-C" protocol to map the 3D genome architecture in human neurogenesis and brain 
tissues and also demonstrated that a rigorous Hi-C bias-correction pipeline 
(HiCorr) can significantly improve the sensitivity and robustness of Hi-C loop 
identification at sub-TAD level, especially the enhancer-promoter (E-P) 
interactions. We used HiCorr to compare the high-resolution maps of chromatin 
interactions from 10 tissue or cell types with a focus on neurogenesis and brain 
tissues. We found that dynamic chromatin loops are better hallmarks for cellular 
differentiation than compartment switching. HiCorr allowed direct observation of 
cell-type- and differentiation-specific E-P aggregates spanning large 
neighborhoods, suggesting a mechanism that stabilizes enhancer contacts during 
development. Interestingly, we concluded that Hi-C loop outperforms eQTL in 
explaining neurological GWAS results, revealing a unique value of 
high-resolution 3D genome maps in elucidating the disease etiology.

Cohesin regulates gene expression through context-specific chromatin folding 
mechanisms such as enhancer-promoter looping and topologically associating 
domain (TAD) formation by cooperating with factors such as cohesin loaders and 
the insulation factor CTCF. We developed a computational workflow to explore how 
three-dimensional (3D) structure and gene expression are regulated collectively 
or individually by cohesin and related factors. The main component is CustardPy, 
by which multi-omics datasets are compared systematically. To validate our 
methodology, we generated 3D genome, transcriptome, and epigenome data before 
and after depletion of cohesin and related factors and compared the effects of 
depletion. We observed diverse effects on the 3D genome and transcriptome, and 
gene expression changes were correlated with the splitting of TADs caused by 
cohesin loss. We also observed variations in long-range interactions across 
TADs, which correlated with their epigenomic states. These computational tools 
and datasets will be valuable for 3D genome and epigenome studies.

The female mammalian brain exhibits sex hormone-driven plasticity during the 
reproductive period. Recent evidence implicates chromatin dynamics in gene 
regulation underlying this plasticity. However, whether ovarian hormones impact 
higher-order chromatin organization in post-mitotic neurons in vivo is unknown. 
Here, we mapped the 3D genome of ventral hippocampal neurons across the oestrous 
cycle and by sex in mice. In females, we find cycle-driven dynamism in 3D 
chromatin organization, including in oestrogen response elements-enriched X 
chromosome compartments, autosomal CTCF loops, and enhancer-promoter 
interactions. With rising oestrogen levels, the female 3D genome becomes more 
similar to the male 3D genome. Cyclical enhancer-promoter interactions are 
partially associated with gene expression and enriched for brain 
disorder-relevant genes and pathways. Our study reveals unique 3D genome 
dynamics in the female brain relevant to female-specific gene regulation, 
neuroplasticity, and disease risk.

The genome is compacted in the nucleus through a hierarchical chromatin 
organization, ranging from chromosome territories to compartments, topologically 
associating domains (TADs), and individual nucleosomes. Nucleosome remodeling 
complexes hydrolyze ATP to translocate DNA and thereby mobilize histone 
proteins. While nucleosome remodeling complexes have been extensively studied 
for their roles in regulating nucleosome positioning and accessibility, their 
contributions to higher-order chromatin architecture remain less well 
understood. Here, we investigate the roles of two key nucleosome remodelers, 
esBAF and INO80C, in shaping 3D genome organization in mouse embryonic stem 
cells. Using Hi-C, we find that loss of either remodeler has minimal effects on 
global compartment or TAD structures. In contrast, subcompartment organization 
is notably altered, suggesting that esBAF and INO80C contribute to finer-scale 
chromatin topology. To overcome the limited resolution of Hi-C for detecting 
regulatory loops, we employed promoter capture Micro-C (PCMC), which revealed 
that the loss of esBAF or INO80C alters a subset of promoter anchored looping 
interactions. Although these changes occur at distinct genomic loci for each 
remodeler, the affected sites are commonly enriched for bivalent chromatin 
regions bound by OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG (OSN), as well as BRG1 and INO80 
themselves. Together, our findings reveal that esBAF and INO80C selectively 
influence subcompartment identity and enhancer-promoter communication at key 
regulatory loci, highlighting a previously underappreciated role for nucleosome 
remodelers in higher-order chromatin organization.

Large eukaryotic genomes are packaged into the restricted area of the nucleus to 
protect the genetic code and provide a dedicated environment to read, copy and 
repair DNA. The physical organisation of the genome into chromatin loops and 
self-interacting domains provides the basic structural units of genome 
architecture. These structural arrangements are complex, multi-layered, and 
highly dynamic and influence how different regions of the genome interact. The 
role of chromatin structures during transcription via enhancer-promoter 
interactions is well established. Less understood is how nuclear architecture 
influences the plethora of chromatin transactions during DNA replication and 
repair. In this review, we discuss how genome architecture is regulated during 
the cell cycle to influence the positioning of replication origins and the 
coordination of DNA double strand break repair. The role of genome architecture 
in these cellular processes highlights its critical involvement in preserving 
genome integrity and cancer prevention.

The 3D organization of chromatin within the nucleus enables dynamic regulation 
and cell type-specific transcription of the genome. This is true at multiple 
levels of resolution: on a large scale, with chromosomes occupying distinct 
volumes (chromosome territories); at the level of individual chromatin fibers, 
which are organized into compartmentalized domains (e.g., Topologically 
Associating Domains-TADs), and at the level of short-range chromatin 
interactions between functional elements of the genome (e.g., enhancer-promoter 
loops).The widespread availability of Chromosome Conformation Capture (3C)-based 
high-throughput techniques has been instrumental in advancing our knowledge of 
chromatin nuclear organization. In particular, Hi-C has the potential to achieve 
the most comprehensive characterization of chromatin 3D interactions, as it is 
theoretically able to detect any pair of restriction fragments connected as a 
result of ligation by proximity.This chapter will illustrate how to compare the 
chromatin interactome in different experimental conditions, starting from 
pre-computed Hi-C contact matrices, how to visualize the results, and how to 
correlate the observed variations in chromatin interaction strength with changes 
in gene expression.

The genomes are organized into ordered and hierarchical topological structures 
in interphase nuclei. Within discrete territories of each chromosome, 
topologically associated domains (TADs) play important roles in various nuclear 
processes such as gene regulation. Inside TADs separated by relatively 
constitutive boundaries, distal elements regulate their gene targets through 
specific chromatin-looping contacts such as long-distance enhancer-promoter 
interactions. High-throughput sequencing studies have revealed millions of 
potential regulatory DNA elements, which are much more abundant than the mere 
∼20,000 genes they control. The recently emerged CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing 
technologies have enabled efficient and precise genetic and epigenetic 
manipulations of genomes. The multiplexed and high-throughput CRISPR 
capabilities facilitate the discovery and dissection of gene regulatory 
elements. Here, we describe the applications of CRISPR for genome, epigenome, 
and 3D genome editing, focusing on CRISPR DNA-fragment editing with Cas9 and a 
pair of sgRNAs to investigate topological folding of chromatin TADs and 
developmental gene regulation.

OBJECTIVES: Osteoarthritis is a complex disease with a huge public health 
burden. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of 
osteoarthritis-associated sequence variants, but the effector genes underpinning 
these signals remain largely elusive. Understanding chromosome organisation in 
three-dimensional (3D) space is essential for identifying long-range contacts 
between distant genomic features (e.g., between genes and regulatory elements), 
in a tissue-specific manner. Here, we generate the first whole genome chromosome 
conformation analysis (Hi-C) map of primary osteoarthritis chondrocytes and 
identify novel candidate effector genes for the disease.
METHODS: Primary chondrocytes collected from 8 patients with knee osteoarthritis 
underwent Hi-C analysis to link chromosomal structure to genomic sequence. The 
identified loops were then combined with osteoarthritis GWAS results and 
epigenomic data from primary knee osteoarthritis chondrocytes to identify 
variants involved in gene regulation via enhancer-promoter interactions.
RESULTS: We identified 345 genetic variants residing within chromatin loop 
anchors that are associated with 77 osteoarthritis GWAS signals. Ten of these 
variants reside directly in enhancer regions of 10 newly described active 
enhancer-promoter loops, identified with multiomics analysis of publicly 
available chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) and assay for 
transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) data from primary 
knee chondrocyte cells, pointing to two new candidate effector genes SPRY4 and 
PAPPA (pregnancy-associated plasma protein A) as well as further support for the 
gene SLC44A2 known to be involved in osteoarthritis. For example, PAPPA is 
directly associated with the turnover of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) 
proteins, and IGF-1 is an important factor in the repair of damaged 
chondrocytes.
CONCLUSIONS: We have constructed the first Hi-C map of primary human 
chondrocytes and have made it available as a resource for the scientific 
community. By integrating 3D genomics with large-scale genetic association and 
epigenetic data, we identify novel candidate effector genes for osteoarthritis, 
which enhance our understanding of disease and can serve as putative high-value 
novel drug targets.

Background: Doxorubicin resistance remains a major therapeutic challenge leading 
to poor survival prognosis and treatment failure in breast cancer. Although 
doxorubicin induces massive changes in the transcriptional landscape are well 
known, potential diagnostic or therapeutic targets associated with the 
reorganization of three-dimensional (3D) chromatin architecture have not yet 
been systematically investigated. Methods: Here we performed in situ 
high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) on parental and 
doxorubicin-resistant MCF7 (MCF7-DR) human breast cancer cells, followed by 
integrative analysis of HiC, ATAC-seq, RNA-seq and TCGA data. Results: It 
revealed that A/B compartment switching was positively correlated to genome-wide 
differential gene expression. The genome of MCF7-DR cells was spatially 
reorganized into smaller topologically associating domains (TADs) and chromatin 
loops. We also revealed the contribution of increased chromatin accessibility 
and potential transcription factor families, including CTCF, AP-1 and bHLH, to 
gained TADs or loops. Intriguingly, we observed two condensed genomic regions 
(∼20 kb) with decreased chromatin accessibility flanking TAD boundaries, which 
might play a critical role in the formation or maintenance of TADs. Finally, 
combining data from TCGA, we identified a number of gained and lost 
enhancer-promoter interactions and their corresponding differentially expressed 
genes involved in chromatin organization and breast cancer signaling pathways, 
including FA2H, FOXA1 and JRKL, which might serve as potential treatment targets 
for breast cancer. Conclusion: These data uncovered a close connection between 
3D genome reorganization, chromatin accessibility as well as gene transcription 
and provide novel insights into the epigenomic mechanisms involving doxorubicin 
resistance in breast cancer.

Evidence indicates that enhancers are transcriptionally active. Herein, we 
investigated transcriptionally active enhancers by using cap analysis of gene 
expression (CAGE) combined with epigenetic marks and chromatin interactions. We 
identified CAGE-tag highly active (CHA) enhancers as distant regulatory elements 
with CAGE-tag ≥ 90th percentile and overlapping with H3K27ac peaks (4.5% of 
enhancers). CHA enhancers were conserved between mouse and man and were 
independent from super-enhancers in predicting cell identity with lower 
P-values. CHA enhancers had increased open chromatin and a higher recruitment of 
cell-specific transcription factors as well as molecules involved in 3D genome 
interactions. HiChIP analysis of enhancer-promoter looping indicated that CHA 
enhancers had a higher density of anchor loops when compared to regular 
enhancers. A subset of CHA enhancers and promoters characterized by a high 
density of chromatin loops and forming hub regulatory units were connected to 
the promoter of immediate early response genes, genes involved in cancer and 
encoding for transcription factors. Promoter of genes within hub CHA regulatory 
units were less likely to be paused. CHA enhancers were enriched in gene 
variants associated with autoimmune disorders and had looping with causal 
candidate genes as revealed by Mendelian randomization. Hence, CHA enhancers 
form a dense hierarchical network of chromatin interactions between regulatory 
elements and genes involved in cell identity and disorders.

Chromatin looping is important for gene regulation, and studies of 3D chromatin 
structure across species and cell types have improved our understanding of the 
principles governing chromatin looping. However, 3D genome evolution and its 
relationship with natural selection remains largely unexplored. In mammals, the 
CTCF protein defines the boundaries of most chromatin loops, and variations in 
CTCF occupancy are associated with looping divergence. While many CTCF binding 
sites fall within transposable elements (TEs), their contribution to 3D 
chromatin structural evolution is unknown. Here we report the relative 
contributions of TE-driven CTCF binding site expansions to conserved and 
divergent chromatin looping in human and mouse. We demonstrate that TE-derived 
CTCF binding divergence may explain a large fraction of variable loops. These 
variable loops contribute significantly to corresponding gene expression 
variability across cells and species, possibly by refining sub-TAD-scale loop 
contacts responsible for cell-type-specific enhancer-promoter interactions.

Nuclear compartments are prominent features of 3D chromatin organization, but 
sequencing depth limitations have impeded investigation at ultra fine-scale. 
CTCF loops are generally studied at a finer scale, but the impact of looping on 
proximal interactions remains enigmatic. Here, we critically examine nuclear 
compartments and CTCF loop-proximal interactions using a combination of in situ 
Hi-C at unparalleled depth, algorithm development, and biophysical modeling. 
Producing a large Hi-C map with 33 billion contacts in conjunction with an 
algorithm for performing principal component analysis on sparse, super massive 
matrices (POSSUMM), we resolve compartments to 500 bp. Our results demonstrate 
that essentially all active promoters and distal enhancers localize in the A 
compartment, even when flanking sequences do not. Furthermore, we find that the 
TSS and TTS of paused genes are often segregated into separate compartments. We 
then identify diffuse interactions that radiate from CTCF loop anchors, which 
correlate with strong enhancer-promoter interactions and proximal transcription. 
We also find that these diffuse interactions depend on CTCF's RNA binding 
domains. In this work, we demonstrate features of fine-scale chromatin 
organization consistent with a revised model in which compartments are more 
precise than commonly thought while CTCF loops are more protracted.

TAD boundaries are genomic elements that separate biological processes in 
neighboring domains by blocking DNA loops that are formed through 
Cohesin-mediated loop extrusion. Most TAD boundaries consist of arrays of 
binding sites for the CTCF protein, whose interaction with the Cohesin complex 
blocks loop extrusion. TAD boundaries are not fully impermeable though and allow 
a limited amount of inter-TAD loop formation. Based on the reanalysis of Nano-C 
data, a multicontact Chromosome Conformation Capture assay, we propose a model 
whereby clustered CTCF binding sites promote the successive stalling of Cohesin 
and subsequent dissociation from the chromatin. A fraction of Cohesin 
nonetheless achieves boundary read-through. Due to a constant rate of Cohesin 
dissociation elsewhere in the genome, the maximum length of inter-TAD loops is 
restricted though. We speculate that the DNA-encoded organization of stalling 
sites regulates TAD boundary permeability and discuss implications for 
enhancer-promoter loop formation and other genomic processes.

Chromatin in the human brain cortex shows more enhancer-enhancer contacts than 
in macaques and mice, yet the organization of these contacts across cellular 
states and the mechanisms behind them remain unclear. Here, we developed 
simultaneous conformation and open-chromatin capture (SCOPE-C) to map open 
chromatin and its long-range spatial interactions from low-input samples. 
Applying SCOPE-C to fetal cortical cells from humans, macaques, and mice, we 
reveal that human neurogenesis is characterized by extended long-range (>1 
megabase [Mb]) enhancer-promoter loops formed via CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) 
mediated loop extrusion. In human excitatory neurons (ENs), these interactions 
establish dynamic networks spanning up to 10 Mb. These networks are enriched 
with human-biased enhancers and neuropsychiatric disorder-linked 
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) regulating key cell-fate genes such as 
SATB2. The formation of these vast, dynamic enhancer networks appears to be a 
prominent feature of human ENs, offering mechanistic insights into cortical 
evolution and the genetic vulnerability of neurodevelopmental regulation.

We identified and characterized multiple cell-type selective enhancers of the 
CFTR gene promoter in previous work and demonstrated active looping of these 
elements to the promoter. Here we address the impact of genomic spacing on these 
enhancer:promoter interactions and on CFTR gene expression. Using CRISPR/Cas9, 
we generated clonal cell lines with deletions between the -35 kb airway enhancer 
and the CFTR promoter in the 16HBE14o- airway cell line, or between the intron 1 
(185 + 10 kb) intestinal enhancer and the promoter in the Caco2 intestinal cell 
line. The effect of these deletions on CFTR transcript abundance, as well as the 
3D looping structure of the locus was investigated in triplicate clones of each 
modification. Our results indicate that both small and larger deletions upstream 
of the promoter can perturb CFTR expression and -35 kb enhancer:promoter 
interactions in the airway cells, though the larger deletions are more 
impactful. In contrast, the small intronic deletions have no effect on CFTR 
expression and intron 1 enhancer:promoter interactions in the intestinal cells, 
whereas larger deletions do. Clonal variation following a specific CFTR 
modification is a confounding factor particularly in 16HBE14o- cells.

The 3D organization of the genome constitutes a spatial layer of information 
processing that helps govern gene expression and thus cell function. Advances in 
chromosome conformation capture sequencing have enabled detailed assessment of 
chromatin architecture, from enhancer-promoter loops to topological domains and 
higher-order contacts, across cell types and developmental states. While the 
ability to investigate genome conformation is maturing, the field faces a 
central challenge: The link between chromatin interactions and cellular function 
remains largely correlative, leaving their causality unresolved. This review 
explores how recent developments in genome engineering enable the targeted 
manipulation of 3D chromatin architecture - specifically DNA loops - to 
illuminate causal links between genome structure and function. Synthetic 
strategies are introduced that rewire enhancer-promoter communication through 
engineered chromatin loops, leveraging programmable DNA-binding platforms such 
as zinc fingers, transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs), and 
CRISPR-Cas9. The current limitations of these approaches related to efficiency, 
scalability, and specificity are also highlighted, and the strategies to address 
them are outlined. As these systems mature, programmable 3D genome engineering 
is emerging as a transformative pillar of synthetic biology, complementing 
sequence-based editing as a core modality for both understanding and ultimately 
reprogramming genome function.

BACKGROUND: EGFR amplification and/or mutation are found in more than half of 
the cases with glioblastoma. Yet, the role of chromatin interactions and its 
regulation of gene expression in EGFR-amplified glioblastoma remains unclear.
METHODS: In this study, we explored alterations in 3D chromatin organization of 
EGFR-amplified glioblastoma and its subsequent impact by performing a 
comparative analysis of Hi-C, RNA-seq, and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) on 
EGFR-amplified glioblastoma-derived A172 and normal astrocytes (HA1800 cell 
line).
RESULTS: A172 cells showed an elevated chromatin relaxation, and unexpected 
entanglement of chromosome regions. A genome-wide landscape of switched 
compartments and differentially expressed genes between HA1800 and A172 cell 
lines demonstrated that compartment activation reshaped chromatin accessibility 
and activated tumorigenesis-related genes. Topological associating domain (TAD) 
analysis revealed that altered TAD domains in A172 also contribute to oncogene 
activation and tumor repressor deactivation. Interestingly, glioblastoma-derived 
A172 cells showed a different chromatin loop contact propensity. Genes in 
tumorigenesis-associated signaling pathways were significantly enriched at the 
anchor loci of altered chromatin loops. Oncogene activation and tumor repressor 
deactivation were associated with chromatin loop alteration. Structure 
variations (SVs) had a dramatic impact on the chromatin conformation of 
EGFR-amplified glioblastoma-derived tumor cells. Moreover, our results revealed 
that 7p11.2 duplication activated EGFR expression in EGFR-amplified glioblastoma 
via neo-TAD formation and novel enhancer-promoter interaction emergence between 
LINC01446 and EGFR.
CONCLUSIONS: The disordered 3D genomic map and multi-omics data of 
EGFR-amplified glioblastoma provide a resource for future interrogation of the 
relationship between chromatin interactions and transcriptome in tumorigenesis.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) relevant to osteoporosis have identified 
hundreds of loci; however, understanding how these variants influence the 
phenotype is complicated because most reside in non-coding DNA sequence that 
serves as transcriptional enhancers and repressors. To advance knowledge on 
these regulatory elements in osteoclasts (OCs), we performed Micro-C analysis, 
which informs on the genome topology of these cells and integrated the results 
with transcriptome and GWAS data to further define loci linked to BMD. Using 
blood cells isolated from 4 healthy participants aged 31-61 yr, we cultured OC 
in vitro and generated a Micro-C chromatin conformation capture dataset. We 
characterized chromatin loops (CLs) in OC from among more than 69 million 
chromatin interactions identified in the genome. Of the CL identified in OC, 
>16 000 were unique compared to precursor cells. When sentinel single nucleotide 
polymorphisms from osteoporosis and bone-related GWAS and those in linkage 
disequilibrium at r 2 > 0.6 were mapped to CL for OC, 12 588 of these variants 
were observed within chromatin contact regions. Notable in differential gene 
ontology enrichment analyses of the topology data for OC and precursors were 
pathways regulating pluripotency of stem cells, Wnt signaling, 
nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor signaling and 
chemokine signaling. These data, in combination with other 3D genome 
architecture and epigenetic data (eg, histone modifications and chromatin 
accessibility), will be useful in modeling to predict genome-wide, which 
enhancers regulate which genes in OC. This data will therefore also be 
informative for resolving GWAS hits. In conclusion, we have generated a 
high-resolution genome topology dataset for human OC and have used this to 
identify CLs relevant to studies of the genetics of osteoporosis. This data will 
serve as a powerful resource to inform future functional studies of OC biology.

Glioblastoma (GBM) remains one of the most aggressive and lethal forms of brain 
cancer, characterised by profound genetic, epigenetic, and phenotypic 
heterogeneity. Recent advancements in high-resolution genome mapping have 
unveiled the critical role of three-dimensional (3D) chromatin 
architecture-encompassing chromatin loops, topologically associating domains, 
and enhancer-promoter interactions-in driving GBM tumourigenesis and therapy 
resistance. This review summarises recent insights into the mechanistic 
contribution of 3D genome reorganisation in sustaining oncogenic transcriptional 
programs, promoting intratumoural heterogeneity, and facilitating adaptive 
resistance. We integrate molecular discoveries with clinical and therapeutic 
perspectives, emphasising the potential of epigenetic drugs to target 
disease-associated chromatin structures. Finally, we highlight unresolved 
questions and future directions in leveraging chromatin conformation data for 
precision oncology in GBM.

Numerous pieces of evidence support the complex, 3D spatial organization of the 
genome dictates gene expression. CTCF is essential to define topologically 
associated domain boundaries and to facilitate the formation of insulated 
chromatin loop structures. To understand CTCF's direct role in global 
transcriptional regulation, we integrated the miniAID-mClover3 cassette to the 
endogenous CTCF locus in a human pediatric B-ALL cell line, SEM, and an immortal 
erythroid precursor cell line, HUDEP-2, to allow for acute depletion of CTCF 
protein by the auxin-inducible degron system. In SEM cells, CTCF loss notably 
disrupted intra-TAD loops and TAD integrity in concurrence with a reduction in 
CTCF-binding affinity, while showing no perturbation to nuclear compartment 
integrity. Strikingly, the overall effect of CTCF's loss on transcription was 
minimal. Whole transcriptome analysis showed hundreds of genes differentially 
expressed in CTCF-depleted cells, among which MYC and a number of MYC target 
genes were specifically downregulated. Mechanically, acute depletion of CTCF 
disrupted the direct interaction between the MYC promoter and its distal 
enhancer cluster residing ∼1.8 Mb downstream. Notably, MYC expression was not 
profoundly affected upon CTCF loss in HUDEP-2 cells suggesting that CTCF could 
play a B-ALL cell line specific role in maintaining MYC expression.

3D genome alternations can dysregulate gene expression by rewiring 
enhancer-promoter interactions and lead to diseases. We report integrated 
analyses of 3D genome alterations and differential gene expressions in 18 newly 
diagnosed T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) patients and 4 healthy 
controls. 3D genome organizations at the levels of compartment, topologically 
associated domains and loop could hierarchically classify different subtypes of 
T-ALL according to T cell differentiation trajectory, similar to gene 
expressions-based classification. Thirty-four previously unrecognized 
translocations and 44 translocation-mediated neo-loops are mapped by Hi-C 
analysis. We find that neo-loops formed in the non-coding region of the genome 
could potentially regulate ectopic expressions of TLX3, TAL2 and HOXA 
transcription factors via enhancer hijacking. Importantly, both 
translocation-mediated neo-loops and NUP98-related fusions are associated with 
HOXA13 ectopic expressions. Patients with HOXA11-A13 expressions, but not other 
genes in the HOXA cluster, have immature immunophenotype and poor outcomes. 
Here, we highlight the potentially important roles of 3D genome alterations in 
the etiology and prognosis of T-ALL.

Cells in renewing tissues exhibit dramatic transcriptional changes as they 
differentiate. The contribution of chromatin looping to tissue renewal is 
incompletely understood. Enhancer-promoter interactions could be relatively 
stable as cells transition from progenitor to differentiated states; 
alternatively, chromatin looping could be as dynamic as the gene expression from 
their loci. The intestinal epithelium is the most rapidly renewing mammalian 
tissue. Proliferative cells in crypts of Lieberkühn sustain a stream of 
differentiated cells that are continually shed into the lumen. We apply 
chromosome conformation capture combined with chromatin immunoprecipitation 
(HiChIP) and sequencing to measure enhancer-promoter interactions in progenitor 
and differentiated cells of the intestinal epithelium. Despite dynamic gene 
regulation across the differentiation axis, we find that enhancer-promoter 
interactions are relatively stable. Functionally, we find HNF4 transcription 
factors are required for chromatin looping at target genes. Depletion of HNF4 
disrupts local chromatin looping, histone modifications, and target gene 
expression. This study provides insights into transcriptional regulatory 
mechanisms governing homeostasis in renewing tissues.

Ewing sarcoma is a prototypical fusion transcription factor-associated pediatric 
cancer that expresses EWS/FLI or a highly related FET/ETS chimera. EWS/FLI 
dysregulates transcription to induce and maintain sarcomagenesis, but the 
mechanisms utilized are not fully understood. We therefore sought to define the 
global effects of EWS/FLI on chromatin conformation and transcription in Ewing 
sarcoma cells using a well-validated 'knock-down/rescue' model of EWS/FLI 
function in combination with next generation sequencing assays to evaluate how 
the chromatin landscape changes with loss, and recovery, of EWS/FLI expression. 
We found that EWS/FLI (and EWS/ERG) genomic localization is largely conserved 
across multiple patient-derived Ewing sarcoma cell lines. This EWS/FLI binding 
signature is associated with establishment of topologically-associated domain 
(TAD) boundaries, compartment activation, enhancer-promoter looping that involve 
both intra- and inter-TAD interactions, and gene activation. In addition, 
EWS/FLI co-localizes with the loop-extrusion factor cohesin to promote chromatin 
loops and TAD boundaries. Importantly, local chromatin features provide the 
basis for transcriptional heterogeneity in regulation of direct EWS/FLI target 
genes across different Ewing sarcoma cell lines. These data demonstrate a key 
role of EWS/FLI in mediating genome-wide changes in chromatin configuration and 
support the notion that fusion transcription factors serve as master regulators 
of three-dimensional reprogramming of chromatin.

Genome-wide profiling of long-range interactions has revealed that the 
CCCTC-Binding factor (CTCF) often anchors chromatin loops and is enriched at 
boundaries of the so-called Topologically Associating Domains, which suggests 
that CTCF is essential in the 3D organization of chromatin. However, the 
systematic topological classification of pairwise CTCF-CTCF interactions has not 
been yet explored. Here, we developed a computational pipeline able to classify 
all CTCF-CTCF pairs according to their chromatin interactions from Hi-C 
experiments. The interaction profiles of all CTCF-CTCF pairs were further 
structurally clustered using self-organizing feature maps and their 
functionality characterized by their epigenetic states. The resulting clusters 
were then input to a convolutional neural network aiming at the de novo 
detecting chromatin loops from Hi-C interaction matrices. Our new method, called 
LOOPbit, is able to automatically detect significant interactions with a higher 
proportion of enhancer-promoter loops compared to other callers. Our highly 
specific loop caller adds a new layer of detail to the link between chromatin 
structure and function.

The molecular subtypes of pancreatic cancer (PC), either 
classical/progenitor-like or basal/squamous-like, are currently a major topic of 
research because of their direct association with clinical outcomes. Some 
transcription factors (TFs) have been reported to be associated with these 
subtypes. However, the mechanisms by which these molecular signatures of PCs are 
established remain unknown. Epigenetic regulatory processes, supported by 
dynamic changes in the chromatin structure, are essential for transcriptional 
profiles. Previously, we reported the importance of open chromatin profiles in 
the biological features and transcriptional status of PCs. Here, we aimed to 
analyze the relationships between three-dimensional (3D) genome structures and 
the molecular subtypes of human PCs using Hi-C analysis. We observed a 
correlation of the specific elements of 3D genome modules, including 
compartments, topologically associating domains, and enhancer-promoter loops, 
with the expression of related genes. We focused on HNF1B, a TF that is 
implicated in the progenitor subtype. Forced expression of HNF1B in 
squamous-type PC organoids induced the upregulation and downregulation of genes 
associated with progenitor and squamous subtypes, respectively. Long-range 
genomic interactions induced by HNF1B were accompanied by compartment modulation 
and H3K27ac redistribution. We also found that these HNF1B-induced changes in 
subtype-related gene expression required an intrinsically disordered region, 
suggesting a possible involvement of phase separation in compartment modulation. 
Thus, mapping of 3D structural changes induced by TFs, such as HNF1B, may become 
a useful resource for further understanding the molecular features of PCs.

Senescence is a state of stable proliferative arrest, generally accompanied by 
the senescence-associated secretory phenotype, which modulates tissue 
homeostasis. Enhancer-promoter interactions, facilitated by chromatin loops, 
play a key role in gene regulation but their relevance in senescence remains 
elusive. Here, we use Hi-C to show that oncogenic RAS-induced senescence in 
human diploid fibroblasts is accompanied by extensive enhancer-promoter 
rewiring, which is closely connected with dynamic cohesin binding to the genome. 
We find de novo cohesin peaks often at the 3' end of a subset of active genes. 
RAS-induced de novo cohesin peaks are transcription-dependent and enriched for 
senescence-associated genes, exemplified by IL1B, where de novo cohesin binding 
is involved in new loop formation. Similar IL1B induction with de novo cohesin 
appearance and new loop formation are observed in terminally differentiated 
macrophages, but not TNFα-treated cells. These results suggest that RAS-induced 
senescence represents a cell fate determination-like process characterised by a 
unique gene expression profile and 3D genome folding signature, mediated in part 
through cohesin redistribution on chromatin.

The gene-regulatory landscape of the brain is highly dynamic in health and 
disease, coordinating a menagerie of biological processes across distinct cell 
types. Here, we present a multi-omic single-nucleus study of 191,890 nuclei in 
late-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD), accessible through our web portal, 
profiling chromatin accessibility and gene expression in the same biological 
samples and uncovering vast cellular heterogeneity. We identified 
cell-type-specific, disease-associated candidate cis-regulatory elements and 
their candidate target genes, including an oligodendrocyte-associated regulatory 
module containing links to APOE and CLU. We describe cis-regulatory 
relationships in specific cell types at a subset of AD risk loci defined by 
genome-wide association studies, demonstrating the utility of this multi-omic 
single-nucleus approach. Trajectory analysis of glial populations identified 
disease-relevant transcription factors, such as SREBF1, and their regulatory 
targets. Finally, we introduce single-nucleus consensus weighted gene 
coexpression analysis, a coexpression network analysis strategy robust to sparse 
single-cell data, and perform a systems-level analysis of the AD transcriptome.

To identify cancer-associated gene regulatory changes, we generated single-cell 
chromatin accessibility landscapes across eight tumor types as part of The 
Cancer Genome Atlas. Tumor chromatin accessibility is strongly influenced by 
copy number alterations that can be used to identify subclones, yet underlying 
cis-regulatory landscapes retain cancer type-specific features. Using 
organ-matched healthy tissues, we identified the "nearest healthy" cell types in 
diverse cancers, demonstrating that the chromatin signature of 
basal-like-subtype breast cancer is most similar to secretory-type luminal 
epithelial cells. Neural network models trained to learn regulatory programs in 
cancer revealed enrichment of model-prioritized somatic noncoding mutations near 
cancer-associated genes, suggesting that dispersed, nonrecurrent, noncoding 
mutations in cancer are functional. Overall, these data and interpretable gene 
regulatory models for cancer and healthy tissue provide a framework for 
understanding cancer-specific gene regulation.

Successful pregnancy relies directly on the placenta's complex, dynamic, 
gene-regulatory networks. Disruption of this vast collection of intercellular 
and intracellular programs leads to pregnancy complications and developmental 
defects. In the present study, we generated a comprehensive, spatially resolved, 
multimodal cell census elucidating the molecular architecture of the first 
trimester human placenta. We utilized paired single-nucleus (sn)ATAC (assay for 
transposase accessible chromatin) sequencing and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), 
spatial snATAC-seq and RNA-seq, and in situ sequencing and hybridization mapping 
of transcriptomes at molecular resolution to spatially reconstruct the joint 
epigenomic and transcriptomic regulatory landscape. Paired analyses unraveled 
intricate tumor-like gene expression and transcription factor motif programs 
potentially sustaining the placenta in a hostile uterine environment; further 
investigation of gene-linked cis-regulatory elements revealed heightened 
regulatory complexity that may govern trophoblast differentiation and placental 
disease risk. Complementary spatial mapping techniques decoded these programs 
within the placental villous core and extravillous trophoblast cell column 
architecture while simultaneously revealing niche-establishing transcriptional 
elements and cell-cell communication. Finally, we computationally imputed 
genome-wide, multiomic single-cell profiles and spatially characterized the 
placental chromatin accessibility landscape. This spatially resolved, 
single-cell multiomic framework of the first trimester human placenta serves as 
a blueprint for future studies on early placental development and pregnancy.

We have produced gene expression profiles of all 302 neurons of the C. elegans 
nervous system that match the single-cell resolution of its anatomy and wiring 
diagram. Our results suggest that individual neuron classes can be solely 
identified by combinatorial expression of specific gene families. For example, 
each neuron class expresses distinct codes of ∼23 neuropeptide genes and ∼36 
neuropeptide receptors, delineating a complex and expansive "wireless" signaling 
network. To demonstrate the utility of this comprehensive gene expression 
catalog, we used computational approaches to (1) identify cis-regulatory 
elements for neuron-specific gene expression and (2) reveal adhesion proteins 
with potential roles in process placement and synaptic specificity. Our 
expression data are available at https://cengen.org and can be interrogated at 
the web application CengenApp. We expect that this neuron-specific directory of 
gene expression will spur investigations of underlying mechanisms that define 
anatomy, connectivity, and function throughout the C. elegans nervous system.

Improving effector activity of antigen-specific T cells is a major goal in 
cancer immunotherapy. Despite the identification of several effector T cell 
(TEFF)-driving transcription factors (TFs), the transcriptional coordination of 
TEFF biology remains poorly understood. We developed an in vivo T cell CRISPR 
screening platform and identified a key mechanism restraining TEFF biology 
through the ETS family TF, Fli1. Genetic deletion of Fli1 enhanced TEFF 
responses without compromising memory or exhaustion precursors. Fli1 restrained 
TEFF lineage differentiation by binding to cis-regulatory elements of 
effector-associated genes. Loss of Fli1 increased chromatin accessibility at 
ETS:RUNX motifs, allowing more efficient Runx3-driven TEFF biology. CD8+ T cells 
lacking Fli1 provided substantially better protection against multiple 
infections and tumors. These data indicate that Fli1 safeguards the developing 
CD8+ T cell transcriptional landscape from excessive ETS:RUNX-driven TEFF cell 
differentiation. Moreover, genetic deletion of Fli1 improves TEFF 
differentiation and protective immunity in infections and cancer.

Cis-regulatory elements (CREs) precisely control spatiotemporal gene expression 
in cells. Using a spatially resolved single-cell atlas of gene expression with 
chromatin accessibility across ten soybean tissues, we identified 103 distinct 
cell types and 303,199 accessible chromatin regions (ACRs). Nearly 40% of the 
ACRs showed cell-type-specific patterns and were enriched for transcription 
factor (TF) motifs defining diverse cell identities. We identified de novo 
enriched TF motifs and explored the conservation of gene regulatory networks 
underpinning legume symbiotic nitrogen fixation. With comprehensive 
developmental trajectories for endosperm and embryo, we uncovered the functional 
transition of the three sub-cell types of endosperm, identified 13 sucrose 
transporters sharing the DNA binding with one finger 11 (DOF11) motif that were 
co-upregulated in late peripheral endosperm, and identified key embryo cell-type 
specification regulators during embryogenesis, including a homeobox TF that 
promotes cotyledon parenchyma identity. This resource provides a valuable 
foundation for analyzing gene regulatory programs in soybean cell types across 
tissues and life stages.

A major driving force behind the evolution of species-specific traits and novel 
structures is alterations in gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Comprehending 
evolution therefore requires an understanding of the nature of changes in GRN 
structure and the responsible mechanisms. Here, we review two insect 
pigmentation GRNs in order to examine common themes in GRN evolution and to 
reveal some of the challenges associated with investigating changes in GRNs 
across different evolutionary distances at the molecular level. The pigmentation 
GRN in Drosophila melanogaster and other drosophilids is a well-defined network 
for which studies from closely related species illuminate the different ways 
co-option of regulators can occur. The pigmentation GRN for butterflies of the 
Heliconius species group is less fully detailed but it is emerging as a useful 
model for exploring important questions about redundancy and modularity in 
cis-regulatory systems. Both GRNs serve to highlight the ways in which 
redeployment of trans-acting factors can lead to GRN rewiring and network 
co-option. To gain insight into GRN evolution, we discuss the importance of 
defining GRN architecture at multiple levels both within and between species and 
of utilizing a range of complementary approaches.

Most mammalian genes have multiple polyA sites, representing a substantial 
source of transcript diversity regulated by the cleavage and polyadenylation 
(CPA) machinery. To better understand how these proteins govern polyA site 
choice, we introduce CPA-Perturb-seq, a multiplexed perturbation screen dataset 
of 42 CPA regulators with a 3' scRNA-seq readout that enables transcriptome-wide 
inference of polyA site usage. We develop a framework to detect 
perturbation-dependent changes in polyadenylation and characterize modules of 
co-regulated polyA sites. We find groups of intronic polyA sites regulated by 
distinct components of the nuclear RNA life cycle, including elongation, 
splicing, termination, and surveillance. We train and validate a deep neural 
network (APARENT-Perturb) for tandem polyA site usage, delineating a 
cis-regulatory code that predicts perturbation response and reveals interactions 
between regulatory complexes. Our work highlights the potential for multiplexed 
single-cell perturbation screens to further our understanding of 
post-transcriptional regulation.

Divergence of cis-regulatory elements drives species-specific traits1, but how 
this manifests in the evolution of the neocortex at the molecular and cellular 
level remains unclear. Here we investigated the gene regulatory programs in the 
primary motor cortex of human, macaque, marmoset and mouse using single-cell 
multiomics assays, generating gene expression, chromatin accessibility, DNA 
methylome and chromosomal conformation profiles from a total of over 200,000 
cells. From these data, we show evidence that divergence of transcription factor 
expression corresponds to species-specific epigenome landscapes. We find that 
conserved and divergent gene regulatory features are reflected in the evolution 
of the three-dimensional genome. Transposable elements contribute to nearly 80% 
of the human-specific candidate cis-regulatory elements in cortical cells. 
Through machine learning, we develop sequence-based predictors of candidate 
cis-regulatory elements in different species and demonstrate that the genomic 
regulatory syntax is highly preserved from rodents to primates. Finally, we show 
that epigenetic conservation combined with sequence similarity helps to uncover 
functional cis-regulatory elements and enhances our ability to interpret genetic 
variants contributing to neurological disease and traits.

Lineage-ambiguous leukemias are high-risk malignancies of poorly understood 
genetic basis. Here, we describe a distinct subgroup of acute leukemia with 
expression of myeloid, T lymphoid, and stem cell markers driven by aberrant 
allele-specific deregulation of BCL11B, a master transcription factor 
responsible for thymic T-lineage commitment and specification. Mechanistically, 
this deregulation was driven by chromosomal rearrangements that juxtapose BCL11B 
to superenhancers active in hematopoietic progenitors, or focal amplifications 
that generate a superenhancer from a noncoding element distal to BCL11B. 
Chromatin conformation analyses demonstrated long-range interactions of 
rearranged enhancers with the expressed BCL11B allele and association of BCL11B 
with activated hematopoietic progenitor cell cis-regulatory elements, suggesting 
BCL11B is aberrantly co-opted into a gene regulatory network that drives 
transformation by maintaining a progenitor state. These data support a role for 
ectopic BCL11B expression in primitive hematopoietic cells mediated by enhancer 
hijacking as an oncogenic driver of human lineage-ambiguous leukemia. 
SIGNIFICANCE: Lineage-ambiguous leukemias pose significant diagnostic and 
therapeutic challenges due to a poorly understood molecular and cellular basis. 
We identify oncogenic deregulation of BCL11B driven by diverse structural 
alterations, including de novo superenhancer generation, as the driving feature 
of a subset of lineage-ambiguous leukemias that transcend current diagnostic 
boundaries.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 2659.

Protein-RNA interactions are fundamental to core biological processes, such as 
mRNA splicing, localization, degradation, and translation. We developed a 
photoreactive nucleotide-enhanced UV crosslinking and oligo(dT) purification 
approach to identify the mRNA-bound proteome using quantitative proteomics and 
to display the protein occupancy on mRNA transcripts by next-generation 
sequencing. Application to a human embryonic kidney cell line identified close 
to 800 proteins. To our knowledge, nearly one-third were not previously 
annotated as RNA binding, and about 15% were not predictable by computational 
methods to interact with RNA. Protein occupancy profiling provides a 
transcriptome-wide catalog of potential cis-regulatory regions on mammalian 
mRNAs and showed that large stretches in 3' UTRs can be contacted by the 
mRNA-bound proteome, with numerous putative binding sites in regions harboring 
disease-associated nucleotide polymorphisms. Our observations indicate the 
presence of a large number of mRNA binders with diverse molecular functions 
participating in combinatorial posttranscriptional gene-expression networks.

Deuterostomes are one major group of bilaterians composed by hemichordates and 
echinoderms (collectively called Ambulacraria) and chordates. Comparative 
studies between these groups can provide valuable insights into the nature of 
the last common ancestor of deuterostomes and that of bilaterians. Indirect 
development of hemichordates, with larval phases similar to echinoderms and an 
adult body plan with an anteroposterior polarity like chordates and other 
bilaterians, makes them a suitable model for studying the molecular basis of 
development among deuterostomes. However, a comprehensive, quantitative 
catalogue of gene expression and chromatin dynamics in hemichordates is still 
lacking. In this study, we analysed the transcriptomes and chromatin 
accessibility of multiple developmental stages of the indirect-developing 
hemichordate Ptychodera flava. We observed that P. flava development is 
underpinned by a biphasic transcriptional program probably controlled by 
distinct genetic networks. Comparisons with other bilaterian species revealed 
similar transcriptional and regulatory dynamics during hemichordate 
gastrulation, cephalochordate neurulation and elongation stages of annelids. By 
means of regulatory networks analysis and functional validations by transgenesis 
experiments in echinoderms, we propose that gastrulation is the stage of highest 
molecular resemblance in deuterostomes and that much of the molecular basis of 
deuterostome development was probably present in the bilaterian last common 
ancestor.

Transcription factors (TFs) form the major class of regulatory genes and play 
key roles in multiple plant stress responses. In most eukaryotic plants, 
transcription factor (TF) families (WRKY, MADS-box and MYB) activate unique 
cellular-level abiotic and biotic stress-responsive strategies, which are 
considered as key determinants for defense and developmental processes. 
Arabidopsis and rice are two important representative model systems for dicot 
and monocot plants, respectively. A comprehensive comparative study on 101 
OsWRKY, 34 OsMADS box and 122 OsMYB genes (rice genome) and, 71 AtWRKY, 66 
AtMADS box and 144 AtMYB genes (Arabidopsis genome) showed various relationships 
among TFs across species. The phylogenetic analysis clustered WRKY, MADS-box and 
MYB TF family members into 10, 7 and 14 clades, respectively. All clades in WRKY 
and MYB TF families and almost half of the total number of clades in the 
MADS-box TF family are shared between both species. Chromosomal and gene 
structure analysis showed that the Arabidopsis-rice orthologous TF gene pairs 
were unevenly localized within their chromosomes whilst the distribution of 
exon-intron gene structure and motif conservation indicated plausible functional 
similarity in both species. The abiotic and biotic stress-responsive 
cis-regulatory element type and distribution patterns in the promoter regions of 
Arabidopsis and rice WRKY, MADS-box and MYB orthologous gene pairs provide 
better knowledge on their role as conserved regulators in both species. 
Co-expression network analysis showed the correlation between WRKY, MADs-box and 
MYB genes in each independent rice and Arabidopsis network indicating their role 
in stress responsiveness and developmental processes.

The zebrafish (Danio rerio) has been widely used in the study of human disease 
and development, and about 70% of the protein-coding genes are conserved between 
the two species1. However, studies in zebrafish remain constrained by the sparse 
annotation of functional control elements in the zebrafish genome. Here we 
performed RNA sequencing, assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using 
sequencing (ATAC-seq), chromatin immunoprecipitation with sequencing, 
whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, and chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) 
experiments in up to eleven adult and two embryonic tissues to generate a 
comprehensive map of transcriptomes, cis-regulatory elements, heterochromatin, 
methylomes and 3D genome organization in the zebrafish Tübingen reference 
strain. A comparison of zebrafish, human and mouse regulatory elements enabled 
the identification of both evolutionarily conserved and species-specific 
regulatory sequences and networks. We observed enrichment of evolutionary 
breakpoints at topologically associating domain boundaries, which were 
correlated with strong histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) and 
CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) signals. We performed single-cell ATAC-seq in 
zebrafish brain, which delineated 25 different clusters of cell types. By 
combining long-read DNA sequencing and Hi-C, we assembled the sex-determining 
chromosome 4 de novo. Overall, our work provides an additional epigenomic anchor 
for the functional annotation of vertebrate genomes and the study of 
evolutionarily conserved elements of 3D genome organization.

Most phenotype-associated genetic variants map to noncoding regulatory regions 
of the human genome, but their mechanisms remain elusive in most cases. We 
developed a highly efficient strategy, Perturb-multiome, to simultaneously 
profile chromatin accessibility and gene expression in single cells with 
CRISPR-mediated perturbation of master transcription factors (TFs). We examined 
the connection between TFs, accessible regions, and gene expression across the 
genome throughout hematopoietic differentiation. We discovered that variants 
within TF-sensitive accessible chromatin regions in erythroid differentiation, 
although representing <0.3% of the genome, show a ~100-fold enrichment for blood 
cell phenotype heritability, which is substantially higher than that for other 
accessible chromatin regions. Our approach facilitates large-scale mechanistic 
understanding of phenotype-associated genetic variants by connecting key 
cis-regulatory elements and their target genes within gene regulatory networks.

Gene expression is controlled by interactions between trans-regulatory factors 
and cis-regulatory DNA sequences, and these interactions constitute the 
essential functional linkages of gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Validation of 
GRN models requires experimental cis-regulatory tests of predicted linkages to 
authenticate their identities and proposed functions. However, cis-regulatory 
analysis is, at present, at a severe bottleneck in genomic system biology 
because of the demanding experimental methodologies currently in use for 
discovering cis-regulatory modules (CRMs), in the genome, and for measuring 
their activities. Here we demonstrate a high-throughput approach to both 
discovery and quantitative characterization of CRMs. The unique aspect is use of 
DNA sequence tags to "barcode" CRM expression constructs, which can then be 
mixed, injected together into sea urchin eggs, and subsequently deconvolved. 
This method has increased the rate of cis-regulatory analysis by >100-fold 
compared with conventional one-by-one reporter assays. The utility of the 
DNA-tag reporters was demonstrated by the rapid discovery of 81 active CRMs from 
37 previously unexplored sea urchin genes. We then obtained simultaneous 
high-resolution temporal characterization of the regulatory activities of more 
than 80 CRMs. On average 2-3 CRMs were discovered per gene. Comparison of 
endogenous gene expression profiles with those of the CRMs recovered from each 
gene showed that, for most cases, at least one CRM is active in each phase of 
endogenous expression, suggesting that CRM recovery was comprehensive. This 
approach will qualitatively alter the practice of GRN construction as well as 
validation, and will impact many additional areas of regulatory system biology.

Modularity and hierarchy in biological systems: Using gene regulatory networks 
to understand evolutionary change.

Modularity and hierarchy are important theoretical concepts in biology, and both 
are useful frameworks to understand the evolution of complex systems. Gene 
regulatory networks (GRNs) provide a powerful mechanistic model for modularity 
in animal development, as they are made up of modular (or self-contained) 
circuits, which are deployed in a hierarchical manner over time. Over the years, 
studies in the sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, have provided an 
illustrative example of how these regulatory circuits are responsible for 
processes such as cell differentiation and cell state specificity. However, GRNs 
are themselves made up of a nested series of interactions, as each gene can be 
regulated by multiple cis-regulatory elements, which can be further broken down 
into distinct transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). As a result, modularity 
can be applied to each "level" of this complex hierarchy. Throughout the 
literature, there is considerable discussion about the roles modular circuits, 
modular enhancers, and modular TFBS play in evolution, yet there is little 
discussion about how these nested interactions operate as a whole. In this 
chapter, we discuss how modular changes at different levels of the GRN hierarchy 
affect animal development and aim to provide a unified framework to understand 
the role of modularity in evolution.

Osteosarcoma is a relatively uncommon tumor that is defined histologically by 
malignant cells developing osteoid. Osteosarcomas are mesenchymal cell tumors 
that cause abnormal bone growth. A combination of genetic, epigenetic, and 
environmental factors leads mesenchymal stem cells to develop into bone 
precursor cells, resulting in osteosarcoma. Only tumor suppressor genes, such as 
p53, Rb, RECQL4, BLM, and WRN, have been detected in inherited family illnesses 
with an OS susceptibility. These genes, in particular, play an essential role in 
the development of OS in individuals. In this research, core genes responsible 
for OS were determined using a microarray and systems biology. 234 genes 
encoding overexpression and down-regulation were identified, among which 60 were 
considered as key genes, many of which had known roles in bone growth. 
Transcriptional regulatory networks were developed with this data and 
subsequently partitioned to define cis-regulatory modules. Results indicate that 
several OS-specific genes have strongly conserved the clustering of bone-related 
cis-regulatory modules, thus promoting the hypothesis that a bone-related gene 
network is essential for understanding OS biology and may play a role in bone 
contractility and anomalies.

The genomic instructions used to regulate development are encoded within a set 
of functional DNA elements called cis-regulatory modules (CRMs). These elements 
determine the precise patterns of temporal and spatial gene expression. Here we 
summarize recent progress made towards cataloguing and characterizing the 
complete repertoire of CRMs. We describe CRMs as genomic information processing 
devices containing clusters of transcription factor binding sites and we 
position CRMs as nodes within large gene regulatory networks. We define CRM 
architecture and describe how these genomic elements process the information 
they encode to their target genes. Furthermore, we present an overview 
describing high-throughput techniques to identify CRMs genome wide and 
experimental methodologies to validate their function on a large scale. This 
review emphasizes the advantages and power of a systems biology approach which 
integrates computational and experimental technologies to further our 
understanding of CRM function.

Gene regulatory networks determine cellular identity. In cancer, aberrations of 
gene networks are caused by driver mutations that often affect transcription 
factors and chromatin modifiers. Nevertheless, gene transcription in cancer 
follows the same cis-regulatory rules as normal cells, and cancer cells have 
served as convenient model systems to study transcriptional regulation. Tumours 
often show regulatory heterogeneity, with subpopulations of cells in different 
transcriptional states, which has important therapeutic implications. Here, we 
review recent experimental and computational techniques to reverse engineer 
cancer gene networks using transcriptome and epigenome data. New algorithms, 
data integration strategies, and increasing amounts of single cell genomics data 
provide exciting opportunities to model dynamic regulatory states at 
unprecedented resolution.

    PLoS Biol. 2:e441.

Relatively little is known about the mechanisms through which gene expression 
regulation evolves. To investigate this, we systematically explored the 
conservation of regulatory networks in fungi by examining the cis-regulatory 
elements that govern the expression of coregulated genes. We first identified 
groups of coregulated Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes enriched for genes with 
known upstream or downstream cis-regulatory sequences. Reasoning that many of 
these gene groups are coregulated in related species as well, we performed 
similar analyses on orthologs of coregulated S. cerevisiae genes in 13 other 
ascomycete species. We find that many species-specific gene groups are enriched 
for the same flanking regulatory sequences as those found in the orthologous 
gene groups fromS. cerevisiae, indicating that those regulatory systems have 
been conserved in multiple ascomycete species. In addition to these clear cases 
of regulatory conservation, we find examples of cis-element evolution that 
suggest multiple modes of regulatory diversification, including alterations in 
transcription factor-binding specificity, incorporation of new gene targets into 
an existing regulatory system, and cooption of regulatory systems to control a 
different set of genes. We investigated one example in greater detail by 
measuring the in vitro activity of the S. cerevisiae transcription factor Rpn4p 
and its orthologs from Candida albicans and Neurospora crassa. Our results 
suggest that the DNA binding specificity of these proteins has coevolved with 
the sequences found upstream of the Rpn4p target genes and suggest that Rpn4p 
has a different function in N. crassa.

The gene regulatory network basis of the "community effect," and analysis of a 
sea urchin embryo example.

Bolouri H(1), Davidson EH.

Author information:
(1)Division of Biology, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA 91125, 
USA.

The "Community Effect" denotes intra-territorial signaling amongst cells which 
constitute a particular tissue or embryonic progenitor field. The cells of the 
territory express the same transcriptional regulatory state, and the 
intra-territorial signaling is essential to maintenance of this specific 
regulatory state. The structure of the underlying gene regulatory network (GRN) 
subcircuitry explains the genomically wired mechanism by which community effect 
signaling is linked to the continuing transcriptional generation of the 
territorial regulatory state. A clear example is afforded by the oral ectoderm 
GRN of the sea urchin embryo where cis-regulatory evidence, experimental 
embryology, and network analysis combine to provide a complete picture. We 
review this example and consider less well known but similar cases in other 
developing systems where the same subcircuit GRN topology is present. To resolve 
mechanistic issues that arise in considering how community effect signaling 
could operate to produce its observed effects, we construct and analyze the 
behavior of a quantitative model of community effect signaling in the sea urchin 
embryo oral ectoderm. Community effect network topology could constitute part of 
the genomic regulatory code that defines transcriptional function in 
multicellular tissues composed of cells in contact, and hence may have arisen as 
a metazoan developmental strategy.

Wound response programs are often activated during neoplastic growth in tumors. 
In both wound repair and tumor growth, cells respond to acute stress and balance 
the activation of multiple programs, including apoptosis, proliferation, and 
cell migration. Central to those responses are the activation of the JNK/MAPK 
and JAK/STAT signaling pathways. Yet, to what extent these signaling cascades 
interact at the cis-regulatory level and how they orchestrate different 
regulatory and phenotypic responses is still unclear. Here, we aim to 
characterize the regulatory states that emerge and cooperate in the wound 
response, using the Drosophila melanogaster wing disc as a model system, and 
compare these with cancer cell states induced by rasV12scrib-/- in the eye disc. 
We used single-cell multiome profiling to derive enhancer gene regulatory 
networks (eGRNs) by integrating chromatin accessibility and gene expression 
signals. We identify a 'proliferative' eGRN, active in the majority of wounded 
cells and controlled by AP-1 and STAT. In a smaller, but distinct population of 
wound cells, a 'senescent' eGRN is activated and driven by C/EBP-like 
transcription factors (Irbp18, Xrp1, Slow border, and Vrille) and Scalloped. 
These two eGRN signatures are found to be active in tumor cells at both gene 
expression and chromatin accessibility levels. Our single-cell multiome and 
eGRNs resource offers an in-depth characterization of the senescence markers, 
together with a new perspective on the shared gene regulatory programs acting 
during wound response and oncogenesis.

The availability of genome sequences, genome-wide assays of transcription factor 
binding, and accessible chromatin maps have unveiled gene regulatory landscapes 
in plants. This understanding has ushered in comparative gene regulatory network 
studies that assess network rewiring between species, across time, and between 
biological tissues. Comparisons of cis-regulatory elements across the plant 
kingdom have uncovered examples of conserved sequences, but also of divergence, 
indicating that selective pressures can vary in different plant families. 
Transcription factor duplication, followed by spatiotemporal expression 
divergence of the duplicates, also appears to be a key mechanism of network 
evolution. Here, we review recent literature describing the regulation of gene 
expression in plants, and how comparative studies provide insights into how 
these regulatory interactions change and lead to gene regulatory network 
rewiring.

Developmental gene regulatory network evolution: insights from comparative 
studies in echinoderms.

Hinman VF(1), Cheatle Jarvela AM.

Author information:
(1)Department of Biological Sciences, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, 
Pennsylvania.

One of the central concerns of Evolutionary Developmental biology is to 
understand how the specification of cell types can change during evolution. In 
the last decade, developmental biology has progressed toward a systems level 
understanding of cell specification processes. In particular, the focus has been 
on determining the regulatory interactions of the repertoire of genes that make 
up gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Echinoderms provide an extraordinary model 
system for determining how GRNs evolve. This review highlights the comparative 
GRN analyses arising from the echinoderm system. This work shows that certain 
types of GRN subcircuits or motifs, i.e., those involving positive feedback, 
tend to be conserved and may provide a constraint on development. This 
conservation may be due to a required arrangement of transcription factor 
binding sites in cis regulatory modules. The review will also discuss ways in 
which novelty may arise, in particular through the co-option of regulatory genes 
and subcircuits. The development of the sea urchin larval skeleton, a novel 
feature that arose in echinoderms, has provided a model for study of co-option 
mechanisms. Finally, the types of GRNs that can permit the great diversity in 
the patterns of ciliary bands and their associated neurons found among these 
taxa are discussed. The availability of genomic resources is rapidly expanding 
for echinoderms, including genome sequences not only for multiple species of sea 
urchins but also a species of sea star, sea cucumber, and brittle star. This 
will enable echinoderms to become a particularly powerful system for 
understanding how developmental GRNs evolve.

For decades, the early development of the Xenopus embryo has been an essential 
model system to study the gene regulatory mechanisms that govern cellular 
specification. At the top of the hierarchy of gene regulatory networks, 
maternally deposited transcription factors initiate this process and regulate 
the expression of zygotic genes that give rise to three distinctive germ layer 
cell types (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm), and subsequent generation of 
organ precursors. The onset of germ layer specification is also closely coupled 
with changes associated with chromatin modifications. This review will examine 
the timing of maternal transcription factors initiating the zygotic genome 
activation, the epigenetic landscape of embryonic chromatin, and the network 
structure that governs the process.

Transcriptional regulation is crucial to control of gene expression. Both 
spatio-temporal expression patterns and expression levels of genes are 
determined by the interaction between cis-acting elements and trans-acting 
factors. Numerous studies have focused on the trans-acting factors that mediate 
transcriptional regulatory networks. However, cis-acting elements, such as 
enhancers, silencers, transposons, and natural variations in the genome, are 
also vital for gene expression regulation and could be utilized by clustered 
regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated 
protein 9 (Cas9)-mediated gene editing to improve crop quality and yield. In 
this review, we discuss current understanding of cis-element-mediated 
transcriptional regulation in major crops, including rice (Oryza sativa), wheat 
(Triticum aestivum), and maize (Zea mays), as well as the latest advancements in 
gene editing techniques and their applications in crops to highlight prospective 
strategies for crop breeding.

Differential gene expression is the core of development, mediating the genetic 
changes necessary for determining cell identity. The regulation of gene activity 
by cis-acting elements (e.g., enhancers) is a crucial mechanism for determining 
differential gene activity by precise control of gene expression in embryonic 
space and time. Modifications to regulatory regions can have profound impacts on 
phenotype, and therefore developmental and evolutionary biologists have 
increasingly focused on elucidating the transcriptional control of genes that 
build and pattern body plans. Here, we trace the evolutionary history of 
transcriptional control of three loci key to vertebrate appendage development 
(Fgf8, Shh, and HoxD/A). Within and across these regulatory modules, we find 
both complex and flexible regulation in contrast with more fixed enhancers that 
appear unchanged over vast timescales of vertebrate evolution. The 
transcriptional control of vertebrate appendage development was likely already 
incredibly complex in the common ancestor of fish, implying that subtle changes 
to regulatory networks were more likely responsible for alterations in phenotype 
rather than the de novo addition of whole regulatory domains. Finally, we 
discuss the dangers of relying on inter-species transgenesis when testing 
enhancer function, and call for more controlled regulatory swap experiments when 
inferring the evolutionary history of enhancer elements.

Segmental arithmetic: summing up the Hox gene regulatory network for hindbrain

Organization and development of the early vertebrate hindbrain are controlled by 
a cascade of regulatory interactions that govern the process of segmentation and 
patterning along the anterior-posterior axis via Hox genes. These interactions 
can be assembled into a gene regulatory network that provides a framework to 
interpret experimental data, generate hypotheses, and identify gaps in our 
understanding of the progressive process of hindbrain segmentation. The network 
can be broadly separated into a series of interconnected programs that govern 
early signaling, segmental subdivision, secondary signaling, segmentation, and 
ultimately specification of segmental identity. Hox genes play crucial roles in 
multiple programs within this network. Furthermore, the network reveals 
properties and principles that are likely to be general to other complex 
developmental systems. Data from vertebrate and invertebrate chordate models are 
shedding light on the origin and diversification of the network. Comprehensive 
cis-regulatory analyses of vertebrate Hox gene regulation have enabled powerful 
cross-species gene regulatory comparisons. Such an approach in the sea lamprey 
has revealed that the network mediating segmental Hox expression was present in 
ancestral vertebrates and has been maintained across diverse vertebrate 
lineages. Invertebrate chordates lack hindbrain segmentation but exhibit 
conservation of some aspects of the network, such as a role for retinoic acid in 
establishing nested Hox expression domains. These comparisons lead to a model in 
which early vertebrates underwent an elaboration of the network between 
anterior-posterior patterning and Hox gene expression, leading to the 
gene-regulatory programs for segmental subdivision and rhombomeric segmentation.

some aspects of Caenorhabditis elegans biology, we implemented an in silico 
evolutionary strategy to produce gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that drive 
cell-specific gene expression patterns, mimicking the process of terminal cell 
differentiation. Dynamics of the gene regulatory networks are governed by a 
thermodynamic model of gene expression, which uses DNA sequences and 
transcription factor degenerate position weight matrixes as input. In a version 
of the model, we included chromatin accessibility. Experimentally, it has been 
determined that cell-specific and broadly expressed genes are regulated 
differently. In our in silico evolved GRNs, broadly expressed genes are 
regulated very redundantly and the architecture of their cis-regulatory modules 
is different, in accordance to what has been found in C. elegans and also in 
other systems. Finally, we found differences in topological positions in GRNs 
between these two classes of genes, which help to explain why broadly expressed 
genes are so resilient to mutations. Overall, our results offer an explanatory 
hypothesis on why broadly expressed genes are regulated so redundantly compared 
to cell-specific genes, which can be extrapolated to phenomena such as ChIP-seq 
HOT regions.

The regulatory genome controls genome activity throughout the life of an 
organism. This requires that complex information processing functions are 
encoded in, and operated by, the regulatory genome. Although much remains to be 
learned about how the regulatory genome works, we here discuss two cases where 
regulatory functions have been experimentally dissected in great detail and at 
the systems level, and formalized by computational logic models. Both examples 
derive from the sea urchin embryo, but assess two distinct organizational levels 
of genomic information processing. The first example shows how the regulatory 
system of a single gene, endo16, executes logic operations through individual 
transcription factor binding sites and cis-regulatory modules that control the 
expression of this gene. The second example shows information processing at the 
gene regulatory network (GRN) level. The GRN controlling development of the sea 
urchin endomesoderm has been experimentally explored at an almost complete 
level. A Boolean logic model of this GRN suggests that the modular logic 
functions encoded at the single-gene level show compositionality and suffice to 
account for integrated function at the network level. We discuss these examples 
both from a biological-experimental point of view and from a computer 
science-informational point of view, as both illuminate principles of how the 
regulatory genome works.

Prostate cancer (PCa) risk-associated SNPs are enriched in noncoding 
cis-regulatory elements (rCREs), yet their modi operandi and clinical impact 
remain elusive. Here, we perform CRISPRi screens of 260 rCREs in PCa cell lines. 
We find that rCREs harboring high risk SNPs are more essential for cell 
proliferation and H3K27ac occupancy is a strong indicator of essentiality. We 
also show that cell-line-specific essential rCREs are enriched in the 8q24.21 
region, with the rs11986220-containing rCRE regulating MYC and PVT1 expression, 
cell proliferation and tumorigenesis in a cell-line-specific manner, depending 
on DNA methylation-orchestrated occupancy of a CTCF binding site in between this 
rCRE and the MYC promoter. We demonstrate that CTCF deposition at this site as 
measured by DNA methylation level is highly variable in prostate specimens, and 
observe the MYC eQTL in the 8q24.21 locus in individuals with low CTCF binding. 
Together our findings highlight a causal mechanism synergistically driven by a 
risk SNP and DNA methylation-mediated 3D genome architecture, advocating for the 
integration of genetics and epigenetics in assessing risks conferred by genetic 
predispositions.

Mesendodermal specification is one of the earliest events in embryogenesis, 
where cells first acquire distinct identities. Cell differentiation is a highly 
regulated process that involves the function of numerous transcription factors 
(TFs) and signaling molecules, which can be described with gene regulatory 
networks (GRNs). Cell differentiation GRNs are difficult to build because 
existing mechanistic methods are low throughput, and high-throughput methods 
tend to be non-mechanistic. Additionally, integrating highly dimensional data 
composed of more than two data types is challenging. Here, we use linked 
self-organizing maps to combine chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing 
(ChIP-seq)/ATAC-seq with temporal, spatial, and perturbation RNA sequencing 
(RNA-seq) data from Xenopus tropicalis mesendoderm development to build a 
high-resolution genome scale mechanistic GRN. We recover both known and 
previously unsuspected TF-DNA/TF-TF interactions validated through reporter 
assays. Our analysis provides insights into transcriptional regulation of early 
cell fate decisions and provides a general approach to building GRNs using 
highly dimensional multi-omic datasets.

Cis-regulatory elements (CREs) are the genetic DNA fragments bound by 
transcription factors (TFs). CREs function as molecular switches that precisely 
modulate the dosage and spatiotemporal patterns of gene expression. The 
systematic identification of CREs not only facilitates the annotation of the 
functional non-coding genome but also provides essential insights into the 
architecture of gene regulatory networks and sheds light on an accurate 
selection of the target sites for genetic engineering of crops. In this review, 
we summarize the current high-throughput methodologies used for identifying 
CREs, illustrate the associations between CREs and agronomic traits in 
horticultural crops, and discuss how CREs can be exploited to facilitate crop 
breeding.

Single-cell analyses parse the brain's billions of neurons into thousands of 
'cell-type' clusters residing in different brain structures1. Many cell types 
mediate their functions through targeted long-distance projections allowing 
interactions between specific cell types. Here we used epi-retro-seq2 to link 
single-cell epigenomes and cell types to long-distance projections for 33,034 
neurons dissected from 32 different regions projecting to 24 different targets 
(225 source-to-target combinations) across the whole mouse brain. We highlight 
uses of these data for interrogating principles relating projection types to 
transcriptomics and epigenomics, and for addressing hypotheses about cell types 
and connections related to genetics. We provide an overall synthesis with 926 
statistical comparisons of discriminability of neurons projecting to each target 
for every source. We integrate this dataset into the larger BRAIN Initiative 
Cell Census Network atlas, composed of millions of neurons, to link projection 
cell types to consensus clusters. Integration with spatial transcriptomics 
further assigns projection-enriched clusters to smaller source regions than the 
original dissections. We exemplify this by presenting in-depth analyses of 
projection neurons from the hypothalamus, thalamus, hindbrain, amygdala and 
midbrain to provide insights into properties of those cell types, including 
differentially expressed genes, their associated cis-regulatory elements and 
transcription-factor-binding motifs, and neurotransmitter use.

The vertebrate neural tube generates a large diversity of molecularly and 
functionally distinct neurons and glia from a small progenitor pool. While the 
role of spatial patterning in organizing cell fate specification has been 
extensively studied, temporal patterning, which controls the timing of cell type 
generation, is equally important. Here, we define a global temporal program 
operating in progenitors throughout the mouse nervous systems that governs cell 
fate choices by controlling chromatin accessibility. Perturbation of this 
cis-regulatory program affects sequential cell fate transitions in neural 
progenitors and the identity of their progeny. The temporal program operates in 
parallel to spatial patterning, ensuring the timely availability of regulatory 
elements for spatial determinants to direct cell-type-specific gene expression. 
These findings identify a chronotopic spatiotemporal integration strategy in 
which a global temporal chromatin program determines the output of a spatial 
gene regulatory network resulting in the ordered allocation of cell type 
identity.

Positive and Negative Cis-Regulatory Elements in Its Promoter Region Involved in

In the signal transduction network, from the perception of stress signals to 
stress-responsive gene expression, various transcription factors and 
cis-regulatory elements in stress-responsive promoters coordinate plant 
adaptation to abiotic stresses. Among the AP2/ERF transcription factor family, 
group VII ERF (ERF-VII) genes, such as RAP2.12, RAP2.2, RAP2.3, AtERF73/HRE1, 
and AtERF71/HRE2, are known to be involved in the response to hypoxia in 
Arabidopsis. Notably, HRE2 has been reported to be involved in responses to 
hypoxia and osmotic stress. In this study, we dissected HRE2 promoter to 
identify hypoxia- and salt stress-responsive region(s). The analysis of the 
promoter deletion series of HRE2 using firefly luciferase and GUS as reporter 
genes indicated that the -116 to -2 region is responsible for both hypoxia and 
salt stress responses. Using yeast one-hybrid screening, we isolated 
HAT22/ABIG1, a member of the HD-Zip II subfamily, which binds to the -116 to -2 
region of HRE2 promoter. Interestingly, HAT22/ABIG1 repressed the transcription 
of HRE2 via the EAR motif located in the N-terminal region of HAT22/ABIG1. 
HAT22/ABIG1 bound to the 5'-AATGATA-3' sequence, HD-Zip II-binding-like 
cis-regulatory element, in the -116 to -2 region of HRE2 promoter. Our findings 
demonstrate that the -116 to -2 region of HRE2 promoter contains both positive 
and negative cis-regulatory elements, which may regulate the expression of HRE2 
in responses to hypoxia and salt stress and that HAT22/ABIG1 negatively 
regulates HRE2 transcription by binding to the HD-Zip II-binding-like element in 
the promoter region.

The advent of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies has revolutionized 
the way we understand the transformation of genetic information into 
morphological traits. Elucidating the network of interactions between genes that 
govern cell differentiation through development is one of the core challenges in 
genome research. These networks are known as developmental gene regulatory 
networks (dGRNs) and consist largely of the functional linkage between 
developmental control genes, cis-regulatory modules, and differentiation genes, 
which generate spatially and temporally refined patterns of gene expression. 
Over the last 20 years, great advances have been made in determining these gene 
interactions mainly in classical model systems, including human, mouse, sea 
urchin, fruit fly, and worm. This has brought about a radical transformation in 
the fields of developmental biology and evolutionary biology, allowing the 
generation of high-resolution gene regulatory maps to analyze cell 
differentiation during animal development. Such maps have enabled the 
identification of gene regulatory circuits and have led to the development of 
network inference methods that can recapitulate the differentiation of specific 
cell-types or developmental stages. In contrast, dGRN research in non-classical 
model systems has been limited to the identification of developmental control 
genes via the candidate gene approach and the characterization of their 
spatiotemporal expression patterns, as well as to the discovery of 
cis-regulatory modules via patterns of sequence conservation and/or predicted 
transcription-factor binding sites. However, thanks to the continuous advances 
in HTS technologies, this scenario is rapidly changing. Here, we give a 
historical overview on the architecture and elucidation of the dGRNs. 
Subsequently, we summarize the approaches available to unravel these regulatory 
networks, highlighting the vast range of possibilities of integrating multiple 
technical advances and theoretical approaches to expand our understanding on the 
global gene regulation during animal development in non-classical model systems. 
Such new knowledge will not only lead to greater insights into the evolution of 
molecular mechanisms underlying cell identity and animal body plans, but also 
into the evolution of morphological key innovations in animals.

Transcription factors (TFs) play a critical role in determining cell fate 
decisions by integrating developmental and environmental signals through binding 
to specific cis-regulatory modules and regulating spatio-temporal specificity of 
gene expression patterns. Precise identification of functional TF binding sites 
in time and space not only will revolutionize our understanding of regulatory 
networks governing cell fate decisions but is also instrumental to uncover how 
genetic variations cause morphological diversity or disease. In this review, we 
discuss recent advances in mapping TF binding sites and characterizing the 
various parameters underlying the complexity of binding site recognition by TFs.

Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) are a family of endogenous retroviruses 
that comprise the ~8.93% of the human genome sequence, with a high proportion 
being human specific. The recent expansion of repeated HERV sequences has 
offered a framework for genetic and epigenetic innovation. In the current 
report, a systematic approach is implemented to catalogue regulatory elements 
within HERVs, as a roadmap to potential functions of HERV sequences in gene 
networks. ENCODE Project has offered a wealth of epigenetic data based on omics 
technologies. I analyzed the presence of HERV sequences on consensus 
cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) from ENCODE data. On the one side, HERVs are in 
1 out of 9 cCREs (>100.000 cCREs in total), dispersed within the genome and 
present in cis-regulatory regions of ~81% of human genes, as calculated 
following gene enrichment analysis. On the other side, promoter-associated HERV 
cCREs are present adjacent to (in a 200 bp window) the transcription start sites 
of 256 human genes. Regulatory network production, followed by centrality 
analysis led to the discovery of 90 core genes containing HERV-associated 
promoters. Pathway analysis on the core network genes and their immediate 
neighbors revealed a regulatory footprint that, among others, is associated with 
inflammation, chemokine signaling and response to viral infection. Collectively, 
these results support the concept that the expansion of regulatory sequences 
derived from HERVs is critical for epigenetic innovation that may have wired 
together genes into novel transcriptional networks with critical roles in 
cellular physiology and pathology.

BACKGROUND: The osteocyte is a type of cell that appears to be one of the key 
endocrine regulators of bone metabolism and a key responder to initiate bone 
formation and remodeling. Identifying the regulatory networks in osteocytes may 
lead to new therapies for osteoporosis and loss of bone.
RESULTS: Using microarray, we identified 269 genes over-expressed in osteocyte, 
many of which have known functions in bone and muscle differentiation and 
contractility. We determined the evolutionarily conserved and enriched TF 
binding sites in the 5 kb promoter regions of these genes. Using this data, a 
transcriptional regulatory network was constructed and subsequently partitioned 
to identify cis-regulatory modules.
CONCLUSION: Our results show that many osteocyte-specific genes, including two 
well-known osteocyte markers DMP1 and Sost, have highly conserved clustering of 
muscle-related cis-regulatory modules, thus supporting the concept that a 
muscle-related gene network is important in osteocyte biology and may play a 
role in contractility and dynamic movements of the osteocyte.

Summary: Predicting how genetic variation affects phenotypic outcomes at the 
organismal, cellular, and molecular levels requires deciphering the 
cis-regulatory code, the sequence rules by which non-coding regions regulate 
genes. In this perspective, we discuss recent computational progress and 
challenges toward solving this fundamental problem. We describe how 
cis-regulatory elements are mapped with various genomics assays and how studies 
of the 3D chromatin organization could help identifying long-range regulatory 
effects. We discuss how the cis-regulatory sequence rules can be learned and 
interpreted with sequence-to-function neural networks, with the goal of 
identifying genetic variants in human disease. We also describe current methods 
for mapping gene regulatory networks to describe biological processes. We point 
out current gaps in knowledge along with technical limitations and benchmarking 
challenges of computational methods. Finally, we discuss newly emerging 
technologies, such as spatial transcriptomics, and outline strategies for 
creating a more general model of the cis-regulatory code that is more broadly 
applicable across cell types and individuals.

A common way to investigate gene regulatory mechanisms is to identify 
differentially expressed genes using transcriptomics, find their candidate 
enhancers using epigenomics, and search for over-represented transcription 
factor (TF) motifs in these enhancers using bioinformatics tools. A related 
follow-up task is to model gene expression as a function of enhancer sequences 
and rank TF motifs by their contribution to such models, thus prioritizing among 
regulators. We present a new computational tool called SEAMoD that performs the 
above tasks of motif finding and sequence-to-expression modeling simultaneously. 
It trains a convolutional neural network model to relate enhancer sequences to 
differential expression in one or more biological conditions. The model uses TF 
motifs to interpret the sequences, learning these motifs and their relative 
importance to each biological condition from data. It also utilizes epigenomic 
information in the form of activity scores of putative enhancers and 
automatically searches for the most promising enhancer for each gene. Compared 
to existing neural network models of non-coding sequences, SEAMoD uses far fewer 
parameters, requires far less training data, and emphasizes biological 
interpretability. We used SEAMoD to understand regulatory mechanisms underlying 
the differentiation of neural stem cell (NSC) derived from mouse forebrain. We 
profiled gene expression and histone modifications in NSC and three 
differentiated cell types and used SEAMoD to model differential expression of 
nearly 12,000 genes with an accuracy of 81%, in the process identifying the 
Olig2, E2f family TFs, Foxo3, and Tcf4 as key transcriptional regulators of the 
differentiation process.

Transcription factors (TFs) bind combinatorially to cis-regulatory elements, 
orchestrating transcriptional programs. Although studies of chromatin state and 
chromosomal interactions have demonstrated dynamic neurodevelopmental 
cis-regulatory landscapes, parallel understanding of TF interactions lags. To 
elucidate combinatorial TF binding driving mouse basal ganglia development, we 
integrated chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) for twelve TFs, 
H3K4me3-associated enhancer-promoter interactions, chromatin and gene expression 
data, and functional enhancer assays. We identified sets of putative regulatory 
elements with shared TF binding (TF-pRE modules) that orchestrate distinct 
processes of GABAergic neurogenesis and suppress other cell fates. The majority 
of pREs were bound by one or two TFs; however, a small proportion were 
extensively bound. These sequences had exceptional evolutionary conservation and 
motif density, complex chromosomal interactions, and activity as in vivo 
enhancers. Our results provide insights into the combinatorial TF-pRE 
interactions that activate and repress expression programs during telencephalon 
neurogenesis and demonstrate the value of TF binding toward modeling 
developmental transcriptional wiring.

Analysis of gene co-expression networks is a powerful "data-driven" tool, 
invaluable for understanding cancer biology and mechanisms of tumor development. 
Yet, despite of completion of thousands of studies on cancer gene expression, 
there were few attempts to normalize and integrate co-expression data from 
scattered sources in a concise "meta-analysis" framework. Here we describe an 
integrated approach to cancer expression meta-analysis, which combines 
generation of "data-driven" co-expression networks with detailed statistical 
detection of promoter sequence motifs within the co-expression clusters. First, 
we applied Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) workflow and 
Pearson's correlation to generate a comprehensive set of over 3000 co-expression 
clusters in 82 normalized microarray datasets from nine cancers of different 
origin. Next, we designed a genome-wide statistical approach to the detection of 
specific DNA sequence motifs based on similarities between the promoters of 
similarly expressed genes. The approach, realized as cisExpress software module, 
was specifically designed for analysis of very large data sets such as those 
generated by publicly accessible whole genome and transcriptome projects. 
cisExpress uses a task farming algorithm to exploit all available computational 
cores within a shared memory node.We discovered that although co-expression 
modules are populated with different sets of genes, they share distinct stable 
patterns of co-regulation based on promoter sequence analysis. The number of 
motifs per co-expression cluster varies widely in accordance with cancer tissue 
of origin, with the largest number in colon (68 motifs) and the lowest in ovary 
(18 motifs). The top scored motifs are typically shared between several tissues; 
they define sets of target genes responsible for certain functionality of 
cancerogenesis. Both the co-expression modules and a database of precalculated 
motifs are publically available and accessible for further studies.

Identifying master regulators of biological processes and mapping their 
downstream gene networks are key challenges in systems biology. We developed a 
computational method, called iRegulon, to reverse-engineer the transcriptional 
regulatory network underlying a co-expressed gene set using cis-regulatory 
sequence analysis. iRegulon implements a genome-wide ranking-and-recovery 
approach to detect enriched transcription factor motifs and their optimal sets 
of direct targets. We increase the accuracy of network inference by using very 
large motif collections of up to ten thousand position weight matrices collected 
from various species, and linking these to candidate human TFs via a motif2TF 
procedure. We validate iRegulon on gene sets derived from ENCODE ChIP-seq data 
with increasing levels of noise, and we compare iRegulon with existing motif 
discovery methods. Next, we use iRegulon on more challenging types of gene 
lists, including microRNA target sets, protein-protein interaction networks, and 
genetic perturbation data. In particular, we over-activate p53 in breast cancer 
cells, followed by RNA-seq and ChIP-seq, and could identify an extensive 
up-regulated network controlled directly by p53. Similarly we map a repressive 
network with no indication of direct p53 regulation but rather an indirect 
effect via E2F and NFY. Finally, we generalize our computational framework to 
include regulatory tracks such as ChIP-seq data and show how motif and track 
discovery can be combined to map functional regulatory interactions among 
co-expressed genes. iRegulon is available as a Cytoscape plugin from 
http://iregulon.aertslab.org.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Cholangiocytes transit from quiescence to hyperproliferation 
during cystogenesis in polycystic liver disease (PLD), the severity of which 
displays prominent sex differences. Epigenetic regulation plays important roles 
in cell state transition. We aimed to investigate the sex-specific epigenetic 
basis of hepatic cystogenesis and to develop therapeutic strategies targeting 
epigenetic modifications for PLD treatment.
METHODS: Normal and cystic primary cholangiocytes were isolated from wild-type 
and PLD mice of both sexes. Chromatin states were characterized by analyzing 
chromatin accessibility (ATAC sequencing) and multiple histone modifications 
(chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing). Differential gene expression was 
determined by transcriptomic analysis (RNA sequencing). Pharmacologic inhibition 
of epigenetic modifying enzymes was undertaken in PLD model mice.
RESULTS: Through genome-wide profiling of chromatin dynamics, we revealed a 
profound increase of global chromatin accessibility during cystogenesis in both 
male and female PLD cholangiocytes. We identified a switch from H3K9me3 to 
H3K9ac on cis-regulatory DNA elements of cyst-associated genes and showed that 
inhibition of H3K9ac acetyltransferase or H3K9me3 demethylase slowed cyst growth 
in male, but not female, PLD mice. In contrast, we found that H3K27ac was 
specifically increased in female PLD mice and that genes associated with 
H3K27ac-gained regions were enriched for cyst-related pathways. In an integrated 
epigenomic and transcriptomic analysis, we identified an estrogen receptor 
alpha-centered transcription factor network associated with the 
H3K27ac-regulated cystogenic gene expression program in female PLD mice.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the multi-layered sex-specific epigenetic 
dynamics underlying cholangiocyte state transition and reveal a potential 
epigenetic therapeutic strategy for male PLD patients.
IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS: In the present study, we elucidate a sex-specific 
epigenetic mechanism underlying the cholangiocyte state transition during 
hepatic cystogenesis and identify epigenetic drugs that effectively slow cyst 
growth in male PLD mice. These findings underscore the importance of sex 
difference in the pathogenesis of PLD and may guide researchers and physicians 
to develop sex-specific personalized approaches for PLD treatment.

Plant cell signaling pathways are in part dependent on transcriptional 
regulatory networks comprising circuits of transcription factors (TFs) and 
regulatory DNA elements that control the expression of target genes. Here, we 
describe experimental and bioinformatic approaches for identifying potential 
cis-regulatory elements. We also discuss recent integrative genomics studies 
aimed at elucidating the functions of cis-regulatory elements in aspects of 
plant biology, including the circadian clock, interactions with the environment, 
stress responses, and regulation of growth and development by phytohormones. 
Finally, we discuss emerging technologies and approaches that offer great 
potential for accelerating the discovery and functional characterization of 
cis-elements and interacting TFs--which will help realize the promise of systems 
biology.

Development of the body plan is controlled by large networks of regulatory 
genes. A gene regulatory network that controls the specification of endoderm and 
mesoderm in the sea urchin embryo is summarized here. The network was derived 
from large-scale perturbation analyses, in combination with computational 
methodologies, genomic data, cis-regulatory analysis, and molecular embryology. 
The network contains over 40 genes at present, and each node can be directly 
verified at the DNA sequence level by cis-regulatory analysis. Its architecture 
reveals specific and general aspects of development, such as how given cells 
generate their ordained fates in the embryo and why the process moves inexorably 
forward in developmental time.

The highly recognizable animals within the phylum Echinodermata encompass an 
enormous disparity of adult and larval body plans. The extensive knowledge of 
sea urchin development has culminated in the description of the exquisitely 
detailed gene regulatory network (GRN) that governs the specification of various 
embryonic territories. This information provides a unique opportunity for 
comparative studies in other echinoderm taxa to understand the evolution and 
developmental mechanisms underlying body plan change. This review focuses on 
recent work that has utilized new genomic resources and systems-level 
experiments to address questions of evolutionary developmental biology. In 
particular, we synthesize the results of several recent studies from various 
echinoderm classes that have explored the development and evolution of the 
larval skeleton, which is a major feature that distinguishes the two predominant 
larval subtypes within the Phylum. We specifically examine the ways in which 
GRNs can evolve, either through cis regulatory and/or protein-level changes in 
transcription factors. We also examine recent work comparing evolution across 
shorter time scales that occur within and between species of sea urchin, and

The laboratory mouse shares the majority of its protein-coding genes with 
humans, making it the premier model organism in biomedical research, yet the two 
mammals differ in significant ways. To gain greater insights into both shared 
and species-specific transcriptional and cellular regulatory programs in the 
mouse, the Mouse ENCODE Consortium has mapped transcription, DNase I 
hypersensitivity, transcription factor binding, chromatin modifications and 
replication domains throughout the mouse genome in diverse cell and tissue 
types. By comparing with the human genome, we not only confirm substantial 
conservation in the newly annotated potential functional sequences, but also 
find a large degree of divergence of sequences involved in transcriptional 
regulation, chromatin state and higher order chromatin organization. Our results 
illuminate the wide range of evolutionary forces acting on genes and their 
regulatory regions, and provide a general resource for research into mammalian 
biology and mechanisms of human diseases.

Transposon-encoded tnpB and iscB genes encode RNA-guided DNA nucleases that 
promote their own selfish spread through targeted DNA cleavage and homologous 
recombination1-4. These widespread gene families were repeatedly domesticated 
over evolutionary timescales, leading to the emergence of diverse 
CRISPR-associated nucleases including Cas9 and Cas12 (refs. 5,6). We set out to 
test the hypothesis that TnpB nucleases may have also been repurposed for novel, 
unexpected functions other than CRISPR-Cas adaptive immunity. Here, using 
phylogenetics, structural predictions, comparative genomics and functional 
assays, we uncover multiple independent genesis events of programmable 
transcription factors, which we name TnpB-like nuclease-dead repressors (TldRs). 
These proteins use naturally occurring guide RNAs to specifically target 
conserved promoter regions of the genome, leading to potent gene repression in a 
mechanism akin to CRISPR interference technologies invented by humans7. Focusing 
on a TldR clade found broadly in Enterobacteriaceae, we discover that 
bacteriophages exploit the combined action of TldR and an adjacently encoded 
phage gene to alter the expression and composition of the host flagellar 
assembly, a transformation with the potential to impact motility8, phage 
susceptibility9, and host immunity10. Collectively, this work showcases the 
diverse molecular innovations that were enabled through repeated exaptation of 
transposon-encoded genes, and reveals the evolutionary trajectory of diverse 
RNA-guided transcription factors.

Maize (Zea mays) originated in tropical areas and is thus susceptible to low 
temperatures, which pose a major threat to maize production. Our understanding 
of the molecular basis of cold tolerance in maize is limited. Here, we 
identified bZIP68, a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor, as a 
negative regulator of cold tolerance in maize. Transcriptome analysis revealed 
that bZIP68 represses the cold-induced expression of DREB1 transcription factor 
genes. The stability and transcriptional activity of bZIP68 are controlled by 
its phosphorylation at the conserved Ser250 residue under cold stress. 
Furthermore, we demonstrated that the bZIP68 locus was a target of selection 
during early domestication. A 358-bp insertion/deletion (Indel-972) polymorphism 
in the bZIP68 promoter has a significant effect on the differential expression 
of bZIP68 between maize and its wild ancestor teosinte. This study thus uncovers 
an evolutionary cis-regulatory variant that could be used to improve cold 
tolerance in maize.

Alternative splicing enhances protein diversity in different ways, including 
through exonization of transposable elements (TEs). Recent transcriptomic 
analyses identified thousands of unannotated spliced transcripts with exonizing 
TEs, but their contribution to the proteome and biological relevance remains 
unclear. Here, we use transcriptome assembly, ribosome profiling, and proteomics 
to describe a population of 1,227 unannotated TE exonizing isoforms generated by 
mRNA splicing and recurrent in human populations. Despite being shorter and 
lowly expressed, these isoforms are shared between individuals and efficiently 
translated. Functional analyses show stable expression, specific cellular 
localization, and, in some cases, modified functions. Exonized TEs are rich in 
ancient genes, whereas the involved splice sites are recent and can be 
evolutionarily conserved. In addition, exonized TEs contribute to the secondary 
structure of the emerging isoforms, supporting their functional relevance. We 
conclude that TE-spliced isoforms represent a diversity reservoir of functional 
proteins on which natural selection can act.

We recently witnessed a tremendous increase in genomics studies on gene 
regulation and in entirely sequenced genomes from closely related species. This 
has triggered analyses that suggest a wide range of evolutionary dynamics of 
gene regulation, from rapid turnover of transcription-factor binding sites to 
conservation of enhancer function across large evolutionary distances. Many 
examples show that enhancers can evolve beyond recognizable sequence similarity 
while retaining function. However, bioinformatics approaches are increasingly 
able to detect conserved regulatory elements through characteristic evolutionary 
sequence signatures. Cis-regulatory changes are also a major source of 
morphological evolution, which might be facilitated by many biochemically 
functional elements that are selectively neutral and by the buffering function 
of redundant enhancers and 'shadow' enhancers.

Eukaryotic regulatory element conservation analysis and identification using 
comparative genomics.

Comparative genomics is a promising approach to the challenging problem of 
eukaryotic regulatory element identification, because functional noncoding 
sequences may be conserved across species from evolutionary constraints. We 
systematically analyzed known human and Saccharomyces cerevisiae regulatory 
elements and discovered that human regulatory elements are more conserved 
between human and mouse than are background sequences. Although S. cerevisiae 
regulatory elements do not appear to be more conserved by comparison of S. 
cerevisiae to Schizosaccharomyces pombe, they are more conserved when compared 
with multiple other yeast genomes (Saccharomyces paradoxus, Saccharomyces 
mikatae, and Saccharomyces bayanus). Based on these analyses, we developed a 
sequence-motif-finding algorithm called CompareProspector, which extends Gibbs 
sampling by biasing the search in regions conserved across species. Using 
human-mouse comparison, CompareProspector identified known motifs for 
transcription factors Mef2, Myf, Srf, and Sp1 from a set of 
human-muscle-specific genes. It also discovered the NFAT motif from genes 
up-regulated by CD28 stimulation in T-cells, which implies the direct 
involvement of NFAT in mediating the CD28 stimulatory signal. Using 
Caenorhabditis elegans-Caenorhabditis briggsae comparison, CompareProspector 
found the PHA-4 motif and the UNC-86 motif. CompareProspector outperformed many 
other computational motif-finding programs, demonstrating the power of 
comparative genomics-based biased sampling in eukaryotic regulatory element 
identification.

To gain insight into how mammalian gene expression is controlled by rapidly 
evolving regulatory elements, we jointly analysed promoter and enhancer activity 
with downstream transcription levels in liver samples from 15 species. Genes 
associated with complex regulatory landscapes generally exhibit high expression 
levels that remain evolutionarily stable. While the number of regulatory 
elements is the key driver of transcriptional output and resilience, regulatory 
conservation matters: elements active across mammals most effectively stabilize 
gene expression. In contrast, recently evolved enhancers typically contribute 
weakly, consistent with their high evolutionary plasticity. These effects are 
observed across the entire mammalian clade and are robust to potential 
confounders, such as the gene expression level. Using liver as a representative 
somatic tissue, our results illuminate how the evolutionary stability of gene 
expression is profoundly entwined with both the number and conservation of 
surrounding promoters and enhancers.

Hoxa2 is an evolutionarily conserved developmental regulatory gene that 
functions to specify rhombomere (r) and pharyngeal arch (PA) identities 
throughout the Osteichthyes. Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) hoxa2a, like 
orthologous Hoxa2 genes from other osteichthyans, is expressed during 
embryogenesis in r2-7 and PA2-7, whereas the paralogous medaka pseudogene, 
ψhoxa2b, is expressed in noncanonical Hoxa2 domains, including the pectoral fin 
buds. To understand the evolution of cis-regulatory element (CRE) control of 
gene expression, we conducted eGFP reporter gene expression studies with 
extensive functional mapping of several conserved CREs upstream of medaka hoxa2a 
and ψhoxa2b in transient and stable-line transgenic medaka embryos. The CREs 
tested were previously shown to contribute to directing mouse Hoxa2 gene 
expression in r3, r5, and PA2-4. Our results reveal the presence of sequence 
elements embedded in the medaka hoxa2a and ψhoxa2b upstream enhancer regions 
(UERs) that mediate expression in r4 and the PAs (hoxa2a r4/CNCC element) or in 
r3-7 and the PAs ψhoxa2b r3-7/CNCC element), respectively. Further, these 
elements were shown to be highly conserved among osteichthyans, which suggests 
that the r4 specifying element embedded in the UER of Hoxa2 is a deeply rooted 
rhombomere specifying element and the activity of this element has been modified 
by the evolution of flanking sequences that redirect its activity to alternative 
developmental compartments.

Toward understanding the evolution of vertebrate gene regulatory networks: 
comparative genomics and epigenomic approaches.

Martinez-Morales JR.

Vertebrates, as most animal phyla, originated >500 million years ago during the 
Cambrian explosion, and progressively radiated into the extant classes. 
Inferring the evolutionary history of the group requires understanding the 
architecture of the developmental programs that constrain the vertebrate 
anatomy. Here, I review recent comparative genomic and epigenomic studies, based 
on ChIP-seq and chromatin accessibility, which focus on the identification of 
functionally equivalent cis-regulatory modules among species. This pioneer work, 
primarily centered in the mammalian lineage, has set the groundwork for further 
studies in representative vertebrate and chordate species. Mapping of active 
regulatory regions across lineages will shed new light on the evolutionary 
forces stabilizing ancestral developmental programs, as well as allowing their 
variation to sustain morphological adaptations on the inherited vertebrate body 
plan.

The zebrafish (Danio rerio) has been widely used in the study of human disease 
and development, and about 70% of the protein-coding genes are conserved between 
the two species1. However, studies in zebrafish remain constrained by the sparse 
annotation of functional control elements in the zebrafish genome. Here we 
performed RNA sequencing, assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using 
sequencing (ATAC-seq), chromatin immunoprecipitation with sequencing, 
whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, and chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) 
experiments in up to eleven adult and two embryonic tissues to generate a 
comprehensive map of transcriptomes, cis-regulatory elements, heterochromatin, 
methylomes and 3D genome organization in the zebrafish Tübingen reference 
strain. A comparison of zebrafish, human and mouse regulatory elements enabled 
the identification of both evolutionarily conserved and species-specific 
regulatory sequences and networks. We observed enrichment of evolutionary 
breakpoints at topologically associating domain boundaries, which were 
correlated with strong histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) and 
CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) signals. We performed single-cell ATAC-seq in 
zebrafish brain, which delineated 25 different clusters of cell types. By 
combining long-read DNA sequencing and Hi-C, we assembled the sex-determining 
chromosome 4 de novo. Overall, our work provides an additional epigenomic anchor 
for the functional annotation of vertebrate genomes and the study of 
evolutionarily conserved elements of 3D genome organization.

Human genomes hold a record of the evolutionary forces that have shaped our 
species. Advances in DNA sequencing, functional genomics, and population genetic 
modeling have deepened our understanding of human demographic history, natural 
selection, and many other long-studied topics. These advances have also revealed 
many previously underappreciated factors that influence the evolution of the 
human genome, including functional modifications to DNA and histones, conserved 
3D topological chromatin domains, structural variation, and heterogeneous 
mutation patterns along the genome. Using evolutionary theory as a lens to study 
these phenomena will lead to significant breakthroughs in understanding what 
makes us human and why we get sick.

Across the human genome, there are nearly 500 'ultraconserved' elements: regions 
of at least 200 contiguous nucleotides that are perfectly conserved in both the 
mouse and rat genomes. Remarkably, the majority of these sequences are 
non-coding, and many can function as enhancers that activate tissue-specific 
gene expression during embryonic development. From their first description more 
than 15 years ago, their extreme conservation has both fascinated and perplexed 
researchers in genomics and evolutionary biology. The intrigue around 
ultraconserved elements only grew with the observation that they are dispensable 
for viability. Here, we review recent progress towards understanding the general 
importance and the specific functions of ultraconserved sequences in mammalian 
development and human disease and discuss possible explanations for their 
extreme conservation.

Cis-regulatory sequences, such as enhancers and promoters, control development 
and physiology by regulating gene expression. Mutations that affect the function 
of these sequences contribute to phenotypic diversity within and between 
species. With many case studies implicating divergent cis-regulatory activity in 
phenotypic evolution, researchers have recently begun to elucidate the genetic 
and molecular mechanisms that are responsible for cis-regulatory divergence. 
Approaches include detailed functional analysis of individual cis-regulatory 
elements and comparing mechanisms of gene regulation among species using the 
latest genomic tools. Despite the limited number of mechanistic studies 
published to date, this work shows how cis-regulatory activity can diverge and 
how studies of cis-regulatory divergence can address long-standing questions 
about the genetic mechanisms of phenotypic evolution.

Despite recent advances in single-cell genomics, the lack of maps for 
single-cell candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) in non-mammal species has 
limited our exploration of conserved regulatory programs across vertebrates and 
invertebrates. Here, we developed a combinatorial-hybridization-based method for 
single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing 
(scATAC-seq) named CH-ATAC-seq, enabling the construction of single-cell 
accessible chromatin landscapes for zebrafish, Drosophila, and earthworms 
(Eisenia andrei). By integrating scATAC censuses of humans, monkeys, and mice, 
we systematically identified 152 distinct main cell types and around 0.8 million 
cell-type-specific cCREs. Our analysis provided insights into the conservation 
of neural, muscle, and immune lineages across species, while epithelial cells 
exhibited a higher organ-origin heterogeneity. Additionally, a large-scale gene 
regulatory network (GRN) was constructed in four vertebrates by integrating 
scRNA-seq censuses. Overall, our study provides a valuable resource for 
comparative epigenomics, identifying the evolutionary conservation and 
divergence of gene regulation across different species.

Identification of putative regulatory upstream ORFs in the yeast genome using 
heuristics and evolutionary conservation.

BACKGROUND: The translational efficiency of an mRNA can be modulated by upstream 
open reading frames (uORFs) present in certain genes. A uORF can attenuate 
translation of the main ORF by interfering with translational reinitiation at 
the main start codon. uORFs also occur by chance in the genome, in which case 
they do not have a regulatory role. Since the sequence determinants for 
functional uORFs are not understood, it is difficult to discriminate functional 
from spurious uORFs by sequence analysis.
RESULTS: We have used comparative genomics to identify novel uORFs in yeast with 
a high likelihood of having a translational regulatory role. We examined uORFs, 
previously shown to play a role in regulation of translation in Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae, for evolutionary conservation within seven Saccharomyces species. 
Inspection of the set of conserved uORFs yielded the following three 
characteristics useful for discrimination of functional from spurious uORFs: a 
length between 4 and 6 codons, a distance from the start of the main ORF between 
50 and 150 nucleotides, and finally a lack of overlap with, and clear separation 
from, neighbouring uORFs. These derived rules are inherently associated with 
uORFs with properties similar to the GCN4 locus, and may not detect most uORFs 
of other types. uORFs with high scores based on these rules showed a much higher 
evolutionary conservation than randomly selected uORFs. In a genome-wide scan in 
S. cerevisiae, we found 34 conserved uORFs from 32 genes that we predict to be 
functional; subsequent analysis showed the majority of these to be located 
within transcripts. A total of 252 genes were found containing conserved uORFs 
with properties indicative of a functional role; all but 7 are novel. Functional 
content analysis of this set identified an overrepresentation of genes involved 
in transcriptional control and development.
CONCLUSION: Evolutionary conservation of uORFs in yeasts can be traced up to 100 
million years of separation. The conserved uORFs have certain characteristics 
with respect to length, distance from each other and from the main start codon, 
and folding energy of the sequence. These newly found characteristics can be 
used to facilitate detection of other conserved uORFs.

Regulation of gene expression is central to many biological processes. Although 
reconstruction of regulatory circuits from genomic data alone is therefore 
desirable, this remains a major computational challenge. Comparative approaches 
that examine the conservation and divergence of circuits and their components 
across strains and species can help reconstruct circuits as well as provide 
insights into the evolution of gene regulatory processes and their adaptive 
contribution. In recent years, advances in genomic and computational tools have 
led to a wealth of methods for such analysis at the sequence, expression, 
pathway, module, and entire network level. Here, we review computational methods 
developed to study transcriptional regulatory networks using comparative 
genomics, from sequence to functional data. We highlight how these methods use 
evolutionary conservation and divergence to reliably detect regulatory 
components as well as estimate the extent and rate of divergence. Finally, we 
discuss the promise and open challenges in linking regulatory divergence to 
phenotypic divergence and adaptation.

Despite the large evolutionary distances between metazoan species, they can show 
remarkable commonalities in their biology, and this has helped to establish fly 
and worm as model organisms for human biology. Although studies of individual 
elements and factors have explored similarities in gene regulation, a 
large-scale comparative analysis of basic principles of transcriptional 
regulatory features is lacking. Here we map the genome-wide binding locations of 
165 human, 93 worm and 52 fly transcription regulatory factors, generating a 
total of 1,019 data sets from diverse cell types, developmental stages, or 
conditions in the three species, of which 498 (48.9%) are presented here for the 
first time. We find that structural properties of regulatory networks are 
remarkably conserved and that orthologous regulatory factor families recognize 
similar binding motifs in vivo and show some similar co-associations. Our 
results suggest that gene-regulatory properties previously observed for 
individual factors are general principles of metazoan regulation that are 
remarkably well-preserved despite extensive functional divergence of individual 
network connections. The comparative maps of regulatory circuitry provided here 
will drive an improved understanding of the regulatory underpinnings of model 
organism biology and how these relate to human biology, development and disease.

Multiple distal cis-regulatory elements (CREs) often cooperate to regulate gene 
expression, and the presence of multiple CREs for a gene has been proposed to 
provide redundancy and robustness to variation. However, we do not understand 
how attributes of a gene's distal CRE landscape-the CREs that contribute to its 
regulation-relate to its expression and function. Here, we integrate 
three-dimensional chromatin conformation and functional genomics data to 
quantify the CRE landscape composition genome-wide across ten human tissues and 
relate their attributes to the function, constraint, and expression patterns of 
genes. Within each tissue, we find that expressed genes have larger CRE 
landscapes than nonexpressed genes and that genes with tissue-specific CREs are 
more likely to have tissue-specific expression. Controlling for the association 
between expression level and CRE landscape size, we also find that CRE 
landscapes around genes under strong constraint (e.g., loss-of-function 
intolerant and housekeeping genes) are not significantly smaller than other 
expressed genes as previously proposed; however, they do have more 
evolutionarily conserved sequences than CREs of expressed genes overall. We also 
show that CRE landscape size does not associate with expression variability 
across individuals; nonetheless, genes with larger CRE landscapes have a 
relative depletion for variants that influence expression levels (expression 
quantitative trait loci). Overall, this work illustrates how differences in gene 
function, expression, and evolutionary constraint are reflected in features of 
CRE landscapes. Thus, considering the CRE landscape of a gene is vital for 
understanding gene expression dynamics across biological contexts and 
interpreting the effects of noncoding genetic variants.

Cell walls are a distinguishing characteristic of plants essential to their 
survival. The pectin content of primary cell walls in grasses and dicots is 
distinctly different. Polygalacturonases (PGs) can degrade pectins and 
participate in multiple developmental processes of plants. This study 
comprehensively compared the evolution, expression, and cis-regulatory element 
of PGs in grasses and dicots. A total of 577 PGs identified from five grasses 
and five dicots fell into seven clades. Evolutionary analysis demonstrated the 
distinct differences between grasses and dicots in patterns of gene duplication 
and loss, and evolutionary rates. Grasses generally contained much fewer clade C 
and F members than dicots. We found that this disparity was the result of less 
duplication and more gene losses in grasses. More duplications occurred in 
clades D and E, and expression analysis showed that most of clade E members were 
expressed ubiquitously at a high overall level and clade D members were closely 
related to male reproduction in both grasses and dicots, suggesting their 
biological functions were highly conserved across species. In addition to the 
general role in reproductive development, PGs of clades C and F specifically 
played roles in root development in dicots, shedding light on organ 
differentiation between the two groups of plants. A regulatory element analysis 
of clade C and F members implied that possible functions of PGs in specific 
biological responses contributed to their expansion and preservation. This work 
can improve the knowledge of PGs in plants generally and in grasses specifically 
and is beneficial to functional studies.

Comparative genomics has revealed a class of non-protein-coding genomic 
sequences that display an extraordinary degree of conservation between two or 
more organisms, regularly exceeding that found within protein-coding exons. 
These elements, collectively referred to as conserved non-coding elements 
(CNEs), are non-randomly distributed across chromosomes and tend to cluster in 
the vicinity of genes with regulatory roles in multicellular development and 
differentiation. CNEs are organized into functional ensembles called genomic 
regulatory blocks-dense clusters of elements that collectively coordinate the 
expression of shared target genes, and whose span in many cases coincides with 
topologically associated domains. CNEs display sequence properties that set them 
apart from other sequences under constraint, and have recently been proposed as 
useful markers for the reconstruction of the evolutionary history of organisms. 
Disruption of several of these elements is known to contribute to diseases 
linked with development, and cancer. The emergence, evolutionary dynamics and 
functions of CNEs still remain poorly understood, and new approaches are 
required to enable comprehensive CNE identification and characterization. Here, 
we review current knowledge and identify challenges that need to be tackled to 
resolve the impasse in understanding extreme non-coding conservation.

Transcription factors (TFs) bind combinatorially to cis-regulatory elements, 
orchestrating transcriptional programs. Although studies of chromatin state and 
chromosomal interactions have demonstrated dynamic neurodevelopmental 
cis-regulatory landscapes, parallel understanding of TF interactions lags. To 
elucidate combinatorial TF binding driving mouse basal ganglia development, we 
integrated chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) for twelve TFs, 
H3K4me3-associated enhancer-promoter interactions, chromatin and gene expression 
data, and functional enhancer assays. We identified sets of putative regulatory 
elements with shared TF binding (TF-pRE modules) that orchestrate distinct 
processes of GABAergic neurogenesis and suppress other cell fates. The majority 
of pREs were bound by one or two TFs; however, a small proportion were 
extensively bound. These sequences had exceptional evolutionary conservation and 
motif density, complex chromosomal interactions, and activity as in vivo 
enhancers. Our results provide insights into the combinatorial TF-pRE 
interactions that activate and repress expression programs during telencephalon 
neurogenesis and demonstrate the value of TF binding toward modeling 
developmental transcriptional wiring.

Biological systems encompass intricate networks governed by RNA-protein 
interactions that play pivotal roles in cellular functions. RNA and proteins 
constituting 1.1% and 18% of the mammalian cell weight, respectively, 
orchestrate vital processes from genome organization to translation. To date, 
disentangling the functional fraction of the human genome has presented a major 
challenge, particularly for noncoding regions, yet recent discoveries have 
started to unveil a host of regulatory functions for noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs). 
While ncRNAs exist at different sizes, structures, degrees of evolutionary 
conservation and abundances within the cell, they partake in diverse roles 
either alone or in combination. However, certain ncRNA subtypes, including those 
that have been described or remain to be discovered, are poorly characterized 
given their heterogeneous nature. RNA activity is in most cases coordinated 
through interactions with RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Extensive efforts are 
being made to accurately reconstruct RNA-RBP regulatory networks, which have 
provided unprecedented insight into cellular physiology and human disease. In 
this review, we provide a comprehensive view of RNAs and RBPs, focusing on how 
their interactions generate functional signals in living cells, particularly in 
the context of post-transcriptional regulatory processes and cancer.

Complement C9, as a member of terminal complement component (TCC) protein, plays 
important roles in innate immunity. However, some complement components appear 
to show difference and evolutionary complexity between higher and lower 
vertebrates. Hence, it is essential to carry on a study of evolutionary origin 
and systematic function of C9 in fish and non-fish vertebrates. This study aims 
to explore the complement gene evolution and potential function in fish based on 
molecular and structural biology. Herein, we found complete divergence of C9 
throughout the gene evolution. The optimal codons of C9 sequences tended to be 
closer to the genomes of lower vertebrates compared to higher vertebrates. 
Further, conserved amino acids in the C9 TMH1 region were identified, implying 
their potential functional association with MAC growth and pore formation. 
Transposons and simple repeats, as gene elements, exhibited a differential 
distribution in the genomic regions in different animal groups but were sparsely 
scattered around the sixth exon (TMH1 region). Notably, this demonstrated the 
regulatory complexity of the C9 gene in higher vertebrates. The negative 
selection pressures on fish and non-fish groups improved both the sequence 
conservation and similarity. Through gene/protein regulatory network and pathway 
analyses, the systematic function of C9 protein was showcased; thus, we could 
reveal the divergence of the systematic function of C9 across species from 
different evolutionary positions. In addition, more complicated functions of C9 
in higher vertebrates could established by the altered spatial conformation of 
the protein. Collectively, the present study illustrates the C9 gene 
evolutionary process and the difference in its systematic function across 
multiple species. Such advances provide new insights for understanding the 
evolutionary and potential functions of complement C9.

Human higher cognition is attributed to the evolutionary expansion and 
elaboration of the human cerebral cortex. However, the genetic mechanisms 
contributing to these developmental changes are poorly understood. We used 
comparative epigenetic profiling of human, rhesus macaque, and mouse 
corticogenesis to identify promoters and enhancers that have gained activity in 
humans. These gains are significantly enriched in modules of coexpressed genes 
in the cortex that function in neuronal proliferation, migration, and 
cortical-map organization. Gain-enriched modules also showed correlated gene 
expression patterns and similar transcription factor binding site enrichments in 
promoters and enhancers, suggesting that they are connected by common regulatory 
mechanisms. Our results reveal coordinated patterns of potential regulatory 
changes associated with conserved developmental processes during corticogenesis, 
providing insight into human cortical evolution.

With the imminent completion of the whole genome sequence of humans, increasing 
attention is being focused on the annotation of cis-regulatory elements in the 
human genome. Comparative genomics approaches based on evolutionary conservation 
have proved useful in the detection of conserved cis-regulatory elements. The 
pufferfish, Fugu rubripes, is an attractive vertebrate model for comparative 
genomics, by virtue of its compact genome and maximal phylogenetic distance from 
mammals. Fugu has lost a large proportion of nonessential DNA, and retained 
single orthologs for many duplicate genes that arose in the fish lineage. 
Non-coding sequences conserved between fugu and mammals have been shown to be 
functional cis-regulatory elements. Thus, fugu is a model fish genome of choice 
for discovering evolutionarily conserved regulatory elements in the human 
genome. Such evolutionarily conserved elements are likely to be shared by all 
vertebrates, and related to regulatory interactions fundamental to all 
vertebrates. The functions of these conserved vertebrate elements can be rapidly 
assayed in mammalian cell lines or in transgenic systems such as 
zebrafish/medaka and Xenopus, followed by validation of crucial elements in 
transgenic rodents.

Extreme metabolic adaptations can elucidate genetic programs that govern 
mammalian metabolism. Here, we used convergent evolutionary changes in 
hibernating lineages to define conserved cis-regulatory elements (CREs) and 
metabolic programs. We characterized mouse hypothalamus gene expression and 
chromatin dynamics across fed, fasted, and refed states and then used 
comparative genomics of hibernating versus nonhibernating lineages to identify 
cis elements with convergent changes in hibernators. Multi-omics approaches 
pinpointed CREs, hub genes, regulatory programs, and cell types underlying 
lineage divergence. Hibernators accumulated loss-of-function effects for CREs 
regulating hypothalamic responses, and the refeeding period after fasting served 
as a key phase for molecular processes with convergent evolutionary changes. 
This work provides a genetic framework for harnessing hibernator adaptations to 
understand human metabolic control.

Comparative genomics identifies the mouse Bmp3 promoter and an upstream 
evolutionary conserved region (ECR) in mammals.

The Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) pathway is a multi-member signaling cascade 
whose basic components are found in all animals. One member, BMP3, which arose 
more recently in evolution and is found only in deuterostomes, serves a unique 
role as an antagonist to both the canonical BMP and Activin pathways. However, 
the mechanisms that control BMP3 expression, and the cis-regulatory regions 
mediating this regulation, remain poorly defined. With this in mind, we sought 
to identify the Bmp3 promoter in mouse (M. musculus) through functional and 
comparative genomic analyses. We found that the minimal promoter required for 
expression in resides within 0.8 kb upstream of Bmp3 in a region that is highly 
conserved with rat (R. norvegicus). We also found that an upstream region 
abutting the minimal promoter acts as a repressor of the minimal promoter in 
HEK293T cells and osteoblasts. Strikingly, a portion of this region is conserved 
among all available eutherian mammal genomes (47/47), but not in any 
non-eutherian animal (0/136). We also identified multiple conserved 
transcription factor binding sites in the Bmp3 upstream ECR, suggesting that 
this region may preserve common cis-regulatory elements that govern Bmp3 
expression across eutherian mammals. Since dysregulation of BMP signaling 
appears to play a role in human health and disease, our findings may have 
application in the development of novel therapeutics aimed at modulating BMP 
signaling in humans.

Ruminant Genome Database (RGD; http://animal.nwsuaf.edu.cn/RGD) provides 
visualization and analysis tools for ruminant comparative genomics and 
functional annotations. As more high-quality ruminant genome assemblies have 
become available, we have redesigned the user interface, integrated and expanded 
multi-omics data, and developed novel features to improve the database. The new 
version, RGD v2.0, houses 78 ruminant genomes; 110-species synteny alignments 
for major livestock (including cattle, sheep, goat) and wild ungulates; 21 012 
orthologous gene clusters with Gene Ontology and pathway annotation; ∼8 600 000 
conserved elements; and ∼1 000 000 cis-regulatory elements by utilizing 1053 
epigenomic data sets. The transcriptome data in RGD v2.0 has nearly doubled, 
currently with 1936 RNA-seq data sets, and 155 174 phenotypic data sets have 
been newly added. New and updated features include: (i) The UCSC Genome Browser, 
BLAT, BLAST and Table Browser tools were updated for six available ruminant 
livestock species. (ii) The LiftOver tool was newly introduced into our browser 
to allow coordinate conversion between different ruminant assemblies. And (iii) 
tissue specificity index, tau, was calculated to facilitate batch screening of 
specifically expressed genes. The enhanced genome annotations and improved 
functionality in RGD v2.0 will be useful for study of genome evolution, 
environmental adaption, livestock breeding and biomedicine.

With the completion of the human genome sequence, attention turned to 
identifying and annotating its functional DNA elements. As a complement to 
genetic and comparative genomics approaches, the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements 
Project was launched to contribute maps of RNA transcripts, transcriptional 
regulator binding sites, and chromatin states in many cell types. The resulting 
genome-wide data reveal sites of biochemical activity with high positional 
resolution and cell type specificity that facilitate studies of gene regulation 
and interpretation of noncoding variants associated with human disease. However, 
the biochemically active regions cover a much larger fraction of the genome than 
do evolutionarily conserved regions, raising the question of whether 
nonconserved but biochemically active regions are truly functional. Here, we 
review the strengths and limitations of biochemical, evolutionary, and genetic 
approaches for defining functional DNA segments, potential sources for the 
observed differences in estimated genomic coverage, and the biological 
implications of these discrepancies. We also analyze the relationship between 
signal intensity, genomic coverage, and evolutionary conservation. Our results 
reinforce the principle that each approach provides complementary information 
and that we need to use combinations of all three to elucidate genome function 
in human biology and disease.

human-mouse erythroid progenitor, lymphoblast and embryonic stem-cell lines. By 
combining the genome-wide transcription factor occupancy repertoires, associated 
epigenetic signals, and co-association patterns, here we deduce several 
evolutionary principles of gene regulatory features operating since the mouse 
and human lineages diverged. The genomic distribution profiles, primary binding 
motifs, chromatin states, and DNA methylation preferences are well conserved for 
TF-occupied sequences. However, the extent to which orthologous DNA segments are 
bound by orthologous TFs varies both among TFs and with genomic location: 
binding at promoters is more highly conserved than binding at distal elements. 
Notably, occupancy-conserved TF-occupied sequences tend to be pleiotropic; they 
function in several tissues and also co-associate with many TFs. Single 
nucleotide variants at sites with potential regulatory functions are enriched in 
occupancy-conserved TF-occupied sequences.

Despite remarkable recent advances in genomics that have enabled us to identify 
most of the genes in the human genome, comparable efforts to define 
transcriptional cis-regulatory elements that control gene expression are lagging 
behind. The difficulty of this task stems from two equally important problems: 
our knowledge of how regulatory elements are encoded in genomes remains 
elementary, and there is a vast genomic search space for regulatory elements, 
since most of mammalian genomes are noncoding. Comparative genomic approaches 
are having a remarkable impact on the study of transcriptional regulation in 
eukaryotes and currently represent the most efficient and reliable methods of 
predicting noncoding sequences likely to control the patterns of gene 
expression. By subjecting eukaryotic genomic sequences to computational 
comparisons and subsequent experimentation, we are inching our way toward a more 
comprehensive catalog of common regulatory motifs that lie behind fundamental 
biological processes. We are still far from comprehending how the 
transcriptional regulatory code is encrypted in the human genome and providing 
an initial global view of regulatory gene networks, but collectively, the 
continued development of comparative and experimental approaches will rapidly 
expand our knowledge of the transcriptional regulome.

BACKGROUND: Parasitism is a major ecological niche for a variety of nematodes. 
Multiple nematode lineages have specialized as pathogens, including deadly 
parasites of insects that are used in biological control. We have sequenced and 
analyzed the draft genomes and transcriptomes of the entomopathogenic nematode 
Steinernema carpocapsae and four congeners (S. scapterisci, S. monticolum, S. 
feltiae, and S. glaseri).
RESULTS: We used these genomes to establish phylogenetic relationships, explore 
gene conservation across species, and identify genes uniquely expanded in insect 
parasites. Protein domain analysis in Steinernema revealed a striking expansion 
of numerous putative parasitism genes, including certain protease and protease 
inhibitor families, as well as fatty acid- and retinol-binding proteins. 
Stage-specific gene expression of some of these expanded families further 
supports the notion that they are involved in insect parasitism by Steinernema. 
We show that sets of novel conserved non-coding regulatory motifs are associated 
with orthologous genes in Steinernema and Caenorhabditis.
CONCLUSIONS: We have identified a set of expanded gene families that are likely 
to be involved in parasitism. We have also identified a set of non-coding motifs 
associated with groups of orthologous genes in Steinernema and Caenorhabditis 
involved in neurogenesis and embryonic development that are likely part of 
conserved protein-DNA relationships shared between these two genera.

The divergence of regulatory regions and gene regulatory network (GRN) rewiring 
is a key driver of cichlid phenotypic diversity. However, the contribution of 
miRNA-binding site turnover has yet to be linked to GRN evolution across 
cichlids. Here, we extend our previous studies by analyzing the selective 
constraints driving evolution of miRNA and transcription factor (TF)-binding 
sites of target genes, to infer instances of cichlid GRN rewiring associated 
with regulatory binding site turnover. Comparative analyses identified increased 
species-specific networks that are functionally associated to traits of cichlid 
phenotypic diversity. The evolutionary rewiring is associated with differential 
models of miRNA- and TF-binding site turnover, driven by a high proportion of 
fast-evolving polymorphic sites in adaptive trait genes compared with subsets of 
random genes. Positive selection acting upon discrete mutations in these 
regulatory regions is likely to be an important mechanism in rewiring GRNs in 
rapidly radiating cichlids. Regulatory variants of functionally associated 
miRNA- and TF-binding sites of visual opsin genes differentially segregate 
according to phylogeny and ecology of Lake Malawi species, identifying both 
rewired, for example, clade-specific and conserved network motifs of adaptive 
trait associated GRNs. Our approach revealed several novel candidate regulators, 
regulatory regions, and three-node motifs across cichlid genomes with previously 
reported associations to known adaptive evolutionary traits.

Noncoding DNA is central to our understanding of human gene regulation and 
complex diseases1,2, and measuring the evolutionary sequence constraint can 
establish the functional relevance of putative regulatory elements in the human 
genome3-9. Identifying the genomic elements that have become constrained 
specifically in primates has been hampered by the faster evolution of noncoding 
DNA compared to protein-coding DNA10, the relatively short timescales separating 
primate species11, and the previously limited availability of whole-genome 
sequences12. Here we construct a whole-genome alignment of 239 species, 
representing nearly half of all extant species in the primate order. Using this 
resource, we identified human regulatory elements that are under selective 
constraint across primates and other mammals at a 5% false discovery rate. We 
detected 111,318 DNase I hypersensitivity sites and 267,410 transcription factor 
binding sites that are constrained specifically in primates but not across other 
placental mammals and validate their cis-regulatory effects on gene expression. 
These regulatory elements are enriched for human genetic variants that affect 
gene expression and complex traits and diseases. Our results highlight the 
important role of recent evolution in regulatory sequence elements 
differentiating primates, including humans, from other placental mammals.

BACKGROUND: The dirigent (DIR) genes encode proteins that act as crucial 
regulators of plant lignin biosynthesis. In Solanaceae species, members of the 
DIR gene family are intricately related to plant growth and development, playing 
a key role in responding to various biotic and abiotic stresses. It will be of 
great application significance to analyze the DIR gene family and expression 
profile under various pathogen stresses in Solanaceae species.
RESULTS: A total of 57 tobacco NtDIRs and 33 potato StDIRs were identified based 
on their respective genome sequences. Phylogenetic analysis of DIR genes in 
tobacco, potato, eggplant and Arabidopsis thaliana revealed three distinct 
subgroups (DIR-a, DIR-b/d and DIR-e). Gene structure and conserved motif 
analysis showed that a high degree of conservation in both exon/intron 
organization and protein motifs among tobacco and potato DIR genes, especially 
within members of the same subfamily. Total 8 pairs of tandem duplication genes 
(3 pairs in tobacco, 5 pairs in potato) and 13 pairs of segmental duplication 
genes (6 pairs in tobacco, 7 pairs in potato) were identified based on the 
analysis of gene duplication events. Cis-regulatory elements of the DIR 
promoters participated in hormone response, stress responses, circadian control, 
endosperm expression, and meristem expression. Transcriptomic data analysis 
under biotic stress revealed diverse response patterns among DIR gene family 
members to pathogens, indicating their functional divergence. After 96 h 
post-inoculation with Ralstonia solanacearum L. (Ras), tobacco seedlings 
exhibited typical symptoms of tobacco bacterial wilt. The qRT-PCR analysis of 11 
selected NtDIR genes displayed differential expression pattern in response to 
the bacterial pathogen Ras infection. Using line 392278 of potato as material, 
typical symptoms of potato late blight manifested on the seedling leaves under 
Phytophthora infestans infection. The qRT-PCR analysis of 5 selected StDIR genes 
showed up-regulation in response to pathogen infection. Notably, three clustered 
genes (NtDIR2, NtDIR4, StDIR3) exhibited a robust response to pathogen 
infection, highlighting their essential roles in disease resistance.
CONCLUSION: The genome-wide identification, evolutionary analysis, and 
expression profiling of DIR genes in response to various pathogen infection in 
tobacco and potato have provided valuable insights into the roles of these genes 
under various stress conditions. Our results could provide a basis for further 
functional analysis of the DIR gene family under pathogen infection conditions.

Nitrogen is one of the most inaccessible plant nutrients, but certain species 
have overcome this limitation by establishing symbiotic interactions with 
nitrogen-fixing bacteria in the root nodule. This root-nodule symbiosis (RNS) is 
restricted to species within a single clade of angiosperms, suggesting a 
critical, but undetermined, evolutionary event at the base of this clade. To 
identify putative regulatory sequences implicated in the evolution of RNS, we 
evaluated the genomes of 25 species capable of nodulation and identified 3091 
conserved noncoding sequences (CNS) in the nitrogen-fixing clade (NFC). We show 
that the chromatin accessibility of 452 CNS correlates significantly with the 
regulation of genes responding to lipochitooligosaccharides in Medicago 
truncatula. These included 38 CNS in proximity to 19 known genes involved in 
RNS. Five such regions are upstream of MtCRE1, Cytokinin Response Element 1, 
required to activate a suite of downstream transcription factors necessary for 
nodulation in M. truncatula. Genetic complementation of an Mtcre1 mutant showed 
a significant decrease of nodulation in the absence of the five CNS, when they 
are driving the expression of a functional copy of MtCRE1. CNS identified in the 
NFC may harbor elements required for the regulation of genes controlling RNS in 
M. truncatula.

Ants originated over 150 million years ago through an irreversible transition to 
superorganismal colony life. Comparative analyses of 163 ant genomes, including 
newly generated whole-genome sequences of 145 ant species, reveal extensive 
genome rearrangements correlated with speciation rates. Meanwhile, conserved 
syntenic blocks are enriched with co-expressed genes involved in basal 
metabolism and caste differentiation. Gene families related to digestion, 
endocrine signaling, cuticular hydrocarbon synthesis, and chemoreception 
expanded in the ant ancestor, while many caste-associated genes underwent 
positive selection in the formicoid ancestor. Elaborations and reductions of 
queen-worker dimorphism and other social traits left convergent signatures of 
intensified or relaxed selection in conserved signaling and metabolic pathways, 
suggesting that a core gene set was used to diversify organizational complexity. 
Previously uncharacterized genetic regulators of caste development were 
confirmed by functional experiments. This study reconstructs the genetic 
underpinning of social traits and their integration within gene-regulatory 
networks shaping caste phenotypes.

Human health depends on perplexing defensive cellular responses against 
microbial pathogens like Viruses. Despite the major effort undertaken, the 
(epi)genomic mechanisms that human cells utilize to tailor defensive gene 
expression programs against microbial attacks have remained inadequately 
understood, mainly due to a significant lack of recording of the in vivo 
functional cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) of the human genome. Here, we introduce 
the virus-responsive fate of the human (epi)genome as characterized in naïve and 
infected cells by functional genomics, computational biology, DNA evolution, and 
DNA Grammar and Syntax investigations. We discovered that multitudes of novel 
functional virus-responsive CRMs (vrCRMs) compose typical enhancers (tEs), 
super-enhancers (SEs), repetitive-DNA enhancers (rDEs), and stand-alone 
functional genomic stretches that grant human cells regulatory underpinnings for 
layering basal immunity and eliminating illogical/harmful defensive responses 
under homeostasis, yet stimulating virus-responsive genes and transposable 
elements (TEs) upon infection. Moreover, extensive epigenomic reprogramming of 
previously unknown SE landscapes marks the transition from naïve to antiviral 
human cell states and involves the functions of the antimicrobial transcription 
factors (TFs), including interferon response factor 3 (IRF3) and nuclear 
factor-κB (NF-κB), as well as coactivators and transcriptional apparatus, along 
with intensive modifications/alterations in histone marks and chromatin 
accessibility. Considering the polyphyletic evolutionary fingerprints of the 
composite DNA sequences of the vrCRMs assessed by TFs-STARR-seq, ranging from 
the animal to microbial kingdoms, the conserved features of antimicrobial TFs 
and chromatin complexes, and their pluripotent stimulus-induced activation, 
these findings shed light on how mammalian (epi)genomes evolved their functions 
to interpret the exogenous stress inflicted and program defensive 
transcriptional responses against microbial agents. Crucially, many known human 
short variants, e.g. single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions, 
deletions etc., and quantitative trait loci (QTLs) linked to autoimmune 
diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), 
Crohn's disease (CD) etc., were mapped within or vastly proximal (±2.5 kb) to 
the novel in vivo functional SEs and vrCRMs discovered, thus underscoring the 
impact of their (mal)functions on human physiology and disease development. 
Hence, we delved into the virus-responsive fate of the human (epi)genome and 
illuminated its architecture, function, evolutionary origins, and its 
significance for cellular homeostasis. These results allow us to chart the 
"Human hyper-Atlas of virus-infection", an integrated "molecular in silico" 
encyclopedia situated in the UCSC Genome Browser that benefits our mechanistic 
understanding of human infectious/(auto)immune diseases development and can 
facilitate the generation of in vivo preclinical animal models, drug design, and 
evolution of therapeutic applications.

Metabolic phenotypes are pivotal for many areas, but disentangling how 
evolutionary history and environmental adaptation shape these phenotypes is an 
open problem. Especially for microbes, which are metabolically diverse and often 
interact in complex communities, few phenotypes can be determined directly. 
Instead, potential phenotypes are commonly inferred from genomic information, 
and rarely were model-predicted phenotypes employed beyond the species level. 
Here, we propose sensitivity correlations to quantify similarity of predicted 
metabolic network responses to perturbations, and thereby link genotype and 
environment to phenotype. We show that these correlations provide a consistent 
functional complement to genomic information by capturing how network context 
shapes gene function. This enables, for example, phylogenetic inference across 
all domains of life at the organism level. For 245 bacterial species, we 
identify conserved and variable metabolic functions, elucidate the quantitative 
impact of evolutionary history and ecological niche on these functions, and 
generate hypotheses on associated metabolic phenotypes. We expect our framework 
for the joint interpretation of metabolic phenotypes, evolution, and environment 
to help guide future empirical studies.

Plant genomes encode a complex and evolutionary diverse regulatory grammar that 
forms the basis for most life on earth. A wealth of regulome and epigenome data 
have been generated in various plant species, but no common, standardized 
resource is available so far for biologists. Here, we present ChIP-Hub, an 
integrative web-based platform in the ENCODE standards that bundles >10,000 
publicly available datasets reanalyzed from >40 plant species, allowing 
visualization and meta-analysis. We manually curate the datasets through 
assessing ~540 original publications and comprehensively evaluate their data 
quality. As a proof of concept, we extensively survey the co-association of 
different regulators and construct a hierarchical regulatory network under a 
broad developmental context. Furthermore, we show how our annotation allows to 
investigate the dynamic activity of tissue-specific regulatory elements 
(promoters and enhancers) and their underlying sequence grammar. Finally, we 
analyze the function and conservation of tissue-specific promoters, enhancers 
and chromatin states using comparative genomics approaches. Taken together, the 
ChIP-Hub platform and the analysis results provide rich resources for deep 
exploration of plant ENCODE. ChIP-Hub is available at 
https://biobigdata.nju.edu.cn/ChIPHub/ .

Plant genomes contain a large fraction of noncoding sequences. The discovery and 
annotation of conserved noncoding sequences (CNSs) in plants is an ongoing 
challenge. Here we report the application of comparative genomics to 
systematically identify CNSs in 50 well-annotated Gramineae genomes using rice 
(Oryza sativa) as the reference. We conduct multiple-way whole-genome alignments 
to the rice genome. The rice genome is annotated as 20 conservation states (CSs) 
at single-nucleotide resolution using a multivariate hidden Markov model 
(ConsHMM) based on the multiple-genome alignments. Different states show 
distinct enrichments for various genomic features, and the conservation scores 
of CSs are highly correlated with the level of associated chromatin 
accessibility. We find that at least 33.5% of the rice genome is highly under 
selection, with more than 70% of the sequence lying outside of coding regions. A 
catalog of 855,366 regulatory CNSs is generated, and they significantly 
overlapped with putative active regulatory elements such as promoters, 
enhancers, and transcription factor binding sites. Collectively, our study 
provides a resource for elucidating functional noncoding regions of the rice 
genome and an evolutionary aspect of regulatory sequences in higher plants.

Homology searches between DNA sequences of evolutionary distant species 
(phylogenetic footprinting) offer a fast detection method for regulatory 
sequences. Because of the small size of their genomes, tetraodontid species such 
as the Japanese pufferfish and green spotted pufferfish have become attractive 
models for comparative genomics. A disadvantage of the tetraodontid species is, 
however, that they cannot be bred and manipulated routinely under laboratory 
conditions, so these species are less attractive for developmental and genetic 
analysis. In contrast, an increasing arsenal of transgene techniques with the 
developmental model species zebrafish and medaka are being used for functional 
analysis of cis regulatory sequences. The main disadvantage is the much larger 
genome. While comparison between many loci proved the suitability of 
phylogenetic footprinting using fish and mammalian sequences, fast rate of 
change in enhancer structure and gene duplication within teleosts may obscure 
detection of homologies. Here we discuss the contribution and potentials 
provided by different teleost models for the detection and functional analysis 
of conserved cis-regulatory elements.

Comparative functional genomics offers a powerful approach to study species 
evolution. To date, the majority of these studies have focused on the 
transcriptome in mammalian and yeast phylogenies. Here, we present a novel 
multi-species proteomic dataset and a computational pipeline to systematically 
compare the protein levels across multiple plant species. Globally we find that 
protein levels diverge according to phylogenetic distance but is more 
constrained than the mRNA level. Module-level comparative analysis of groups of 
proteins shows that proteins that are more highly expressed tend to be more 
conserved. To interpret the evolutionary patterns of conservation and 
divergence, we develop a novel network-based integrative analysis pipeline that 
combines publicly available transcriptomic datasets to define co-expression 
modules. Our analysis pipeline can be used to relate the changes in protein 
levels to different species-specific phenotypic traits. We present a case study 
with the rhizobia-legume symbiosis process that supports the role of autophagy 
in this symbiotic association.

BACKGROUND: Because species-specific gene expression is driven by 
species-specific regulation, understanding the relationship between sequence and 
function of the regulatory regions in different species will help elucidate how 
differences among species arise. Despite active experimental and computational 
research, relationships among sequence, conservation, and function are still 
poorly understood.
RESULTS: We compared transcription factor occupied segments (TFos) for 116 human 
and 35 mouse TFs in 546 human and 125 mouse cell types and tissues from the 
Human and the Mouse ENCODE projects. We based the map between human and mouse 
TFos on a one-to-one nucleotide cross-species mapper, bnMapper, that utilizes 
whole genome alignments (WGA). Our analysis shows that TFos are under 
evolutionary constraint, but a substantial portion (25.1% of mouse and 25.85% of 
human on average) of the TFos does not have a homologous sequence on the other 
species; this portion varies among cell types and TFs. Furthermore, 47.67% and 
57.01% of the homologous TFos sequence shows binding activity on the other 
species for human and mouse respectively. However, 79.87% and 69.22% is 
repurposed such that it binds the same TF in different cells or different TFs in 
the same cells. Remarkably, within the set of repurposed TFos, the corresponding 
genome regions in the other species are preferred locations of novel TFos. These 
events suggest exaptation of some functional regulatory sequences into new 
function. Despite TFos repurposing, we did not find substantial changes in their 
predicted target genes, suggesting that CRMs buffer evolutionary events allowing 
little or no change in the TFos - target gene associations. Thus, the small 
portion of TFos with strictly conserved occupancy underestimates the degree of 
conservation of regulatory interactions.
CONCLUSION: We mapped regulatory sequences from an extensive number of TFs and 
cell types between human and mouse using WGA. A comparative analysis of this 
correspondence unveiled the extent of the shared regulatory sequence across TFs 
and cell types under study. Importantly, a large part of the shared regulatory 
sequence is repurposed on the other species. This sequence, fueled by turnover 
events, provides a strong case for exaptation in regulatory elements.

Metazoan genomes primarily consist of non-coding DNA in comparison to coding 
regions. Non-coding fraction of the genome contains cis-regulatory elements, 
which ensure that the genetic code is read properly at the right time and space 
during development. Regulatory elements and their target genes define functional 
landscapes within the genome, and some developmentally important genes evolve by 
keeping the genes involved in specification of common organs/tissues in clusters 
and are termed gene complex. The clustering of genes involved in a common 
function may help in robust spatio-temporal gene expression. Gene complexes are 
often found to be evolutionarily conserved, and the classic example is the hox 
complex. The evolutionary constraints seen among gene complexes provide an ideal 
model system to understand cis and trans-regulation of gene function. This 
review will discuss the various characteristics of gene regulatory modules found 
within gene complexes and how they can be characterized.

The limited regenerative capacity of the human heart contributes to high 
morbidity and mortality worldwide. In contrast, zebrafish exhibit robust 
regenerative capacity, providing a powerful model for studying how to overcome 
intrinsic epigenetic barriers maintaining cardiac homeostasis and initiate 
regeneration. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of the histone 
modifications H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K27me3 and H3K27ac during various stages of 
zebrafish heart regeneration. We found a vast gain of repressive chromatin marks 
one day after myocardial injury, followed by the acquisition of active chromatin 
characteristics on day four and a transition to a repressive state on day 14, 
and identified distinct transcription factor ensembles associated with these 
events. The rapid transcriptional response involves the engagement of 
super-enhancers at genes implicated in extracellular matrix reorganization and 
TOR signaling, while H3K4me3 breadth highly correlates with transcriptional 
activity and dynamic changes at genes involved in proteolysis, cell cycle 
activity, and cell differentiation. Using loss- and gain-of-function approaches, 
we identified transcription factors in cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells 
influencing cardiomyocyte dedifferentiation or proliferation. Finally, we 
detected significant evolutionary conservation between regulatory regions that 
drive zebrafish and neonatal mouse heart regeneration, suggesting that 
reactivating transcriptional and epigenetic networks converging on these 
regulatory elements might unlock the regenerative potential of adult human 
hearts.

The yellow boxfish ( Ostracion cubicus) exhibits a combination of derived 
morphological traits specialized for coral reef environments and ancestral 
characteristics, including a fused dermal plate. Contradictory evolutionary 
evidence hinders true classification of O. cubicus. To clarify its evolutionary 
position within Tetraodontiformes, a chromosome-level genome assembly was 
generated, representing the most contiguous and complete genome to date for this 
lineage. Notably, O. cubicus possessed the largest genome within the order 
Tetraodontiformes, primarily due to extensive transposable element expansion. 
Phylogenetic analysis based on 19 whole genomes and 131 mitochondrial genomes 
resolved Tetraodontiformes into three major sister groups (Ostraciidae-Molidae, 
Tetraodontidae, and Balistidae-Monacanthidae). Comparative genomic evidence 
indicated that O. cubicus diverged early from the common ancestor of modern 
Tetraodontiformes and retained the highest number of HOX genes among surveyed 
taxa. Although overall genomic architecture was largely conserved, certain 
genetic and environmental changes may have contributed to its phenotypic 
adaptations, including climate cooling during the Miocene-Pliocene Transition, 
recent DNA and long interspersed nuclear element (LINE) transposon bursts, 
lineage-specific chromosomal rearrangements, and gene family expansion. Many 
positively selected genes and rapidly evolving genes were associated with 
skeletal development, including bmp7, egf7, and bmpr2. Transcriptomic 
comparisons between carapace and tail skin revealed various candidate genes and 
pathways related to carapace formation, such as postn, scpp1, and components of 
the TGF-β signaling pathway. A derived amino acid substitution in eda, coupled 
with protein structural modeling, suggested potential molecular convergence in 
dermal plate formation among teleosts. These findings provide novel insights 
into the genomic and developmental basis of carapace evolution and coral 
reef-adaptation in O. cubicus, offering a strong case for evolutionary balance 
between genomic conservation with regulatory innovation to achieve coral reef 
specialization.

Newts have large genomes harboring many repeat elements. How these elements 
shape the genome and relate to newts' unique regeneration ability remains 
unknown. We present here the chromosome-scale assembly of the 20.3 Gb genome of 
the Iberian ribbed newt, Pleurodeles waltl, with a hitherto unprecedented 
contiguity and completeness among giant genomes. Utilizing this assembly, we 
demonstrate conserved synteny as well as genetic rearrangements, such as in the 
major histocompatibility complex locus. We provide evidence suggesting that 
intronic repeat elements drive newt-specific circular RNA (circRNA) biogenesis 
and show their regeneration-specific expression. We also present a comprehensive 
in-depth annotation and chromosomal mapping of microRNAs, highlighting genomic 
expansion profiles as well as a distinct regulatory pattern in the regenerating 
limb. These data reveal links between repeat elements, non-coding RNAs, and 
adult regeneration and provide key resources for addressing developmental, 
regenerative, and evolutionary principles.

BACKGROUND: Evolutionary conservation is an invaluable tool for inferring 
functional significance in the genome, including regions that are crucial across 
many species and those that have undergone convergent evolution. Computational 
methods to test for sequence conservation are dominated by algorithms that 
examine the ability of one or more nucleotides to align across large 
evolutionary distances. While these nucleotide alignment-based approaches have 
proven powerful for protein-coding genes and some non-coding elements, they fail 
to capture conservation of many enhancers, distal regulatory elements that 
control spatial and temporal patterns of gene expression. The function of 
enhancers is governed by a complex, often tissue- and cell type-specific code 
that links combinations of transcription factor binding sites and other 
regulation-related sequence patterns to regulatory activity. Thus, function of 
orthologous enhancer regions can be conserved across large evolutionary 
distances, even when nucleotide turnover is high.
RESULTS: We present a new machine learning-based approach for evaluating 
enhancer conservation that leverages the combinatorial sequence code of enhancer 
activity rather than relying on the alignment of individual nucleotides. We 
first train a convolutional neural network model that can predict 
tissue-specific open chromatin, a proxy for enhancer activity, across mammals. 
Next, we apply that model to distinguish instances where the genome sequence 
would predict conserved function versus a loss of regulatory activity in that 
tissue. We present criteria for systematically evaluating model performance for 
this task and use them to demonstrate that our models accurately predict 
tissue-specific conservation and divergence in open chromatin between primate 
and rodent species, vastly out-performing leading nucleotide alignment-based 
approaches. We then apply our models to predict open chromatin at orthologs of 
brain and liver open chromatin regions across hundreds of mammals and find that 
brain enhancers associated with neuron activity have a stronger tendency than 
the general population to have predicted lineage-specific open chromatin.
CONCLUSION: The framework presented here provides a mechanism to annotate 
tissue-specific regulatory function across hundreds of genomes and to study 
enhancer evolution using predicted regulatory differences rather than 
nucleotide-level conservation measurements.

Genetic perturbations of cortical development can lead to neurodevelopmental 
disease, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). To identify genomic regions 
crucial to corticogenesis, we mapped the activity of gene-regulatory elements 
generating a single-cell atlas of gene expression and chromatin accessibility 
both independently and jointly. This revealed waves of gene regulation by key 
transcription factors (TFs) across a nearly continuous differentiation 
trajectory, distinguished the expression programs of glial lineages, and 
identified lineage-determining TFs that exhibited strong correlation between 
linked gene-regulatory elements and expression levels. These highly connected 
genes adopted an active chromatin state in early differentiating cells, 
consistent with lineage commitment. Base-pair-resolution neural network models 
identified strong cell-type-specific enrichment of noncoding mutations predicted 
to be disruptive in a cohort of ASD individuals and identified frequently 
disrupted TF binding sites. This approach illustrates how cell-type-specific 
mapping can provide insights into the programs governing human development and 
disease.

The adult mammalian heart has limited capacity for regeneration following 
injury, whereas the neonatal heart can readily regenerate within a short period 
after birth. Neonatal heart regeneration is orchestrated by multiple cell types 
intrinsic to the heart, as well as immune cells that infiltrate the heart after 
injury. To elucidate the transcriptional responses of the different cellular 
components of the mouse heart following injury, we perform single-cell RNA 
sequencing on neonatal hearts at various time points following myocardial 
infarction and couple the results with bulk tissue RNA-sequencing data collected 
at the same time points. Concomitant single-cell ATAC sequencing exposes 
underlying dynamics of open chromatin landscapes and regenerative gene 
regulatory networks of diverse cardiac cell types and reveals extracellular 
mediators of cardiomyocyte proliferation, angiogenesis, and fibroblast 
activation. Together, our data provide a transcriptional basis for neonatal 
heart regeneration at single-cell resolution and suggest strategies for 
enhancing cardiac function after injury.

Deconvolution of regulatory mechanisms that drive transcriptional programs in 
cancer cells is key to understanding tumor biology. Herein, we present matched 
transcriptome (scRNA-seq) and chromatin accessibility (scATAC-seq) profiles at 
single-cell resolution from human ovarian and endometrial tumors processed 
immediately following surgical resection. This dataset reveals the complex 
cellular heterogeneity of these tumors and enabled us to quantitatively link 
variation in chromatin accessibility to gene expression. We show that malignant 
cells acquire previously unannotated regulatory elements to drive hallmark 
cancer pathways. Moreover, malignant cells from within the same patients show 
substantial variation in chromatin accessibility linked to transcriptional 
output, highlighting the importance of intratumoral heterogeneity. Finally, we 
infer the malignant cell type-specific activity of transcription factors. By 
defining the regulatory logic of cancer cells, this work reveals an important 
reliance on oncogenic regulatory elements and highlights the ability of matched 
scRNA-seq/scATAC-seq to uncover clinically relevant mechanisms of tumorigenesis 
in gynecologic cancers.

CRISPR-based gene activation (CRISPRa) is a strategy for upregulating gene 
expression by targeting promoters or enhancers in a tissue/cell-type specific 
manner. Here, we describe an experimental framework that combines highly 
multiplexed perturbations with single-cell RNA sequencing (sc-RNA-seq) to 
identify cell-type-specific, CRISPRa-responsive cis-regulatory elements and the 
gene(s) they regulate. Random combinations of many gRNAs are introduced to each 
of many cells, which are then profiled and partitioned into test and control 
groups to test for effect(s) of CRISPRa perturbations of both enhancers and 
promoters on the expression of neighboring genes. Applying this method to a 
library of 493 gRNAs targeting candidate cis-regulatory elements in both K562 
cells and iPSC-derived excitatory neurons, we identify gRNAs capable of 
specifically upregulating intended target genes and no other neighboring genes 
within 1 Mb, including gRNAs yielding upregulation of six autism spectrum 
disorder (ASD) and neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) risk genes in neurons. A 
consistent pattern is that the responsiveness of individual enhancers to CRISPRa 
is restricted by cell type, implying a dependency on either chromatin landscape 
and/or additional trans-acting factors for successful gene activation. The 
approach outlined here may facilitate large-scale screens for gRNAs that 
activate genes in a cell type-specific manner.

Massively parallel reporter gene assays are key tools in regulatory genomics but 
cannot be used to identify cell-type-specific regulatory elements without 
performing assays serially across different cell types. To address this problem, 
we developed a single-cell massively parallel reporter assay (scMPRA) to measure 
the activity of libraries of cis-regulatory sequences (CRSs) across multiple 
cell types simultaneously. We assayed a library of core promoters in a mixture 
of HEK293 and K562 cells and showed that scMPRA is a reproducible, highly 
parallel, single-cell reporter gene assay that detects cell-type-specific 
cis-regulatory activity. We then measured a library of promoter variants across 
multiple cell types in live mouse retinas and showed that subtle genetic 
variants can produce cell-type-specific effects on cis-regulatory activity. We 
anticipate that scMPRA will be widely applicable for studying the role of CRSs 
across diverse cell types.

Genetic targeting methods for monitoring and manipulating neuronal activity are 
not widely used for studying the primate brain, largely owing to the lack of a 
cell-type-specific targeting method. Using single-cell RNA and ATAC sequencing 
of macaque brains combined with in vivo screening, we identified a large set of 
enhancers capable of driving targeted gene expression in specific cell types. 
AAV vectors driven by these enhancers successfully targeted layer-specific 
glutamatergic neurons, GABAergic interneuron subtypes, astrocytes, and 
oligodendrocytes with high specificity. Cross-species comparison revealed that 
some macaque enhancers are conserved and functional across species, but 
enhancers with layer-specific targeting in macaques did not label neurons in 
mice, highlighting evolutionary differences in cortical CREs. Targeting 
precision was further improved using a FLPo-dependent intersectional approach 
with two enhancers. These enhancer-AAVs were validated by monitoring and 
manipulating activity in macaque visual cortex, providing valuable tools to 
dissect primate neural circuit functions.

The integration of single cell transcriptome and chromatin accessibility 
datasets enables a deeper understanding of cell heterogeneity. We performed 
single nucleus ATAC (snATAC-seq) and RNA (snRNA-seq) sequencing to generate 
paired, cell-type-specific chromatin accessibility and transcriptional profiles 
of the adult human kidney. We demonstrate that snATAC-seq is comparable to 
snRNA-seq in the assignment of cell identity and can further refine our 
understanding of functional heterogeneity in the nephron. The majority of 
differentially accessible chromatin regions are localized to promoters and a 
significant proportion are closely associated with differentially expressed 
genes. Cell-type-specific enrichment of transcription factor binding motifs 
implicates the activation of NF-κB that promotes VCAM1 expression and drives 
transition between a subpopulation of proximal tubule epithelial cells. Our 
multi-omics approach improves the ability to detect unique cell states within 
the kidney and redefines cellular heterogeneity in the proximal tubule and thick 
ascending limb.

Cell type-specific transcriptional differences between brain tissues from donors 
with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and unaffected controls have been well documented, 
but few studies have rigorously interrogated the regulatory mechanisms 
responsible for these alterations. We performed single nucleus multiomics 
(snRNA-seq plus snATAC-seq) on 105,332 nuclei isolated from cortical tissues 
from 7 AD and 8 unaffected donors to identify candidate cis-regulatory elements 
(CREs) involved in AD-associated transcriptional changes. We detected 319,861 
significant correlations, or links, between gene expression and cell 
type-specific transposase accessible regions enriched for active CREs. Among 
these, 40,831 were unique to AD tissues. Validation experiments confirmed the 
activity of many regions, including several candidate regulators of APP 
expression. We identified ZEB1 and MAFB as candidate transcription 
factors playing important roles in AD-specific gene regulation in neurons and 
microglia, respectively. Microglia links were globally enriched for heritability 
of AD risk and previously identified active regulatory regions.

cis-regulatory elements (CREs) encode the genomic blueprints of spatiotemporal 
gene expression programs enabling highly specialized cell functions. Using 
single-cell genomics in six maize organs, we determined the cis- and 
trans-regulatory factors defining diverse cell identities and coordinating 
chromatin organization by profiling transcription factor (TF) combinatorics, 
identifying TFs with non-cell-autonomous activity, and uncovering TFs underlying 
higher-order chromatin interactions. Cell-type-specific CREs were enriched for 
enhancer activity and within unmethylated long terminal repeat retrotransposons. 
Moreover, we found cell-type-specific CREs are hotspots for phenotype-associated 
genetic variants and were targeted by selection during modern maize breeding, 
highlighting the biological implications of this CRE atlas. Through comparison 
of maize and Arabidopsis thaliana developmental trajectories, we identified TFs 
and CREs with conserved and divergent chromatin dynamics, showcasing extensive 
evolution of gene regulatory networks. In addition to this rich dataset, we 
developed single-cell analysis software, Socrates, which can be used to 
understand cis-regulatory variation in any species.

BACKGROUND: Analyzing disease-linked genetic variants via expression 
quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) helps identify potential disease-causing genes. 
Previous research prioritized genes by integrating Genome-Wide Association Study 
(GWAS) results with tissue-level eQTLs. Recent studies have explored brain cell 
type-specific eQTLs, but a systematic analysis across multiple Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) genome-wide association study (GWAS) datasets or comparisons 
between tissue-level and cell type-specific effects remain limited. Here, we 
integrated brain cell type-level and bulk-level eQTL datasets with AD GWAS 
datasets to identify potential causal genes.
METHODS: We used Summary Data-Based Mendelian Randomization (SMR) and Bayesian 
Colocalization (COLOC) to integrate AD GWAS summary statistics with eQTLs 
datasets. Combining data from five AD GWAS, two single-cell eQTL datasets, and 
one bulk eQTL dataset, we identified novel candidate causal genes and further 
confirmed known ones. We investigated gene regulation through enhancer activity 
using H3K27ac and ATAC-seq data, performed protein-protein interaction (PPI) and 
pathway enrichment, and conducted a drug/compound enrichment analysis with Drug 
Signatures Database (DSigDB) to support drug repurposing for AD.
RESULTS: We identified 28 candidate causal genes for AD, of which 12 were 
uniquely detected at the cell-type level, 9 were exclusive to the bulk level and 
7 detected in both. Among the 19 cell-type level candidate causal genes, 
microglia contributed the highest number of candidate genes, followed by 
excitatory neurons, astrocytes, inhibitory neurons, oligodendrocytes, and 
oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). PABPC1 emerged as a novel candidate 
causal gene in astrocytes. We generated PPI networks for the candidate causal 
genes and found that pathways such as membrane organization, cell migration, and 
ERK1/2 and PI3K/AKT signaling were enriched. The AD-risk variant associated with 
candidate causal gene PABPC1 is located near or within enhancers only active in 
astrocytes. We classified the 28 genes into three drug tiers and identified 
druggable interactions, with imatinib mesylate emerging as a key candidate. A 
drug-target gene network was created to explore potential drug targets for AD.
CONCLUSIONS: We systematically prioritized AD candidate causal genes based on 
cell type-level and bulk level molecular evidence. The integrative approach 
enhances our understanding of molecular mechanisms of AD-related genetic 
variants and facilitates interpretation of AD GWAS results.

BACKGROUND: Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) poses a growing health threat, 
elevating heart failure risk in diabetic individuals. Understanding DCM is 
crucial, with fibroblasts and endothelial cells playing pivotal roles in driving 
myocardial fibrosis and contributing to cardiac dysfunction. Advances in 
Multimodal single-cell profiling, such as scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq, provide 
deeper insights into DCM's unique cell states and molecular landscape for 
targeted therapeutic interventions.
METHODS: Single-cell RNA and ATAC data from 10x Multiome libraries were 
processed using Cell Ranger ARC v2.0.1. Gene expression and ATAC data underwent 
Seurat and Signac filtration. Differential gene expression and accessible 
chromatin regions were identified. Transcription factor activity was estimated 
with chromVAR, and Cis-coaccessibility networks were calculated using Cicero. 
Coaccessibility connections were compared to the GeneHancer database. Gene 
Ontology analysis, biological process scoring, cell-cell communication analysis, 
and gene-motif correlation was performed to reveal intricate molecular changes. 
Immunofluorescent staining utilized various antibodies on paraffin-embedded 
tissues to verify the findings.
RESULTS: This study integrated scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data obtained from 
hearts of WT and DCM mice, elucidating molecular changes at the single-cell 
level throughout the diabetic cardiomyopathy progression. Robust and accurate 
clustering analysis of the integrated data revealed altered cell proportions, 
showcasing decreased endothelial cells and macrophages, coupled with increased 
fibroblasts and myocardial cells in the DCM group, indicating enhanced fibrosis 
and endothelial damage. Chromatin accessibility analysis unveiled unique 
patterns in cell types, with heightened transcriptional activity in myocardial 
cells. Subpopulation analysis highlighted distinct changes in cardiomyocytes and 
fibroblasts, emphasizing pathways related to fatty acid metabolism and cardiac 
contraction. Fibroblast-centered communication analysis identified interactions 
with endothelial cells, implicating VEGF receptors. Endothelial cell 
subpopulations exhibited altered gene expressions, emphasizing contraction and 
growth-related pathways. Candidate regulators, including Tcf21, Arnt, Stat5a, 
and Stat5b, were identified, suggesting their pivotal roles in DCM development. 
Immunofluorescence staining validated marker genes of cell subpopulations, 
confirming PDK4, PPARγ and Tpm1 as markers for metabolic pattern-altered 
cardiomyocytes, activated fibroblasts and endothelial cells with compromised 
proliferation.
CONCLUSION: Our integrated scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq analysis unveils intricate 
cell states and molecular alterations in diabetic cardiomyopathy. Identified 
cell type-specific changes, transcription factors, and marker genes offer 
valuable insights. The study sheds light on potential therapeutic targets for 
DCM.

The establishment of cell types during development requires precise interactions 
between genes and distal regulatory sequences. We have a limited understanding 
of how these interactions look in three dimensions, vary across cell types in 
complex tissue, and relate to transcription. Here we describe optical 
reconstruction of chromatin architecture (ORCA), a method that can trace the DNA 
path in single cells with nanoscale accuracy and genomic resolution reaching two 
kilobases. We used ORCA to study a Hox gene cluster in cryosectioned Drosophila 
embryos and labelled around 30 RNA species in parallel. We identified 
cell-type-specific physical borders between active and Polycomb-repressed DNA, 
and unexpected Polycomb-independent borders. Deletion of Polycomb-independent 
borders led to ectopic enhancer-promoter contacts, aberrant gene expression, and 
developmental defects. Together, these results illustrate an approach for 
high-resolution, single-cell DNA domain analysis in vivo, identify domain 
structures that change with cell identity, and show that border elements 
contribute to the formation of physical domains in Drosophila.

With the advent of recent next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies in 
genomics, transcriptomics, and epigenomics, profiling single-cell sequencing 
became possible. The single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is widely used to 
characterize diverse cell populations and ascertain cell type-specific 
regulatory mechanisms. The gene regulatory network (GRN) mainly consists of 
genes and their regulators-transcription factors (TF). Here, we describe the 
lightning-fast Python implementation of the SCENIC (Single-Cell reEgulatory 
Network Inference and Clustering) pipeline called pySCENIC. Using single-cell 
RNA-seq data, it maps TFs onto gene regulatory networks and integrates various 
cell types to infer cell-specific GRNs. There are two fast and efficient GRN 
inference algorithms, GRNBoost2 and GENIE3, optionally available with pySCENIC. 
The pipeline has three steps: (1) identification of potential TF targets based 
on co-expression; (2) TF-motif enrichment analysis to identify the direct 
targets (regulons); and (3) scoring the activity of regulons (or other gene 
sets) on single cell types.

Gene expression and complex phenotypes are determined by the activity of 
cis-regulatory elements. However, an understanding of how extant genetic 
variants affect cis regulation remains limited. Here, we investigated the 
consequences of cis-regulatory diversity using single-cell genomics of more than 
0.7 million nuclei across 172 Zea mays (maize) inbreds. Our analyses pinpointed 
cis-regulatory elements distinct to domesticated maize and revealed how 
historical transposon activity has shaped the cis-regulatory landscape. 
Leveraging population genetics principles, we fine-mapped about 22,000 chromatin 
accessibility-associated genetic variants with widespread cell type-specific 
effects. Variants in TEOSINTE BRANCHED1/CYCLOIDEA/PROLIFERATING CELL 
FACTOR-binding sites were the most prevalent determinants of chromatin 
accessibility. Finally, integrating chromatin accessibility-associated variants, 
organismal trait variation, and population differentiation revealed how local 
adaptation has rewired regulatory networks in unique cellular contexts to alter 
maize flowering.

Human brain development spans from embryogenesis to adulthood, with dynamic gene 
expression controlled by cell-type-specific cis-regulatory element activity and 
three-dimensional genome organization. To advance our understanding of postnatal 
brain development, we simultaneously profiled gene expression and chromatin 
accessibility in 101,924 single nuclei from four brain regions across ten 
donors, covering five key postnatal stages from infancy to late adulthood. Using 
this dataset and chromosome conformation capture data, we constructed 
enhancer-based gene regulatory networks to identify cell-type-specific 
regulators of brain development and interpret genome-wide association study loci 
for ten main brain disorders. Our analysis connected 2,318 cell-specific loci to 
1,149 unique genes, representing 41% of loci linked to the investigated traits, 
and highlighted 55 genes influencing several disease phenotypes. Pseudotime 
analysis revealed distinct stages of postnatal oligodendrogenesis and their 
regulatory programs. These findings provide a comprehensive dataset of 
cell-type-specific gene regulation at critical timepoints in postnatal brain 
development.

Genome-wide profiling of histone modifications can reveal not only the location 
and activity state of regulatory elements, but also the regulatory mechanisms 
involved in cell-type-specific gene expression during development and disease 
pathology. Conventional assays to profile histone modifications in bulk tissues 
lack single-cell resolution. Here we describe an ultra-high-throughput method, 
Paired-Tag, for joint profiling of histone modifications and transcriptome in 
single cells to produce cell-type-resolved maps of chromatin state and 
transcriptome in complex tissues. We used this method to profile five histone 
modifications jointly with transcriptome in the adult mouse frontal cortex and 
hippocampus. Integrative analysis of the resulting maps identified distinct 
groups of genes subject to divergent epigenetic regulatory mechanisms. Our 
single-cell multiomics approach enables comprehensive analysis of chromatin 
state and gene regulation in complex tissues and characterization of gene 
regulatory programs in the constituent cell types.

The cellular complexity of the human brain is established via dynamic changes in 
gene expression throughout development that is mediated, in part, by the 
spatiotemporal activity of cis-regulatory elements (CREs). We simultaneously 
profiled gene expression and chromatin accessibility in 45,549 cortical nuclei 
across six broad developmental time points from fetus to adult. We identified 
cell type-specific domains in which chromatin accessibility is highly correlated 
with gene expression. Differentiation pseudotime trajectory analysis indicates 
that chromatin accessibility at CREs precedes transcription and that dynamic 
changes in chromatin structure play a critical role in neuronal lineage 
commitment. In addition, we mapped cell type-specific and temporally specific 
genetic loci implicated in neuropsychiatric traits, including schizophrenia and 
bipolar disorder. Together, our results describe the complex regulation of cell 
composition at critical stages in lineage determination and shed light on the 
impact of spatiotemporal alterations in gene expression on neuropsychiatric 
disease.

Recent advances in single-cell technologies have led to the discovery of 
thousands of brain cell types; however, our understanding of the gene regulatory 
programs in these cell types is far from complete1-4. Here we report a 
comprehensive atlas of candidate cis-regulatory DNA elements (cCREs) in the 
adult mouse brain, generated by analysing chromatin accessibility in 2.3 million 
individual brain cells from 117 anatomical dissections. The atlas includes 
approximately 1 million cCREs and their chromatin accessibility across 1,482 
distinct brain cell populations, adding over 446,000 cCREs to the most recent 
such annotation in the mouse genome. The mouse brain cCREs are moderately 
conserved in the human brain. The mouse-specific cCREs-specifically, those 
identified from a subset of cortical excitatory neurons-are strongly enriched 
for transposable elements, suggesting a potential role for transposable elements 
in the emergence of new regulatory programs and neuronal diversity. Finally, we 
infer the gene regulatory networks in over 260 subclasses of mouse brain cells 
and develop deep-learning models to predict the activities of gene regulatory 
elements in different brain cell types from the DNA sequence alone. Our results 
provide a resource for the analysis of cell-type-specific gene regulation 
programs in both mouse and human brains.

Lipid mediators are important regulators in inflammatory responses, and their 
biosynthetic pathways are targeted by commonly used anti-inflammatory drugs. 
Switching from pro-inflammatory lipid mediators (PIMs) to specialized 
pro-resolving (SPMs) is a critical step toward acute inflammation resolution and 
preventing chronic inflammation. Although the biosynthetic pathways and enzymes 
for PIMs and SPMs have now been largely identified, the actual transcriptional 
profiles underlying the immune cell type-specific transcriptional profiles of 
these mediators are still unknown. Using the Atlas of Inflammation Resolution, 
we created a large network of gene regulatory interactions linked to the 
biosynthesis of SPMs and PIMs. By mapping single-cell sequencing data, we 
identified cell type-specific gene regulatory networks of the lipid mediator 
biosynthesis. Using machine learning approaches combined with network features, 
we identified cell clusters of similar transcriptional regulation and 
demonstrated how specific immune cell activation affects PIM and SPM profiles. 
We found substantial differences in regulatory networks in related cells, 
accounting for network-based preprocessing in functional single-cell analyses. 
Our results not only provide further insight into the gene regulation of lipid 
mediators in the immune response but also shed light on the contribution of 
selected cell types in their biosynthesis.

Cell type-specific regulatory programs that drive type 1 diabetes (T1D) in the 
pancreas are poorly understood. Here, we performed single-nucleus multiomics and 
spatial transcriptomics in up to 32 nondiabetic (ND), autoantibody-positive 
(AAB+), and T1D pancreas donors. Genomic profiles from 853,005 cells mapped to 
12 pancreatic cell types, including multiple exocrine subtypes. β, Acinar, and 
other cell types, and related cellular niches, had altered abundance and gene 
activity in T1D progression, including distinct pathways altered in AAB+ 
compared to T1D. We identified epigenomic drivers of gene activity in T1D and 
AAB+ which, combined with genetic association, revealed causal pathways of T1D 
risk including antigen presentation in β cells. Last, single-cell and spatial 
profiles together revealed widespread changes in cell-cell signaling in T1D 
including signals affecting β cell regulation. Overall, these results revealed 
drivers of T1D in the pancreas, which form the basis for therapeutic targets for 
disease prevention.

The recent development of single-cell techniques is essential to unravel complex 
biological systems. By measuring the transcriptome and the accessible genome on 
a single-cell level, cellular heterogeneity in a biological environment can be 
deciphered. Transcription factors act as key regulators activating and 
repressing downstream target genes, and together they constitute gene regulatory 
networks that govern cell morphology and identity. Dissecting these gene 
regulatory networks is crucial for understanding molecular mechanisms and 
disease, especially within highly complex biological systems. The gene 
regulatory network analysis software ANANSE and the motif enrichment software 
GimmeMotifs were both developed to analyse bulk datasets. We developed scANANSE, 
a software pipeline for gene regulatory network analysis and motif enrichment 
using single-cell RNA and ATAC datasets. The scANANSE pipeline can be run from 
either R or Python. First, it exports data from standard single-cell objects. 
Next, it automatically runs multiple comparisons of cell cluster data. Finally, 
it imports the results back to the single-cell object, where the result can be 
further visualised, integrated, and interpreted. Here, we demonstrate our 
scANANSE pipeline on a publicly available PBMC multi-omics dataset. It 
identifies well-known cell type-specific hematopoietic factors. Importantly, we 
also demonstrated that scANANSE combined with GimmeMotifs is able to predict 
transcription factors with both activating and repressing roles in gene 
regulation.

Transcribed enhancer maps can reveal nuclear interactions underpinning each cell 
type and connect specific cell types to diseases. Using a 5' single-cell RNA 
sequencing approach, we defined transcription start sites of enhancer RNAs and 
other classes of coding and noncoding RNAs in human CD4+ T cells, revealing 
cellular heterogeneity and differentiation trajectories. Integration of these 
datasets with single-cell chromatin profiles showed that active enhancers with 
bidirectional RNA transcription are highly cell type-specific and that disease 
heritability is strongly enriched in these enhancers. The resulting cell 
type-resolved multimodal atlas of bidirectionally transcribed enhancers, which 
we linked with promoters using fine-scale chromatin contact maps, enabled us to 
systematically interpret genetic variants associated with a range of 
immune-mediated diseases.

Single-cell ATAC sequencing (scATAC-seq), a state-of-the-art genomic technique 
designed to map chromatin accessibility at the single-cell level, presents 
unique analytical challenges due to limited sampling and data sparsity. In this 
study, we use case studies to highlight the limitations of conventional 
peak-based methods for processing scATAC-seq data. These methods can fail to 
capture precise cell-type-specific regulatory signals, producing results that 
are difficult to interpret and lack portability, thereby compromising the 
reproducibility of research findings. To overcome these issues, we introduce 
CREscendo, a method that utilizes Tn5 cleavage frequencies and regulatory 
annotations to identify differential usage of candidate regulatory elements 
(CREs) across cell types. Our research advocates for moving away from 
traditional peak-based quantification in scATAC-seq toward a more robust 
framework that relies on a standardized reference of annotated CREs, enhancing 
both the accuracy and reproducibility of genomic studies.

Endurance exercise induces multisystem adaptations that improve performance and 
benefit health. Gene regulatory circuit responses within individual skeletal 
muscle cell types, which are key mediators of exercise effects, have not been 
studied. Here, we map transcriptome, chromatin, and regulatory circuit responses 
to acute endurance exercise in muscle using same-cell RNA-seq/ATAC-seq multiome 
assays. High-quality data were obtained from 37,154 nuclei comprising 14 cell 
types in vastus lateralis samples collected before and 3.5 h after either 40 min 
cycling exercise at 70% VO2max or 40 min supine rest. Both shared and 
cell-type-specific regulatory programs were identified. Differential gene 
expression and accessibility sites are largely distinct within nuclei for each 
cell type and muscle fiber, with the largest numbers of regulatory events 
observed in the three muscle fiber types (slow, fast, and intermediate) and 
lumican (LUM)-expressing fibro-adipogenic progenitor cells. Single-cell 
regulatory circuit triad reconstruction (transcription factor, chromatin 
interaction site, regulated gene) also identifies largely distinct gene 
regulatory circuits modulated by exercise in the three muscle fiber types and 
LUM-expressing fibro-adipogenic progenitor cells, involving a total of 328 
transcription factors acting at chromatin sites regulating 2025 genes. This 
web-accessible single-cell data set and regulatory circuitry map serve as a 
resource for understanding the molecular underpinnings of the metabolic and 
physiological effects of exercise and for guiding interpretation of the exercise 
response literature in bulk tissue.

Cell-type-specific alternative splicing (AS) enables differential gene isoform 
expression between diverse neuron types with distinct identities and functions. 
Current studies linking individual RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) to AS in a 
limited number of neuron types underscore the need for holistic modeling. Here, 
we use network reverse engineering to derive a map of the neuron-type-specific 
AS-regulatory landscape of 133 mouse neocortical cell types using pseudobulk 
transcriptomes derived from single-cell data. We infer the regulons of 350 RBPs 
and their cell-type-specific activities, among which we validate Elavl2 as a key 
RBP for medial ganglionic eminence (MGE)-specific splicing in GABAergic 
interneurons using an in vitro embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation system. 
We also identify a module of exons and candidate regulators specific to long- 
and short-projection neurons across multiple neuronal classes. This study 
provides a resource for elucidating splicing-regulatory programs that drive 
neuronal molecular diversity, including those that do not align with 
gene-expression-based classifications.

DNA accessibility of cis-regulatory elements (CREs) dictates transcriptional 
activity and drives cell differentiation during development. While many genes 
regulating embryonic development have been identified, the underlying CRE 
dynamics controlling their expression remain largely uncharacterized. To address 
this, we produced a multimodal resource and genomic regulatory map for the 
zebrafish community, which integrates single-cell combinatorial indexing assay 
for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing 
(sci-ATAC-seq) with bulk histone PTMs and Hi-C data to achieve a genome-wide 
classification of the regulatory architecture determining transcriptional 
activity in the 24-h post-fertilization (hpf) embryo. We characterized the 
genome-wide chromatin architecture at bulk and single-cell resolution, applying 
sci-ATAC-seq on whole 24-hpf stage zebrafish embryos, generating accessibility 
profiles for ∼23,000 single nuclei. We developed a genome segmentation method, 
ScregSeg (single-cell regulatory landscape segmentation), for defining 
regulatory programs, and candidate CREs, specific to one or more cell types. We 
integrated the ScregSeg output with bulk measurements for histone 
post-translational modifications and 3D genome organization and identified new 
regulatory principles between chromatin modalities prevalent during zebrafish 
development. Sci-ATAC-seq profiling of npas4l/cloche mutant embryos identified 
novel cellular roles for this hematovascular transcriptional master regulator 
and suggests an intricate mechanism regulating its expression. Our work defines 
regulatory architecture and principles in the zebrafish embryo and establishes a 
resource of cell-type-specific genome-wide regulatory annotations and candidate 
CREs, providing a valuable open resource for genomics, developmental, molecular, 
and computational biology.

Gene regulatory networks (GRNs), consisting of transcription factors and their 
target sites, control neurogenesis and cell-fate specification in the developing 
central nervous system. In this study, we use integrated single-cell RNA and 
single-cell ATAC sequencing (scATAC-seq) analysis in developing mouse and human 
retina to identify multiple interconnected, evolutionarily conserved GRNs 
composed of cell-type-specific transcription factors that both activate genes 
within their own network and inhibit genes in other networks. These GRNs control 
temporal patterning in primary progenitors, regulate transition from primary to 
neurogenic progenitors, and drive specification of each major retinal cell type. 
We confirm that NFI transcription factors selectively activate expression of 
genes promoting late-stage temporal identity in primary retinal progenitors and 
identify other transcription factors that regulate rod photoreceptor 
specification in postnatal retina. This study inventories cis- and trans-acting 
factors that control retinal development and can guide cell-based therapies 
aimed at replacing retinal neurons lost to disease.

Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic (H-I) brain injury, a leading cause of 
neurodevelopmental disabilities, severely affects the metabolically active and 
neurogenic hippocampus. To investigate its acute effects and identify drug 
targets for early therapeutic windows, we applied single-nucleus RNA sequencing 
on postnatal day 8 (P8) mouse hippocampi under sham, hypoxic, and 
hypoxic-ischemic conditions. We constructed a comprehensive hippocampal cell 
atlas and developed a machine-learning classifier for precise cell type 
identification. Our analysis reveals early vulnerabilities in mature neurons and 
notable resilience in immature DG, GABAergic, and Cajal-Retzius cells following 
H-I. Gene regulatory network analysis identified key transcription factors 
associated with neuronal vulnerability, along with upregulated ribosome 
biogenesis and dysregulated calcium homeostasis pathways. We observed rapid 
activation of astrocytes and microglia, with Runx1 identified as a potential key 
transcription factor associated with early microglia immune responses. 
Endothelial cells displayed complex transcriptional changes and predicted 
intercellular signaling patterns that may influence vascular repair and 
recovery. Our study advances the understanding of immediate cellular and 
transcriptional responses to neonatal H-I injury, providing new insights into 
hippocampal cell heterogeneity and pathophysiology. The integrated hippocampal 
atlas, post-H-I atlas, and machine learning classifier are available at 
https://hippo-seq.org .

Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is known to modulate immune response in 
peripheral blood cells. The mechanisms of THC's effects on gene expression in 
human immune cells remains poorly understood. Combining a within-subject design 
with single cell transcriptome mapping, we report that THC acutely alters gene 
expression in 15,973 blood cells. We identified 294 transcriptome-wide 
significant genes among eight cell types including 69 common genes and 225 
cell-type-specific genes affected by THC administration, including those genes 
involving in immune response, cytokine production, cell proliferation and 
apoptosis. We revealed distinct transcriptomic sub-clusters affected by THC in 
major immune cell types where THC perturbed cell-type-specific intracellular 
gene expression correlations. Gene set enrichment analysis further supports the 
findings of THC's common and cell-type-specific effects on immune response and 
cell toxicity. This comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic profiling provides 
important insights into THC's acute effects on immune function that may have 
important medical implications.

MOTIVATION: Identifying regulatory regions in the genome is of great interest 
for understanding the epigenomic landscape in cells. One fundamental challenge 
in this context is to find the target genes whose expression is affected by the 
regulatory regions. A recent successful method is the Activity-By-Contact (ABC) 
model which scores enhancer-gene interactions based on enhancer activity and the 
contact frequency of an enhancer to its target gene. However, it describes 
regulatory interactions entirely from a gene's perspective, and does not account 
for all the candidate target genes of an enhancer. In addition, the ABC model 
requires two types of assays to measure enhancer activity, which limits the 
applicability. Moreover, there is neither implementation available that could 
allow for an integration with transcription factor (TF) binding information nor 
an efficient analysis of single-cell data.
RESULTS: We demonstrate that the ABC score can yield a higher accuracy by 
adapting the enhancer activity according to the number of contacts the enhancer 
has to its candidate target genes and also by considering all annotated 
transcription start sites of a gene. Further, we show that the model is 
comparably accurate with only one assay to measure enhancer activity. We 
combined our generalized ABC model with TF binding information and illustrated 
an analysis of a single-cell ATAC-seq dataset of the human heart, where we were 
able to characterize cell type-specific regulatory interactions and predict gene 
expression based on TF affinities. All executed processing steps are 
incorporated into our new computational pipeline STARE.

In diploid organisms, biallelic gene expression enables the production of 
adequate levels of mRNA1,2. This is essential for haploinsufficient genes, which 
require biallelic expression for optimal function to prevent the onset of 
developmental disorders1,3. Whether and how a biallelic or monoallelic state is 
determined in a cell-type-specific manner at individual loci remains unclear. 
MSL2 is known for dosage compensation of the male X chromosome in flies. Here we 
identify a role of MSL2 in regulating allelic expression in mammals. 
Allele-specific bulk and single-cell analyses in mouse neural progenitor cells 
revealed that, in addition to the targets showing biallelic downregulation, a 
class of genes transitions from biallelic to monoallelic expression after MSL2 
loss. Many of these genes are haploinsufficient. In the absence of MSL2, one 
allele remains active, retaining active histone modifications and transcription 
factor binding, whereas the other allele is silenced, exhibiting loss of 
promoter-enhancer contacts and the acquisition of DNA methylation. Msl2-knockout 
mice show perinatal lethality and heterogeneous phenotypes during embryonic 
development, supporting a role for MSL2 in regulating gene dosage. The role of 
MSL2 in preserving biallelic expression of specific dosage-sensitive genes sets 
the stage for further investigation of other factors that are involved in 
allelic dosage compensation in mammalian cells, with considerable implications 
for human disease.

This chapter discusses the development and application of constitutive and brain 
cell-type-specific promoters and enhancers in lentiviral vectors to enable 
precise and efficient gene delivery. The fundamental mechanisms of 
transcriptional regulation by promoters, distinguished between constitutive and 
cell-type-specific promoters, are outlined and the role of enhancers in 
modulating transcriptional activity is emphasized. Recent breakthroughs in 
single-cell transcriptomics and assay for transposase-accessible chromatin 
(ATAC) sequencing have led to the identification of novel enhancer regions, thus 
paving the way for the development of more refined and targeted lentiviral 
vectors. These advances have the potential to significantly improve the 
specificity and efficacy of transgene expression in distinct brain cell 
populations, including excitatory and inhibitory neurons, astrocytes, and 
microglia.

The epigenetic control of gene expression is highly cell-type and context 
specific. Yet, despite its complexity, gene regulatory logic can be broken down 
into modular components consisting of a transcription factor (TF) activating or 
repressing the target gene expression through its binding to a cis-regulatory 
region. We propose a nonparametric approach, TRIPOD, to detect and characterize 
the three-way relationships between a TF, its target gene, and the accessibility 
of the TF's binding site using single-cell RNA and ATAC multiomic data. We apply 
TRIPOD to interrogate the cell-type-specific regulatory logic in peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells and contrast our results to detections from enhancer 
databases, cis-eQTL studies, ChIP-seq experiments, and TF knockdown/knockout 
studies. We then apply TRIPOD to mouse embryonic brain data and identify 
regulatory relationships, validated by ChIP-seq and PLAC-seq. Finally, we 
demonstrate TRIPOD on the SHARE-seq data of differentiating mouse hair follicle 
cells and identify lineage-specific regulation supported by histone marks and 
super-enhancer annotations. A record of this paper's transparent peer review 
process is included in the supplemental information.

The inability to scalably and precisely measure the activity of developmental 
cis-regulatory elements (CREs) in multicellular systems is a bottleneck in 
genomics. Here we develop a dual RNA cassette that decouples the detection and 
quantification tasks inherent to multiplex single-cell reporter assays. The 
resulting measurement of reporter expression is accurate over multiple orders of 
magnitude, with a precision approaching the limit set by Poisson counting noise. 
Together with RNA barcode stabilization via circularization, these scalable 
single-cell quantitative expression reporters provide high-contrast readouts, 
analogous to classic in situ assays but entirely from sequencing. Screening >200 
regions of accessible chromatin in a multicellular in vitro model of early 
mammalian development, we identify 13 (8 previously uncharacterized) autonomous 
and cell-type-specific developmental CREs. We further demonstrate that chimeric 
CRE pairs generate cognate two-cell-type activity profiles and assess gain- and 
loss-of-function multicellular expression phenotypes from CRE variants with 
perturbed transcription factor binding sites. Single-cell quantitative 
expression reporters can be applied in developmental and multicellular systems 
to quantitatively characterize native, perturbed and synthetic CREs at scale, 
with high sensitivity and at single-cell resolution.

Single-cell RNA sequencing has enabled to capture the gene activities at 
single-cell resolution, thus allowing reconstruction of cell-type-specific gene 
regulatory networks (GRNs). The available algorithms for reconstructing GRNs are 
commonly designed for bulk RNA-seq data, and few of them are applicable to 
analyze scRNA-seq data by dealing with the dropout events and cellular 
heterogeneity. In this paper, we represent the joint gene expression 
distribution of a gene pair as an image and propose a novel supervised deep 
neural network called DeepDRIM which utilizes the image of the target TF-gene 
pair and the ones of the potential neighbors to reconstruct GRN from scRNA-seq 
data. Due to the consideration of TF-gene pair's neighborhood context, DeepDRIM 
can effectively eliminate the false positives caused by transitive gene-gene 
interactions. We compared DeepDRIM with nine GRN reconstruction algorithms 
designed for either bulk or single-cell RNA-seq data. It achieves evidently 
better performance for the scRNA-seq data collected from eight cell lines. The 
simulated data show that DeepDRIM is robust to the dropout rate, the cell number 
and the size of the training data. We further applied DeepDRIM to the scRNA-seq 
gene expression of B cells from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of the patients 
with mild and severe coronavirus disease 2019. We focused on the 
cell-type-specific GRN alteration and observed targets of TFs that were 
differentially expressed between the two statuses to be enriched in lysosome, 
apoptosis, response to decreased oxygen level and microtubule, which had been 
proved to be associated with coronavirus infection.

BACKGROUND: Analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data has 
revolutionized our understanding of cellular heterogeneity, yet current 
approaches face challenges in efficiency, interpretability, and connecting 
molecular insights to therapeutic applications. Despite advances in deep 
learning methods, identifying cell-type-specific functional gene sets remains 
difficult.
RESULTS: In this study, we present scKAN, an interpretable framework for 
scRNA-seq analysis with two primary goals: accurate cell-type annotation and the 
discovery of cell-type-specific marker genes and gene sets. The key innovation 
is using the learnable activation curves of the Kolmogorov-Arnold network to 
model gene-to-cell relationships. This approach provides a more direct way to 
visualize and interpret these specific interactions compared to the aggregated 
weighting schemes typical of attention mechanisms. This architecture achieves 
superior performance in cell-type annotation, with a 6.63% improvement in macro 
F1 score over state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, it enables the systematic 
identification of functionally coherent cell-type-specific gene sets. We 
demonstrate the framework's translational potential through a case study on 
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, where gene signatures identified by scKAN led 
to a potential drug repurposing candidate, whose binding stability was supported 
by molecular dynamics simulations.
CONCLUSIONS: Our work establishes scKAN as an efficient and interpretable 
framework that effectively bridges single-cell analysis with drug discovery. By 
combining lightweight architecture with the ability to uncover nuanced 
biological patterns, our approach offers an interpretable method for translating 
large-scale single-cell data into actionable therapeutic strategies. This 
approach provides a robust foundation for accelerating the identification of 
cell-type-specific targets in complex diseases.

Recent advances in single-cell transposase-accessible chromatin using a 
sequencing assay (scATAC-seq) allow cellular heterogeneity dissection and 
regulatory landscape reconstruction with an unprecedented resolution. However, 
compared to bulk-sequencing, its ultra-high missingness remarkably reduces 
usable reads in each cell type, resulting in broader, fuzzier peak boundary 
definitions and limiting our ability to pinpoint functional regions and 
interpret variant impacts precisely. We propose a weakly supervised learning 
method, scEpiLock, to directly identify core functional regions from coarse peak 
labels and quantify variant impacts in a cell-type-specific manner. First, 
scEpiLock uses a multi-label classifier to predict chromatin accessibility via a 
deep convolutional neural network. Then, its weakly supervised object detection 
module further refines the peak boundary definition using gradient-weighted 
class activation mapping (Grad-CAM). Finally, scEpiLock provides 
cell-type-specific variant impacts within a given peak region. We applied 
scEpiLock to various scATAC-seq datasets and found that it achieves an area 
under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of ~0.9 and an area under 
precision recall (AUPR) above 0.7. Besides, scEpiLock's object detection 
condenses coarse peaks to only ⅓ of their original size while still reporting 
higher conservation scores. In addition, we applied scEpiLock on brain 
scATAC-seq data and reported several genome-wide association studies (GWAS) 
variants disrupting regulatory elements around known risk genes for Alzheimer's 
disease, demonstrating its potential to provide cell-type-specific biological 
insights in disease studies.

In plants, the biosynthetic pathways of some specialized metabolites are 
partitioned into specialized or rare cell types, as exemplified by the 
monoterpenoid indole alkaloid (MIA) pathway of Catharanthus roseus (Madagascar 
Periwinkle), the source of the anticancer compounds vinblastine and vincristine. 
In the leaf, the C. roseus MIA biosynthetic pathway is partitioned into three 
cell types with the final known steps of the pathway expressed in the rare cell 
type termed idioblast. How cell-type specificity of MIA biosynthesis is achieved 
is poorly understood. We generated single-cell multi-omics data from C. roseus 
leaves. Integrating gene expression and chromatin accessibility profiles across 
single cells, as well as transcription factor (TF)-binding site profiles, we 
constructed a cell-type-aware gene regulatory network for MIA biosynthesis. We 
showcased cell-type-specific TFs as well as cell-type-specific cis-regulatory 
elements. Using motif enrichment analysis, co-expression across cell types, and 
functional validation approaches, we discovered a novel idioblast-specific TF 
(Idioblast MYB1, CrIDM1) that activates expression of late-stage MIA 
biosynthetic genes in the idioblast. These analyses not only led to the 
discovery of the first documented cell-type-specific TF that regulates the 
expression of two idioblast-specific biosynthetic genes within an idioblast 
metabolic regulon but also provides insights into cell-type-specific metabolic 
regulation.

Germination involves highly dynamic transcriptional programs as the cells of 
seeds reactivate and express the functions necessary for establishment in the 
environment. Individual cell types have distinct roles within the embryo, so 
must therefore have cell type-specific gene expression and gene regulatory 
networks. We can better understand how the functions of different cell types are 
established and contribute to the embryo by determining how cell type-specific 
transcription begins and changes through germination. Here we describe a 
temporal analysis of the germinating Arabidopsis thaliana embryo at single-cell 
resolution. We define the highly dynamic cell type-specific patterns of gene 
expression and how these relate to changing cellular function as germination 
progresses. Underlying these are unique gene regulatory networks and 
transcription factor activity. We unexpectedly discover that most embryo cells 
transition through the same initial transcriptional state early in germination, 
even though cell identity has already been established during embryogenesis. 
Cells later transition to cell type-specific gene expression patterns. 
Furthermore, our analyses support previous findings that the earliest events 
leading to the induction of seed germination take place in the vasculature. 
Overall, our study constitutes a general framework with which to characterize 
Arabidopsis cell transcriptional states through seed germination, allowing 
investigation of different genotypes and other plant species whose seed 
strategies may differ.

Cell type-specific enhancers are critically important for lineage specification. 
The mechanisms that determine cell-type specificity of enhancer activity, 
however, are not fully understood. Most current models for how enhancers 
function invoke physical proximity between enhancer elements and their target 
genes. Here, we use an imaging-based approach to examine the spatial 
relationship of cell type-specific enhancers and their target genes with 
single-cell resolution. Using high-throughput microscopy, we measure the spatial 
distance from target promoters to their cell type-specific active and inactive 
enhancers in individual pancreatic cells derived from distinct lineages. We find 
increased proximity of all promoter-enhancer pairs relative to non-enhancer 
pairs separated by similar genomic distances. Strikingly, spatial proximity 
between enhancers and target genes was unrelated to tissue-specific enhancer 
activity. Furthermore, promoter-enhancer proximity did not correlate with the 
expression status of target genes. Our results suggest that promoter-enhancer 
pairs exist in a distinctive chromatin environment but that genome folding is 
not a universal driver of cell-type specificity in enhancer function.

Transcriptional enhancers drive cell-type-specific gene expression patterns, and 
thus play key roles in development and disease. Large-scale consortia have 
extensively cataloged >one million putative enhancers encoded in the human 
genome. But few enhancers have been endogenously tested for function. For almost 
all enhancers, it remains unknown what genes they target and how much they 
contribute to target gene expression. We have previously developed a method 
called Mosaic-seq, which enables the high-throughput interrogation of enhancer 
activity by performing pooled CRISPRi-based epigenetic suppression of enhancers 
with a single-cell transcriptomic readout. Here, we describe an optimized 
version of this method, Mosaic-seq2. We have made several key improvements that 
have significantly simplified the library preparation process and increased the 
overall sensitivity and throughput of the method.

Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) reveal the complex molecular interactions that 
govern cell state. However, it is challenging for identifying causal relations 
among genes due to noisy data and molecular nonlinearity. Here, we propose a 
novel causal criterion, neighbor cross-mapping entropy (NME), for inferring GRNs 
from both steady data and time-series data. NME is designed to quantify 
'continuous causality' or functional dependency from one variable to another 
based on their function continuity with varying neighbor sizes. NME shows 
superior performance on benchmark datasets, comparing with existing methods. By 
applying to scRNA-seq datasets, NME not only reliably inferred GRNs for cell 
types but also identified cell states. Based on the inferred GRNs and further 
their activity matrices, NME showed better performance in single-cell clustering 
and downstream analyses. In summary, based on continuous causality, NME provides 
a powerful tool in inferring causal regulations of GRNs between genes from 
scRNA-seq data, which is further exploited to identify novel cell types/states 
and predict cell type-specific network modules.

Spatiotemporal gene expression patterns are governed to a large extent by the 
activity of enhancer elements, which engage in physical contacts with their 
target genes. Identification of enhancer-promoter (EP) links that are functional 
only in a specific subset of cell types is a key challenge in understanding gene 
regulation. We introduce CT-FOCS (cell type FOCS), a statistical inference 
method that uses linear mixed effect models to infer EP links that show marked 
activity only in a single or a small subset of cell types out of a large panel 
of probed cell types. Analyzing 808 samples from FANTOM5, covering 472 cell 
lines, primary cells and tissues, CT-FOCS inferred such EP links more accurately 
than recent state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we show that strictly cell 
type-specific EP links are very uncommon in the human genome.

Mineral nutrient uptake and deposition profoundly influence plant development, 
stress resilience, and productivity. Silicon (Si), though classified as a 
non-essential element, significantly influences a plant's physiology, 
particularly in fortifying defense responses and mitigating stress. While the 
genetic and molecular mechanisms of Si uptake and transport are well studied in 
monocots, particularly rice, their role in dicot species, such as soybean, 
remains unclear at the cellular and molecular levels. In this study, we utilized 
single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to dissect cellular responses to Si 
accumulation in soybean leaves. We identified distinct cellular populations, 
including a unique Si-induced or Si-associated cell cluster within vascular 
cells, suggesting a specialized mechanism of Si distribution. Si treatment 
notably induced the expression of defense-related genes, with a pronounced 
enrichment in vascular cells, underscoring their pivotal role in activating 
plant defense mechanisms. Moreover, Si modulated the expression of genes 
involved in phytoalexin biosynthesis, salicylic acid, and immune receptor 
signaling, suggesting transcriptional priming of genes involved in defense 
responses. Further investigation of Si transporters revealed precise expression 
of an Si efflux gene in epidermal cells in response to Si treatment. We also 
validated the role of efflux Si transporters using a Xenopus oocyte assay and 
CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing of composite soybean plant roots. This study provides 
critical insights into the biotic stress regulatory networks influenced by Si 
treatment in soybean leaves at the single-cell level, thus laying the foundation 
for enhancing stress tolerance through optimized mineral nutrient uptake.

A plethora of studies have demonstrated the roles of lncRNAs in modulating 
disease severity and outcomes during infection. However, the spatio-temporal 
expression of these lncRNAs is poorly understood. In this study, we used 
single-cell RNA-seq to understand the spatio-temporal expression dynamics of 
lncRNAs across healthy, SARS-CoV-2-infected, and recovered individuals and their 
functional role in modulating the disease and recovery. We identified 203 
differentially expressed lncRNAs, including cell type-specific ones like MALAT1, 
NEAT1, ZFAS1, SNHG7, SNHG8, and SNHG25 modulating immune function in classical 
monocyte, NK T, proliferating NK, plasmablast, naive, and activated B/T cells. 
Interestingly, we found invariant lncRNAs (no significant change in expression 
across conditions) regulating essential housekeeping functions (for example, 
HOTAIR, NRAV, SNHG27, SNHG28, and UCA1) in infected and recovered individuals. 
Despite similar repeat element abundance, variant lncRNAs displayed higher Alu 
content, suggesting increased interactions with proximal and distal genes, 
crucial for immune response modulation. The comparable repeat abundance but 
distinct expression levels of variant and invariant lncRNAs highlight the 
significance of investigating the regulatory mechanisms of invariant lncRNAs. 
Overall, this study offers new insights into the spatio-temporal expression 
patterns and functional roles of lncRNAs in SARS-CoV-2-infected and recovered 
individuals while highlighting the importance of invariant lncRNAs in the 
disease context.

BACKGROUND: Regulated cell death (RCD), a genetically controlled process 
mediated by specialized molecular pathways (commonly termed programmed cell 
death), plays pivotal roles in diverse pathophysiological processes. However, 
the landscape and functional implications of RCD subtypes in chronic 
rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) remain poorly characterized. This 
study aimed to systematically investigate the involvement of RCD mechanisms in 
the pathogenesis and progression of CRSwNP.
METHODS: Transcriptomic datasets (GSE136825, GSE23552, GSE198950, GSE196169, 
GSE156285) related to CRSwNP were retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus 
(GEO) database. A comprehensive panel of 18 RCD-associated gene sets was 
compiled through a systematic literature review. Gene set variation analysis 
(GSVA) was employed to profile RCD activation patterns in CRSwNP. Integrative 
bioinformatics approaches including weighted gene co-expression network analysis 
(WGCNA) and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression 
were implemented to identify hub RCD-related genes and construct a cell death 
index (CDI). Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data were analyzed to map 
RCD dynamics across cellular subpopulations. Clinical validation was performed 
using qRT-PCR quantification of key genes in nasal polyp/inferior turbinate 
tissues, with the concurrent assessment of symptom severity via visual analogue 
scale (VAS) scores.
RESULTS: GSVA revealed significant upregulation of 8 RCD subtypes in CRSwNP: 
apoptosis, ferroptosis, necroptosis, entotic cell death, lysosome-dependent cell 
death, NETosis, immunogenic cell death, and anoikis. Pathway enrichment analysis 
demonstrated that RCD-related differentially expressed genes were predominantly 
involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and immune-inflammatory 
regulation. Furthermore, the WGCNA algorithm and LASSO analysis identified 8 key 
cell death genes (PTHLH, GRINA, S100A9, SCG2, HMOX1, RNF183, TYROBP, SEMA7A), 
which were utilized to construct the cell death-related index (CDI). In training 
and validation cohorts, the CDI was significantly elevated in CRSwNP compared to 
control and exhibited high diagnostic performance, with elevated scores 
correlating with enhanced immune cell infiltration. Single-cell resolution 
analysis uncovered cell type-specific RCD activation patterns. Clinical 
validation confirmed significantly higher expression of S100A9, PTHLH, and HMOX1 
in eosinophilic versus non-eosinophilic polyps. Notably, expression levels of 
PTHLH, S100A9, HMOX1, GRINA, and TYROBP showed strong positive correlations with 
VAS scores.
CONCLUSIONS: Our investigation delineates an RCD activation signature in CRSwNP 
pathogenesis, characterized by 8 key cell death modalities and their regulatory 
genes. The novel CDI exhibits promising diagnostic potential, while mechanistic 
insights suggest RCD pathways may drive disease progression through EMT 
potentiation and inflammatory cascade amplification. These findings provide a 
framework for developing RCD-targeted therapeutic strategies in CRSwNP.

The dysregulation of gene expression programs in the human atria during 
persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) is not completely understood. Here, we 
reanalyze bulk RNA-sequencing datasets from two studies (N = 242) and identified 
755 differentially expressed genes in left atrial appendages of individuals with 
persistent AF and non-AF controls. We combined the bulk RNA-sequencing 
differentially expressed genes with a left atrial appendage single-nucleus 
multi-omics dataset to assign genes to specific atrial cell types. We found 
noncoding genes at the IFNG locus (LINC01479, IFNG-AS1) strongly dysregulated in 
cardiomyocytes. We defined a gene expression signature potentially driven by 
androgen receptor signaling in cardiomyocytes from individuals with AF. 
Cell-type-specific gene expression modules suggested an increase in T cell and a 
decrease in adipocyte and neuronal cell gene expression in AF. Lastly, we showed 
that reducing NR4A1 expression, a marker of a poorly characterized human atrial 
fibroblast subtype, fibroblast activation markers, extracellular matrix 
remodeling and cell proliferation decreased.

immunity development-can lead to malignancy, making it crucial to understand its 
regulatory mechanisms. We generated a multiomics resource comprising paired 
chromatin accessibility and gene expression profiles across eight human B cell 
precursor populations, providing a detailed characterization of early human B 
cell development. Integrative analysis revealed highly cell type-specific 
regulatory elements and enabled the reconstruction of the gene regulatory 
network governing differentiation. We identified putative candidate regulons, 
such as ELK3, enriched in pro-B cells and potentially involved in cell cycle 
progression. Regulons from bulk data were projected onto single-cell data, 
validating their activity and refining the regulatory landscape. This resource 
enabled identification of active regulatory programs and 
transformation-associated states in B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The 
publicly available atlas provides a valuable resource for understanding B cell 
development and disease, supporting future efforts to decode regulatory programs 
in immunity and hematologic malignancies.

Single-cell ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq) has proven to be a state-of-art approach to 
investigating gene regulation at the single-cell level. However, existing 
methods cannot precisely uncover cell-type-specific binding of transcription 
regulators (TRs) and construct gene regulation networks (GRNs) in single-cell. 
ChIP-seq has been widely used to profile TR binding sites in the past decades. 
Here, we developed SCRIP, an integrative method to infer single-cell TR activity 
and targets based on the integration of scATAC-seq and a large-scale TR ChIP-seq 
reference. Our method showed improved performance in evaluating TR binding 
activity compared to the existing motif-based methods and reached a higher 
consistency with matched TR expressions. Besides, our method enables identifying 
TR target genes as well as building GRNs at the single-cell resolution based on 
a regulatory potential model. We demonstrate SCRIP's utility in accurate 
cell-type clustering, lineage tracing, and inferring cell-type-specific GRNs in 
multiple biological systems. SCRIP is freely available at

Plant development and survival is centered on complex regulatory networks 
composed of genes, proteins, hormone pathways, metabolites and signaling 
pathways. The recent advancements in whole genome biology have furthered our 
understanding of the interactions between these networks. As a result, numerous 
cell type-specific transcriptome profiles have been generated that have 
elucidated complex gene regulatory networks occurring at the cellular level, 
many of which were masked during whole-organ analysis. Modern technologies have 
also allowed researchers to generate multiple whole-organ metabolite profiles; 
however, only a limited number have been generated at the level of individual 
cells. Recent advancements in the isolation of individual cell populations have 
made cell type-specific metabolite profiles possible, enabling the enhanced 
detection and quantification of metabolites that were formerly unavailable when 
considering the whole organ. The comparison of metabolite and transcriptome 
profiles from the same cells has been a valuable resource to generate 
predictions regarding specific metabolite activity and function. In this review, 
we focus on recent studies that demonstrate the value of cell type-specific 
transcriptional profiles and their comparison with profiles generated from whole 
organs. Advancements in the isolation of single-cell populations will be 
highlighted, and the potential application towards generating detailed metabolic 
profiles will be discussed.
