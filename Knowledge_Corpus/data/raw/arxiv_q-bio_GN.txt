Abstract:
Machine- and deep-learning approaches for biological sequences depend critically on transforming raw DNA, RNA, and protein FASTA files into informative numerical representations. However, this process is often fragmented across multiple libraries and preprocessing steps, which creates a barrier for researchers without extensive computational expertise. To address this gap, we developed deepFEPS, an open-source toolkit that unifies state-of-the-art feature extraction methods for sequence data within a single, reproducible workflow. deepFEPS integrates five families of modern feature extractors - k-mer embeddings (Word2Vec, FastText), document-level embeddings (Doc2Vec), transformer-based encoders (DNABERT, ProtBERT, and ESM2), autoencoder-derived latent features, and graph-based embeddings - into one consistent platform. The system accepts FASTA input via a web interface or command-line tool, exposes key model parameters, and outputs analysis-ready feature matrices (CSV). Each run is accompanied by an automatic quality-control report including sequence counts, dimensionality, sparsity, variance distributions, class balance, and diagnostic visualizations. By consolidating advanced sequence embeddings into one environment, deepFEPS reduces preprocessing overhead, improves reproducibility, and shortens the path from raw sequences to downstream machine- and deep-learning applications. deepFEPS lowers the practical barrier to modern representation learning for bioinformatics, enabling both novice and expert users to generate advanced embeddings for classification, clustering, and predictive modeling. Its unified framework supports exploratory analyses, high-throughput studies, and integration into institutional workflows, while remaining extensible to emerging models and methods.

Title: Moonshine.jl: a Julia package for genome-scale model-based ancestral recombination graph inference

Abstract:
The ancestral recombination graph (ARG) is the model of choice in statistical genetics to model population ancestries. Software capable of simulating ARGs on a genome scale within a reasonable amount of time are now widely available for most practical use cases. While the inverse problem of inferring ancestries from a sample of haplotypes has seen major progress in the last decade, it does not enjoy the same level of advancement as its counterpart. Up until recently, even moderately sized samples could only be handled using heuristics. In recent years, the possibility of model-based inference for datasets closer to "real world" scenarios has become a reality, largely due to the development of threading-based samplers. This article introduces Moonshine.jl, a Julia package that has the ability, among other things, to infer ARGs for samples of thousands of human haplotypes of sizes on the order of hundreds of megabases within a reasonable amount of time. On recent hardware, our package is able to infer an ARG for samples of densely haplotyped (over one marker/kilobase) human chromosomes of sizes up to 10000 in well under a day on data simulated by msprime. Scaling up simulation on a compute cluster is straightforward thanks to a strictly single-threaded implementation. While model-based, it does not resort to threading but rather places restrictions on probability distributions typically used in simulation software in order to enforce sample consistency. In addition to being efficient, a strong emphasis is placed on ease of use and integration into the biostatistical software ecosystem.

Abstract:
Representation learning on multi-omics data is challenging due to extreme dimensionality, modality heterogeneity, and cohort-specific batch effects. While pre-trained transformer backbones have shown broad generalization capabilities in biological sequence modeling, their application to multi-omics integration remains underexplored. We present MoRE (Multi-Omics Representation Embedding), a framework that repurposes frozen pre-trained transformers to align heterogeneous assays into a shared latent space. Unlike purely generative approaches, MoRE employs a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategy, prioritizing cross-sample and cross-modality alignment over simple sequence reconstruction. Specifically, MoRE attaches lightweight, modality-specific adapters and a task-adaptive fusion layer to the frozen backbone. It optimizes a masked modeling objective jointly with supervised contrastive and batch-invariant alignment losses, yielding structure-preserving embeddings that generalize across unseen cell types and platforms. We benchmark MoRE against established baselines, including scGPT, scVI, and Harmony with Scrublet, evaluating integration fidelity, rare population detection, and modality transfer. Our results demonstrate that MoRE achieves competitive batch robustness and biological conservation while significantly reducing trainable parameters compared to fully fine-tuned models. This work positions MoRE as a practical step toward general-purpose omics foundation models.

Abstract:
Motivation: Modern genomics laboratories generate massive volumes of sequencing data, often resulting in significant storage costs. Genomics storage consists of duplicate files, temporary processing files, and redundant intermediate data. Results: We developed SeqManager, a web-based application that provides automated identification, classification, and management of sequencing data files with intelligent duplicate detection. It also detects intermediate sequencing files that can safely be removed. Evaluation across four genomics laboratory settings demonstrate that our tool is fast and has a very low memory footprint.

Abstract:
Multi-assembly methods rely at their core on a flow decomposition problem, namely, decomposing a weighted graph into weighted paths or walks. However, most results over the past decade have focused on decompositions over directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). This limitation has lead to either purely heuristic methods, or in applications transforming a graph with cycles into a DAG via preprocessing heuristics. In this paper we show that flow decomposition problems can be solved in practice also on general graphs with cycles, via a framework that yields fast and flexible Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulations.   Our key technique relies on the graph-theoretic notion of dominator tree, which we use to find all safe sequences of edges, that are guaranteed to appear in some walk of any flow decomposition solution. We generalize previous results from DAGs to cyclic graphs, by showing that maximal safe sequences correspond to extensions of common leaves of two dominator trees, and that we can find all of them in time linear in their size. Using these, we can accelerate MILPs for any flow decomposition into walks in general graphs, by setting to (at least) 1 suitable variables encoding solution walks, and by setting to 0 other walks variables non-reachable to and from safe sequences. This reduces model size and eliminates costly linearizations of MILP variable products.   We experiment with three decomposition models (Minimum Flow Decomposition, Least Absolute Errors and Minimum Path Error), on four bacterial datasets. Our pre-processing enables up to thousand-fold speedups and solves even under 30 seconds many instances otherwise timing out. We thus hope that our dominator-based MILP simplification framework, and the accompanying software library can become building blocks in multi-assembly applications.

Abstract:
Modern genomic analyses increasingly rely on pangenomes, that is, representations of the genome of entire populations. The simplest representation of a pangenome is a set of individual genome sequences. Compared to e.g. sequence graphs, this has the advantage that efficient exact search via indexes based on the Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) is possible, that no chimeric sequences are created, and that the results are not influenced by heuristics. However, such an index may report a match in thousands of positions even if these all correspond to the same locus, making downstream analysis unnecessarily expensive. For sufficiently similar sequences (e.g. human chromosomes), a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) can be computed. Since an MSA tends to group similar strings in the same columns, it is likely that a string occurring thousands of times in the pangenome can be described by very few columns in the MSA. We describe a method to tag entries in the BWT with the corresponding column in the MSA and develop an index that can map matches in the BWT to columns in the MSA in time proportional to the output. As a by-product, we can efficiently project a match to a designated reference genome, a capability that current pangenome aligners based on the BWT lack.

Abstract:
Spatial transcriptomics (ST) is a novel technology that enables the observation of gene expression at the resolution of individual spots within pathological tissues. ST quantifies the expression of tens of thousands of genes in a tissue section; however, heavy observational noise is often introduced during measurement. In prior studies, to ensure meaningful assessment, both training and evaluation have been restricted to only a small subset of highly variable genes, and genes outside this subset have also been excluded from the training process. However, since there are likely co-expression relationships between genes, low-expression genes may still contribute to the estimation of the evaluation target. In this paper, we propose $Auxiliary \ Gene \ Learning$ (AGL) that utilizes the benefit of the ignored genes by reformulating their expression estimation as auxiliary tasks and training them jointly with the primary tasks. To effectively leverage auxiliary genes, we must select a subset of auxiliary genes that positively influence the prediction of the target genes. However, this is a challenging optimization problem due to the vast number of possible combinations. To overcome this challenge, we propose Prior-Knowledge-Based Differentiable Top-$k$ Gene Selection via Bi-level Optimization (DkGSB), a method that ranks genes by leveraging prior knowledge and relaxes the combinatorial selection problem into a differentiable top-$k$ selection problem. The experiments confirm the effectiveness of incorporating auxiliary genes and show that the proposed method outperforms conventional auxiliary task learning approaches.

Abstract:
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables transcriptomic profiling at cellular resolution but suffers from pervasive dropout events that obscure biological signals. We present SCR-MF, a modular two-stage workflow that combines principled dropout detection using scRecover with robust non-parametric imputation via missForest. Across public and simulated datasets, SCR-MF achieves robust and interpretable performance comparable to or exceeding existing imputation methods in most cases, while preserving biological fidelity and transparency. Runtime analysis demonstrates that SCR-MF provides a competitive balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, making it suitable for mid-scale single-cell datasets.

Abstract:
Large-scale genomic workflows used in precision medicine can process datasets spanning tens to hundreds of gigabytes per sample, leading to high memory spikes, intensive disk I/O, and task failures due to out-of-memory errors. Simple static resource allocation methods struggle to handle the variability in per-chromosome RAM demands, resulting in poor resource utilization and long runtimes. In this work, we propose multiple mechanisms for adaptive, RAM-efficient parallelization of chromosome-level bioinformatics workflows. First, we develop a symbolic regression model that estimates per-chromosome memory consumption for a given task and introduces an interpolating bias to conservatively minimize over-allocation. Second, we present a dynamic scheduler that adaptively predicts RAM usage with a polynomial regression model, treating task packing as a Knapsack problem to optimally batch jobs based on predicted memory requirements. Additionally, we present a static scheduler that optimizes chromosome processing order to minimize peak memory while preserving throughput. Our proposed methods, evaluated on simulations and real-world genomic pipelines, provide new mechanisms to reduce memory overruns and balance load across threads. We thereby achieve faster end-to-end execution, showcasing the potential to optimize large-scale genomic workflows.

Abstract:
Biological data sets are often high-dimensional, noisy, and governed by complex interactions among sparse signals. This poses major challenges for interpretability and reliable feature selection. Tasks such as identifying motif interactions in genomics exemplify these difficulties, as only a small subset of biologically relevant features (e.g., motifs) are typically active, and their effects are often non-linear and context-dependent. While statistical approaches often result in more interpretable models, deep learning models have proven effective in modeling complex interactions and prediction accuracy, yet their black-box nature limits interpretability. We introduce BaGGLS, a flexible and interpretable probabilistic binary regression model designed for high-dimensional biological inference involving feature interactions. BaGGLS incorporates a Bayesian group global-local shrinkage prior, aligned with the group structure introduced by interaction terms. This prior encourages sparsity while retaining interpretability, helping to isolate meaningful signals and suppress noise. To enable scalable inference, we employ a partially factorized variational approximation that captures posterior skewness and supports efficient learning even in large feature spaces. In extensive simulations, we can show that BaGGLS outperforms the other methods with regard to interaction detection and is many times faster than MCMC sampling under the horseshoe prior. We also demonstrate the usefulness of BaGGLS in the context of interaction discovery from motif scanner outputs and noisy attribution scores from deep learning models. This shows that BaGGLS is a promising approach for uncovering biologically relevant interaction patterns, with potential applicability across a range of high-dimensional tasks in computational biology.

Abstract:
Spatial Transcriptomics enables mapping of gene expression within its native tissue context, but current platforms measure only a limited set of genes due to experimental constraints and excessive costs. To overcome this, computational models integrate Single-Cell RNA Sequencing data with Spatial Transcriptomics to predict unmeasured genes. We propose CASPER, a cross-attention based framework that predicts unmeasured gene expression in Spatial Transcriptomics by leveraging centroid-level representations from Single-Cell RNA Sequencing. We performed rigorous testing over four state-of-the-art Spatial Transcriptomics/Single-Cell RNA Sequencing dataset pairs across four existing baseline models. CASPER shows significant improvement in nine out of the twelve metrics for our experiments. This work paves the way for further work in Spatial Transcriptomics to Single-Cell RNA Sequencing modality translation. The code for CASPER is available at https://github.com/AI4Med-Lab/CASPER.

Abstract:
Precise prognostic stratification of colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a major clinical challenge due to its high heterogeneity. The conventional TNM staging system is inadequate for personalized medicine. We aimed to develop and validate a novel multiple instance learning model TDAM-CRC using histopathological whole-slide images for accurate prognostic prediction and to uncover its underlying molecular mechanisms. We trained the model on the TCGA discovery cohort (n=581), validated it in an independent external cohort (n=1031), and further we integrated multi-omics data to improve model interpretability and identify novel prognostic biomarkers. The results demonstrated that the TDAM-CRC achieved robust risk stratification in both cohorts. Its predictive performance significantly outperformed the conventional clinical staging system and multiple state-of-the-art models. The TDAM-CRC risk score was confirmed as an independent prognostic factor in multivariable analysis. Multi-omics analysis revealed that the high-risk subtype is closely associated with metabolic reprogramming and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Through interaction network analysis, we identified and validated Mitochondrial Ribosomal Protein L37 (MRPL37) as a key hub gene linking deep pathomic features to clinical prognosis. We found that high expression of MRPL37, driven by promoter hypomethylation, serves as an independent biomarker of favorable prognosis. Finally, we constructed a nomogram incorporating the TDAM-CRC risk score and clinical factors to provide a precise and interpretable clinical decision-making tool for CRC patients. Our AI-driven pathological model TDAM-CRC provides a robust tool for improved CRC risk stratification, reveals new molecular targets, and facilitates personalized clinical decision-making.

Abstract:
Trained on massive cross-species DNA corpora, DNA large language models (LLMs) learn the fundamental "grammar" and evolutionary patterns of genomic sequences. This makes them powerful priors for DNA sequence modeling, particularly over long ranges. However, two major constraints hinder their use in practice: the quadratic computational cost of self-attention and the growing memory required for key-value (KV) caches during autoregressive decoding. These constraints force the use of heuristics such as fixed-window truncation or sliding windows, which compromise fidelity on ultra-long sequences by discarding distant information. We introduce FOCUS (Feature-Oriented Compression for Ultra-long Self-attention), a progressive context-compression module that can be plugged into pretrained DNA LLMs. FOCUS combines the established k-mer representation in genomics with learnable hierarchical compression: it inserts summary tokens at k-mer granularity and progressively compresses attention key and value activations across multiple Transformer layers, retaining only the summary KV states across windows while discarding ordinary-token KV. A shared-boundary windowing scheme yields a stationary cross-window interface that propagates long-range information with minimal loss. We validate FOCUS on an Evo-2-based DNA LLM fine-tuned on GRCh38 chromosome 1 with self-supervised training and randomized compression schedules to promote robustness across compression ratios. On held-out human chromosomes, FOCUS achieves near-lossless fidelity: compressing a 1 kb context into only 10 summary tokens (about 100x) shifts the average per-nucleotide probability by only about 0.0004. Compared to a baseline without compression, FOCUS reduces KV-cache memory and converts effective inference scaling from O(N^2) to near-linear O(N), enabling about 100x longer inference windows on commodity GPUs with near-lossless fidelity.

Abstract:
Modeling genomic sequences faces two unsolved challenges: the information density varies widely across different regions, while there is no clearly defined minimum vocabulary unit. Relying on either four primitive bases or independently designed DNA tokenizers, existing approaches with naive masked language modeling pre-training often fail to adapt to the varying complexities of genomic sequences. Leveraging Token Merging techniques, this paper introduces a hierarchical architecture that jointly optimizes a dynamic genomic tokenizer and latent Transformers with context-aware pre-training tasks. As for network structures, the tokenization module automatically chunks adjacent bases into words by stacking multiple layers of the differentiable token merging blocks with local-window constraints, then a Latent Encoder captures the global context of these merged words by full-attention blocks. Symmetrically employing a Latent Decoder and a Local Decoder, MergeDNA learns with two pre-training tasks: Merged Token Reconstruction simultaneously trains the dynamic tokenization module and adaptively filters important tokens, while Adaptive Masked Token Modeling learns to predict these filtered tokens to capture informative contents. Extensive experiments show that MergeDNA achieves superior performance on three popular DNA benchmarks and several multi-omics tasks with fine-tuning or zero-shot evaluation, outperforming typical tokenization methods and large-scale DNA foundation models.

Abstract:
Unsupervised learning on high-dimensional RNA-seq data can reveal molecular subtypes beyond standard labels. We combine an autoencoder-based representation with clustering and stability analysis to search for rare but reproducible genomic subtypes. On the UCI "Gene Expression Cancer RNA-Seq" dataset (801 samples, 20,531 genes; BRCA, COAD, KIRC, LUAD, PRAD), a pan-cancer analysis shows clusters aligning almost perfectly with tissue of origin (Cramer's V = 0.887), serving as a negative control. We therefore reframe the problem within KIRC (n = 146): we select the top 2,000 highly variable genes, standardize them, train a feed-forward autoencoder (128-dimensional latent space), and run k-means for k = 2-10. While global indices favor small k, scanning k with a pre-specified discovery rule (rare < 10 percent and stable with Jaccard >= 0.60 across 20 seeds after Hungarian alignment) yields a simple solution at k = 5 (silhouette = 0.129, DBI = 2.045) with a rare cluster C0 (6.85 percent of patients) that is highly stable (Jaccard = 0.787). Cluster-vs-rest differential expression (Welch's t-test, Benjamini-Hochberg FDR) identifies coherent markers. Overall, pan-cancer clustering is dominated by tissue of origin, whereas a stability-aware within-cancer approach reveals a rare, reproducible KIRC subtype.

Abstract:
In-context learning (ICL) -- the capacity of a model to infer and apply abstract patterns from examples provided within its input -- has been extensively studied in large language models trained for next-token prediction on human text. In fact, prior work often attributes this emergent behavior to distinctive statistical properties in human language. This raises a fundamental question: can ICL arise organically in other sequence domains purely through large-scale predictive training?   To explore this, we turn to genomic sequences, an alternative symbolic domain rich in statistical structure. Specifically, we study the Evo2 genomic model, trained predominantly on next-nucleotide (A/T/C/G) prediction, at a scale comparable to mid-sized LLMs. We develop a controlled experimental framework comprising symbolic reasoning tasks instantiated in both linguistic and genomic forms, enabling direct comparison of ICL across genomic and linguistic models. Our results show that genomic models, like their linguistic counterparts, exhibit log-linear gains in pattern induction as the number of in-context demonstrations increases. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first evidence of organically emergent ICL in genomic sequences, supporting the hypothesis that ICL arises as a consequence of large-scale predictive modeling over rich data. These findings extend emergent meta-learning beyond language, pointing toward a unified, modality-agnostic view of in-context learning.

Abstract:
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), especially temporally resolved datasets, enables genome-wide profiling of gene expression dynamics at single-cell resolution across discrete time points. However, current technologies provide only sparse, static snapshots of cell states and are inherently influenced by technical noise, complicating the inference and representation of continuous transcriptional dynamics. Although embedding methods can reduce dimensionality and mitigate technical noise, the majority of existing approaches typically treat trajectory inference separately from embedding construction, often neglecting temporal structure. To address this challenge, here we introduce CellStream, a novel deep learning framework that jointly learns embedding and cellular dynamics from single-cell snapshot data by integrating an autoencoder with unbalanced dynamical optimal transport. Compared to existing methods, CellStream generates dynamics-informed embeddings that robustly capture temporal developmental processes while maintaining high consistency with the underlying data manifold. We demonstrate CellStream's effectiveness on both simulated datasets and real scRNA-seq data, including spatial transcriptomics. Our experiments indicate significant quantitative improvements over state-of-the-art methods in representing cellular trajectories with enhanced temporal coherence and reduced noise sensitivity. Overall, CellStream provides a new tool for learning and representing continuous streams from the noisy, static snapshots of single-cell gene expression.

Abstract:
Efficient and consistent string processing is critical in the exponentially growing genomic data era. Locally Consistent Parsing (LCP) addresses this need by partitioning an input genome string into short, exactly matching substrings (e.g., "cores"), ensuring consistency across partitions. Labeling the cores of an input string consistently not only provides a compact representation of the input but also enables the reapplication of LCP to refine the cores over multiple iterations, providing a progressively longer and more informative set of substrings for downstream analyses.   We present the first iterative implementation of LCP with Lcptools and demonstrate its effectiveness in identifying cores with minimal collisions. Experimental results show that the number of cores at the i^th iteration is O(n/c^i) for c ~ 2.34, while the average length and the average distance between consecutive cores are O(c^i). Compared to the popular sketching techniques, LCP produces significantly fewer cores, enabling a more compact representation and faster analyses. To demonstrate the advantages of LCP in genomic string processing in terms of computation and memory efficiency, we also introduce LCPan, an efficient variation graph constructor. We show that LCPan generates variation graphs >10x faster than vg, while using >13x less memory.

Abstract:
Classes, as fundamental elements of Computer Vision, have been extensively studied within incremental learning frameworks. In contrast, tokens, which play essential roles in many research fields, exhibit similar characteristics of growth, yet investigations into their incremental learning remain significantly scarce. This research gap primarily stems from the holistic nature of tokens in language, which imposes significant challenges on the design of incremental learning frameworks for them. To overcome this obstacle, in this work, we turn to a type of token, gene, for a large-scale biological dataset--single-cell transcriptomics--to formulate a pipeline for gene incremental learning and establish corresponding evaluations. We found that the forgetting problem also exists in gene incremental learning, thus we adapted existing class incremental learning methods to mitigate the forgetting of genes. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrated the soundness of our framework design and evaluations, as well as the effectiveness of our method adaptations. Finally, we provide a complete benchmark for gene incremental learning in single-cell transcriptomics.

Abstract:
Single-cell data analysis seeks to characterize cellular heterogeneity based on high-dimensional gene expression profiles. Conventional approaches represent each cell as a vector in Euclidean space, which limits their ability to capture intrinsic correlations and multiscale geometric structures. We propose a multiscale framework based on Grassmann manifolds that integrates machine learning with subspace geometry for single-cell data analysis. By generating embeddings under multiple representation scales, the framework combines their features from different geometric views into a unified Grassmann manifold. A power-based scale sampling function is introduced to control the selection of scales and balance in- formation across resolutions. Experiments on nine benchmark single-cell RNA-seq datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively preserves meaningful structures and provides stable clustering performance, particularly for small to medium-sized datasets. These results suggest that Grassmann manifolds offer a coherent and informative foundation for analyzing single cell data.

Abstract:
The identification of disease-gene associations is instrumental in understanding the mechanisms of diseases and developing novel treatments. Besides identifying genes from RNA-Seq datasets, it is often necessary to identify gene clusters that have relationships with a disease. In this work, we propose a graph-based method for using an RNA-Seq dataset with known genes related to a disease and perform a robust clustering analysis to identify clusters of genes. Our method involves the construction of a gene co-expression network, followed by the computation of gene embeddings leveraging Node2Vec+, an algorithm applying weighted biased random walks and skipgram with negative sampling to compute node embeddings from undirected graphs with weighted edges. Finally, we perform spectral clustering to identify clusters of genes. All processes in our entire method are jointly optimized for stability, robustness, and optimality by applying Tree-structured Parzen Estimator. Our method was applied to an RNA-Seq dataset of known genes that have associations with Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD). We also performed tests to validate and verify the robustness and statistical significance of our methods due to the stochastic nature of the involved processes. Our results show that our method is capable of generating consistent and robust clustering results. Our method can be seamlessly applied to other RNA-Seq datasets due to our process of joint optimization, ensuring the stability and optimality of the several steps in our method, including the construction of a gene co-expression network, computation of gene embeddings, and clustering of genes. Our work will aid in the discovery of natural structures in the RNA-Seq data, and understanding gene regulation and gene functions not just for AMD but for any disease in general.

Abstract:
Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has revealed numerous non-coding short variants whose functional impacts remain poorly understood. Despite recent advances in deep-learning genomic approaches, accurately predicting and prioritizing clinically relevant mutations in gene regulatory regions remains a major challenge. Here we introduce Deep VRegulome, a deep-learning method for prediction and interpretation of functionally disruptive variants in the human regulome, which combines 700 DNABERT fine-tuned models, trained on vast amounts of ENCODE gene regulatory regions, with variant scoring, motif analysis, attention-based visualization, and survival analysis. We showcase its application on TCGA glioblastoma WGS dataset in prioritizing survival-associated mutations and regulatory regions. The analysis identified 572 splice-disrupting and 9,837 transcription-factor binding site altering mutations occurring in greater than 10% of glioblastoma samples. Survival analysis linked 1352 mutations and 563 disrupted regulatory regions to patient outcomes, enabling stratification via non-coding mutation signatures. All the code, fine-tuned models, and an interactive data portal are publicly available.

Abstract:
Accurate cell type annotation across datasets is a key challenge in single-cell analysis. snRNA-seq enables profiling of frozen or difficult-to-dissociate tissues, complementing scRNA-seq by capturing fragile or rare cell types. However, cross-annotation between these two datasets remains largely unexplored, as existing methods treat them independently. We introduce ScNucAdapt, the first method designed for cross-annotation between scRNA-seq and snRNA-seq datasets. To address distributional and cell composition differences, ScNucAdapt employs partial domain adaptation. Experiments across diverse samples show that ScNucAdapt achieves robust and accurate cell type annotation, outperforming existing approaches. Therefore, ScNucAdapt provides a practical framework for the cross-domain cell type annotation between scRNA-seq and snRNA-seq data.

Abstract:
Detecting chemical modifications on RNA molecules remains a key challenge in epitranscriptomics. Traditional reverse transcription-based sequencing methods introduce enzyme- and sequence-dependent biases and fragment RNA molecules, confounding the accurate mapping of modifications across the transcriptome. Nanopore direct RNA sequencing offers a powerful alternative by preserving native RNA molecules, enabling the detection of modifications at single-molecule resolution. However, current computational tools can identify only a limited subset of modification types within well-characterized sequence contexts for which ample training data exists. Here, we introduce a model-free computational method that reframes modification detection as an anomaly detection problem, requiring only canonical (unmodified) RNA reads without any other annotated data. For each nanopore read, our approach extracts robust, modification-sensitive features from the raw ionic current signal at a site using the signature transform, then computes an anomaly score by comparing the resulting feature vector to its nearest neighbors in an unmodified reference dataset. We convert anomaly scores into statistical p-values to enable anomaly detection at both individual read and site levels. Validation on densely-modified \textit{E. coli} rRNA demonstrates that our approach detects known sites harboring diverse modification types, without prior training on these modifications. We further applyied this framework to dengue virus (DENV) transcripts and mammalian mRNAs. For DENV sfRNA, it led to revealing a novel 2'-O-methylated site, which we validate orthogonally by qRT-PCR assays. These results demonstrate that our model-free approach operates robustly across different types of RNAs and datasets generated with different nanopore sequencing chemistries.

Abstract:
Biological age, which may be older or younger than chronological age due to factors such as genetic predisposition, environmental exposures, serves as a meaningful biomarker of aging processes and can inform risk stratification, treatment planning, and survivorship care in cancer patients. We propose EpiCAge, a multimodal framework that integrates epigenetic and phenotypic data to improve biological age prediction. Evaluated on eight internal and four external cancer cohorts, EpiCAge consistently outperforms existing epigenetic and phenotypic age clocks. Our analyses show that EpiCAge identifies biologically relevant markers, and its derived age acceleration is significantly associated with mortality risk. These results highlight EpiCAge as a promising multimodal machine learning tool for biological age assessment in oncology.

Comment: 7 pages, 2 figures

Abstract:
Alternative splicing creates complex bubbles in splicing graphs where more than two transcript paths compete, challenging methods designed for simple binary events. We present a unified framework that compares paths using distinct exonic parts observed directly from reads. We build a GrASE splicing graph (DAG) per gene, enumerate bubbles, and quantify shared and distinct exonic parts across three comparison structures. (i) all-pairwise contrasts (ii) a multinomial n-way comparison and (iii) valid bipartitions of paths. For (iii) we introduce lower-set bipartitioning, which respects subset relations among paths by enumerating downward-closed sets in a containment graph, yielding valid two-group splits with nonempty distinguishing parts. Our test statistic is the fraction of reads mapped to distinct parts relative to distinct + shared parts, enabling differential usage across samples. Applied to genome annotations, the approach examines more bubbles than prior tools while remaining tractable and interpretable.

Comment: Review; 31 pages

Abstract:
The discovery of genetic risk factors has transformed human genetics, yet the pace of new gene identification has slowed despite the exponential expansion of sequencing and biobank resources. Current approaches are optimized for the extremes of the allele frequency spectrum: rare, high-penetrance variants identified through burden testing, and common, low-effect variants mapped by genome-wide association studies. Between these extremes lies variants of intermediate frequency and effect size where statistical power is limited, pathogenicity is often misclassified, and gene discovery lags behind empirical evidence of heritable contribution. This 'missing middle' represents a critical blind spot across disease areas, from neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders to cancer and aging. In this review, we organize strategies for risk gene identification by variant frequency class, highlighting methodological strengths and constraints at each scale. We draw on lessons across fields to illustrate how innovations in variant annotation, joint modeling, phenotype refinement, and network-based inference can extend discovery into the intermediate range. By framing the frequency spectrum as a unifying axis, we provide a conceptual map of current capabilities, their limitations, and emerging directions toward more comprehensive risk gene discovery.

Abstract:
Since its emergence, SARS-CoV-2 has demonstrated a rapid and unpredictable evolutionary trajectory, characterized by the continual emergence of immune-evasive variants. This poses persistent challenges to public health and vaccine development.   While large-scale generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs) have revolutionized the modeling of sequential data, their direct applications to noisy viral genomic sequences are limited. In this paper, we introduce PETRA(Pretrained Evolutionary TRAnsformer), a novel transformer approach based on evolutionary trajectories derived from phylogenetic trees rather than raw RNA sequences. This method effectively mitigates sequencing noise and captures the hierarchical structure of viral evolution.   With a weighted training framework to address substantial geographical and temporal imbalances in global sequence data, PETRA excels in predicting future SARS-CoV-2 mutations, achieving a weighted recall@1 of 9.45% for nucleotide mutations and 17.10\% for spike amino-acid mutations, compared to 0.49% and 6.64% respectively for the best baseline. PETRA also demonstrates its ability to aid in the real-time mutation prediction of major clades like 24F(XEC) and 25A(LP.8.1). The code is open sourced on https://github.com/xz-keg/PETra

Abstract:
Computational modeling of single-cell gene expression is crucial for understanding cellular processes, but generating realistic expression profiles remains a major challenge. This difficulty arises from the count nature of gene expression data and complex latent dependencies among genes. Existing generative models often impose artificial gene orderings or rely on shallow neural network architectures. We introduce a scalable latent diffusion model for single-cell gene expression data, which we refer to as scLDM, that respects the fundamental exchangeability property of the data. Our VAE uses fixed-size latent variables leveraging a unified Multi-head Cross-Attention Block (MCAB) architecture, which serves dual roles: permutation-invariant pooling in the encoder and permutation-equivariant unpooling in the decoder. We enhance this framework by replacing the Gaussian prior with a latent diffusion model using Diffusion Transformers and linear interpolants, enabling high-quality generation with multi-conditional classifier-free guidance. We show its superior performance in a variety of experiments for both observational and perturbational single-cell data, as well as downstream tasks like cell-level classification.

Abstract:
In clinical proteomics, available input is often limited. In addition, phospho-proteomics is of particular interest since the dysregulation of these post-translational modifications (PTMs) has been implicated in various diseases such as cancer. We therefore assessed the feasibility of low input phospho-proteomics via phospho-bulk titration and low-input starting material. We found that there was identification of more phospho-peptides through phospho-bulk titration because of sample loss during preparation of low input starting material. Additionally, we explored various lysis buffers and boiling times for efficiency of decrosslinking formalin-fixed cells since cells and tissues are often fixed for preservation and sorting via FACS. We found that boiling in 0.05M Tris pH 7.6 with 5% SDS for 60 min yielded the highest number of phospho-peptides. Lastly, we applied Evotips Pure and phospho-bulk titration to treated Jurkat cells and identified 7 phospho-sites involved in T-cell stimulation.

Abstract:
Nucleotide sequence variation can induce significant shifts in functional fitness. Recent nucleotide foundation models promise to predict such fitness effects directly from sequence, yet heterogeneous datasets and inconsistent preprocessing make it difficult to compare methods fairly across DNA and RNA families. Here we introduce NABench, a large-scale, systematic benchmark for nucleic acid fitness prediction. NABench aggregates 162 high-throughput assays and curates 2.6 million mutated sequences spanning diverse DNA and RNA families, with standardized splits and rich metadata. We show that NABench surpasses prior nucleotide fitness benchmarks in scale, diversity, and data quality. Under a unified evaluation suite, we rigorously assess 29 representative foundation models across zero-shot, few-shot prediction, transfer learning, and supervised settings. The results quantify performance heterogeneity across tasks and nucleic-acid types, demonstrating clear strengths and failure modes for different modeling choices and establishing strong, reproducible baselines. We release NABench to advance nucleic acid modeling, supporting downstream applications in RNA/DNA design, synthetic biology, and biochemistry. Our code is available at https://github.com/mrzzmrzz/NABench.

Abstract:
Diagnosing rare diseases requires linking gene findings with often unstructured reference text. Current pipelines collect many candidate genes, but clinicians still spend a lot of time filtering false positives and combining evidence from papers and databases. A key challenge is language: phenotype descriptions and inheritance patterns are written in prose, not fully captured by tables. Large language models (LLMs) can read such text, but clinical use needs grounding in citable knowledge and stable, repeatable behavior. We explore a knowledge-grounded and language-aware reranking layer on top of a high-recall first-stage pipeline. The goal is to improve precision and explainability, not to replace standard bioinformatics steps. We use expert-built context and a consensus method to reduce LLM variability, producing shorter, better-justified gene lists for expert review. LA-MARRVEL achieves the highest accuracy, outperforming other methods -- including traditional bioinformatics diagnostic tools (AI-MARRVEL, Exomiser, LIRICAL) and naive large language models (e.g., Anthropic Claude) -- with an average Recall@5 of 94.10%, a +3.65 percentage-point improvement over AI-MARRVEL. The LLM-generated reasoning provides clear prose on phenotype matching and inheritance patterns, making clinical review faster and easier. LA-MARRVEL has three parts: expert-engineered context that enriches phenotype and disease information; a ranked voting algorithm that combines multiple LLM runs to choose a consensus ranked gene list; and the AI-MARRVEL pipeline that provides first-stage ranks and gene annotations, already known as a state-of-the-art method in Rare Disease Diagnosis on BG, DDD, and UDN cohorts. The online AI-MARRVEL includes LA-MARRVEL as an LLM feature at https://ai.marrvel.org . We evaluate LA-MARRVEL on three datasets from independent cohorts of real-world diagnosed patients.

Abstract:
DNA methylation can be associated with phenotypic plasticity, yet how temperature shapes DNA methylation diversity in natural populations is unclear. Analyzing whole-genome bisulfite sequencing from 1075 Arabidopsis thaliana accessions grown at 10°C, 16°C, and 22°C, we quantified single-cytosine diversity using Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD). Diversity consistently peaked at intermediate methylation levels across the CpG, CHG, and CHH sequence contexts. Temperature modulated this diversity, primarily impacting intermediately methylated sites, with non-CG contexts (CHG and CHH) exhibiting increased diversity at warmer temperatures. Notably, at 22°C, CHH diversity patterns indicated altered balance between the RdDM and CMT2 pathways that regulate specific transposable element (TE) superfamilies. Furthermore, accessions from Southern Europe displayed higher non-CG diversity at 22°C compared to Northern European accessions. Our findings reveal that temperature influences the epigenomic diversity landscape, highlighting context-dependent plasticity, a dynamic interplay between silencing pathways, and potential geographic adaptation in response to environmental cues.

Abstract:
Introduction: Epigenomic datasets from high-throughput sequencing experiments are commonly summarized as genomic intervals. As the volume of this data grows, so does interest in analyzing it through deep learning. However, the heterogeneity of genomic interval data, where each dataset defines its own regions, creates barriers for machine learning methods that require consistent, discrete vocabularies. Methods: We introduce gtars-tokenizers, a high-performance library that maps genomic intervals to a predefined universe or vocabulary of regions, analogous to text tokenization in natural language processing. Built in Rust with bindings for Python, R, CLI, and WebAssembly, gtars-tokenizers implements two overlap methods (BITS and AIList) and integrates seamlessly with modern ML frameworks through Hugging Face-compatible APIs. Results: The gtars-tokenizers package achieves top efficiency for large-scale datasets, while enabling genomic intervals to be processed using standard ML workflows in PyTorch and TensorFlow without ad hoc preprocessing. This token-based approach bridges genomics and machine learning, supporting scalable and standardized analysis of interval data across diverse computational environments.

Abstract:
Motivation: Advances in high-throughput chromatin conformation capture have provided insight into the three-dimensional structure and organization of chromatin. While bulk Hi-C experiments capture spatio-temporally averaged chromatin interactions across millions of cells, single-cell Hi-C experiments report on the chromatin interactions of individual cells. Supervised and unsupervised algorithms have been developed to embed single-cell Hi-C maps and identify different cell types. However, single-cell Hi-C maps are often difficult to cluster due to their high sparsity, with state-of-the-art algorithms achieving a maximum Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) of only < 0.4 on several datasets while requiring labels for training.   Results: We introduce a novel unsupervised algorithm, Single-cell Clustering Using Diagonal Diffusion Operators (SCUDDO), to embed and cluster single-cell Hi-C maps. We evaluate SCUDDO on three previously difficult-to-cluster single-cell Hi-C datasets, and show that it can outperform other current algorithms in ARI by > 0.2. Further, SCUDDO outperforms all other tested algorithms even when we restrict the number of intrachromosomal maps for each cell type and when we use only a small fraction of contacts in each Hi-C map. Thus, SCUDDO can capture the underlying latent features of single-cell Hi-C maps and provide accurate labeling of cell types even when cell types are not known a priori.   Availability: SCUDDO is freely available at www.github.com/lmaisuradze/scuddo. The tested datasets are publicly available and can be downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus.

Summary: We present AmpliconHunter2 (AHv2), a highly scalable in silico PCR engine written in C that can handle degenerate primers and uses a highly accurate melting temperature model. AHv2 implements a bit-mask IUPAC matcher with AVX2 SIMD acceleration, supports user-specified mismatches and 3' clamp constraints, calls amplicons in all four primer pair orientations (FR/RF/FF/RR), and optionally trims primers and extracts fixed-length flanking barcodes into FASTA headers. The pipeline packs FASTA into 2-bit batches, streams them in 16 MB chunks, writes amplicons to per-thread temp files and concatenates outputs, minimizing peak RSS during amplicon finding. We also summarize updates to the Python reference (AHv1.1).

Abstract:
Bulk tissue RNA sequencing of heterogeneous samples provides averaged gene expression profiles, obscuring cell type-specific dynamics. To address this, we present a probabilistic hierarchical Bayesian model that deconvolves bulk RNA-seq data into constituent cell-type expression profiles and proportions, leveraging a high-resolution single-cell reference. We apply our model to human endometrial tissue across the menstrual cycle, a context characterized by dramatic hormone-driven cellular composition changes. Our extended framework provides a principled inference of cell type proportions and cell-specific gene expression changes across cycle phases. We demonstrate the model's structure, priors, and inference strategy in detail, and we validate its performance with simulations and comparisons to existing methods. The results reveal dynamic shifts in epithelial, stromal, and immune cell fractions between menstrual phases, and identify cell-type-specific differential gene expression associated with endometrial function (e.g., decidualization markers in stromal cells during the secretory phase). We further conduct robustness tests and show that our Bayesian approach is resilient to reference mismatches and noise. Finally, we discuss the biological significance of our findings, potential clinical implications for fertility and endometrial disorders, and future directions, including integration of spatial transcriptomics.

Abstract:
Single-cell RNA-seq foundation models achieve strong performance on downstream tasks but remain black boxes, limiting their utility for biological discovery. Recent work has shown that sparse dictionary learning can extract concepts from deep learning models, with promising applications in biomedical imaging and protein models. However, interpreting biological concepts remains challenging, as biological sequences are not inherently human-interpretable. We introduce a novel concept-based interpretability framework for single-cell RNA-seq models with a focus on concept interpretation and evaluation. We propose an attribution method with counterfactual perturbations that identifies genes that influence concept activation, moving beyond correlational approaches like differential expression analysis. We then provide two complementary interpretation approaches: an expert-driven analysis facilitated by an interactive interface and an ontology-driven method with attribution-based biological pathway enrichment. Applying our framework to two well-known single-cell RNA-seq models from the literature, we interpret concepts extracted by Top-K Sparse Auto-Encoders trained on two immune cell datasets. With a domain expert in immunology, we show that concepts improve interpretability compared to individual neurons while preserving the richness and informativeness of the latent representations. This work provides a principled framework for interpreting what biological knowledge foundation models have encoded, paving the way for their use for hypothesis generation and discovery.

Abstract:
Advances in single-cell sequencing have enabled high-resolution profiling of diverse molecular modalities, while integrating unpaired multi-omics single-cell data remains challenging. Existing approaches either rely on pair information or prior correspondences, or require computing a global pairwise coupling matrix, limiting their scalability and flexibility. In this paper, we introduce a scalable and flexible generative framework called single-cell Multi-omics Regularized Disentangled Representations (scMRDR) for unpaired multi-omics integration. Specifically, we disentangle each cell's latent representations into modality-shared and modality-specific components using a well-designed $β$-VAE architecture, which are augmented with isometric regularization to preserve intra-omics biological heterogeneity, adversarial objective to encourage cross-modal alignment, and masked reconstruction loss strategy to address the issue of missing features across modalities. Our method achieves excellent performance on benchmark datasets in terms of batch correction, modality alignment, and biological signal preservation. Crucially, it scales effectively to large-level datasets and supports integration of more than two omics, offering a powerful and flexible solution for large-scale multi-omics data integration and downstream biological discovery.

Abstract:
Analysis of genomics data is central to nearly all areas of modern biology. Despite significant progress in artificial intelligence (AI) and computational methods, these technologies require significant human oversight to generate novel and reliable biological insights. Consequently, the genomics community has developed a substantial number of diverse visualization approaches and a proliferation of tools that biologists rely on in their data analysis workflows. While there are a few commonly used visualization tools for genomics data, many tools target specific use cases for genomics data interpretation and offer only a limited, predefined set of visualization types. Moreover, static visualizations often fail to support exploratory analysis. Developing interactive visualizations and tools typically requires significant time and technical expertise, even when supported by modern LLM-powered coding assistants, and the resulting visualizations can be difficult to share among collaborators. We developed Gosling Designer, an all-in-one platform for editing, exploring, and sharing visualizations of genomics data. Gosling Designer addresses four key challenges observed in existing genomics visualization tools: (1) limited versatility, (2) difficulty of visualization authoring, (3) complexity of data management, and (4) barriers to sharing and collaboration.

Title: Integrated Multi-omics Reveals MEF2C as a Direct Regulator of Microglial Immune and Synaptic Programs

Abstract:
Background: Patients carrying MEF2C haploinsufficiency develop a recognizable neurodevelopmental syndrome featuring intellectual disability, treatment-resistant seizures, and autism spectrum behaviors. While MEF2C's critical roles in cardiac development and neuronal function are well-established, its specific transcriptional operations within microglia (the brain's resident immune cells) have remained surprisingly undefined. This knowledge gap is particularly notable given that MEF2C syndrome patients consistently present with neurological symptoms while cardiac abnormalities are rarely observed.   Results: We used human iPSC-derived microglia with MEF2C knockout to perform integrated ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analyses. Our data demonstrate that MEF2C directly binds 1,258 genomic loci and regulates 755 differentially expressed genes (FDR < 0.05). Integration identified 69 high-confidence direct targets with statistically significant overlap (p = 8.87 x 10^-5). The most dramatic changes included ADAMDEC1, a microglia-enriched metalloprotease for extracellular matrix remodeling (log2FC = -4.76, adj. p = 3.30 x 10^-19), and CARD11, an NF-kappaB signaling component (log2FC = -5.16, adj. p = 5.95 x 10^-5). Pathway analysis revealed profound disruption of Fc-gamma receptor signaling (p = 3.11 x 10^-7), alongside widespread changes in immune response and synaptic organization pathways.   Conclusion: These findings establish MEF2C as a master transcriptional regulator coordinating both immune effector functions and synaptic interaction programs in microglia. The observed changes, particularly in Fc receptor signaling critical for synaptic pruning, likely underlie the neurological manifestations of MEF2C syndrome.

Abstract:
The identification of homologous gene families across multiple genomes is a central task in bacterial pangenomics traditionally requiring computationally demanding all-against-all comparisons. PanDelos addresses this challenge with an alignment-free and parameter-free approach based on k-mer profiles, combining high speed, ease of use, and competitive accuracy with state-of-the-art methods. However, the increasing availability of genomic data requires tools that can scale efficiently to larger datasets. To address this need, we present PanDelos-plus, a fully parallel, gene-centric redesign of PanDelos. The algorithm parallelizes the most computationally intensive phases (Best Hit detection and Bidirectional Best Hit extraction) through data decomposition and a thread pool strategy, while employing lightweight data structures to reduce memory usage. Benchmarks on synthetic datasets show that PanDelos-plus achieves up to 14x faster execution and reduces memory usage by up to 96%, while maintaining accuracy. These improvements enable population-scale comparative genomics to be performed on standard multicore workstations, making large-scale bacterial pangenome analysis accessible for routine use in everyday research.

Abstract:
Arsenic (As), a widespread environmental toxin, poses major health risks due to its inorganic forms (iAs), which are linked to cancer, cardiovascular disease, and endocrine disruption. Although its toxic effects have been extensively studied, the molecular mechanisms underlying arsenic-induced perturbations remain incompletely understood. This complexity arises from its ability to reprogram epigenetic landscapes, alter gene expression, and disrupt metabolic balance through interconnected regulatory networks. Existing studies often analyze epigenomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic datasets independently, overlooking their interdependence. Here, we present a coupled matrix factorization (CMF) framework based on the PARAFAC2-AOADMM model for joint integration of DNA methylation (RRBS), RNA-seq, and metabolomics data from mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and epiblast-like cells (EpiLCs) exposed to arsenic. By jointly decomposing multi-omics matrices, our approach identifies shared and dataset-specific components that capture coordinated molecular responses to arsenic exposure. This integrative methodology demonstrates the potential of CMF-based models in computational toxicology and offers a generalizable framework for dissecting complex multi-layered biological perturbations.

Comment: 17 pages (main text), 4 figures (main text), 7 supplementary figures, 4 supplementary tables. Focuses on a computational framework using causal inference and biological validation for underpowered cancer genomic studies

Abstract:
Motivation: Standard genome-wide association studies in cancer genomics rely on statistical significance with multiple testing correction, but systematically fail in underpowered cohorts. In TCGA breast cancer (n=967, 133 deaths), low event rates (13.8%) create severe power limitations, producing false negatives for known drivers and false positives for large passenger genes. Results: We developed a five-criteria computational framework integrating causal inference (inverse probability weighting, doubly robust estimation) with orthogonal biological validation (expression, mutation patterns, literature evidence). Applied to TCGA-BRCA mortality analysis, standard Cox+FDR detected zero genes at FDR<0.05, confirming complete failure in underpowered settings. Our framework correctly identified RYR2 -- a cardiac gene with no cancer function -- as a false positive despite nominal significance (p=0.024), while identifying KMT2C as a complex candidate requiring validation despite marginal significance (p=0.047, q=0.954). Power analysis revealed median power of 15.1% across genes, with KMT2C achieving only 29.8% power (HR=1.55), explaining borderline statistical significance despite strong biological evidence. The framework distinguished true signals from artifacts through mutation pattern analysis: RYR2 showed 29.8% silent mutations (passenger signature) with no hotspots, while KMT2C showed 6.7% silent mutations with 31.4% truncating variants (driver signature). This multi-evidence approach provides a template for analyzing underpowered cohorts, prioritizing biological interpretability over purely statistical significance.

Abstract:
Cancer exhibits diverse and complex phenotypes driven by multifaceted molecular interactions. Recent biomedical research has emphasized the comprehensive study of such diseases by integrating multi-omics datasets (genome, proteome, transcriptome, epigenome). This approach provides an efficient method for identifying genetic variants associated with cancer and offers a deeper understanding of how the disease develops and spreads. However, it is challenging to comprehend complex interactions among the features of multi-omics datasets compared to single omics. In this paper, we analyze lung cancer multi-omics datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Using four statistical methods, LIMMA, the T test, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), and the Wilcoxon test, we identified differentially expressed genes across gene expression, DNA methylation, and miRNA expression data. We then integrated these multi-omics data using the Kernel Machine Regression (KMR) approach. Our findings reveal significant interactions among the three omics: gene expression, miRNA expression, and DNA methylation in lung cancer. From our data analysis, we identified 38 genes significantly associated with lung cancer. From our data analysis, we identified 38 genes significantly associated with lung cancer. Among these, eight genes of highest ranking (PDGFRB, PDGFRA, SNAI1, ID1, FGF11, TNXB, ITGB1, ZIC1) were highlighted by rigorous statistical analysis. Furthermore, in silico studies identified three top-ranked potential candidate drugs (Selinexor, Orapred, and Capmatinib) that could play a crucial role in the treatment of lung cancer. These proposed drugs are also supported by the findings of other independent studies, which underscore their potential efficacy in the fight against lung cancer.

Abstract:
Nanopore sequencing enables real-time long-read DNA sequencing with reads exceeding 10 kilobases, but inherent error rates of 12-15 percent present significant computational challenges for read alignment. The critical seed chaining step must connect exact k-mer matches between reads and reference genomes while filtering spurious matches, yet state-of-the-art methods rely on fixed gap penalty functions unable to adapt to varying genomic contexts including tandem repeats and structural variants. This paper presents RawHash3, a hybrid framework combining graph neural networks with classical dynamic programming for adaptive seed chaining that maintains real-time performance while providing statistical guarantees. We formalize seed chaining as graph learning where seeds constitute nodes with 12-dimensional feature vectors and edges encode 8-dimensional spatial relationships including gap consistency. Our architecture employs three-layer EdgeConv GNN with confidence-based method selection that dynamically switches between learned guidance and algorithmic fallback. Comprehensive evaluation on 1,000 synthetic nanopore reads with 5,200 test seeds demonstrates RawHash3 achieves 99.94 percent precision and 40.07 percent recall, representing statistically significant 25.0 percent relative improvement over baseline with p less than 0.001. The system maintains median inference latency of 1.59ms meeting real-time constraints, while demonstrating superior robustness with 100 percent success rate under 20 percent label corruption versus baseline degradation to 30.3 percent. Cross-validation confirms stability establishing graph neural networks as viable approach for production genomics pipelines.

Abstract:
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data simulation is limited by classical methods that rely on linear correlations, failing to capture the intrinsic, nonlinear dependencies. No existing simulator jointly models gene-gene and cell-cell interactions. We introduce qSimCells, a novel quantum computing-based simulator that employs entanglement to model intra- and inter-cellular interactions, generating realistic single-cell transcriptomes with cellular heterogeneity. The core innovation is a quantum kernel that uses a parameterized quantum circuit with CNOT gates to encode complex, nonlinear gene regulatory network (GRN) as well as cell-cell communication topologies with explicit causal directionality. The resulting synthetic data exhibits non-classical dependencies: standard correlation-based analyses (Pearson and Spearman) fail to recover the programmed causal pathways and instead report spurious associations driven by high baseline gene-expression probabilities. Furthermore, applying cell-cell communication detection to the simulated data validates the true mechanistic links, revealing a robust, up to 75-fold relative increase in inferred communication probability only when quantum entanglement is active. These results demonstrate that the quantum kernel is essential for producing high-fidelity ground-truth datasets and highlight the need for advanced inference techniques to capture the complex, non-classical dependencies inherent in gene regulation.

Abstract:
Large Language Models are increasingly popular in genomics due to their potential to decode complex biological sequences. Hence, researchers require a standardized benchmark to evaluate DNA Language Models (DNA LMs) capabilities. However, evaluating DNA LMs is a complex task that intersects genomic's domain-specific challenges and machine learning methodologies, where seemingly minor implementation details can significantly compromise benchmark validity. We demonstrate this through BEND (Benchmarking DNA Language Models), where hardware-dependent hyperparameters -- number of data loading workers and buffer sizes -- create spurious performance variations of up to 4% for identical models. The problem stems from inadequate data shuffling interacting with domain specific data characteristics. Experiments with three DNA language models (HyenaDNA, DNABERT-2, ResNet-LM) show these artifacts affect both absolute performance and relative model rankings. We propose a simple solution: pre-shuffling data before storage eliminates hardware dependencies while maintaining efficiency. This work highlights how standard ML practices can interact unexpectedly with domain-specific data characteristics, with broader implications for benchmark design in specialized domains.

Abstract:
Aging is a highly complex and heterogeneous process that progresses at different rates across individuals, making biological age (BA) a more accurate indicator of physiological decline than chronological age. While previous studies have built aging clocks using single-omics data, they often fail to capture the full molecular complexity of human aging. In this work, we leveraged the Human Phenotype Project, a large-scale cohort of 10,000 adults aged 40-70 years, with extensive longitudinal profiling that includes clinical, behavioral, environmental, and multi-omics datasets spanning transcriptomics, lipidomics, metabolomics, and the microbiome. By employing advanced machine learning frameworks capable of modeling nonlinear biological dynamics, we developed and rigorously validated a multi-omics aging clock that robustly predicts diverse health outcomes and future disease risk. Unsupervised clustering of the integrated molecular profiles from multi-omics uncovered distinct biological subtypes of aging, revealing striking heterogeneity in aging trajectories and pinpointing pathway-specific alterations associated with different aging patterns. These findings demonstrate the power of multi-omics integration to decode the molecular landscape of aging and lay the groundwork for personalized healthspan monitoring and precision strategies to prevent age-related diseases.

Abstract:
Genome-resolved metagenomics has contributed largely to discovering prokaryotic genomes. When applied to microscopic eukaryotes, challenges such as the high number of introns and repeat regions found in nuclear genomes have hampered the mining and discovery of novel protistan lineages. Organellar genomes are simpler, smaller, have higher abundance than their nuclear counterparts and contain valuable phylogenetic information, but are yet to be widely used to identify new protist lineages from metagenomes. Here we present "ChloroScan", a new bioinformatics pipeline to extract eukaryotic plastid genomes from metagenomes. It incorporates a deep learning contig classifier to identify putative plastid contigs and an automated binning module to recover bins with guidance from a curated marker gene database. Additionally, ChloroScan summarizes the results in different user-friendly formats, including annotated coding sequences and proteins for each bin. We show that ChloroScan recovers more high-quality plastid bins than MetaBAT2 for simulated metagenomes. The practical utility of ChloroScan is illustrated by recovering 16 medium to high-quality metagenome assembled genomes from four protist-size fractioned metagenomes, with several bins showing high taxonomic novelty.

Abstract:
Rare genetic disease diagnosis faces critical challenges: insufficient patient data, inaccessible full genome sequencing, and the immense number of possible causative genes. These limitations cause prolonged diagnostic journeys, inappropriate treatments, and critical delays, disproportionately affecting patients in resource-limited settings where diagnostic tools are scarce. We propose RareNet, a subgraph-based Graph Neural Network that requires only patient phenotypes to identify the most likely causal gene and retrieve focused patient subgraphs for targeted clinical investigation. RareNet can function as a standalone method or serve as a pre-processing or post-processing filter for other candidate gene prioritization methods, consistently enhancing their performance while potentially enabling explainable insights. Through comprehensive evaluation on two biomedical datasets, we demonstrate competitive and robust causal gene prediction and significant performance gains when integrated with other frameworks. By requiring only phenotypic data, which is readily available in any clinical setting, RareNet democratizes access to sophisticated genetic analysis, offering particular value for underserved populations lacking advanced genomic infrastructure.

Abstract:
Spatial variable genes (SVGs) reveal critical information about tissue architecture, cellular interactions, and disease microenvironments. As spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies proliferate, accurately identifying SVGs across diverse platforms, tissue types, and disease contexts has become both a major opportunity and a significant computational challenge. Here, we present a comprehensive benchmarking study of 20 state-of-the-art SVG detection methods using human slides from STimage-1K4M, a large-scale resource of ST data comprising 662 slides from more than 18 tissue types. We evaluate each method across a range of biologically and technically meaningful criteria, including recovery of pathologist-annotated domain-specific markers, cross-slide reproducibility, scalability to high-resolution data, and robustness to technical variation. Our results reveal marked differences in performance depending on tissue type, spatial resolution, and study design. Beyond benchmarking, we construct the first cross-tissue atlas of SVGs, enabling comparative analysis of spatial gene programs across cancer and normal tissues. We observe similarities between pairs of tissues that reflect developmental and functional relationships, such as high overlap between thymus and lymph node, and uncover spatial gene programs associated with metastasis, immune infiltration, and tissue-of-origin identity in cancer. Together, our work defines a framework for evaluating and interpreting spatial gene expression and establishes a reference resource for the ST community.

Abstract:
Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) datasets are fundamental to genetic studies but pose significant privacy risks when shared. The correlation of SNPs with each other makes strong adversarial attacks such as masked-value reconstruction, kin, and membership inference attacks possible. Existing privacy-preserving approaches either apply differential privacy to statistical summaries of these datasets or offer complex methods that require post-processing and the usage of a publicly available dataset to suppress or selectively share SNPs.   In this study, we introduce an innovative framework for generating synthetic SNP sequence datasets using samples derived from time-inhomogeneous hidden Markov models (TIHMMs). To preserve the privacy of the training data, we ensure that each SNP sequence contributes only a bounded influence during training, enabling strong differential privacy guarantees. Crucially, by operating on full SNP sequences and bounding their gradient contributions, our method directly addresses the privacy risks introduced by their inherent correlations.   Through experiments conducted on the real-world 1000 Genomes dataset, we demonstrate the efficacy of our method using privacy budgets of $\varepsilon \in [1, 10]$ at $δ=10^{-4}$. Notably, by allowing the transition models of the HMM to be dependent on the location in the sequence, we significantly enhance performance, enabling the synthetic datasets to closely replicate the statistical properties of non-private datasets. This framework facilitates the private sharing of genomic data while offering researchers exceptional flexibility and utility.

Abstract:
Identifying cancer driver genes (CDGs) is essential for understanding cancer mechanisms and developing targeted therapies. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have recently been employed to identify CDGs by capturing patterns in biological interaction networks. However, most GNN-based approaches rely on a single protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, ignoring complementary information from other biological networks. Some studies integrate multiple networks by aligning features with consistency constraints to learn unified gene representations for CDG identification. However, such representation-level fusion often assumes congruent gene relationships across networks, which may overlook network heterogeneity and introduce conflicting information. To address this, we propose Soft-Evidence Fusion Graph Neural Network (SEFGNN), a novel framework for CDG identification across multiple networks at the decision level. Instead of enforcing feature-level consistency, SEFGNN treats each biological network as an independent evidence source and performs uncertainty-aware fusion at the decision level using Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST). To alleviate the risk of overconfidence from DST, we further introduce a Soft Evidence Smoothing (SES) module that improves ranking stability while preserving discriminative performance. Experiments on three cancer datasets show that SEFGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and exhibits strong potential in discovering novel CDGs.

Abstract:
Nanopore sequencing technologies continue to advance rapidly, offering critical benefits such as real-time analysis, the ability to sequence extremely long DNA fragments (up to millions of bases in a single read), and the option to selectively stop sequencing a molecule before completion. Traditionally, the raw electrical signals generated during sequencing are converted into DNA sequences through a process called basecalling, which typically relies on large neural network models. Raw signal analysis has emerged as a promising alternative to these resource-intensive approaches. While attempts have been made to benchmark conventional basecalling methods, existing evaluation frameworks 1) overlook raw signal analysis techniques, 2) lack the flexibility to accommodate new raw signal analysis tools easily, and 3) fail to include the latest improvements in nanopore datasets. Our goal is to provide an extensible benchmarking framework that enables designing and comparing new methods for raw signal analysis. To this end, we introduce RawBench, the first flexible framework for evaluating raw nanopore signal analysis techniques. RawBench provides modular evaluation of three core pipeline components: 1) reference genome encoding (using different pore models), 2) signal encoding (through various segmentation methods), and 3) representation matching (via different data structures). We extensively evaluate raw signal analysis techniques in terms of 1) quality and performance for read mapping, 2) quality and performance for read classification, and 3) quality of raw signal analysis-assisted basecalling. Our evaluations show that raw signal analysis can achieve competitive quality while significantly reducing resource requirements, particularly in settings where real-time processing or edge deployment is necessary.

Abstract:
Deep learning, particularly with the advancement of Large Language Models, has transformed biomolecular modeling, with protein advances (e.g., ESM) inspiring emerging RNA language models such as RiNALMo. Yet how and what these RNA Language Models internally encode about messenger RNA (mRNA) or non-coding RNA (ncRNA) families remains unclear. We present SAE- RNA, interpretability model that analyzes RiNALMo representations and maps them to known human-level biological features. Our work frames RNA interpretability as concept discovery in pretrained embeddings, without end-to-end retraining, and provides practical tools to probe what RNA LMs may encode about ncRNA families. The model can be extended to close comparisons between RNA groups, and supporting hypothesis generation about previously unrecognized relationships.

Abstract:
Gene expression data is essential for understanding how genes are regulated and interact within biological systems, providing insights into disease pathways and potential therapeutic targets. Gene knockout has proven to be a fundamental technique in molecular biology, allowing the investigation of the function of specific genes in an organism, as well as in specific cell types. However, gene expression patterns are quite heterogeneous in single-cell transcriptional data from a uniform environment, representing different cell states, which produce cell-type and cell-specific gene knockout impacts. A computational method that can predict the single-cell resolution knockout impact is still lacking. Here, we present a data-driven framework for learning the mapping between gene expression profiles derived from gene assemblages, enabling the accurate prediction of perturbed expression profiles following knockout (KO) for any cell, without relying on prior perturbed data. We systematically validated our framework using synthetic data generated from gene regulatory dynamics models, two mouse knockout single-cell datasets, and high-throughput in vitro CRISPRi Perturb-seq data. Our results demonstrate that the framework can accurately predict both expression profiles and KO effects at the single-cell level. Our approach provides a generalizable tool for inferring gene function at single-cell resolution, offering new opportunities to study genetic perturbations in contexts where large-scale experimental screens are infeasible.

Abstract:
Medulloblastoma is a malignant pediatric brain cancer, and the discovery of molecular subgroups is enabling personalized treatment strategies. In 2019, a consensus identified eight novel subtypes within Groups 3 and 4, each displaying heterogeneous characteristics. Classifiers are essential for translating these findings into clinical practice by supporting clinical trials, personalized therapy development and application, and patient monitoring. This study presents a DNA methylation-based, cross-platform machine learning classifier capable of distinguishing these subtypes on both HM450 and EPIC methylation array samples. Across two independent test sets, the model achieved weighted F1 = 0.95 and balanced accuracy = 0.957, consistent across platforms. As the first cross-platform solution, it provides backward compatibility while extending applicability to a newer platform, also enhancing accessibility. It also has the potential to become the first publicly available classifier for these subtypes once deployed through a web application, as planned in the future. This work overall takes steps in the direction of advancing precision medicine and improving clinical outcomes for patients within the majority prevalence medulloblastoma subgroups, groups 3 and 4.

Abstract:
Background. Preeclampsia (PE) complicates 2-8% of pregnancies and is marked by placental hypoxia and HIF-pathway activation, especially in early-onset PE (eoPE). Integrating patient tissue analyses with experimental models may reveal common molecular markers of trophoblast hypoxia.   Methods. We analyzed scRNA-seq data from 10 eoPE, 7 late-onset PE (loPE), and corresponding control placentas, identifying villous cytotrophoblast (VCT), syncytiotrophoblast (SCT), and extravillous trophoblast (EVT) subpopulations. BeWo b30 cells were treated for 24 h with CoCl2 (300 $μ$M) or an oxyquinoline derivative (OD, 5 $μ$M) to induce hypoxia. RNA and small RNA sequencing quantified mRNA and microRNA changes. PROGENy inferred pathway activities.   Results. ScRNA-seq revealed highest hypoxia pathway activation in eoPE, with EVT showing maximum activity among trophoblast populations. Nine genes were upregulated across all trophoblast types in eoPE: EBI3, CST6, FN1, RFK, COL17A1, LDHA, PKP2, RPS4Y1, and RPS26. In vitro, OD induced more specific hypoxia responses than CoCl2, with 1,284 versus 3,032 differentially expressed genes respectively. Critically, EBI3, FN1, and COL17A1 showed concordant upregulation in both placental tissue and OD-treated cells, while CoCl2 treatment produced opposite expression patterns. MicroRNA analysis identified hsa-miR-27a-5p and hsa-miR-193b-5p as consistently elevated in both experimental conditions and previously reported in PE placental vesicles. We also identified isoforms of hsa-miR-9-5p and hsa-miR-92b-3p as hypoxia-associated in trophoblast.   Conclusions. EBI3, COL17A1, hsa-miR-27a-5p, and hsa-miR-193b-5p emerge as trophoblast hypoxia markers in PE. Oxyquinoline derivatives offer a more physiologically relevant in vitro hypoxia model than CoCl2. This integrated approach advances understanding of PE pathophysiology and suggests candidate therapeutic targets.

Abstract:
Epilepsy is a chronic neurological condition characterized by recurrent seizures, with global prevalence estimated at 50 million people worldwide. While progress in high-throughput sequencing has allowed for broad-based transcriptomic profiling of brain tissues, the deciphering of these highly complex datasets remains one of the challenges. To address this issue, in this paper we propose a new analysis pipeline that integrates the power of deep learning strategies with GPU-acceleration computation for investigating Gene expression patterns in epilepsy. Specifically, our proposed approach employs GPT-2 XL, a transformer-based Large Language Model (LLM) with 1.5 billion parameters for genomic sequence analysis over the latest NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs based on Hopper architecture. Our proposed method enables efficient preprocessing of RNA sequence data, gene sequence encoding, and subsequent pattern identification. We conducted experiments on two epilepsy datasets including GEO accession GSE264537 and GSE275235. The obtained results reveal several significant transcriptomic modifications, including reduced hippocampal astrogliosis after ketogenic diet treatment as well as restored excitatory-inhibitory signaling equilibrium in zebrafish epilepsy model. Moreover, our results highlight the effectiveness of leveraging LLMs in combination with advanced hardware acceleration for transcriptomic characterization in neurological diseases.

Abstract:
Genetic nurture effects and assortative mating (AM) occur across many human behaviors and can bias estimates from traditional genetic models. These influences are typically studied univariately, within the same trait. However, estimation of cross-trait genetic nurture effects and cross-trait AM remains underexplored due to the absence of suitable approaches. To address this, we developed a multivariate extension of the SEM-PGS model for datasets with genotyped and phenotyped parents and offspring, enabling joint estimation of within-trait and cross-trait genetic and environmental influences. By integrating haplotypic polygenic scores (PGS) into a structural equation modeling framework, the model simultaneously estimates same-trait and cross-trait direct effects, genetic nurture, vertical transmission, and assortative mating. We also provide the first formal description of how copaths can be used to model multivariate assortative mating and derive the corresponding parameter expectations in matrix form. Forward-time Monte Carlo simulations under varying conditions of r^2_PGS and N_trio demonstrate that the model yields unbiased estimates of both within-trait and cross-trait effects when assumptions are met. The precision of estimates was adequate with large sample sizes (N_trio > 16k) and improved as PGS predictive power increased. In addition, our simulation results show that failing to model cross-trait effects biases within-trait estimates, underscoring the importance of incorporating cross-trait effects. The multivariate SEM-PGS model offers a powerful and flexible tool for disentangling gene-environment interplay and advancing the understanding of familial influences on human traits.

Abstract:
Background: Large foundation models have revolutionized single-cell analysis, yet no kidney-specific model currently exists, and it remains unclear whether organ-focused models can outperform generalized models. The kidney's complex cellular architecture further complicate integration of large-scale omics data, where current frameworks trained on limited datasets struggle to correct batch effects, capture cross-modality variation, and generalize across species. Methods: We developed Nephrobase Cell+, the first kidney-focused large foundation model, pretrained on ~100 billion tokens from ~39.5 million single-cell and single-nucleus profiles across 4,319 samples. Nephrobase Cell+ uses a transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture with gene-token cross-attention and a mixture-of-experts module for scalable representation learning. Results: Nephrobase Cell+ sets a new benchmark for kidney single-cell analysis. It produces tightly clustered, biologically coherent embeddings in human and mouse kidneys, far surpassing previous foundation models such as Geneformer, scGPT, and UCE, as well as traditional methods such as PCA and autoencoders. It achieves the highest cluster concordance and batch-mixing scores, effectively removing donor/assay batch effects while preserving cell-type structure. Cross-species evaluation shows superior alignment of homologous cell types and >90% zero-shot annotation accuracy for major kidney lineages in both human and mouse. Even its 1B-parameter and 500M variants consistently outperform all existing models. Conclusions: Nephrobase Cell+ delivers a unified, high-fidelity representation of kidney biology that is robust, cross-species transferable, and unmatched by current single-cell foundation models, offering a powerful resource for kidney genomics and disease research.

Abstract:
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology enables systematic delineation of cellular states and interactions, providing crucial insights into cellular heterogeneity. Building on this potential, numerous computational methods have been developed for tasks such as cell clustering, cell type annotation, and marker gene identification. To fully assess and compare these methods, standardized, analysis-ready datasets are essential. However, such datasets remain scarce, and variations in data formats, preprocessing workflows, and annotation strategies hinder reproducibility and complicate systematic evaluation of existing methods. To address these challenges, we present scUnified, an AI-ready standardized resource for single-cell RNA sequencing data that consolidates 13 high-quality datasets spanning two species (human and mouse) and nine tissue types. All datasets undergo standardized quality control and preprocessing and are stored in a uniform format to enable direct application in diverse computational analyses without additional data cleaning. We further demonstrate the utility of scUnified through experimental analyses of representative biological tasks, providing a reproducible foundation for the standardized evaluation of computational methods on a unified dataset.

Abstract:
Distinguishing the rare "driver" mutations that fuel cancer progression from the vast background of "passenger" mutations in the non-coding genome is a fundamental challenge in cancer biology. A primary mechanism that non-coding driver mutations contribute to cancer is by affecting gene expression, potentially from millions of nucleotides away. However, existing predictors of gene expression from mutations are unable to simultaneously handle interactions spanning millions of base pairs, the extreme sparsity of somatic mutations, and generalize to unseen genes. To overcome these limitations, we introduce GenVarFormer (GVF), a novel transformer-based architecture designed to learn mutation representations and their impact on gene expression. GVF efficiently predicts the effect of mutations up to 8 million base pairs away from a gene by only considering mutations and their local DNA context, while omitting the vast intermediate sequence. Using data from 864 breast cancer samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we demonstrate that GVF predicts gene expression with 26-fold higher correlation across samples than current models. In addition, GVF is the first model of its kind to generalize to unseen genes and samples simultaneously. Finally, we find that GVF patient embeddings are more informative than ground-truth gene expression for predicting overall patient survival in the most prevalent breast cancer subtype, luminal A. GVF embeddings and gene expression yielded concordance indices of $0.706^{\pm0.136}$ and $0.573^{\pm0.234}$, respectively. Our work establishes a new state-of-the-art for modeling the functional impact of non-coding mutations in cancer and provides a powerful new tool for identifying potential driver events and prognostic biomarkers.

Abstract:
Predicting cellular responses to genetic perturbations represents a fundamental challenge in systems biology, critical for advancing therapeutic discovery and virtual cell modeling. While large language models (LLMs) show promise for biological reasoning, their application to perturbation prediction remains underexplored due to challenges in adapting them to structured experimental data. We present SynthPert, a novel method that enhances LLM performance through supervised fine-tuning on synthetic reasoning traces generated by frontier models. Using the PerturbQA benchmark, we demonstrate that our approach not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but surpasses the capabilities of the frontier model that generated the training data. Our results reveal three key insights: (1) Synthetic reasoning traces effectively distill biological knowledge even when partially inaccurate, (2) This approach enables cross-cell-type generalization with 87% accuracy on unseen RPE1 cells, and (3) Performance gains persist despite using only 2% of quality-filtered training data. This work shows the effectiveness of synthetic reasoning distillation for enhancing domain-specific reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract:
Language models are increasingly applied to biological sequences like proteins and mRNA, yet their default Euclidean geometry may mismatch the hierarchical structures inherent to biological data. While hyperbolic geometry provides a better alternative for accommodating hierarchical data, it has yet to find a way into language modeling for mRNA sequences. In this work, we introduce HyperHELM, a framework that implements masked language model pre-training in hyperbolic space for mRNA sequences. Using a hybrid design with hyperbolic layers atop Euclidean backbone, HyperHELM aligns learned representations with the biological hierarchy defined by the relationship between mRNA and amino acids. Across multiple multi-species datasets, it outperforms Euclidean baselines on 9 out of 10 tasks involving property prediction, with 10% improvement on average, and excels in out-of-distribution generalization to long and low-GC content sequences; for antibody region annotation, it surpasses hierarchy-aware Euclidean models by 3% in annotation accuracy. Our results highlight hyperbolic geometry as an effective inductive bias for hierarchical language modeling of mRNA sequences.

Abstract:
Gene enhancers control when and where genes switch on, yet their sequence diversity and tissue specificity make them hard to pinpoint in colorectal cancer. We take a sequence-only route and fine-tune DNABERT-2, a transformer genomic language model that uses byte-pair encoding to learn variable-length tokens from DNA. Using assays curated via the Johnston Cancer Research Centre at Queen's University Belfast, we assembled a balanced corpus of 2.34 million 1 kb enhancer sequences, applied summit-centered extraction and rigorous de-duplication including reverse-complement collapse, and split the data stratified by class. With a 4096-term vocabulary and a 232-token context chosen empirically, the DNABERT-2-117M classifier was trained with Optuna-tuned hyperparameters and evaluated on 350742 held-out sequences. The model reached PR-AUC 0.759, ROC-AUC 0.743, and best F1 0.704 at an optimized threshold (0.359), with recall 0.835 and precision 0.609. Against a CNN-based EnhancerNet trained on the same data, DNABERT-2 delivered stronger threshold-independent ranking and higher recall, although point accuracy was lower. To our knowledge, this is the first study to apply a second-generation genomic language model with BPE tokenization to enhancer classification in colorectal cancer, demonstrating the feasibility of capturing tumor-associated regulatory signals directly from DNA sequence alone. Overall, our results show that transformer-based genomic models can move beyond motif-level encodings toward holistic classification of regulatory elements, offering a novel path for cancer genomics. Next steps will focus on improving precision, exploring hybrid CNN-transformer designs, and validating across independent datasets to strengthen real-world utility.

Abstract:
Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) is a rapidly escalating global health crisis. While genomic sequencing enables rapid prediction of resistance phenotypes, current computational methods have limitations. Standard machine learning models treat the genome as an unordered collection of features, ignoring the sequential context of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs). State-of-the-art sequence models like Transformers are often too data-hungry and computationally expensive for the moderately-sized datasets that are typical in this domain. To address these challenges, we propose AMR-EnsembleNet, an ensemble framework that synergistically combines sequence-based and feature-based learning. We developed a lightweight, custom 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to efficiently learn predictive sequence motifs from high-dimensional SNP data. This sequence-aware model was ensembled with an XGBoost model, a powerful gradient boosting system adept at capturing complex, non-local feature interactions. We trained and evaluated our framework on a benchmark dataset of 809 E. coli strains, predicting resistance across four antibiotics with varying class imbalance. Our 1D CNN-XGBoost ensemble consistently achieved top-tier performance across all the antibiotics, reaching a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.926 for Ciprofloxacin (CIP) and the highest Macro F1-score of 0.691 for the challenging Gentamicin (GEN) AMR prediction. We also show that our model consistently focuses on SNPs within well-known AMR genes like fusA and parC, confirming it learns the correct genetic signals for resistance. Our work demonstrates that fusing a sequence-aware 1D CNN with a feature-based XGBoost model creates a powerful ensemble, overcoming the limitations of using either an order-agnostic or a standalone sequence model.

Abstract:
Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong ability in generating rich representations across domains such as natural language processing and generation, computer vision, and multimodal learning. However, their application in biomedical data analysis remains nascent. Single-cell transcriptomic profiling is essential for dissecting cell subtype diversity in development and disease, but rare subtypes pose challenges for scaling laws. We present a computational framework that integrates single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) with LLMs to derive knowledge-informed gene embeddings. Highly expressed genes for each cell are mapped to NCBI Gene descriptions and embedded using models such as text-embedding-ada-002, BioBERT, and SciBERT. Applied to retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), which differ in vulnerability to glaucoma-related neurodegeneration, this strategy improves subtype classification, highlights biologically significant features, and reveals pathways underlying selective neuronal vulnerability. More broadly, it illustrates how LLM-derived embeddings can augment biological analysis under data-limited conditions and lay the groundwork for future foundation models in single-cell biology.

Abstract:
Background: Structural variants (SVs) are genomic differences $\ge$50 bp in length. They remain challenging to detect even with long sequence reads, and the sources of these difficulties are not well quantified.   Results: We identified 35.4 Mb of low-complexity regions (LCRs) in GRCh38. Although these regions cover only 1.2% of the genome, they contain 69.1% of confident SVs in sample HG002. Across long-read SV callers, 77.3-91.3% of erroneous SV calls occur within LCRs, with error rates increasing with LCR length.   Conclusion: SVs are enriched and difficult to call in LCRs. Special care need to be taken for calling and analyzing these variants.

Abstract:
Polygenic risk scores can be used to model the individual genetic liability for human traits. Current methods primarily focus on modeling the mean of a phenotype neglecting the variance. However, genetic variants associated with phenotypic variance can provide important insights to gene-environment interaction studies. To overcome this, we propose snpboostlss, a cyclical gradient boosting algorithm for a Gaussian location-scale model to jointly derive sparse polygenic models for both the mean and the variance of a quantitative phenotype. To improve computational efficiency on high-dimensional and large-scale genotype data (large n and large p), we only consider a batch of most relevant variants in each boosting step. We investigate the effect of statins therapy (the environmental factor) on low-density lipoprotein in the UK Biobank cohort using the new snpboostlss algorithm. We are able to verify the interaction between statins usage and the polygenic risk scores for phenotypic variance in both cross sectional and longitudinal analyses. Particularly, following the spirit of target trial emulation, we observe that the treatment effect of statins is more substantial in people with higher polygenic risk scores for phenotypic variance, indicating gene-environment interaction. When applying to body mass index, the newly constructed polygenic risk scores for variance show significant interaction with physical activity and sedentary behavior. Therefore, the polygenic risk scores for phenotypic variance derived by snpboostlss have potential to identify individuals that could benefit more from environmental changes (e.g. medical intervention and lifestyle changes).

Abstract:
Recent advances in large language model (LLM) embeddings have enabled powerful representations for biological data, but most applications to date focus only on gene-level information. We present one of the first systematic frameworks to generate variant-level embeddings across the entire human genome. Using curated annotations from FAVOR, ClinVar, and the GWAS Catalog, we constructed semantic text descriptions for 8.9 billion possible variants and generated embeddings at three scales: 1.5 million HapMap3+MEGA variants, ~90 million imputed UK Biobank variants, and ~9 billion all possible variants. Embeddings were produced with both OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large and the open-source Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B models. Baseline experiments demonstrate high predictive accuracy for variant properties, validating the embeddings as structured representations of genomic variation. We outline two downstream applications: embedding-informed hypothesis testing by extending the Frequentist And Bayesian framework to genome-wide association studies, and embedding-augmented genetic risk prediction that enhances standard polygenic risk scores. These resources, publicly available on Hugging Face, provide a foundation for advancing large-scale genomic discovery and precision medicine.

Results show that SLMs combined with such agentic framework can achieve comparable and in many cases superior performance versus existing approaches utilising larger models, with our best model-agent combination achieving 98% accuracy on the GeneTuring benchmark. Notably, small 3-10B parameter models consistently achieve 85-97% accuracy while requiring much lower computational resources than conventional approaches. This demonstrates promising potential for efficiency gains, cost savings, and democratization of ML-powered genomics tools while retaining highly robust and accurate performance.

Title: Reverse-Complement Consistency for DNA Language Models

Abstract:
A fundamental property of DNA is that the reverse complement (RC) of a sequence often carries identical biological meaning. However, state-of-the-art DNA language models frequently fail to capture this symmetry, producing inconsistent predictions for a sequence and its RC counterpart, which undermines their reliability. In this work, we introduce Reverse-Complement Consistency Regularization (RCCR), a simple and model-agnostic fine-tuning objective that directly penalizes the divergence between a model's prediction on a sequence and the aligned prediction on its reverse complement. We evaluate RCCR across three diverse backbones (Nucleotide Transformer, HyenaDNA, DNABERT-2) on a wide range of genomic tasks, including sequence classification, scalar regression, and profile prediction. Our experiments show that RCCR substantially improves RC robustness by dramatically reducing prediction flips and errors, all while maintaining or improving task accuracy compared to baselines such as RC data augmentation and test-time averaging. By integrating a key biological prior directly into the learning process, RCCR produces a single, intrinsically robust, and computationally efficient model fine-tuning recipe for diverse biology tasks.

Abstract:
DNA language models have revolutionized our ability to understand and design DNA sequences--the fundamental language of life--with unprecedented precision, enabling transformative applications in therapeutics, synthetic biology, and gene editing. However, this capability also poses substantial dual-use risks, including the potential for creating pathogens, viruses, and even bioweapons. To address these biosecurity challenges, we introduce two innovative watermarking techniques to reliably track the designed DNA: DNAMark and CentralMark. DNAMark employs synonymous codon substitutions to embed watermarks in DNA sequences while preserving the original function. CentralMark further advances this by creating inheritable watermarks that transfer from DNA to translated proteins, leveraging protein embeddings to ensure detection across the central dogma. Both methods utilize semantic embeddings to generate watermark logits, enhancing robustness against natural mutations, synthesis errors, and adversarial attacks. Evaluated on our therapeutic DNA benchmark, DNAMark and CentralMark achieve F1 detection scores above 0.85 under various conditions, while maintaining over 60% sequence similarity to ground truth and degeneracy scores below 15%. A case study on the CRISPR-Cas9 system underscores CentralMark's utility in real-world settings. This work establishes a vital framework for securing DNA language models, balancing innovation with accountability to mitigate biosecurity risks.

Abstract:
Data visualization is a fundamental tool in genomics research, enabling the exploration, interpretation, and communication of complex genomic features. While machine learning models show promise for transforming data into insightful visualizations, current models lack the training foundation for domain-specific tasks. In an effort to provide a foundational resource for genomics-focused model training, we present a framework for generating a dataset that pairs abstract, low-level questions about genomics data with corresponding visualizations. Building on prior work with statistical plots, our approach adapts to the complexity of genomics data and the specialized representations used to depict them. We further incorporate multiple linked queries and visualizations, along with justifications for design choices, figure captions, and image alt-texts for each item in the dataset. We use genomics data retrieved from three distinct genomics data repositories (4DN, ENCODE, Chromoscope) to produce GQVis: a dataset consisting of 1.14 million single-query data points, 628k query pairs, and 589k query chains. The GQVis dataset and generation code are available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/HIDIVE/GQVis and https://github.com/hms-dbmi/GQVis-Generation.

Abstract:
Small interfering RNA (siRNA) is a short double-stranded RNA molecule (about 21-23 nucleotides) with the potential to cure diseases by silencing the function of target genes. Due to its well-understood mechanism, many siRNA-based drugs have been evaluated in clinical trials. However, selecting effective binding regions and designing siRNA sequences requires extensive experimentation, making the process costly. As genomic resources and publicly available siRNA datasets continue to grow, data-driven models can be leveraged to better understand siRNA-mRNA interactions. To fully exploit such data, curating high-quality siRNA datasets is essential to minimize experimental errors and noise. We propose siDPT: siRNA efficacy Prediction via Debiased Preference-Pair Transformer, a framework that constructs a preference-pair dataset and designs an siRNA-mRNA interactive transformer with debiased ranking objectives to improve siRNA inhibition prediction and generalization. We evaluate our approach using two public datasets and one newly collected patent dataset. Our model demonstrates substantial improvement in Pearson correlation and strong performance across other metrics.

Abstract:
Understanding disease similarity is critical for advancing diagnostics, drug discovery, and personalized treatment strategies. We present PhenoGnet, a novel graph-based contrastive learning framework designed to predict disease similarity by integrating gene functional interaction networks with the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO). PhenoGnet comprises two key components: an intra-view model that separately encodes gene and phenotype graphs using Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and Graph Attention Networks (GATs), and a cross view model implemented as a shared weight multilayer perceptron (MLP) that aligns gene and phenotype embeddings through contrastive learning. The model is trained using known gene phenotype associations as positive pairs and randomly sampled unrelated pairs as negatives. Diseases are represented by the mean embeddings of their associated genes and/or phenotypes, and pairwise similarity is computed via cosine similarity. Evaluation on a curated benchmark of 1,100 similar and 866 dissimilar disease pairs demonstrates strong performance, with gene based embeddings achieving an AUCPR of 0.9012 and AUROC of 0.8764, outperforming existing state of the art methods. Notably, PhenoGnet captures latent biological relationships beyond direct overlap, offering a scalable and interpretable solution for disease similarity prediction. These results underscore its potential for enabling downstream applications in rare disease research and precision medicine.

Abstract:
Sequencing of PCR amplicons generated using degenerate primers (typically targeting a region of the 16S ribosomal gene) is widely used in metagenomics to profile the taxonomic composition of complex microbial samples. To reduce taxonomic biases in primer selection it is important to conduct in silico PCR analyses of the primers against large collections of up to millions of bacterial genomes. However, existing in silico PCR tools have impractical running time for analyses of this scale. In this paper we introduce AmpliconHunter, a highly scalable in silico PCR package distributed as open-source command-line tool and publicly available through a user-friendly web interface at https://ah1.engr.uconn.edu/. AmpliconHunter implements an accurate nearest-neighbor model for melting temperature calculations, allowing for primer-template hybridization with mismatches, along with three complementary methods for estimating off-target amplification. By taking advantage of multi-core parallelism and SIMD operations available on modern CPUs, the AmpliconHunter web server can complete in silico PCR analyses of commonly used degenerate primer pairs against the 2.4M genomes in the latest AllTheBacteria collection in as few as 6-7 hours.

Abstract:
TRPM4 is overexpressed in prostate cancer (PCa) associated with metastasis or recurrence. There is paucity of information pertaining to TRPM4 characterization and functions at single-cell level in PCa. This study introduces the CEP-IP framework, a novel explainable machine learning approach for the identification of biologically relevant cell subpopulations in single-cell transcriptomics of pairwise genes. The framework combines cell explanatory power (CEP) classification with inflection point (IP) analysis to assign model performance into individual cells, while stratifying transcriptional space into distinct regions. To demonstrate the CEP-IP framework, generalized additive model (GAM) was applied to model relationships between TRPM4 and co-expressed genes in aggressive PCa and benign prostate cells from scRNA-seq data. Genes were identified using Spearman-Kendall dual-filter. Seven ribosomal genes (RPL10, RPL27, RPL28, RPS2, RPS8, RPS12, RPS26; averaged as Ribo gene set) passed dual-filtering specifically in PCa cells. TRPM4-Ribo modeling outperformed alternative cancer gene sets (deviance explained FDR<0.05). The CEP-IP framework identified top-ranked explanatory power (TREP) cells and stratified them using IP analysis into pre-IP and post-IP regions, creating four distinct cell subpopulations per patient. Gene Ontology analysis revealed pre-IP TREP cells enriched for immune-related processes, while post-IP TREP cells enriched for ribosomal, translation, and cell adhesion pathways. In conclusion, the explainable CEP-IP framework allows for the identification of cancer cell subpopulations with distinctive biology and therapeutic implications, applicable to any pairwise gene analysis.

Abstract:
We introduce Genome-Factory, an integrated Python library for tuning, deploying, and interpreting genomic models. Our core contribution is to simplify and unify the workflow for genomic model development: data collection, model tuning, inference, benchmarking, and interpretability. For data collection, Genome-Factory offers an automated pipeline to download genomic sequences and preprocess them. It also includes quality control, such as GC content normalization. For model tuning, Genome-Factory supports three approaches: full-parameter, low-rank adaptation, and adapter-based fine-tuning. It is compatible with a wide range of genomic models. For inference, Genome-Factory enables both embedding extraction and DNA sequence generation. For benchmarking, we include two existing benchmarks and provide a flexible interface for users to incorporate additional benchmarks. For interpretability, Genome-Factory introduces the first open-source biological interpreter based on a sparse auto-encoder. This module disentangles embeddings into sparse, near-monosemantic latent units and links them to interpretable genomic features by regressing on external readouts. To improve accessibility, Genome-Factory features both a zero-code command-line interface and a user-friendly web interface. We validate the utility of Genome-Factory across three dimensions: (i) Compatibility with diverse models and fine-tuning methods; (ii) Benchmarking downstream performance using two open-source benchmarks; (iii) Biological interpretation of learned representations with DNABERT-2. These results highlight its end-to-end usability and practical value for real-world genomic analysis.

Abstract:
We introduce a unified framework for evaluating dimensionality reduction techniques in spatial transcriptomics beyond standard PCA approaches. We benchmark six methods PCA, NMF, autoencoder, VAE, and two hybrid embeddings on a cholangiocarcinoma Xenium dataset, systematically varying latent dimensions ($k$=5-40) and clustering resolutions ($ρ$=0.1-1.2). Each configuration is evaluated using complementary metrics including reconstruction error, explained variance, cluster cohesion, and two novel biologically-motivated measures: Cluster Marker Coherence (CMC) and Marker Exclusion Rate (MER). Our results demonstrate distinct performance profiles: PCA provides a fast baseline, NMF maximizes marker enrichment, VAE balances reconstruction and interpretability, while autoencoders occupy a middle ground. We provide systematic hyperparameter selection using Pareto optimal analysis and demonstrate how MER-guided reassignment improves biological fidelity across all methods, with CMC scores improving by up to 12\% on average. This framework enables principled selection of dimensionality reduction methods tailored to specific spatial transcriptomics analyses.

Abstract:
Differentiating between the two main subtypes of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD): Crohns disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) is a persistent clinical challenge due to overlapping presentations. This study introduces a novel computational framework that employs spatial transcriptomics (ST) to create an explainable machine learning model for IBD classification. We analyzed ST data from the colonic mucosa of healthy controls (HC), UC, and CD patients. Using Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), we first identified four recurring cellular niches, representing distinct functional microenvironments within the tissue. From these niches, we systematically engineered 44 features capturing three key aspects of tissue pathology: niche composition, neighborhood enrichment, and niche-gene signals. A multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier trained on these features achieved an accuracy of 0.774 +/- 0.161 for the more challenging three-class problem (HC, UC, and CD) and 0.916 +/- 0.118 in the two-class problem of distinguishing IBD from healthy tissue. Crucially, model explainability analysis revealed that disruptions in the spatial organization of niches were the strongest predictors of general inflammation, while the classification between UC and CD relied on specific niche-gene expression signatures. This work provides a robust, proof-of-concept pipeline that transforms descriptive spatial data into an accurate and explainable predictive tool, offering not only a potential new diagnostic paradigm but also deeper insights into the distinct biological mechanisms that drive IBD subtypes.

Abstract:
The gene set analysis (GSA) is a foundational approach for uncovering the molecular functions associated with a group of genes. Recently, LLM-powered methods have emerged to annotate gene sets with biological functions together with coherent explanatory insights. However, existing studies primarily focus on proprietary models, which have been shown to outperform their open-source counterparts despite concerns over cost and data privacy. Furthermore, no research has investigated the application of advanced reasoning strategies to the GSA task. To address this gap, we introduce Gene-R1, a data-augmented learning framework that equips lightweight and open-source LLMs with step-by-step reasoning capabilities tailored to GSA. Experiments on 1,508 in-distribution gene sets demonstrate that Gene-R1 achieves substantial performance gains, matching commercial LLMs. On 106 out-of-distribution gene sets, Gene-R1 performs comparably to both commercial and large-scale LLMs, exhibiting robust generalizability across diverse gene sources.

Motivation: Low-complexity (LC) DNA sequences are compositionally repetitive sequences that are often associated with spurious homologous matches and variant calling artifacts. While algorithms for identifying LC sequences exist, they either do not define complexity mathematically or are inefficient with long or variable context windows.   Results: Longdust is a new algorithm that efficiently identifies long LC sequences including centromeric satellite and tandem repeats with moderately long motifs. It defines string complexity by statistically modeling the k-mer count distribution with the parameters: the k-mer length, the context window size and a threshold on complexity. Longdust exhibits high performance on real data and high consistency with existing methods.   Availability and implementation: https://github.com/lh3/longdust

Abstract:
As synthetic genomics scales toward the construction of increasingly larger genomes, computational strategies are needed to address technical feasibility. We introduce an algorithmic framework for the Minimum-Cost Synthetic Genome Planning problem, aiming to identify the most cost-effective strategy to assemble a target genome from a source genome through a combination of reuse, synthesis, and join operations. By comparing dynamic programming and greedy heuristic strategies under diverse cost regimes, we demonstrate how algorithmic choices influence the cost-efficiency of large-scale genome construction. In parallel, solving the Minimum-Cost Synthetic Genome Planning problem can help us better understand genome architecture and evolution. We applied our framework in case studies on viral genomes, including SARS-CoV-2, to examine how source-target genome similarity shapes construction costs. Our analyses revealed that conserved regions such as ORF1ab can be reconstructed cost-effectively from related templates, while highly variable regions such as the S (spike) gene are more reliant on DNA synthesis, highlighting the biological and economic trade-offs of genome design.

Abstract:
The frequency distributions of DNA k-mers are shaped by fundamental biological processes and offer a window into genome structure and evolution. Inspired by analogies to natural language, prior studies have attempted to model genomic k-mer usage using Zipf's law, a rank-frequency law originally formulated for words in human language. However, the extent to which this law accurately captures the distribution of k-mers across diverse species remains unclear. Here, we systematically analyze k-mer frequency spectra across more than 225,000 genome assemblies spanning all three domains of life and viruses. We demonstrate that Zipf's law consistently underperforms in modeling k-mer distributions. In contrast, we propose the truncated power law and Zipf-Mandelbrot distributions, which provide substantially improved fits across taxonomic groups. We show that genome size and GC content influence model performance, with larger and GC-content imbalanced genomes yielding better adherence. Additionally, we perform an extensive analysis on vocabulary expansion and exhaustion across the same organisms using Heaps' law. We apply our modeling framework to evaluate simulated genomes generated by k-let preserving shuffling and deep generative language models. Our results reveal substantial differences between organismal genomes and their synthetic or shuffled counterparts, offering a novel approach to benchmark the biological plausibility of artificial genomes. Collectively, this work establishes new standards for modeling genomic k-mer distributions and provides insights relevant to synthetic biology, and evolutionary sequence analysis.

Abstract:
Prediction of patient survival using high-dimensional multi-omics data requires systematic feature selection methods that ensure predictive performance, sparsity, and reliability for prognostic biomarker discovery. We developed a hybrid ensemble feature selection (hEFS) approach that combines data subsampling with multiple prognostic models, integrating both embedded and wrapper-based strategies for survival prediction. Omics features are ranked using a voting-theory-inspired aggregation mechanism across models and subsamples, while the optimal number of features is selected via a Pareto front, balancing predictive accuracy and model sparsity without any user-defined thresholds. When applied to multi-omics datasets from three pancreatic cancer cohorts, hEFS identifies significantly fewer and more stable biomarkers compared to the conventional, late-fusion CoxLasso models, while maintaining comparable discrimination performance. Implemented within the open-source mlr3fselect R package, hEFS offers a robust, interpretable, and clinically valuable tool for prognostic modelling and biomarker discovery in high-dimensional survival settings.

Abstract:
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides unprecedented insights into cellular heterogeneity, enabling detailed analysis of complex biological systems at single-cell resolution. However, the high dimensionality and technical noise inherent in scRNA-seq data pose significant analytical challenges. While current embedding methods focus primarily on gene expression levels, they often overlook crucial gene-gene interactions that govern cellular identity and function. To address this limitation, we present a novel embedding approach that integrates both gene expression profiles and data-driven gene-gene interactions. Our method first constructs a Cell-Leaf Graph (CLG) using random forest models to capture regulatory relationships between genes, while simultaneously building a K-Nearest Neighbor Graph (KNNG) to represent expression similarities between cells. These graphs are then combined into an Enriched Cell-Leaf Graph (ECLG), which serves as input for a graph neural network to compute cell embeddings. By incorporating both expression levels and gene-gene interactions, our approach provides a more comprehensive representation of cellular states. Extensive evaluation across multiple datasets demonstrates that our method enhances the detection of rare cell populations and improves downstream analyses such as visualization, clustering, and trajectory inference. This integrated approach represents a significant advance in single-cell data analysis, offering a more complete framework for understanding cellular diversity and dynamics.

Abstract:
Single-cell technologies provide an unprecedented opportunity for dissecting the interplay between the cancer cells and the associated tumor microenvironment, and the produced high-dimensional omics data should also augment existing survival modeling approaches for identifying tumor cell type-specific genes predictive of cancer patient survival. However, there is no statistical model to integrate multiscale data including individual-level survival data, multicellular-level cell composition data and cellular-level single-cell omics covariates. We propose a class of Bayesian generalized promotion time cure models (GPTCMs) for the multiscale data integration to identify cell-type-specific genes and improve cancer prognosis. We demonstrate with simulations in both low- and high-dimensional settings that the proposed Bayesian GPTCMs are able to identify cell-type-associated covariates and improve survival prediction.

Abstract:
Understanding the modular structure and central elements of complex biological networks is critical for uncovering system-level mechanisms in disease. Here, we constructed weighted gene co-expression networks from bulk RNA-seq data of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovial tissue, using pairwise correlation and a percolation-guided thresholding strategy. Community detection with Louvain and Leiden algorithms revealed robust modules, and node-strength ranking identified the top 50 hub genes globally and within communities. To assess novelty, we integrated genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with literature-based evidence from PubMed, highlighting five high-centrality genes with little to no prior RA-specific association. Functional enrichment confirmed their roles in immune-related processes, including adaptive immune response and lymphocyte regulation. Notably, these hubs showed strong positive correlations with T- and B-cell markers and negative correlations with NK-cell markers, consistent with RA immunopathology. Overall, our framework demonstrates how correlation-based network construction, modularity-driven clustering, and centrality-guided novelty scoring can jointly reveal informative structure in omics-scale data. This generalizable approach offers a scalable path to gene prioritization in RA and other autoimmune conditions.

Abstract:
Accurate prediction of virus-host interactions is critical for understanding viral ecology and developing applications like phage therapy. However, the growing number of computational tools has created a complex landscape, making direct performance comparison challenging due to inconsistent benchmarks and varying usability. Here, we provide a systematic review and a rigorous benchmark of 27 virus-host prediction tools. We formulate the host prediction task into two primary frameworks, link prediction and multi-class classification, and construct two benchmark datasets to evaluate tool performance in distinct scenarios: a database-centric dataset (RefSeq-VHDB) and a metagenomic discovery dataset (MetaHiC-VHDB). Our results reveal that no single tool is universally optimal. Performance is highly context-dependent, with tools like CHERRY and iPHoP demonstrating robust, broad applicability, while others, such as RaFAH and PHIST, excel in specific contexts. We further identify a critical trade-off between predictive accuracy, prediction rate, and computational cost. This work serves as a practical guide for researchers and establishes a standardized benchmark to drive future innovation in deciphering complex virus-host interactions.

Generative modeling of discrete variables is challenging yet crucial for applications in natural language processing and biological sequence design. We introduce the Shortlisting Model (SLM), a novel simplex-based diffusion model inspired by progressive candidate pruning. SLM operates on simplex centroids, reducing generation complexity and enhancing scalability. Additionally, SLM incorporates a flexible implementation of classifier-free guidance, enhancing unconditional generation performance. Extensive experiments on DNA promoter and enhancer design, protein design, character-level and large-vocabulary language modeling demonstrate the competitive performance and strong potential of SLM.

Abstract:
Single-cell multi-omics data contain huge information of cellular states, and analyzing these data can reveal valuable insights into cellular heterogeneity, diseases, and biological processes. However, as cell differentiation \& development is a continuous and dynamic process, it remains challenging to computationally model and infer cell interaction patterns based on single-cell multi-omics data. This paper presents scI2CL, a new single-cell multi-omics fusion framework based on intra- and inter-omics contrastive learning, to learn comprehensive and discriminative cellular representations from complementary multi-omics data for various downstream tasks. Extensive experiments of four downstream tasks validate the effectiveness of scI2CL and its superiority over existing peers. Concretely, in cell clustering, scI2CL surpasses eight state-of-the-art methods on four widely-used real-world datasets. In cell subtyping, scI2CL effectively distinguishes three latent monocyte cell subpopulations, which are not discovered by existing methods. Simultaneously, scI2CL is the only method that correctly constructs the cell developmental trajectory from hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells to Memory B cells. In addition, scI2CL resolves the misclassification of cell types between two subpopulations of CD4+ T cells, while existing methods fail to precisely distinguish the mixed cells. In summary, scI2CL can accurately characterize cross-omics relationships among cells, thus effectively fuses multi-omics data and learns discriminative cellular representations to support various downstream analysis tasks.

Abstract:
Understanding which genes control which traits in an organism remains one of the central challenges in biology. Despite significant advances in data collection technology, our ability to map genes to traits is still limited. This genome-to-phenome (G2P) challenge spans several problem domains, including plant breeding, and requires models capable of reasoning over high-dimensional, heterogeneous, and biologically structured data. Currently, however, many datasets solely capture genetic information or solely capture phenotype information. Additionally, phenotype data is very heterogeneous, which many datasets do not fully capture. The critical drawback is that these datasets are not integrated, that is, they do not link with each other to describe the same biological specimens. This limits machine learning models' ability to be informed on the various aspects of these specimens, impacting the breadth of correlations learned, and therefore their ability to make more accurate predictions. To address this gap, we present the Arabidopsis Genomics-Phenomics (AGP) Dataset, a curated multi-modal dataset linking gene expression profiles with phenotypic trait measurements in Arabidopsis thaliana, a model organism in plant biology. AGP supports tasks such as phenotype prediction and interpretable graph learning. In addition, we benchmark conventional regression and explanatory baselines, including a biologically-informed hypergraph baseline, to validate gene-trait associations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first dataset that provides multi-modal gene information and heterogeneous trait or phenotype data for the same Arabidopsis thaliana specimens. With AGP, we aim to foster the research community towards accurately understanding the connection between genotypes and phenotypes using gene information, higher-order gene pairings, and trait data from several sources.

Abstract:
Variations in complex traits are influenced by multiple genetic variants, environmental risk factors, and their interactions. Though substantial progress has been made in identifying single genetic variants associated with complex traits, detecting the gene-gene and gene-environment interactions remains a great challenge. When a large number of genetic variants and environmental risk factors are involved, searching for interactions is limited to pair-wise interactions due to the exponentially increased feature space and computational intensity. Alternatively, recursive partitioning approaches, such as random forests, have gained popularity in high-dimensional genetic association studies. In this article, we propose a U-Statistic-based random forest approach, referred to as Forest U-Test, for genetic association studies with quantitative traits. Through simulation studies, we showed that the Forest U-Test outperformed existing methods. The proposed method was also applied to study Cannabis Dependence CD, using three independent datasets from the Study of Addiction: Genetics and Environment. A significant joint association was detected with an empirical p-value less than 0.001. The finding was also replicated in two independent datasets with p-values of 5.93e-19 and 4.70e-17, respectively.

Abstract:
Objective: To investigate the mechanism by which quercetin inhibits triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) through regulating T-cell-related targets, providing a novel strategy for TNBC immunotherapy.Methods: Single-cell RNA sequencing (GSE161529 dataset) and network pharmacology were integrated. PCA and UMAP clustering identified T-cell subsets and differentially expressed genes in TNBC microenvironment. TNBC-related targets were screened via CTD and OMIM databases, with functional pathways analyzed by GO/KEGG enrichment. Molecular docking and PPI networks validated interactions between quercetin and core targets.Results: Quercetin intersected with 79 TNBC targets, including AKT1, EGFR, and MMP9, enriched in EGFR inhibitor resistance and endocrine resistance pathways. Molecular docking revealed the highest affinity between quercetin and GSK3B (-13.2 kJ/mol). AKT1 and MMP9 expression correlated with patient survival.Conclusion: Quercetin may reverse TNBC immunosuppression by multi-target modulation of T-cell function, but clinical application requires solutions for its low bioavailability, such as delivery systems or combination therapies.

Abstract:
The surge in multimodal single-cell omics data exposes limitations in traditional, manually defined analysis workflows. AI agents offer a paradigm shift, enabling adaptive planning, executable code generation, traceable decisions, and real-time knowledge fusion. However, the lack of a comprehensive benchmark critically hinders progress. We introduce a novel benchmarking evaluation system to rigorously assess agent capabilities in single-cell omics analysis. This system comprises: a unified platform compatible with diverse agent frameworks and LLMs; multidimensional metrics assessing cognitive program synthesis, collaboration, execution efficiency, bioinformatics knowledge integration, and task completion quality; and 50 diverse real-world single-cell omics analysis tasks spanning multi-omics, species, and sequencing technologies. Our evaluation reveals that Grok-3-beta achieves state-of-the-art performance among tested agent frameworks. Multi-agent frameworks significantly enhance collaboration and execution efficiency over single-agent approaches through specialized role division. Attribution analyses of agent capabilities identify that high-quality code generation is crucial for task success, and self-reflection has the most significant overall impact, followed by retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and planning. This work highlights persistent challenges in code generation, long-context handling, and context-aware knowledge retrieval, providing a critical empirical foundation and best practices for developing robust AI agents in computational biology.

Abstract:
Pre-training large language models on genomic sequences is a powerful approach for learning biologically meaningful representations. Masked language modeling (MLM) methods, such as DNABERT and Nucleotide Transformer (NT), achieve strong performance but suffer from partial token supervision, pre-training/fine-tuning mismatches, and high computational costs. We introduce NucEL, the first ELECTRA-style pre-training framework for genomic foundation models, addressing these limitations. Using a discriminator to identify tokens altered by a generator, NucEL provides comprehensive token-level supervision across all sequence positions, improving efficiency over the partial supervision of MLM. Incorporating ModernBERT's hybrid local-global attention and flash attention, NucEL offers an optimized BERT architecture for genomic modeling. Unlike 6-mer tokenization, NucEL uses single-nucleotide tokens for fine-grained resolution, boosting both efficiency and interpretability. Pre-trained on the human genome, NucEL achieves state-of-the-art results on diverse downstream tasks -- regulatory element identification (e.g., promoters, enhancers), transcription factor binding prediction, open chromatin classification, and histone modification profiling -- surpassing similarly sized MLM-based models and rivaling models 25x larger, such as NT. Ablation studies highlight optimal tokenization and masking strategies for ELECTRA-style DNA pre-training. Attention analysis reveals NucEL's superior capture of biologically relevant motifs compared to NT, providing insights into hierarchical learning and regulatory element modeling. These findings demonstrate ELECTRA-style pre-training as an efficient, effective strategy for genomic representation learning with broad implications for genomic research.

Abstract:
A fundamental limitation of probabilistic deep learning is its predominant reliance on Gaussian priors. This simplistic assumption prevents models from accurately capturing the complex, non-Gaussian landscapes of natural data, particularly in demanding domains like complex biological data, severely hindering the fidelity of the model for scientific discovery. The physically-grounded Boltzmann distribution offers a more expressive alternative, but it is computationally intractable on classical computers. To date, quantum approaches have been hampered by the insufficient qubit scale and operational stability required for the iterative demands of deep learning. Here, we bridge this gap by introducing the Quantum Boltzmann Machine-Variational Autoencoder (QBM-VAE), a large-scale and long-time stable hybrid quantum-classical architecture. Our framework leverages a quantum processor for efficient sampling from the Boltzmann distribution, enabling its use as a powerful prior within a deep generative model. Applied to million-scale single-cell datasets from multiple sources, the QBM-VAE generates a latent space that better preserves complex biological structures, consistently outperforming conventional Gaussian-based deep learning models like VAE and SCVI in essential tasks such as omics data integration, cell-type classification, and trajectory inference. It also provides a typical example of introducing a physics priori into deep learning to drive the model to acquire scientific discovery capabilities that breaks through data limitations. This work provides the demonstration of a practical quantum advantage in deep learning on a large-scale scientific problem and offers a transferable blueprint for developing hybrid quantum AI models.

Abstract:
Motivation: Recent advances in single-cell analysis have introduced new computational challenges. Researchers often need to use multiple analysis tools written in different programming languages while managing version conflicts between related packages within a single workflow. For the research community, minimizing the time spent on environment setup and installation issues is essential. Results: We present ShortCake, a containerized platform that integrates a suite of single-cell analysis tools written in R and Python. ShortCake isolates competing Python tools into separate virtual environments that can be easily accessed within a Jupyter notebook. This enables users to effortlessly transition between various environments, including R, even within a single notebook. Additionally, ShortCake offers multiple ``flavors,'' enabling users to select container images tailored to their specific needs. ShortCake provides a unified environment with fixed versions of various tools, thus streamlining workflows, reducing setup time, and improving reproducibility. Availability and implementation: The ShortCake image is available on DockerHub (https://hub.docker.com/r/rnakato/shortcake).

Abstract:
Deep generative models open new avenues for simulating realistic genomic data while preserving privacy and addressing data accessibility constraints. While previous studies have primarily focused on generating gene expression or haplotype data, this study explores generating genotype data in both unconditioned and phenotype-conditioned settings, which is inherently more challenging due to the discrete nature of genotype data. In this work, we developed and evaluated commonly used generative models, including Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Diffusion Models, and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and proposed adaptation tailored to discrete genotype data. We conducted extensive experiments on large-scale datasets, including all chromosomes from cow and multiple chromosomes from human. Model performance was assessed using a well-established set of metrics drawn from both deep learning and quantitative genetics literature. Our results show that these models can effectively capture genetic patterns and preserve genotype-phenotype association. Our findings provide a comprehensive comparison of these models and offer practical guidelines for future research in genotype simulation. We have made our code publicly available at https://github.com/SihanXXX/DiscreteGenoGen.

Abstract:
Integrating multi-omics data, such as DNA methylation, mRNA expression, and microRNA (miRNA) expression, offers a comprehensive view of the biological mechanisms underlying disease. However, the high dimensionality and complex interactions among omics layers present major challenges for predictive modeling. We propose Multi-Omics integration with Tree-generated Graph Neural Network (MOTGNN), a novel and interpretable framework for binary disease classification. MOTGNN employs eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) to perform omics-specific supervised graph construction, followed by modality-specific Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for hierarchical representation learning, and a deep feedforward network for cross-omics integration. On three real-world disease datasets, MOTGNN outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 5-10% in accuracy, ROC-AUC, and F1-score, and remains robust to severe class imbalance (e.g., 87.2% vs. 33.4% F1 on imbalanced data). The model maintains computational efficiency through sparse graphs (2.1-2.8 edges per node) and provides built-in interpretability, revealing both top-ranked biomarkers and the relative contributions of each omics modality. These results highlight MOTGNN's potential to improve both predictive accuracy and interpretability in multi-omics disease modeling.

Abstract:
MicroRNAs (miRs) are robust regulators of gene expression, implicated in most biological processes. microRNAs predominantly downregulate the expression of genes post-transcriptionally and each miR is predicted to target several hundred genes. The accurate identification and annotation of miR-mRNA target interactions is central to understanding miRs function and their therapeutic potential. However, computational target prediction is challenging due to imperfect complementarity of miRs with their targets and the growing volume and heterogeneity of experimental data present challenges in accessing, integrating, and analysing miR-target interaction information across biological contexts. This creates a need for integrated resources and intelligent query tools.   We present the miRKat Suite, comprising miRKatDB, a comprehensive, curated database of predicted and validated miR-target interactions and associated annotations, and miRKatAI, a multi-agent system powered by large language models (LLMs) and LangGraph. miRKatDB integrates data from multiple publicly available sources, providing a comprehensive foundation for miR studies, including miR target genes and changes in levels of tissue expression previously reported. miRKatAI offers a natural language interface for complex querying of miRKatDB, facilitates grounded information retrieval from established sources in the field, and supports basic data visualisation. The miRKat Suite aims to accelerate miR research by streamlining data access, enhancing exploratory analysis, and supporting hypothesis generation.

Abstract:
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) prediction remains a tremendous challenge due to its multifactorial etiology and global burden of morbidity and mortality. Despite the growing availability of genomic and electrophysiological data, extracting biologically meaningful insights from such high-dimensional, noisy, and sparsely annotated datasets remains a non-trivial task. Recently, LLMs has been applied effectively to predict structural variations in biological sequences. In this work, we explore the potential of fine-tuned LLMs to predict cardiac diseases and SNPs potentially leading to CVD risk using genetic markers derived from high-throughput genomic profiling. We investigate the effect of genetic patterns associated with cardiac conditions and evaluate how LLMs can learn latent biological relationships from structured and semi-structured genomic data obtained by mapping genetic aspects that are inherited from the family tree. By framing the problem as a Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning task, the models are prompted to generate disease labels and articulate informed clinical deductions across diverse patient profiles and phenotypes. The findings highlight the promise of LLMs in contributing to early detection, risk assessment, and ultimately, the advancement of personalized medicine in cardiac care.

Abstract:
The complexity of modern bioinformatics analysis has created a critical gap between data generation and developing scientific insights. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in scientific reasoning, they remain fundamentally limited when dealing with real-world analytical workflows that demand iterative computation, tool integration and rigorous validation. We introduce K-Dense Analyst, a hierarchical multi-agent system that achieves autonomous bioinformatics analysis through a dual-loop architecture. K-Dense Analyst, part of the broader K-Dense platform, couples planning with validated execution using specialized agents to decompose complex objectives into executable, verifiable tasks within secure computational environments. On BixBench, a comprehensive benchmark for open-ended biological analysis, K-Dense Analyst achieves 29.2% accuracy, surpassing the best-performing language model (GPT-5) by 6.3 percentage points, representing nearly 27% improvement over what is widely considered the most powerful LLM available. Remarkably, K-Dense Analyst achieves this performance using Gemini 2.5 Pro, which attains only 18.3% accuracy when used directly, demonstrating that our architectural innovations unlock capabilities far beyond the underlying model's baseline performance. Our insights demonstrate that autonomous scientific reasoning requires more than enhanced language models, it demands purpose-built systems that can bridge the gap between high-level scientific objectives and low-level computational execution. These results represent a significant advance toward fully autonomous computational biologists capable of accelerating discovery across the life sciences.

Abstract:
Understanding gene perturbation effects across diverse cellular contexts is a central challenge in functional genomics, with important implications for therapeutic discovery and precision medicine. Single-cell technologies enable high-resolution measurement of transcriptional responses, but collecting such data is costly and time-consuming, especially when repeated for each cell type. Existing computational methods often require separate models per cell type, limiting scalability and generalization. We present CFM-GP, a method for cell type-agnostic gene perturbation prediction. CFM-GP learns a continuous, time-dependent transformation between unperturbed and perturbed gene expression distributions, conditioned on cell type, allowing a single model to predict across all cell types. Unlike prior approaches that use discrete modeling, CFM-GP employs a flow matching objective to capture perturbation dynamics in a scalable manner. We evaluate on five datasets: SARS-CoV-2 infection, IFN-beta stimulated PBMCs, glioblastoma treated with Panobinostat, lupus under IFN-beta stimulation, and Statefate progenitor fate mapping. CFM-GP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in R-squared and Spearman correlation, and pathway enrichment analysis confirms recovery of key biological pathways. These results demonstrate the robustness and biological fidelity of CFM-GP as a scalable solution for cross-cell type gene perturbation prediction.

Abstract:
Large pre-trained DNA language models such as DNABERT-2, Nucleotide Transformer, and HyenaDNA have demonstrated strong performance on various genomic benchmarks. However, most applications rely on expensive fine-tuning, which works best when the training and test data share a similar distribution. In this work, we investigate whether task-specific fine-tuning is always necessary. We show that simple embedding-based pipelines that extract fixed representations from these models and feed them into lightweight classifiers can achieve competitive performance. In evaluation settings with different data distributions, embedding-based methods often outperform fine-tuning while reducing inference time by 10x to 20x. Our results suggest that embedding extraction is not only a strong baseline but also a more generalizable and efficient alternative to fine-tuning, especially for deployment in diverse or unseen genomic contexts. For example, in enhancer classification, HyenaDNA embeddings combined with zCurve achieve 0.68 accuracy (vs. 0.58 for fine-tuning), with an 88% reduction in inference time and over 8x lower carbon emissions (0.02 kg vs. 0.17 kg CO2). In non-TATA promoter classification, DNABERT-2 embeddings with zCurve or GC content reach 0.85 accuracy (vs. 0.89 with fine-tuning) with a 22x lower carbon footprint (0.02 kg vs. 0.44 kg CO2). These results show that embedding-based pipelines offer over 10x better carbon efficiency while maintaining strong predictive performance.

Abstract:
microRNA are pivotal post-transcriptional regulators whose single-cell behavior has remained largely inaccessible owing to technical barriers in single-cell small-RNA profiling. We present SiCmiR, a two-layer neural network that predicts miRNA expression profile from only 977 LINCS L1000 landmark genes reducing sensitivity to dropout of single-cell RNA-seq data. Proof-of-concept analyses illustrate how SiCmiR can uncover candidate hub-miRNAs in bulk-seq cell lines and hepatocellular carcinoma, scRNA-seq pancreatic ductal carcinoma and ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma and extracellular-vesicle-mediated crosstalk in glioblastoma. Trained on 6462 TCGA paired miRNA-mRNA samples, SiCmiR attains state-of-the-art accuracy on held-out cancers and generalizes to unseen cancer types, drug perturbations and scRNA-seq. We next constructed SiCmiR-Atlas, containing 632 public datasets, 9.36 million cells, 726 cell types, which is the first dedicated database of single-cell mature miRNA expression--providing interactive visualization, biomarker identification and cell-type-resolved miRNA-target networks. SiCmiR transforms bulk-derived statistical power into a single-cell view of miRNA biology and provides a community resource SiCmiR Atlas for biomarker discovery.

Abstract:
Cell type annotation is a fundamental step in the analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. In practice, human experts often rely on the structure revealed by principal component analysis (PCA) followed by $k$-nearest neighbor ($k$-NN) graph construction to guide annotation. While effective, this process is labor-intensive and does not scale to large datasets. Recent advances in CLIP-style models offer a promising path toward automating cell type annotation. By aligning scRNA-seq profiles with natural language descriptions, models like LangCell enable zero-shot annotation. While LangCell demonstrates decent zero-shot performance, its predictions remain suboptimal, particularly in achieving consistent accuracy across all cell types. In this paper, we propose to refine the zero-shot logits produced by LangCell through a graph-regularized optimization framework. By enforcing local consistency over the task-specific PCA-based k-NN graph, our method combines the scalability of the pre-trained models with the structural robustness relied upon in expert annotation. We evaluate our approach on 14 annotated human scRNA-seq datasets from 4 distinct studies, spanning 11 organs and over 200,000 single cells. Our method consistently improves zero-shot annotation accuracy, achieving accuracy gains of up to 10%. Further analysis showcase the mechanism by which GRIT effectively propagates correct signals through the graph, pulling back mislabeled cells toward more accurate predictions. The method is training-free, model-agnostic, and serves as a simple yet effective plug-in for enhancing automated cell type annotation in practice.

Abstract:
Understanding the molecular-level mechanisms underpinning Alzheimer's disease (AD) by studying crucial genes associated with the disease remains a challenge. Alzheimer's, being a multifactorial disease, requires understanding the gene-gene interactions underlying it for theranostics and progress. In this article, a novel attempt has been made using a quantum regression to decode how some crucial genes in the AD Amyloid Beta Precursor Protein ($APP$), Sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 14 ($FGF14$), Yin Yang 1 ($YY1$), and Phospholipase D Family Member 3 ($PLD3$) etc. become influenced by other prominent switching genes during disease progression, which may help in gene expression-based therapy for AD. Our proposed Quantum Regression Network (Alz-QNet) introduces a pioneering approach with insights from the state-of-the-art Quantum Gene Regulatory Networks (QGRN) to unravel the gene interactions involved in AD pathology, particularly within the Entorhinal Cortex (EC), where early pathological changes occur. Using the proposed Alz-QNet framework, we explore the interactions between key genes ($APP$, $FGF14$, $YY1$, $EGR1$, $GAS7$, $AKT3$, $SREBF2$, and $PLD3$) within the CE microenvironment of AD patients, studying genetic samples from the database $GSE138852$, all of which are believed to play a crucial role in the progression of AD. Our investigation uncovers intricate gene-gene interactions, shedding light on the potential regulatory mechanisms that underlie the pathogenesis of AD, which help us to find potential gene inhibitors or regulators for theranostics.

Abstract:
Modern disease classification often overlooks molecular commonalities hidden beneath divergent clinical presentations. This study introduces a transcriptomics-driven framework for discovering disease relationships by analyzing over 1300 disease-condition pairs using GenoMAS, a fully automated agentic AI system. Beyond identifying robust gene-level overlaps, we develop a novel pathway-based similarity framework that integrates multi-database enrichment analysis to quantify functional convergence across diseases. The resulting disease similarity network reveals both known comorbidities and previously undocumented cross-category links. By examining shared biological pathways, we explore potential molecular mechanisms underlying these connections-offering functional hypotheses that go beyond symptom-based taxonomies. We further show how background conditions such as obesity and hypertension modulate transcriptomic similarity, and identify therapeutic repurposing opportunities for rare diseases like autism spectrum disorder based on their molecular proximity to better-characterized conditions. In addition, this work demonstrates how biologically grounded agentic AI can scale transcriptomic analysis while enabling mechanistic interpretation across complex disease landscapes.

Abstract:
Genomic language models (gLMs) face a fundamental efficiency challenge: either maintain separate specialized models for each biological modality (DNA and RNA) or develop large multi-modal architectures. Both approaches impose significant computational burdens - modality-specific models require redundant infrastructure despite inherent biological connections, while multi-modal architectures demand massive parameter counts and extensive cross-modality pretraining. To address this limitation, we introduce CodonMoE (Adaptive Mixture of Codon Reformative Experts), a lightweight adapter that transforms DNA language models into effective RNA analyzers without RNA-specific pretraining. Our theoretical analysis establishes CodonMoE as a universal approximator at the codon level, capable of mapping arbitrary functions from codon sequences to RNA properties given sufficient expert capacity. Across four RNA prediction tasks spanning stability, expression, and regulation, DNA models augmented with CodonMoE significantly outperform their unmodified counterparts, with HyenaDNA+CodonMoE series achieving state-of-the-art results using 80% fewer parameters than specialized RNA models. By maintaining sub-quadratic complexity while achieving superior performance, our approach provides a principled path toward unifying genomic language modeling, leveraging more abundant DNA data and reducing computational overhead while preserving modality-specific performance advantages.

Comment: (review in progress). supplementary material included in pdf; anonymized code at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Feature_Selection_HD-D853/README.md

Abstract:
Feature selection (FS) is assumed to improve predictive performance and identify meaningful features in high-dimensional datasets. Surprisingly, small random subsets of features (0.02-1%) match or outperform the predictive performance of both full feature sets and FS across 28 out of 30 diverse datasets (microarray, bulk and single-cell RNA-Seq, mass spectrometry, imaging, etc.). In short, any arbitrary set of features is as good as any other (with surprisingly low variance in results) - so how can a particular set of selected features be "important" if they perform no better than an arbitrary set? These results challenge the assumption that computationally selected features reliably capture meaningful signals, emphasizing the importance of rigorous validation before interpreting selected features as actionable, particularly in computational genomics.

Abstract:
Network models provide a powerful framework for analysing single-cell count data, facilitating the characterisation of cellular identities, disease mechanisms, and developmental trajectories. However, uncertainty modeling in unsupervised learning with genomic data remains insufficiently explored. Conventional clustering methods assign a singular identity to each cell, potentially obscuring transitional states during differentiation or mutation. This study introduces a variational Bayesian framework for clustering and analysing single-cell genomic data, employing a Bayesian Gaussian mixture model to estimate the probabilistic association of cells with distinct clusters. This approach captures cellular transitions, yielding biologically coherent insights into neurogenesis and breast cancer progression. The inferred clustering probabilities enable further analyses, including Differential Expression Analysis and pseudotime analysis. Furthermore, we propose utilising the misclustering rate and Area Under the Curve in clustering scRNA-seq data as an innovative metric to quantitatively evaluate overall clustering performance. This methodological advancement enhances the resolution of single-cell data analysis, enabling a more nuanced characterisation of dynamic cellular identities in development and disease.

Abstract:
Spatial transcriptomics enables simultaneous measurement of gene expression and tissue morphology, offering unprecedented insights into cellular organization and disease mechanisms. However, the field lacks comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating multimodal learning methods that leverage both histology images and gene expression data. Here, we present HESCAPE, a large-scale benchmark for cross-modal contrastive pretraining in spatial transcriptomics, built on a curated pan-organ dataset spanning 6 different gene panels and 54 donors. We systematically evaluated state-of-the-art image and gene expression encoders across multiple pretraining strategies and assessed their effectiveness on two downstream tasks: gene mutation classification and gene expression prediction. Our benchmark demonstrates that gene expression encoders are the primary determinant of strong representational alignment, and that gene models pretrained on spatial transcriptomics data outperform both those trained without spatial data and simple baseline approaches. However, downstream task evaluation reveals a striking contradiction: while contrastive pretraining consistently improves gene mutation classification performance, it degrades direct gene expression prediction compared to baseline encoders trained without cross-modal objectives. We identify batch effects as a key factor that interferes with effective cross-modal alignment. Our findings highlight the critical need for batch-robust multimodal learning approaches in spatial transcriptomics. To accelerate progress in this direction, we release HESCAPE, providing standardized datasets, evaluation protocols, and benchmarking tools for the community

Abstract:
Pan-cancer classification using transcriptomic (RNA-Seq) data can inform tumor subtyping and therapy selection, but is challenging due to extremely high dimensionality and limited sample sizes. In this study, we propose a novel deep learning framework that uses a class-conditional variational autoencoder (cVAE) to augment training data for pan-cancer gene expression classification. Using 801 tumor RNA-Seq samples spanning 5 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we first perform feature selection to reduce 20,531 gene expression features to the 500 most variably expressed genes. A cVAE is then trained on this data to learn a latent representation of gene expression conditioned on cancer type, enabling the generation of synthetic gene expression samples for each tumor class. We augment the training set with these cVAE-generated samples (doubling the dataset size) to mitigate overfitting and class imbalance. A two-layer multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier is subsequently trained on the augmented dataset to predict tumor type. The augmented framework achieves high classification accuracy (~98%) on a held-out test set, substantially outperforming a classifier trained on the original data alone. We present detailed experimental results, including VAE training curves, classifier performance metrics (ROC curves and confusion matrix), and architecture diagrams to illustrate the approach. The results demonstrate that cVAE-based synthetic augmentation can significantly improve pan-cancer prediction performance, especially for underrepresented cancer classes.

Abstract:
CARTEpigenoQC is an R-based toolkit designed to streamline quality control (QC) for single-cell epigenomic datasets involving Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR)-engineered T cells. With the growing application of scATAC-seq, scCUT&Tag, and scBS-seq to characterize CAR-T cell states, it has become critical to perform customized QC that not only addresses standard metrics like FRiP (Fraction of Reads in Peaks) and TSS enrichment, but also directly detects signal from CAR vector insertion sites. CARTEpigenoQC supports both 10x Genomics and non-10x data formats and produces HTML and PNG summary outputs suited for exploratory analysis and regulatory-grade preclinical reporting. It is intended to assist researchers, core facilities, and translational immunologists in ensuring the validity of single-cell epigenomic profiling of engineered T cells.

Abstract:
Distinguishing pathogenic mutations from benign polymorphisms remains a critical challenge in precision medicine. EnTao-GPM, developed by Fudan University and BioMap, addresses this through three innovations: (1) Cross-species targeted pre-training on disease-relevant mammalian genomes (human, pig, mouse), leveraging evolutionary conservation to enhance interpretation of pathogenic motifs, particularly in non-coding regions; (2) Germline mutation specialization via fine-tuning on ClinVar and HGMD, improving accuracy for both SNVs and non-SNVs; (3) Interpretable clinical framework integrating DNA sequence embeddings with LLM-based statistical explanations to provide actionable insights. Validated against ClinVar, EnTao-GPM demonstrates superior accuracy in mutation classification. It revolutionizes genetic testing by enabling faster, more accurate, and accessible interpretation for clinical diagnostics (e.g., variant assessment, risk identification, personalized treatment) and research, advancing personalized medicine.

Abstract:
Gene expression analysis holds the key to many biomedical discoveries, yet extracting insights from raw transcriptomic data remains formidable due to the complexity of multiple large, semi-structured files and the need for extensive domain expertise. Current automation approaches are often limited by either inflexible workflows that break down in edge cases or by fully autonomous agents that lack the necessary precision for rigorous scientific inquiry. GenoMAS charts a different course by presenting a team of LLM-based scientists that integrates the reliability of structured workflows with the adaptability of autonomous agents. GenoMAS orchestrates six specialized LLM agents through typed message-passing protocols, each contributing complementary strengths to a shared analytic canvas. At the heart of GenoMAS lies a guided-planning framework: programming agents unfold high-level task guidelines into Action Units and, at each juncture, elect to advance, revise, bypass, or backtrack, thereby maintaining logical coherence while bending gracefully to the idiosyncrasies of genomic data.   On the GenoTEX benchmark, GenoMAS reaches a Composite Similarity Correlation of 89.13% for data preprocessing and an F$_1$ of 60.48% for gene identification, surpassing the best prior art by 10.61% and 16.85% respectively. Beyond metrics, GenoMAS surfaces biologically plausible gene-phenotype associations corroborated by the literature, all while adjusting for latent confounders.

Abstract:
Differential expression (DE) analysis is a key task in RNA-seq studies, aiming to identify genes with expression differences across conditions. A central challenge is balancing false discovery rate (FDR) control with statistical power. Parametric methods such as DESeq2 and edgeR achieve high power by modeling gene-level counts using negative binomial distributions and applying empirical Bayes shrinkage. However, these methods may suffer from FDR inflation when model assumptions are mildly violated, especially in large-sample settings. In contrast, non-parametric tests like Wilcoxon offer more robust FDR control but often lack power and do not support covariate adjustment. We propose Nullstrap-DE, a general add-on framework that combines the strengths of both approaches. Designed to augment tools like DESeq2 and edgeR, Nullstrap-DE calibrates FDR while preserving power, without modifying the original method's implementation. It generates synthetic null data from a model fitted under the gene-specific null (no DE), applies the same test statistic to both observed and synthetic data, and derives a threshold that satisfies the target FDR level. We show theoretically that Nullstrap-DE asymptotically controls FDR while maintaining power consistency. Simulations confirm that it achieves reliable FDR control and high power across diverse settings, where DESeq2, edgeR, or Wilcoxon often show inflated FDR or low power. Applications to real datasets show that Nullstrap-DE enhances statistical rigor and identifies biologically meaningful genes.

Abstract:
Multi-omics data offer unprecedented insights into complex biological systems, yet their high dimensionality, sparsity, and intricate interactions pose significant analytical challenges. Network-based approaches have advanced multi-omics research by effectively capturing biologically relevant relationships among molecular entities. While these methods are powerful for representing molecular interactions, there remains a need for tools specifically designed to effectively utilize these network representations across diverse downstream analyses. To fulfill this need, we introduce BioNeuralNet, a flexible and modular Python framework tailored for end-to-end network-based multi-omics data analysis. BioNeuralNet leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn biologically meaningful low-dimensional representations from multi-omics networks, converting these complex molecular networks into versatile embeddings. BioNeuralNet supports all major stages of multi-omics network analysis, including several network construction techniques, generation of low-dimensional representations, and a broad range of downstream analytical tasks. Its extensive utilities, including diverse GNN architectures, and compatibility with established Python packages (e.g., scikit-learn, PyTorch, NetworkX), enhance usability and facilitate quick adoption. BioNeuralNet is an open-source, user-friendly, and extensively documented framework designed to support flexible and reproducible multi-omics network analysis in precision medicine.

Abstract:
The modeling of genomic sequences presents unique challenges due to their length and structural complexity. Traditional sequence models struggle to capture long-range dependencies and biological features inherent in DNA. In this work, we propose TrinityDNA, a novel DNA foundational model designed to address these challenges. The model integrates biologically informed components, including Groove Fusion for capturing DNA's structural features and Gated Reverse Complement (GRC) to handle the inherent symmetry of DNA sequences. Additionally, we introduce a multi-scale attention mechanism that allows the model to attend to varying levels of sequence dependencies, and an evolutionary training strategy that progressively adapts the model to both prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes. TrinityDNA provides a more accurate and efficient approach to genomic sequence modeling, offering significant improvements in gene function prediction, regulatory mechanism discovery, and other genomics applications. Our model bridges the gap between machine learning techniques and biological insights, paving the way for more effective analysis of genomic data. Additionally, we introduced a new DNA long-sequence CDS annotation benchmark to make evaluations more comprehensive and oriented toward practical applications.

Abstract:
The exponential growth of DNA sequencing data has outpaced traditional heuristic-based methods, which struggle to scale effectively. Efficient computational approaches are urgently needed to support large-scale similarity search, a foundational task in bioinformatics for detecting homology, functional similarity, and novelty among genomic and proteomic sequences. Although tools like BLAST have been widely used and remain effective in many scenarios, they suffer from limitations such as high computational cost and poor performance on divergent sequences.   In this work, we explore embedding-based similarity search methods that learn latent representations capturing deeper structural and functional patterns beyond raw sequence alignment. We systematically evaluate two state-of-the-art vector search libraries, FAISS and ScaNN, on biologically meaningful gene embeddings. Unlike prior studies, our analysis focuses on bioinformatics-specific embeddings and benchmarks their utility for detecting novel sequences, including those from uncharacterized taxa or genes lacking known homologs. Our results highlight both computational advantages (in memory and runtime efficiency) and improved retrieval quality, offering a promising alternative to traditional alignment-heavy tools.

Abstract:
Functional annotation of microbial genomes is often biased toward protein-coding genes, leaving a vast, unexplored landscape of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) that are critical for regulating bacterial and archaeal physiology, stress response and metabolism. Identifying ncRNAs directly from genomic sequence is a paramount challenge in bioinformatics and biology, essential for understanding the complete regulatory potential of an organism. This paper presents RNAMunin, a machine learning (ML) model that is capable of finding ncRNAs using genomic sequence alone. It is also computationally viable for large sequence datasets such as long read metagenomic assemblies with contigs totaling multiple Gbp. RNAMunin is trained on Rfam sequences extracted from approximately 60 Gbp of long read metagenomes from 16 San Francisco Estuary samples. We know of no other model that can detect ncRNAs based solely on genomic sequence at this scale. Since RNAMunin only requires genomic sequence as input, we do not need for an ncRNA to be transcribed to find it, i.e., we do not need transcriptomics data. We wrote this manuscript in a narrative style in order to best convey how RNAMunin was developed and how it works in detail. Unlike almost all current ML models, at approximately 1M parameters, RNAMunin is very small and very fast.

Abstract:
Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) technologies provide biologists with rich insights into single-cell biology by preserving spatial context of cells. Building foundational models for ST can significantly enhance the analysis of vast and complex data sources, unlocking new perspectives on the intricacies of biological tissues. However, modeling ST data is inherently challenging due to the need to extract multi-scale information from tissue slices containing vast numbers of cells. This process requires integrating macro-scale tissue morphology, micro-scale cellular microenvironment, and gene-scale gene expression profile. To address this challenge, we propose SToFM, a multi-scale Spatial Transcriptomics Foundation Model. SToFM first performs multi-scale information extraction on each ST slice, to construct a set of ST sub-slices that aggregate macro-, micro- and gene-scale information. Then an SE(2) Transformer is used to obtain high-quality cell representations from the sub-slices. Additionally, we construct \textbf{SToCorpus-88M}, the largest high-resolution spatial transcriptomics corpus for pretraining. SToFM achieves outstanding performance on a variety of downstream tasks, such as tissue region semantic segmentation and cell type annotation, demonstrating its comprehensive understanding of ST data through capturing and integrating multi-scale information.

Abstract:
In this paper, we consider a tree inference problem motivated by the critical problem in single-cell genomics of reconstructing dynamic cellular processes from sequencing data. In particular, given a population of cells sampled from such a process, we are interested in the problem of ordering the cells according to their progression in the process. This is known as trajectory inference. If the process is differentiation, this amounts to reconstructing the corresponding differentiation tree. One way of doing this in practice is to estimate the shortest-path distance between nodes based on cell similarities observed in sequencing data. Recent sequencing techniques make it possible to measure two types of data: gene expression levels, and RNA velocity, a vector that predicts changes in gene expression. The data then consist of a discrete vector field on a (subset of a) Euclidean space of dimension equal to the number of genes under consideration. By integrating this velocity field, we trace the evolution of gene expression levels in each single cell from some initial stage to its current stage. Eventually, we assume that we have a faithful embedding of the differentiation tree in a Euclidean space, but which we only observe through the curves representing the paths from the root to the nodes. Using varifold distances between such curves, we define a similarity measure between nodes which we prove approximates the shortest-path distance in a tree that is isomorphic to the target tree.

Abstract:
Single-cell foundation models such as scGPT represent a significant advancement in single-cell omics, with an ability to achieve state-of-the-art performance on various downstream biological tasks. However, these models are inherently limited in that a vast amount of information in biology exists as text, which they are unable to leverage. There have therefore been several recent works that propose the use of LLMs as an alternative to single-cell foundation models, achieving competitive results. However, there is little understanding of what factors drive this performance, along with a strong focus on using LLMs as an alternative, rather than complementary approach to single-cell foundation models. In this study, we therefore investigate what biological insights contribute toward the performance of LLMs when applied to single-cell data, and introduce scMPT; a model which leverages synergies between scGPT, and single-cell representations from LLMs that capture these insights. scMPT demonstrates stronger, more consistent performance than either of its component models, which frequently have large performance gaps between each other across datasets. We also experiment with alternate fusion methods, demonstrating the potential of combining specialized reasoning models with scGPT to improve performance. This study ultimately showcases the potential for LLMs to complement single-cell foundation models and drive improvements in single-cell analysis.

Abstract:
Clustering analysis is fundamental in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data analysis for elucidating cellular heterogeneity and diversity. Recent graph-based scRNA-seq clustering methods, particularly graph neural networks (GNNs), have significantly improved in tackling the challenges of high-dimension, high-sparsity, and frequent dropout events that lead to ambiguous cell population boundaries. However, their reliance on hard graph constructions derived from thresholded similarity matrices presents challenges:(i) The simplification of intercellular relationships into binary edges (0 or 1) by applying thresholds, which restricts the capture of continuous similarity features among cells and leads to significant information loss.(ii) The presence of significant inter-cluster connections within hard graphs, which can confuse GNN methods that rely heavily on graph structures, potentially causing erroneous message propagation and biased clustering outcomes. To tackle these challenges, we introduce scSGC, a Soft Graph Clustering for single-cell RNA sequencing data, which aims to more accurately characterize continuous similarities among cells through non-binary edge weights, thereby mitigating the limitations of rigid data structures. The scSGC framework comprises three core components: (i) a zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB)-based feature autoencoder; (ii) a dual-channel cut-informed soft graph embedding module; and (iii) an optimal transport-based clustering optimization module. Extensive experiments across ten datasets demonstrate that scSGC outperforms 13 state-of-the-art clustering models in clustering accuracy, cell type annotation, and computational efficiency. These results highlight its substantial potential to advance scRNA-seq data analysis and deepen our understanding of cellular heterogeneity.

Abstract:
Transcription Factor Binding Site (TFBS) prediction is crucial for understanding gene regulation and various biological processes. This study introduces a novel Mixture of Experts (MoE) approach for TFBS prediction, integrating multiple pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models, each specializing in different TFBS patterns. We evaluate the performance of our MoE model against individual expert models on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets, using six randomly selected transcription factors (TFs) for OOD testing. Our results demonstrate that the MoE model achieves competitive or superior performance across diverse TF binding sites, particularly excelling in OOD scenarios. The Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) statistical test confirms the significance of these performance differences. Additionally, we introduce ShiftSmooth, a novel attribution mapping technique that provides more robust model interpretability by considering small shifts in input sequences. Through comprehensive explainability analysis, we show that ShiftSmooth offers superior attribution for motif discovery and localization compared to traditional Vanilla Gradient methods. Our work presents an efficient, generalizable, and interpretable solution for TFBS prediction, potentially enabling new discoveries in genome biology and advancing our understanding of transcriptional regulation.

Abstract:
Transformers have revolutionized nucleotide sequence analysis, yet capturing long-range dependencies remains challenging. Recent studies show that autoregressive transformers often exhibit Markovian behavior by relying on fixed-length context windows for next-token prediction. However, standard self-attention mechanisms are computationally inefficient for long sequences due to their quadratic complexity and do not explicitly enforce global transition consistency.   We introduce CARMANIA (Context-Aware Regularization with Markovian Integration for Attention-Based Nucleotide Analysis), a self-supervised pretraining framework that augments next-token (NT) prediction with a transition-matrix (TM) loss. The TM loss aligns predicted token transitions with empirically derived n-gram statistics from each input sequence, encouraging the model to capture higher-order dependencies beyond local context. This integration enables CARMANIA to learn organism-specific sequence structures that reflect both evolutionary constraints and functional organization.   We evaluate CARMANIA across diverse genomic tasks, including regulatory element prediction, functional gene classification, taxonomic inference, antimicrobial resistance detection, and biosynthetic gene cluster classification. CARMANIA outperforms the previous best long-context model by at least 7 percent, matches state-of-the-art on shorter sequences (exceeding prior results on 20 out of 40 tasks while running approximately 2.5 times faster), and shows particularly strong improvements on enhancer and housekeeping gene classification tasks, including up to a 34 percent absolute gain in Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) for enhancer prediction. The TM loss boosts accuracy in 33 of 40 tasks, especially where local motifs or regulatory patterns drive prediction.

Abstract:
AMRScan is a hybrid bioinformatics toolkit implemented in both R and [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) for the rapid and reproducible detection of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes from next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. The toolkit enables users to identify AMR gene hits in sequencing reads by aligning them against reference databases such as CARD using BLAST.   The R implementation provides a concise, script-based approach suitable for single-sample analysis, teaching, and rapid prototyping. In contrast, the Nextflow implementation enables reproducible, scalable workflows for multi-sample batch processing in high-performance computing (HPC) and containerized environments. It leverages modular pipeline design with support for automated database setup, quality control, conversion, BLAST alignment, and results parsing.   AMRScan helps bridge the gap between lightweight exploratory analysis and production-ready surveillance pipelines, making it suitable for both research and public health genomics applications.

Abstract:
HybridQC is an R package that streamlines quality control (QC) of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data by combining traditional threshold-based filtering with machine learning-based outlier detection. It provides an efficient and adaptive framework to identify low-quality cells in noisy or shallow-depth datasets using techniques such as Isolation Forest, while remaining compatible with widely adopted formats such as Seurat objects.   The package is lightweight, easy to install, and suitable for small-to-medium scRNA-seq datasets in research settings. HybridQC is especially useful for projects involving non-model organisms, rare samples, or pilot studies, where automated and flexible QC is critical for reproducibility and downstream analysis.

Abstract:
Genetic transfers are pervasive across both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, encompassing canonical genomic introgression between species or genera and horizontal gene transfer (HGT) across kingdoms. However, DNA transfer between phylogenetically distant species, here defined as remote introgression (RI), has remained poorly explored in evolutionary genomics. In this study, we present RIFinder, a novel phylogeny-based method for RI event detection, and apply it to a comprehensive dataset of 122 grass genomes. Our analysis identifies 622 RI events originating from 543 distinct homologous genes, revealing distinct characteristics among grass subfamilies. Specifically, the subfamily Pooideae exhibits the highest number of introgressed genes while Bambusoideae contains the lowest. Comparisons among accepted genes, their donor copies and native homologs demonstrate that introgressed genes undergo post-transfer localized adaptation, with significant functional enrichment in stress-response pathways. Notably, we identify a large Triticeae-derived segment in a Chloridoideae species Cleistogenes songorica, which is potentially associated with its exceptional drought tolerance. Furthermore, we provide compelling evidence that RI has contributed to the origin and diversification of biosynthetic gene clusters of gramine, a defensive alkaloid chemical, across grass species. Collectively, our study establishes a robust method for RI detection and highlights its critical role in adaptive evolution.

Abstract:
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables single-cell transcriptomic profiling, revealing cellular heterogeneity and rare populations. Recent deep learning models like Geneformer and Mouse-Geneformer perform well on tasks such as cell-type classification and in silico perturbation. However, their species-specific design limits cross-species generalization and translational applications, which are crucial for advancing translational research and drug discovery. We present Mix-Geneformer, a novel Transformer-based model that integrates human and mouse scRNA-seq data into a unified representation via a hybrid self-supervised approach combining Masked Language Modeling (MLM) and SimCSE-based contrastive loss to capture both shared and species-specific gene patterns. A rank-value encoding scheme further emphasizes high-variance gene signals during training. Trained on about 50 million cells from diverse human and mouse organs, Mix-Geneformer matched or outperformed state-of-the-art baselines in cell-type classification and in silico perturbation tasks, achieving 95.8% accuracy on mouse kidney data versus 94.9% from the best existing model. It also successfully identified key regulatory genes validated by in vivo studies. By enabling scalable cross-species transcriptomic modeling, Mix-Geneformer offers a powerful tool for comparative transcriptomics and translational applications. While our results demonstrate strong performance, we also acknowledge limitations, such as the computational cost and variability in zero-shot transfer.

Abstract:
Sequence data, such as DNA, RNA, and protein sequences, exhibit intricate, multi-scale structures that pose significant challenges for conventional analysis methods, particularly those relying on alignment or purely statistical representations. In this work, we introduce category-based topological sequence analysis (CTSA ) of genomes. CTSA models a sequence as a resolution category, capturing its hierarchical structure through a categorical construction. Substructure complexes are then derived from this categorical representation, and their persistent homology is computed to extract multi-scale topological features. Our models depart from traditional alignment-free approaches by incorporating structured mathematical formalisms rooted in sequence topology. The resulting topological signatures provide informative representations across a variety of tasks, including the phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 variants and the prediction of protein-nucleic acid binding affinities. Comparative studies were carried out against six state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results demonstrate that CTSA achieves excellent and consistent performance in these tasks, suggesting its general applicability and robustness. Beyond sequence analysis, the proposed framework opens new directions for the integration of categorical and homological theories for biological sequence analysis.

Abstract:
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized the study of cellular heterogeneity, enabling detailed molecular profiling at the individual cell level. However, integrating high-dimensional single-cell data into causal mediation analysis remains challenging due to zero inflation and complex mediator structures. We propose a novel mediation framework leveraging zero-inflated negative binomial models to characterize cell-level mediator distributions and beta regression for zero-inflation proportions. The model can identify expression level as well as expressed proportion that could mediate disease-leading causal pathway. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate improved power and controlled false discovery rates. We further illustrate the utility of this approach through application to ROSMAP single-cell transcriptomic data, uncovering biologically meaningful mediation effects that enhance understanding of disease mechanisms.

Abstract:
T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires encode critical immunological signatures for autoimmune diseases, yet their clinical application remains limited by sequence sparsity and low witness rates. We developed EAMil, a multi-instance deep learning framework that leverages TCR sequencing data to diagnose systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with exceptional accuracy. By integrating PrimeSeq feature extraction with ESMonehot encoding and enhanced gate attention mechanisms, our model achieved state-of-the-art performance with AUCs of 98.95% for SLE and 97.76% for RA. EAMil successfully identified disease-associated genes with over 90% concordance with established differential analyses and effectively distinguished disease-specific TCR genes. The model demonstrated robustness in classifying multiple disease categories, utilizing the SLEDAI score to stratify SLE patients by disease severity as well as to diagnose the site of damage in SLE patients, and effectively controlling for confounding factors such as age and gender. This interpretable framework for immune receptor analysis provides new insights for autoimmune disease detection and classification with broad potential clinical applications across immune-mediated conditions.

Abstract:
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers share significant similarities in their encoding strategies for interacting with features from nodes of interest, where Transformers use query-key scores and GNNs use edges. Compared to GNNs, which are unable to encode relative positions, Transformers leverage dynamic attention capabilities to better represent relative relationships, thereby becoming the standard backbones in large-scale sequential pre-training. However, the subtle difference prompts us to consider: if positions are no longer crucial, could we substitute Transformers with Graph Neural Networks in some fields such as Single-Cell Transcriptomics? In this paper, we first explore the similarities and differences between GNNs and Transformers, specifically in terms of relative positions. Additionally, we design a synthetic example to illustrate their equivalence where there are no relative positions between tokens in the sample. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on a large-scale position-agnostic dataset-single-cell transcriptomics-finding that GNNs achieve competitive performance compared to Transformers while consuming fewer computation resources. These findings provide novel insights for researchers in the field of single-cell transcriptomics, challenging the prevailing notion that the Transformer is always the optimum choice.

Abstract:
Background: While benchmarks on short-read variant calling suggest low error rate below 0.5%, they are only applicable to predefined confident regions. For a human sample without such regions, the error rate could be 10 times higher. Although multiple sets of easy regions have been identified to alleviate the issue, they fail to consider non-reference samples or are biased towards existing short-read data or aligners.   Results: Here, using hundreds of high-quality human assemblies, we derived a set of sample-agnostic easy regions where short-read variant calling reaches high accuracy. These regions cover 88.2% of GRCh38, 92.2% of coding regions and 96.3% of ClinVar pathogenic variants. They achieve a good balance between coverage and easiness and can be generated for other human assemblies or species with multiple well assembled genomes.   Conclusion: This resource provides a convient and powerful way to filter spurious variant calls for clinical or research human samples.

Abstract:
Predicting drug responses using genetic and transcriptomic features is crucial for enhancing personalized medicine. In this study, we implemented an ensemble of machine learning algorithms to analyze the correlation between genetic and transcriptomic features of cancer cell lines and IC50 values, a reliable metric for drug efficacy. Our analysis involved a reduction of the feature set from an original pool of 38,977 features, demonstrating a strong linear relationship between genetic features and drug responses across various algorithms, including SVR, Linear Regression, and Ridge Regression. Notably, copy number variations (CNVs) emerged as more predictive than mutations, suggesting a significant reevaluation of biomarkers for drug response prediction. Through rigorous statistical methods, we identified a highly reduced set of 421 critical features. This set offers a novel perspective that contrasts with traditional cancer driver genes, underscoring the potential for these biomarkers in designing targeted therapies. Furthermore, our findings advocate for IC50 values as a predictable measurement of drug responses and underscore the need for more data that can represent the dimensionality of genomic data in drug response prediction. Future work will aim to expand the dataset and refine feature selection to enhance the generalizability of the predictive model in clinical settings.

Abstract:
We train a neural network to predict distributional responses in gene expression following genetic perturbations. This is an essential task in early-stage drug discovery, where such responses can offer insights into gene function and inform target identification. Existing methods only predict changes in the mean expression, overlooking stochasticity inherent in single-cell data. In contrast, we offer a more realistic view of cellular responses by modeling expression distributions. Our model predicts gene-level histograms conditioned on perturbations and outperforms baselines in capturing higher-order statistics, such as variance, skewness, and kurtosis, at a fraction of the training cost. To generalize to unseen perturbations, we incorporate prior knowledge via gene embeddings from large language models (LLMs). While modeling a richer output space, the method remains competitive in predicting mean expression changes. This work offers a practical step towards more expressive and biologically informative models of perturbation effects.

Abstract:
Recent multi-omic microbiome studies enable integrative analysis of microbes and metabolites, uncovering their associations with various host conditions. Such analyses require multivariate models capable of accounting for the complex correlation structures between microbes and metabolites. However, existing multivariate models often suffer from low statistical power for detecting microbiome-metabolome interactions due to small sample sizes and weak biological signals. To address these challenges, we introduce CoMMiT, Co-informed inference of Microbiome-Metabolome Interactions via novel Transfer learning models. Unlike conventional transfer-learning methods that borrow information from external datasets, CoMMiT leverages similarities across metabolites within a single cohort, reducing the risk of negative transfer often caused by differences in sequencing platforms and bioinformatic pipelines across studies. CoMMiT operates under the flexible assumption that auxiliary metabolites are collectively informative for the target metabolite, without requiring individual auxiliary metabolites to be informative. CoMMiT uses a novel data-driven approach to selecting the optimal set of auxiliary metabolites. Using this optimal set, CoMMiT employs a de-biasing framework to enable efficient calculation of p-values, facilitating the identification of statistically significant microbiome-metabolome interactions. Applying CoMMiT to a feeding study reveals biologically meaningful microbiome-metabolome interactions under a low glycemic load diet, demonstrating the diet-host link through gut metabolism.

We introduce the Copy Number Stochastic Block Model (CN-SBM), a probabilistic framework that jointly clusters samples and genomic regions based on discrete copy number states using a bipartite categorical block model. Unlike models relying on Gaussian or Poisson assumptions, CN-SBM respects the discrete nature of CNV calls and captures subpopulation-specific patterns through block-wise structure. Using a two-stage approach, CN-SBM decomposes CNV data into primary and residual components, enabling detection of both large-scale chromosomal alterations and finer aberrations. We derive a scalable variational inference algorithm for application to large cohorts and high-resolution data. Benchmarks on simulated and real datasets show improved model fit over existing methods. Applied to TCGA low-grade glioma data, CN-SBM reveals clinically relevant subtypes and structured residual variation, aiding patient stratification in survival analysis. These results establish CN-SBM as an interpretable, scalable framework for CNV analysis with direct relevance for tumor heterogeneity and prognosis.

Abstract:
A key challenge in learning from multimodal biological data is missing modalities, where all data from some modalities are missing for some patients. Current fusion methods address this by excluding patients with missing modalities, imputing missing modalities, or making predictions directly with partial modalities. However, they often struggle with diverse missing-modality patterns and the exponential growth of the number of such patterns as the number of modalities increases. To address these limitations, we propose MAGNET (Missing-modality-Aware Graph neural NETwork) for direct prediction with partial modalities, which introduces a patient-modality multi-head attention mechanism to fuse lower-dimensional modality embeddings based on their importance and missingness. MAGNET's complexity increases linearly with the number of modalities while adapting to missing-pattern variability. To generate predictions, MAGNET further constructs a patient graph with fused multimodal embeddings as node features and the connectivity determined by the modality missingness, followed by a conventional graph neural network. Experiments on three public multiomics datasets for cancer classification, with real-world instead of artificial missingness, show that MAGNET outperforms the state-of-the-art fusion methods. The data and code are available at https://github.com/SinaTabakhi/MAGNET.

Abstract:
Recent benchmarks reveal that models for single-cell perturbation response are often outperformed by simply predicting the dataset mean. We trace this anomaly to a metric artifact: control-referenced deltas and unweighted error metrics reward mode collapse whenever the control is biased or the biological signal is sparse. Large-scale \textit{in silico} simulations and analysis of two real-world perturbation datasets confirm that shared reference shifts, not genuine biological change, drives high performance in these evaluations. We introduce differentially expressed gene (DEG)-aware metrics, weighted mean-squared error (WMSE) and weighted delta $R^{2}$ ($R^{2}_{w}(Δ)$) with respect to all perturbations, that measure error in niche signals with high sensitivity. We further introduce negative and positive performance baselines to calibrate these metrics. With these improvements, the mean baseline sinks to null performance while genuine predictors are correctly rewarded. Finally, we show that using WMSE as a loss function reduces mode collapse and improves model performance.

Abstract:
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Several diagnostic methods, such as imaging modalities and Serum Alpha-Fetoprotein (AFP) testing, have been used for HCC detection; however, their effectiveness is limited to later stages of the disease. In contrast, transcriptomic analysis of biposy samples has shown promise for early detection. While machine learning techniques have been applied to transcriptomic data for cancer detection, their clinical adoption remains limited due to challenges such as poor generalizability across different datasets, lack of interpretability, and high computational complexity. To address these limitations, we developed a novel predictive formula for HCC detection using the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN). This formula is based on the expression levels of five genes: VIPR1, CYP1A2, FCN3, ECM1, and LIFR. Derived from the GSE25097 dataset, the formula offers a simple, interpretable, efficient, and accessible approach for HCC identification. It achieves 99% accuracy on the GSE25097 test set and demonstrates robust performance on six additional independent datasets, achieving accuracies of above 90% in all cases. These findings highlight the critical role of these five genes as biomarkers for HCC detection, offering a foundation for future research and clinical applications to improve HCC diagnostic approaches.

Abstract:
Single-cell sequencing is revolutionizing biology by enabling detailed investigations of cell-state transitions. Many biological processes unfold along continuous trajectories, yet it remains challenging to extract smooth, low-dimensional representations from inherently noisy, high-dimensional single-cell data. Neighbor embedding (NE) algorithms, such as t-SNE and UMAP, are widely used to embed high-dimensional single-cell data into low dimensions. But they often introduce undesirable distortions, resulting in misleading interpretations. Existing evaluation methods for NE algorithms primarily focus on separating discrete cell types rather than capturing continuous cell-state transitions, while dynamic modeling approaches rely on strong assumptions about cellular processes and specialized data. To address these challenges, we build on the Predictability-Computability-Stability (PCS) framework for reliable and reproducible data-driven discoveries. First, we systematically evaluate popular NE algorithms through empirical analysis, simulation, and theory, and reveal their key shortcomings, such as artifacts and instability. We then introduce NESS, a principled and interpretable machine learning approach to improve NE representations by leveraging algorithmic stability and to enable robust inference of smooth biological structures. NESS offers useful concepts, quantitative stability metrics, and efficient computational workflows to uncover developmental trajectories and cell-state transitions in single-cell data. Finally, we apply NESS to six single-cell datasets, spanning pluripotent stem cell differentiation, organoid development, and multiple tissue-specific lineage trajectories. Across these diverse contexts, NESS consistently yields useful biological insights, such as identification of transitional and stable cell states and quantification of transcriptional dynamics during development.

Abstract:
Large language models (LLMs) trained on text demonstrated remarkable results on natural language processing (NLP) tasks. These models have been adapted to decipher the language of DNA, where sequences of nucleotides act as "words" that encode genomic functions. However, the genome differs fundamentally from natural language, as it lacks clearly defined words or a consistent grammar. Although DNA language models (DNALMs) such as DNABERT, GENA-LM have achieved high level of performance on genome-related biological tasks, these models do not encode biological functions in the presence of sequence variations. To address this problem, we pre-train foundation models that effectively integrate sequence variations, in particular Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), as they underlie important biological functions. Specifically, we use ModernBERT to pre-train two different Biomedical Foundation Models (BMFM), namely, BMFM-DNA-REF in which the model is trained with sequences of varying lengths along with their reverse complements derived from the reference genome and BMFM-DNA-SNP in which the model is trained with sequences created using a novel representation scheme that encodes sequence variations. Our findings indicate that integrating sequence variations into DNALMs helps capture the biological functions as seen in improvements on all fine-tuning tasks. To explore the model's practical utility, we experimented with various strategies for SNP imputation on promoter detection task introduced in DNABERT-2. However, we acknowledge that the current benchmarks are limited in their ability to fully evaluate these models. To enable more comprehensive assessment in the future and encourage community contributions, we release our models through HuggingFace and the code to reproduce the results at https://github.com/BiomedSciAI/biomed-multi-omic

Abstract:
The accurate development, assessment, interpretation, and benchmarking of bioinformatics frameworks for analyzing transcriptional regulatory grammars rely on controlled simulations to validate the underlying methods. However, existing simulators often lack end-to-end flexibility or ease of integration, which limits their practical use. We present inMOTIFin, a lightweight, modular, and user-friendly Python-based software that addresses these gaps by providing versatile and efficient simulation and modification of DNA regulatory sequences. inMOTIFin enables users to simulate or modify regulatory sequences efficiently for the customizable generation of motifs and insertion of motif instances with precise control over their positions, co-occurrences, and spacing, as well as direct modification of real sequences, facilitating a comprehensive evaluation of motif-based methods and interpretation tools. We demonstrate inMOTIFin applications for the assessment of de novo motif discovery prediction, the analysis of transcription factor cooperativity, and the support of explainability analyses for deep learning models. inMOTIFin ensures robust and reproducible analyses for studying transcriptional regulatory grammars.   inMOTIFin is available at PyPI https://pypi.org/project/inMOTIFin/ and Docker Hub https://hub.docker.com/r/cbgr/inmotifin.

Abstract:
Extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA) plays key regulatory roles and contributes to oncogene overexpression in cancer through high-copy amplification and long-range interactions. Despite advances in modeling, no pre-trained models currently support full-length circular eccDNA for downstream analysis. Existing genomic models are either limited to single-nucleotide resolution or hindered by the inefficiency of the quadratic attention mechanism. Here, we introduce eccDNAMamba, the first bidirectional state-space encoder tailored for circular DNA sequences. It combines forward and reverse passes for full-context representation learning with linear-time complexity, and preserves circular structure through a novel augmentation strategy. Tested on two real-world datasets, eccDNAMamba achieves strong classification performance and scales to sequences up to 200 Kbp, offering a robust and efficient framework for modeling circular genomes.

Abstract:
Pretraining DNA language models (DNALMs) on the full human genome is resource-intensive, yet often considered necessary for strong downstream performance. Inspired by recent findings in NLP and long-context modeling, we explore an alternative: self-pretraining on task-specific, unlabeled data. Using the BEND benchmark, we show that DNALMs trained with self-pretraining match or exceed the performance of models trained from scratch under identical compute. While genome-scale pretraining may still offer higher absolute performance, task-specific self-pretraining provides a practical and compute-efficient strategy for building stronger supervised baselines.

Abstract:
Understanding the properties of biological systems is an exciting avenue for applying advanced approaches to solving corresponding computational tasks. A specific class of problems that arises in the resolution of biological challenges is optimization. In this work, we present the results of a proof-of-concept study that applies a quantum-inspired optimization algorithm to simulate a viral response. We formulate an Ising-type model to describe the patterns of gene activity in host responses. Reducing the problem to the Ising form allows the use of available quantum and quantum-inspired optimization tools. We demonstrate the application of a quantum-inspired optimization algorithm to this problem. Our study paves the way for exploring the full potential of quantum and quantum-inspired optimization tools in biological applications.

Abstract:
We studied a generalized question: chronic diseases like ME/CFS and long COVID exhibit high heterogeneity with multifactorial etiology and progression, complicating diagnosis and treatment. To address this, we developed BioMapAI, an explainable Deep Learning framework using the richest longitudinal multi-omics dataset for ME/CFS to date. This dataset includes gut metagenomics, plasma metabolome, immune profiling, blood labs, and clinical symptoms. By connecting multi-omics to a symptom matrix, BioMapAI identified both disease- and symptom-specific biomarkers, reconstructed symptoms, and achieved state-of-the-art precision in disease classification. We also created the first connectivity map of these omics in both healthy and disease states and revealed how microbiome-immune-metabolome crosstalk shifted from healthy to ME/CFS.

Abstract:
Optimal transport provides a robust framework for comparing probability distributions. Its effectiveness is significantly influenced by the choice of the underlying ground metric. Traditionally, the ground metric has either been (i) predefined, e.g., as the Euclidean distance, or (ii) learned in a supervised way, by utilizing labeled data to learn a suitable ground metric for enhanced task-specific performance. Yet, predefined metrics typically cannot account for the inherent structure and varying importance of different features in the data, and existing supervised approaches to ground metric learning often do not generalize across multiple classes or are restricted to distributions with shared supports. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach for learning metrics for arbitrary distributions over a shared metric space. Our method provides a distance between individual points like a global metric, but requires only class labels on a distribution-level for training. The learned global ground metric enables more accurate optimal transport distances, leading to improved performance in embedding, clustering and classification tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness and interpretability of our approach using patient-level scRNA-seq data spanning multiple diseases.

Abstract:
Circular genome visualizations are essential for exploring structural variants and gene regulation. However, existing tools often require complex scripting and manual configuration, making the process time-consuming, error-prone, and difficult to learn. To address these challenges, we introduce AuraGenome, an LLM-powered framework for rapid, reusable, and scalable generation of multi-layered circular genome visualizations. AuraGenome combines a semantic-driven multi-agent workflow with an interactive visual analytics system. The workflow employs seven specialized LLM-driven agents, each assigned distinct roles such as intent recognition, layout planning, and code generation, to transform raw genomic data into tailored visualizations. The system supports multiple coordinated views tailored for genomic data, offering ring, radial, and chord-based layouts to represent multi-layered circular genome visualizations. In addition to enabling interactions and configuration reuse, the system supports real-time refinement and high-quality report export. We validate its effectiveness through two case studies and a comprehensive user study. AuraGenome is available at: https://github.com/Darius18/AuraGenome.

Abstract:
Transcriptomic foundation models (TFMs) have recently emerged as powerful tools for analyzing gene expression in cells and tissues, supporting key tasks such as cell-type annotation, batch correction, and perturbation prediction. However, the diversity of model implementations and training strategies across recent TFMs, though promising, makes it challenging to isolate the contribution of individual design choices or evaluate their potential synergies. This hinders the field's ability to converge on best practices and limits the reproducibility of insights across studies. We present BMFM-RNA, an open-source, modular software package that unifies diverse TFM pretraining and fine-tuning objectives within a single framework. Leveraging this capability, we introduce a novel training objective, whole cell expression decoder (WCED), which captures global expression patterns using an autoencoder-like CLS bottleneck representation. In this paper, we describe the framework, supported input representations, and training objectives. We evaluated four model checkpoints pretrained on CELLxGENE using combinations of masked language modeling (MLM), WCED and multitask learning. Using the benchmarking capabilities of BMFM-RNA, we show that WCED-based models achieve performance that matches or exceeds state-of-the-art approaches like scGPT across more than a dozen datasets in both zero-shot and fine-tuning tasks. BMFM-RNA, available as part of the biomed-multi-omics project ( https://github.com/BiomedSciAI/biomed-multi-omic ), offers a reproducible foundation for systematic benchmarking and community-driven exploration of optimal TFM training strategies, enabling the development of more effective tools to leverage the latest advances in AI for understanding cell biology.

Proceedings of the ICML 2025 GenBio Workshop: The 2nd Workshop on Generative AI and Biology, Vancouver, Canada, 2025

Abstract:
Generating high-fidelity and biologically plausible synthetic single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, especially with conditional control, is challenging due to its high dimensionality, sparsity, and complex biological variations. Existing generative models often struggle to capture these unique characteristics and ensure robustness to structural noise in cellular networks. We introduce LapDDPM, a novel conditional Graph Diffusion Probabilistic Model for robust and high-fidelity scRNA-seq generation. LapDDPM uniquely integrates graph-based representations with a score-based diffusion model, enhanced by a novel spectral adversarial perturbation mechanism on graph edge weights. Our contributions are threefold: we leverage Laplacian Positional Encodings (LPEs) to enrich the latent space with crucial cellular relationship information; we develop a conditional score-based diffusion model for effective learning and generation from complex scRNA-seq distributions; and we employ a unique spectral adversarial training scheme on graph edge weights, boosting robustness against structural variations. Extensive experiments on diverse scRNA-seq datasets demonstrate LapDDPM's superior performance, achieving high fidelity and generating biologically-plausible, cell-type-specific samples. LapDDPM sets a new benchmark for conditional scRNA-seq data generation, offering a robust tool for various downstream biological applications.

Abstract:
Identifying causative genes from patient phenotypes remains a significant challenge in precision medicine, with important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of genetic disorders. We propose a novel graph-based approach for predicting causative genes from patient phenotypes, with or without an available list of candidate genes, by integrating a rare disease knowledge graph (KG). Our model, combining graph neural networks and transformers, achieves substantial improvements over the current state-of-the-art. On the real-world MyGene2 dataset, it attains a mean reciprocal rank (MRR) of 24.64\% and nDCG@100 of 33.64\%, surpassing the best baseline (SHEPHERD) at 19.02\% MRR and 30.54\% nDCG@100. We perform extensive ablation studies to validate the contribution of each model component. Notably, the approach generalizes to cases where only phenotypic data are available, addressing key challenges in clinical decision support when genomic information is incomplete.

Abstract:
Motivation: Spliced alignment refers to the alignment of messenger RNA (mRNA) or protein sequences to eukaryotic genomes. It plays a critical role in gene annotation and the study of gene functions. Accurate spliced alignment demands sophisticated modeling of splice sites, but current aligners use simple models, which may affect their accuracy given dissimilar sequences.   Results: We implemented minisplice to learn splice signals with a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) and trained a model with 7,026 parameters for vertebrate and insect genomes. It captures conserved splice signals across phyla and reveals GC-rich introns specific to mammals and birds. We used this model to estimate the empirical splicing probability for every GT and AG in genomes, and modified minimap2 and miniprot to leverage pre-computed splicing probability during alignment. Evaluation on human long-read RNA-seq data and cross-species protein datasets showed our method greatly improves the junction accuracy especially for noisy long RNA-seq reads and proteins of distant homology.

Abstract:
Generative AI foundation models offer transformative potential for processing structured biological data, particularly in single-cell RNA sequencing, where datasets are rapidly scaling toward billions of cells. We propose the use of agentic foundation models with real-time web search to automate the labeling of experimental data, achieving up to 82.5% accuracy. This addresses a key bottleneck in supervised learning for structured omics data by increasing annotation throughput without manual curation and human error. Our approach enables the development of virtual cell foundation models capable of downstream tasks such as cell-typing and perturbation prediction. As data volume grows, these models may surpass human performance in labeling, paving the way for reliable inference in large-scale perturbation screens. This application demonstrates domain-specific innovation in health monitoring and diagnostics, aligned with efforts like the Human Cell Atlas and Human Tumor Atlas Network.

Abstract:
Viruses are the most abundant biological entities on Earth and play central roles in shaping microbiomes and influencing ecosystem functions. Yet, most viral genes remain uncharacterized, comprising what is commonly referred to as "viral dark matter." Metagenomic studies across diverse environments consistently show that 40-90% of viral genes lack known homologs or annotated functions. This persistent knowledge gap limits our ability to interpret viral sequence data, understand virus-host interactions, and assess the ecological or applied significance of viral genes. Among the most intriguing components of viral dark matter are auxiliary viral genes (AVGs), including auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs), regulatory genes (AReGs), and host physiology-modifying genes (APGs), which may alter host function during infection and contribute to microbial metabolism, stress tolerance, or resistance. In this review, we explore recent advances in the discovery and functional characterization of viral dark matter. We highlight representative examples of novel viral proteins across diverse ecosystems including human microbiomes, soil, oceans, and extreme environments, and discuss what is known, and still unknown, about their roles. We then examine the bioinformatic and experimental challenges that hinder functional characterization, and present emerging strategies to overcome these barriers. Finally, we highlight both the fundamental and applied benefits that multidisciplinary efforts to characterize viral proteins can bring. By integrating computational predictions with experimental validation, and fostering collaboration across disciplines, we emphasize that illuminating viral dark matter is both feasible and essential for advancing microbial ecology and unlocking new tools for biotechnology.

Abstract:
Spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies enable gene expression profiling with spatial resolution, offering unprecedented insights into tissue organization and disease heterogeneity. However, current analysis methods often struggle with noisy data, limited scalability, and inadequate modelling of complex cellular relationships. We present SemanticST, a biologically informed, graph-based deep learning framework that models diverse cellular contexts through multi-semantic graph construction. SemanticST builds multiple context-specific graphs capturing spatial proximity, gene expression similarity, and tissue domain structure, and learns disentangled embeddings for each. These are fused using an attention-inspired strategy to yield a unified, biologically meaningful representation. A community-aware min-cut loss improves robustness over contrastive learning, particularly in sparse ST data. SemanticST supports mini-batch training, making it the first graph neural network scalable to large-scale datasets such as Xenium (500,000 cells). Benchmarking across four platforms (Visium, Slide-seq, Stereo-seq, Xenium) and multiple human and mouse tissues shows consistent 20 percentage gains in ARI, NMI, and trajectory fidelity over DeepST, GraphST, and IRIS. In re-analysis of breast cancer Xenium data, SemanticST revealed rare and clinically significant niches, including triple receptor-positive clusters, spatially distinct DCIS-to-IDC transition zones, and FOXC2 tumour-associated myoepithelial cells, suggesting non-canonical EMT programs with stem-like features. SemanticST thus provides a scalable, interpretable, and biologically grounded framework for spatial transcriptomics analysis, enabling robust discovery across tissue types and diseases, and paving the way for spatially resolved tissue atlases and next-generation precision medicine.

Abstract:
Raw signal genome analysis (RSGA) has emerged as a promising approach to enable real-time genome analysis by directly analyzing raw electrical signals. However, rapid advancements in sequencing technologies make it increasingly difficult for software-based RSGA to match the throughput of raw signal generation. This paper demonstrates that while hardware acceleration techniques can significantly accelerate RSGA, the high volume of genomic data shifts the performance and energy bottleneck from computation to I/O data movement. As sequencing throughput increases, I/O overhead becomes the main contributor to both runtime and energy consumption. Therefore, there is a need to design a high-performance, energy-efficient system for RSGA that can both alleviate the data movement bottleneck and provide large acceleration capabilities. We propose MARS, a storage-centric system that leverages the heterogeneous resources within modern storage systems (e.g., storage-internal DRAM, storage controller, flash chips) alongside their large storage capacity to tackle both data movement and computational overheads of RSGA in an area-efficient and low-cost manner. MARS accelerates RSGA through a novel hardware/software co-design approach. First, MARS modifies the RSGA pipeline via two filtering mechanisms and a quantization scheme, reducing hardware demands and optimizing for in-storage execution. Second, MARS accelerates the RSGA steps directly within the storage by leveraging both Processing-Near-Memory and Processing-Using-Memory paradigms. Third, MARS orchestrates the execution of all steps to fully exploit in-storage parallelism and minimize data movement. Our evaluation shows that MARS outperforms basecalling-based software and hardware-accelerated state-of-the-art read mapping pipelines by 93x and 40x, on average across different datasets, while reducing their energy consumption by 427x and 72x.

Abstract:
To meet the needs of a large pharmaceutical organization, we set out to create S3Mirror - an application for transferring large genomic sequencing datasets between S3 buckets quickly, reliably, and observably. We used the DBOS Transact durable execution framework to achieve these goals and benchmarked the performance and cost of the application. S3Mirror is an open source DBOS Python application that can run in a variety of environments, including DBOS Cloud Pro, where it runs as much as 40x faster than AWS DataSync at a fraction of the cost. Moreover, S3Mirror is resilient to failures and allows for real-time filewise observability of ongoing and past transfers.

Abstract:
Predicting guide RNA (gRNA) activity is critical for effective CRISPR-Cas12 genome editing but remains challenging due to limited data, variation across protospacer adjacent motifs (PAMs-short sequence requirements for Cas binding), and reliance on large-scale training. We investigate whether pre-trained biological foundation model originally trained on transcriptomic data can improve gRNA activity estimation even without domain-specific pre-training. Using embeddings from existing RNA foundation model as input to lightweight regressor, we show substantial gains over traditional baselines. We also integrate chromatin accessibility data to capture regulatory context, improving performance further. Our results highlight the effectiveness of pre-trained foundation models and chromatin accessibility data for gRNA activity prediction.

Abstract:
Genomic language models (gLMs) hold promise for generating novel, functional DNA sequences for synthetic biology. However, realizing this potential requires models to go beyond evolutionary plausibility and understand how DNA sequence encodes gene expression and regulation. We introduce a benchmark called Nullsettes, which assesses how well models can predict in silico loss-of-function (LOF) mutations, in synthetic expression cassettes with little evolutionary precedent. Testing 12 state-of-the-art gLMs, we find that most fail to consistently detect these strong LOF mutations. All models show a sharp drop in predictive accuracy as the likelihood assigned to the original (nonmutant) sequence decreases, suggesting that gLMs rely heavily on pattern-matching to their evolutionary prior rather than on any mechanistic understanding of gene expression. Our findings highlight fundamental limitations in how gLMs generalize to engineered, non-natural sequences, and underscore the need for benchmarks and modeling strategies that prioritize functional understanding.

Abstract:
In this paper, we study the efficacy and utility of recent advances in non-local, non-linear image interpolation and extrapolation algorithms, specifically, ideas based on Implicit Neural Representations (INR), as a tool for analysis of spatial transcriptomics data. We seek to utilize the microarray gene expression data sparsely sampled in the healthy human brain, and produce fully resolved spatial maps of any given gene across the whole brain at a voxel-level resolution. To do so, we first obtained the 100 top AD risk genes, whose baseline spatial transcriptional profiles were obtained from the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA). We adapted Implicit Neural Representation models so that the pipeline can produce robust voxel-resolution quantitative maps of all genes. We present a variety of experiments using interpolations obtained from Abagen as a baseline/reference.

Abstract:
Single-cell transcriptomics and proteomics have become a great source for data-driven insights into biology, enabling the use of advanced deep learning methods to understand cellular heterogeneity and gene expression at the single-cell level. With the advent of spatial-omics data, we have the promise of characterizing cells within their tissue context as it provides both spatial coordinates and intra-cellular transcriptional or protein counts. Proteomics offers a complementary view by directly measuring proteins, which are the primary effectors of cellular function and key therapeutic targets. However, existing models either ignore the spatial information or the complex genetic and proteomic programs within cells. Thus they cannot infer how cell internal regulation adapts to microenvironmental cues. Furthermore, these models often utilize fixed gene vocabularies, hindering their generalizability unseen genes. In this paper, we introduce HEIST, a hierarchical graph transformer foundation model for spatial transcriptomics and proteomics. HEIST models tissues as hierarchical graphs. The higher level graph is a spatial cell graph, and each cell in turn, is represented by its lower level gene co-expression network graph. HEIST achieves this by performing both intra-level and cross-level message passing to utilize the hierarchy in its embeddings and can thus generalize to novel datatypes including spatial proteomics without retraining. HEIST is pretrained on 22.3M cells from 124 tissues across 15 organs using spatially-aware contrastive and masked autoencoding objectives. Unsupervised analysis of HEIST embeddings reveals spatially informed subpopulations missed by prior models. Downstream evaluations demonstrate generalizability to proteomics data and state-of-the-art performance in clinical outcome prediction, cell type annotation, and gene imputation across multiple technologies.

Abstract:
Pathogen genome data offers valuable structure for spatial models, but its utility is limited by incomplete sequencing coverage. We propose a probabilistic framework for inferring genetic distances between unsequenced cases and known sequences within defined transmission chains, using time-aware evolutionary distance modeling. The method estimates pairwise divergence from collection dates and observed genetic distances, enabling biologically plausible imputation grounded in observed divergence patterns, without requiring sequence alignment or known transmission chains. Applied to highly pathogenic avian influenza A/H5 cases in wild birds in the United States, this approach supports scalable, uncertainty-aware augmentation of genomic datasets and enhances the integration of evolutionary information into spatiotemporal modeling workflows.

Abstract:
As a core mechanism of epigenetic regulation in eukaryotes, protein post-translational modifications (PTMs) require precise prediction to decipher dynamic life activity networks. To address the limitations of existing deep learning models in cross-modal feature fusion, domain generalization, and architectural optimization, this study proposes UniPTMs: the first unified framework for multi-type PTM prediction. The framework innovatively establishes a "Master-Slave" dual-path collaborative architecture: The master path dynamically integrates high-dimensional representations of protein sequences, structures, and evolutionary information through a Bidirectional Gated Cross-Attention (BGCA) module, while the slave path optimizes feature discrepancies and recalibration between structural and traditional features using a Low-Dimensional Fusion Network (LDFN). Complemented by a Multi-scale Adaptive convolutional Pyramid (MACP) for capturing local feature patterns and a Bidirectional Hierarchical Gated Fusion Network (BHGFN) enabling multi-level feature integration across paths, the framework employs a Hierarchical Dynamic Weighting Fusion (HDWF) mechanism to intelligently aggregate multimodal features. Enhanced by a novel Hierarchical Contrastive loss function for feature consistency optimization, UniPTMs demonstrates significant performance improvements (3.2%-11.4% MCC and 4.2%-14.3% AP increases) over state-of-the-art models across five modification types and transcends the Single-Type Prediction Paradigm. To strike a balance between model complexity and performance, we have also developed a lightweight variant named UniPTMs-mini.

Abstract:
Gene set analysis (GSA) is a foundational approach for interpreting genomic data of diseases by linking genes to biological processes. However, conventional GSA methods overlook clinical context of the analyses, often generating long lists of enriched pathways with redundant, nonspecific, or irrelevant results. Interpreting these requires extensive, ad-hoc manual effort, reducing both reliability and reproducibility. To address this limitation, we introduce cGSA, a novel AI-driven framework that enhances GSA by incorporating context-aware pathway prioritization. cGSA integrates gene cluster detection, enrichment analysis, and large language models to identify pathways that are not only statistically significant but also biologically meaningful. Benchmarking on 102 manually curated gene sets across 19 diseases and ten disease-related biological mechanisms shows that cGSA outperforms baseline methods by over 30%, with expert validation confirming its increased precision and interpretability. Two independent case studies in melanoma and breast cancer further demonstrate its potential to uncover context-specific insights and support targeted hypothesis generation.

Abstract:
Learning on small data is a challenge frequently encountered in many real-world applications. In this work we study how effective quantum ensemble models are when trained on small data problems in healthcare and life sciences. We constructed multiple types of quantum ensembles for binary classification using up to 26 qubits in simulation and 56 qubits on quantum hardware. Our ensemble designs use minimal trainable parameters but require long-range connections between qubits. We tested these quantum ensembles on synthetic datasets and gene expression data from renal cell carcinoma patients with the task of predicting patient response to immunotherapy. From the performance observed in simulation and initial hardware experiments, we demonstrate how quantum embedding structure affects performance and discuss how to extract informative features and build models that can learn and generalize effectively. We present these exploratory results in order to assist other researchers in the design of effective learning on small data using ensembles. Incorporating quantum computing in these data constrained problems offers hope for a wide range of studies in healthcare and life sciences where biological samples are relatively scarce given the feature space to be explored.

Abstract:
Natural Language Processing (NLP) has transformed various fields beyond linguistics by applying techniques originally developed for human language to the analysis of biological sequences. This review explores the application of NLP methods to biological sequence data, focusing on genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics. We examine how various NLP methods, from classic approaches like word2vec to advanced models employing transformers and hyena operators, are being adapted to analyze DNA, RNA, protein sequences, and entire genomes. The review also examines tokenization strategies and model architectures, evaluating their strengths, limitations, and suitability for different biological tasks. We further cover recent advances in NLP applications for biological data, such as structure prediction, gene expression, and evolutionary analysis, highlighting the potential of these methods for extracting meaningful insights from large-scale genomic data. As language models continue to advance, their integration into bioinformatics holds immense promise for advancing our understanding of biological processes in all domains of life.

Abstract:
Modern single-cell datasets now comprise hundreds of millions of cells, presenting significant challenges for training deep learning models that require shuffled, memory-efficient data loading. While the AnnData format is the community standard for storing single-cell datasets, existing data loading solutions for AnnData are often inadequate: some require loading all data into memory, others convert to dense formats that increase storage demands, and many are hampered by slow random disk access. We present scDataset, a PyTorch IterableDataset that operates directly on one or more AnnData files without the need for format conversion. The core innovation is a combination of block sampling and batched fetching, which together balance randomness and I/O efficiency. On the Tahoe 100M dataset, scDataset achieves up to a 48$\times$ speed-up over AnnLoader, a 27$\times$ speed-up over HuggingFace Datasets, and an 18$\times$ speed-up over BioNeMo in single-core settings. These advances democratize large-scale single-cell model training for the broader research community.

Abstract:
Inspired by the success of unsupervised pre-training paradigms, researchers have applied these approaches to DNA pre-training. However, we argue that these approaches alone yield suboptimal results because pure DNA sequences lack sufficient information, since their functions are regulated by genomic profiles like chromatin accessibility. Here, we demonstrate that supervised training for genomic profile prediction serves as a more effective alternative to pure sequence pre-training. Furthermore, considering the multi-species and multi-profile nature of genomic profile prediction, we introduce our $\textbf{S}$pecies-$\textbf{P}$rofile $\textbf{A}$daptive $\textbf{C}$ollaborative $\textbf{E}$xperts (SPACE) that leverages Mixture of Experts (MoE) to better capture the relationships between DNA sequences across different species and genomic profiles, thereby learning more effective DNA representations. Through extensive experiments across various tasks, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance, establishing that DNA models trained with supervised genomic profiles serve as powerful DNA representation learners.

Abstract:
Climate change is a major threat to crop potential and is characterized by both long-term shifts in temperature and precipitation patterns as well as increased occurrence of extreme weather events, these extreme weather events are the most immediate and intractable threat to agriculture. Crop resilience in the face of stress depends upon the speed and effectiveness with which plants and cropping systems sense and respond to that stress. A variety of agronomic practices including breeding, exogenous inputs (nutrients, water, biostimulants and others) and shifts in cultivation practice have been used to influence plant stress response to achieve the goal of increased plant and cropping system resilience. Traditional breeding is a powerful tool that has resulted in stable and long-term cultivar improvements but is often too slow and complex to meet the diverse, complex and unpredictable challenges of climate induced stresses. Increased inputs (water, nutrients, pesticides etc.) and management strategies (cropping system choice, soil management etc.) can alleviate stress but are often constrained by cost and availability of inputs. Exogenous biostimulants, microbials and plant hormones have shown great promise as mechanisms to optimize natural plant resilience resulting in immediate but non-permanent improvements in plant responses to climate induced stresses. The failure to modernize regulatory frameworks for the use of biostimulants in agriculture will constrain the development of safe effective tools and deprive growers of means to respond to the vagaries of climate change. Here we discuss the scientific rationale for eliminating the regulatory barriers that constrain the potential for biostimulants or products that modulate plant regulatory networks to address climate change challenges and propose a framework for enabling legislation to strengthen cropping system resilience.

Abstract:
Multiplexed immunofluorescence microscopy captures detailed measurements of spatially resolved, multiple biomarkers simultaneously, revealing tissue composition and cellular interactions in situ among single cells. The growing scale and dimensional complexity of these datasets demand reproducible, comprehensive and user-friendly computational tools. To address this need, we developed SPAC (SPAtial single-Cell analysis), a Python-based package and a corresponding shiny application within an integrated, modular SPAC ecosystem (Liu et al., 2025) designed specifically for biologists without extensive coding expertise. Following image segmentation and extraction of spatially resolved single-cell data, SPAC streamlines downstream phenotyping and spatial analysis, facilitating characterization of cellular heterogeneity and spatial organization within tissues. Through scalable performance, specialized spatial statistics, highly customizable visualizations, and seamless workflows from dataset to insights, SPAC significantly lowers barriers to sophisticated spatial analyses.

Abstract:
Recent studies have shown that integrating multimodal data fusion techniques for imaging and genetic features is beneficial for the etiological analysis and predictive diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, there are several critical flaws in current deep learning methods. Firstly, there has been insufficient discussion and exploration regarding the selection and encoding of genetic information. Secondly, due to the significantly superior classification value of AD imaging features compared to genetic features, many studies in multimodal fusion emphasize the strengths of imaging features, actively mitigating the influence of weaker features, thereby diminishing the learning of the unique value of genetic features. To address this issue, this study proposes the dynamic multimodal role-swapping network (GenDMR). In GenDMR, we develop a novel approach to encode the spatial organization of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), enhancing the representation of their genomic context. Additionally, to adaptively quantify the disease risk of SNPs and brain region, we propose a multi-instance attention module to enhance model interpretability. Furthermore, we introduce a dominant modality selection module and a contrastive self-distillation module, combining them to achieve a dynamic teacher-student role exchange mechanism based on dominant and auxiliary modalities for bidirectional co-updating of different modal data. Finally, GenDMR achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ADNI public dataset and visualizes attention to different SNPs, focusing on confirming 12 potential high-risk genes related to AD, including the most classic APOE and recently highlighted significant risk genes. This demonstrates GenDMR's interpretable analytical capability in exploring AD genetic features, providing new insights and perspectives for the development of multimodal data fusion techniques.

Abstract:
Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia is the most common form of dementia. With the emergence of disease-modifying therapies, predicting disease risk before symptom onset has become critical. We introduce DuAL-Net, a hybrid deep learning framework for AD dementia prediction using whole genome sequencing (WGS) data. DuAL-Net integrates two components: local probability modeling, which segments the genome into non-overlapping windows, and global annotation-based modeling, which annotates SNPs and reorganizes WGS input to capture long-range functional relationships. Both employ out-of-fold stacking with TabNet and Random Forest classifiers. Final predictions combine local and global probabilities using an optimized weighting parameter alpha. We analyzed WGS data from 1,050 individuals (443 cognitively normal, 607 AD dementia) using five-fold cross-validation. DuAL-Net achieved an AUC of 0.671 using top-ranked SNPs, representing 35.0% and 20.3% higher performance than bottom-ranked and randomly selected SNPs, respectively. ROC analysis demonstrated strong positive correlation between SNP prioritization rank and predictive power. The model identified known AD-associated SNPs as top contributors alongside potentially novel variants. DuAL-Net presents a promising framework improving both predictive accuracy and biological interpretability. The framework and web implementation offer an accessible platform for broader research applications.

Abstract:
INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is genetically complex, complicating robust classification from genomic data. METHODS: We developed a transformer-based ensemble model (TrUE-Net) using Monte Carlo Dropout for uncertainty estimation in AD classification from whole-genome sequencing (WGS). We combined a transformer that preserves single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sequence structure with a concurrent random forest using flattened genotypes. An uncertainty threshold separated samples into an uncertain (high-variance) group and a more certain (low-variance) group. RESULTS: We analyzed 1050 individuals, holding out half for testing. Overall accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) were 0.6514 and 0.6636, respectively. Excluding the uncertain group improved accuracy from 0.6263 to 0.7287 (10.24% increase) and F1 from 0.5843 to 0.8205 (23.62% increase). DISCUSSION: Monte Carlo Dropout-driven uncertainty helps identify ambiguous cases that may require further clinical evaluation, thus improving reliability in AD genomic classification.

Abstract:
Low-cost, high-throughput DNA and RNA sequencing (HTS) data is the main workforce for the life sciences. Genome sequencing is now becoming a part of Predictive, Preventive, Personalized, and Participatory (termed 'P4') medicine. All genomic data are currently processed in energy-hungry computer clusters and centers, necessitating data transfer, consuming substantial energy, and wasting valuable time. Therefore, there is a need for fast, energy-efficient, and cost-efficient technologies that enable genomics research without requiring data centers and cloud platforms. We recently started the BioPIM Project to leverage the emerging processing-in-memory (PIM) technologies to enable energy and cost-efficient analysis of bioinformatics workloads. The BioPIM Project focuses on co-designing algorithms and data structures commonly used in genomics with several PIM architectures for the highest cost, energy, and time savings benefit.

Abstract:
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized our understanding of cellular processes by enabling gene expression analysis at the individual cell level. Clustering allows for the identification of cell types and the further discovery of intrinsic patterns in single-cell data. However, the high dimensionality and sparsity of scRNA-seq data continue to challenge existing clustering models. In this paper, we introduce JojoSCL, a novel self-supervised contrastive learning framework for scRNA-seq clustering. By incorporating a shrinkage estimator based on hierarchical Bayesian estimation, which adjusts gene expression estimates towards more reliable cluster centroids to reduce intra-cluster dispersion, and optimized using Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimate (SURE), JojoSCL refines both instance-level and cluster-level contrastive learning. Experiments on ten scRNA-seq datasets substantiate that JojoSCL consistently outperforms prevalent clustering methods, with further validation of its practicality through robustness analysis and ablation studies. JojoSCL's code is available at: https://github.com/ziwenwang28/JojoSCL.

Abstract:
Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) analysis is a powerful, minimally invasive tool for monitoring disease progression, treatment response, and early detection. A major challenge, however, is accurately determining the tissue of origin, especially in complex or heterogeneous disease contexts. To address this, we developed a machine learning framework that leverages tissue-specific DNA methylation signatures to classify both tissue and disease origin from cfDNA data. Our model integrates methylation datasets across diverse epigenomic platforms, including Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS), Illumina Infinium Bead Arrays, and Enzymatic Methyl-seq (EM-seq). To account for platform variability and data sparsity, we applied imputation strategies and harmonized CpG features to enable cross-platform learning. Dimensionality reduction revealed clear tissue-specific clustering of methylation profiles. A random forest classifier trained on these features achieved consistent classification performance (accuracy 0.75-0.8 across test sets and platforms). Notably, our model distinguished clinically relevant tissues such as inflamed synovium and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in arthritis patients and deconvoluted synthetic cfDNA mixtures mimicking real-world liquid biopsy samples. The predicted tissue proportions closely matched the true values, demonstrating the model's potential for both classification and quantitative inference. These results support the feasibility of using cross-platform methylation data and machine learning for scalable, generalizable cfDNA diagnostics and lay the groundwork for future integration of disease-specific epigenetic features to guide clinical decision-making in precision medicine.

Abstract:
Accurately predicting gene mutations, mutation subtypes and their exons in lung cancer is critical for personalized treatment planning and prognostic assessment. Faced with regional disparities in medical resources and the high cost of genomic assays, using artificial intelligence to infer these mutations and exon variants from routine histopathology images could greatly facilitate precision therapy. Although some prior studies have shown that deep learning can accelerate the prediction of key gene mutations from lung cancer pathology slides, their performance remains suboptimal and has so far been limited mainly to early screening tasks. To address these limitations, we have assembled PathGene, which comprises histopathology images paired with next-generation sequencing reports from 1,576 patients at the Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, and 448 TCGA-LUAD patients. This multi-center dataset links whole-slide images to driver gene mutation status, mutation subtypes, exon, and tumor mutational burden (TMB) status, with the goal of leveraging pathology images to predict mutations, subtypes, exon locations, and TMB for early genetic screening and to advance precision oncology. Unlike existing datasets, we provide molecular-level information related to histopathology images in PathGene to facilitate the development of biomarker prediction models. We benchmarked 11 multiple-instance learning methods on PathGene for mutation, subtype, exon, and TMB prediction tasks. These experimental methods provide valuable alternatives for early genetic screening of lung cancer patients and assisting clinicians to quickly develop personalized precision targeted treatment plans for patients.

Abstract:
Background: Platelet proteomics offers valuable insights for clinical research, yet isolating high-purity platelets remains a challenge. Current methods often lead to contamination or platelet loss, compromising data quality and reproducibility.   Objectives: This study aimed to optimize a platelet isolation technique that yields high-purity samples with minimal loss and to identify the most effective mass spectrometry-based proteomic method for analyzing platelet proteins with optimal coverage and sensitivity.   Methods: We refined an isolation protocol by adjusting centrifugation time to reduce blood volume requirements while preserving platelet yield and purity. Using this optimized method, we evaluated three proteomic approaches: Label-free Quantification with Data-Independent Acquisition (LFQ-DIA), Label-free Quantification with Data-Dependent Acquisition (LFQ-DDA), and Tandem Mass Tag labeling with DDA (TMT-DDA).   Results: LFQ-DIA demonstrated superior protein coverage and sensitivity compared to LFQ-DDA and TMT-DDA. The refined isolation protocol effectively minimized contamination and platelet loss. Additionally, age-related differences in platelet protein composition were observed, highlighting the importance of using age-matched controls in biomarker discovery studies.   Conclusions: The optimized platelet isolation protocol provides a cost-effective and reliable method for preparing high-purity samples for proteomics. LFQ-DIA is the most suitable approach for comprehensive platelet protein analysis. Age-related variation in platelet proteomes underscores the need for demographic matching in clinical proteomic research.

Abstract:
Potato functional genomics lags due to unsystematic gene information curation, gene identifier inconsistencies across reference genome versions, and the increasing volume of research publications. To address these limitations, we developed the Potato Knowledge Hub (http://www.potato-ai.top), leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and a systematically curated collection of over 3,200 high-quality potato research papers spanning over 120 years. This platform integrates two key modules: a functional gene database containing 2,571 literature-reported genes, meticulously mapped to the latest DMv8.1 reference genome with resolved nomenclature discrepancies and links to original publications; and a potato knowledge base. The knowledge base, built using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture, accurately answers research queries with literature citations, mitigating LLM "hallucination." Users can interact with the hub via a natural language AI agent, "Potato Research Assistant," for querying specialized knowledge, retrieving gene information, and extracting sequences. The continuously updated Potato Knowledge Hub aims to be a comprehensive resource, fostering advancements in potato functional genomics and supporting breeding programs.

Abstract:
Topologically Associating Chromatic Domains are spatially distinct chromatin regions that regulate transcription by segregating active and inactive genomic elements. Empirical studies show that their formation correlates with local patterns of epigenetic markers, yet the precise mechanisms linking 1D epigenetic landscapes to 3D chromatin folding remain unclear. Recent models represent chromatin as a spin system, where nucleosomes are treated as discrete-state variables coupled by interaction strengths derived from genomic and epigenomic data. Classical samplers struggle with these models due to high frustration and dense couplings. Here, we present a quantum annealing (QA) approach to efficiently sample chromatin states, embedding an epigenetic Ising model into the topology of D-Wave quantum processors.

Abstract:
DNA, encoding genetic instructions for almost all living organisms, fuels groundbreaking advances in genomics and synthetic biology. Recently, DNA Foundation Models have achieved success in designing synthetic functional DNA sequences, even whole genomes, but their susceptibility to jailbreaking remains underexplored, leading to potential concern of generating harmful sequences such as pathogens or toxin-producing genes. In this paper, we introduce GeneBreaker, the first framework to systematically evaluate jailbreak vulnerabilities of DNA foundation models. GeneBreaker employs (1) an LLM agent with customized bioinformatic tools to design high-homology, non-pathogenic jailbreaking prompts, (2) beam search guided by PathoLM and log-probability heuristics to steer generation toward pathogen-like sequences, and (3) a BLAST-based evaluation pipeline against a curated Human Pathogen Database (JailbreakDNABench) to detect successful jailbreaks. Evaluated on our JailbreakDNABench, GeneBreaker successfully jailbreaks the latest Evo series models across 6 viral categories consistently (up to 60\% Attack Success Rate for Evo2-40B). Further case studies on SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and HIV-1 envelope protein demonstrate the sequence and structural fidelity of jailbreak output, while evolutionary modeling of SARS-CoV-2 underscores biosecurity risks. Our findings also reveal that scaling DNA foundation models amplifies dual-use risks, motivating enhanced safety alignment and tracing mechanisms.

Abstract:
Inspired by the great success of Masked Language Modeling (MLM) in the natural language domain, the paradigm of self-supervised pre-training and fine-tuning has also achieved remarkable progress in the field of DNA sequence modeling. However, previous methods often relied on massive pre-training data or large-scale base models with huge parameters, imposing a significant computational burden. To address this, many works attempted to use more compact models to achieve similar outcomes but still fell short by a considerable margin. In this work, we propose a Hybrid Architecture Distillation (HAD) approach, leveraging both distillation and reconstruction tasks for more efficient and effective pre-training. Specifically, we employ the NTv2-500M as the teacher model and devise a grouping masking strategy to align the feature embeddings of visible tokens while concurrently reconstructing the invisible tokens during MLM pre-training. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we conducted comprehensive experiments on the Nucleotide Transformer Benchmark and Genomic Benchmark. Compared to models with similar parameters, our model achieved excellent performance. More surprisingly, it even surpassed the distillation ceiling-teacher model on some sub-tasks, which is more than 500 $\times$ larger. Lastly, we utilize t-SNE for more intuitive visualization, which shows that our model can gain a sophisticated understanding of the intrinsic representation pattern in genomic sequences.

Abstract:
Designing regulatory DNA sequences that achieve precise cell-type-specific gene expression is crucial for advancements in synthetic biology, gene therapy and precision medicine. Although transformer-based language models (LMs) can effectively capture patterns in regulatory DNA, their generative approaches often struggle to produce novel sequences with reliable cell-specific activity. Here, we introduce Ctrl-DNA, a novel constrained reinforcement learning (RL) framework tailored for designing regulatory DNA sequences with controllable cell-type specificity. By formulating regulatory sequence design as a biologically informed constrained optimization problem, we apply RL to autoregressive genomic LMs, enabling the models to iteratively refine sequences that maximize regulatory activity in targeted cell types while constraining off-target effects. Our evaluation on human promoters and enhancers demonstrates that Ctrl-DNA consistently outperforms existing generative and RL-based approaches, generating high-fitness regulatory sequences and achieving state-of-the-art cell-type specificity. Moreover, Ctrl-DNA-generated sequences capture key cell-type-specific transcription factor binding sites (TFBS), short DNA motifs recognized by regulatory proteins that control gene expression, demonstrating the biological plausibility of the generated sequences.

Abstract:
In the crowded eukaryotic nucleus, euchromatin and heterochromatin segregate into distinct compartments, a phenomenon often attributed to homotypic interactions mediated by liquid liquid phase separation of chromatin associated proteins. Here, we revisit genome compartmentalization by examining the role of in vivo DNA packing density fluctuations driven by ATP dependent chromatin remodelers. Leveraging DNA accessibility data, we develop a polymer based model that captures these fluctuations and successfully reproduces genome wide compartment patterns observed in HiC data, without invoking homotypic interactions. Further analysis reveals that density fluctuations in a crowded nuclear environment elevate the system energy, while euchromatin heterochromatin segregation facilitates energy dissipation, offering a thermodynamic advantage for spontaneous compartment formation. These findings suggest that euchromatin heterochromatin segregation may arise through a non equilibrium, self organizing process, providing new insights into genome organization.

Abstract:
Brain aging trajectories differ between males and females, yet the genetic factors underlying these differences remain underexplored. Using structural MRI and genotyping data from 40,940 UK Biobank participants (aged 45-83), we computed Brain Age Gap Estimates (BrainAGE) for total brain, hippocampal, and ventricular volumes. We conducted sex-stratified genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and Post-GWAS analyses to identify genetic variants associated with accelerated brain aging. Distinct gene sets emerged by sex: in females, neurotransmitter transport and mitochondrial stress response genes were implicated; in males, immune and inflammation-related genes dominated. Shared genes, including GMNC and OSTN, were consistently linked to brain volumes across sexes, suggesting core roles in neurostructural maintenance. Tissue expression analyses revealed sex-specific enrichment in pathways tied to neurodegeneration. These findings highlight the importance of sex-stratified approaches in aging research and suggest genetic targets for personalized interventions against age-related cognitive decline.

Abstract:
Spatial transcriptomics (ST) has emerged as a powerful technology for bridging histology imaging with gene expression profiling. However, its application has been limited by low throughput and the need for specialized experimental facilities. Prior works sought to predict ST from whole-slide histology images to accelerate this process, but they suffer from two major limitations. First, they do not explicitly model cell-cell interaction as they factorize the joint distribution of whole-slide ST data and predict the gene expression of each spot independently. Second, their encoders struggle with memory constraints due to the large number of spots (often exceeding 10,000) in typical ST datasets. Herein, we propose STFlow, a flow matching generative model that considers cell-cell interaction by modeling the joint distribution of gene expression of an entire slide. It also employs an efficient slide-level encoder with local spatial attention, enabling whole-slide processing without excessive memory overhead. On the recently curated HEST-1k and STImage-1K4M benchmarks, STFlow substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and achieves over 18% relative improvements over the pathology foundation models.

Abstract:
Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing and are increasingly applied to other sequential data types, including genetic sequences. However, adapting LLMs to genomics presents significant challenges. Capturing complex genomic interactions requires modeling long-range dependencies within DNA sequences, where interactions often span over 10,000 base pairs, even within a single gene, posing substantial computational burdens under conventional model architectures and training paradigms. Moreover, standard LLM training approaches are suboptimal for DNA: autoregressive training, while efficient, supports only unidirectional understanding. However, DNA is inherently bidirectional, e.g., bidirectional promoters regulate transcription in both directions and account for nearly 11% of human gene expression. Masked language models (MLMs) allow bidirectional understanding but are inefficient, as only masked tokens contribute to the loss per step. To address these limitations, we introduce JanusDNA, the first bidirectional DNA foundation model built upon a novel pretraining paradigm that combines the optimization efficiency of autoregressive modeling with the bidirectional comprehension of masked modeling. JanusDNA adopts a hybrid Mamba, Attention and Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, combining long-range modeling of Attention with efficient sequential learning of Mamba. MoE layers further scale model capacity via sparse activation while keeping computational cost low. Notably, JanusDNA processes up to 1 million base pairs at single nucleotide resolution on a single 80GB GPU. Extensive experiments and ablations show JanusDNA achieves new SOTA results on three genomic representation benchmarks, outperforming models with 250x more activated parameters.

Abstract:
Sequencing a genome to determine an individual's DNA produces an enormous number of short nucleotide subsequences known as reads, which must be reassembled to reconstruct the full genome. We present a method for analyzing this type of data using contrastive learning, in which an encoder model is trained to produce embeddings that cluster together sequences from the same genomic region. The sequential nature of genomic regions is preserved in the form of trajectories through this embedding space. Trained solely to reflect the structure of the genome, the resulting model provides a general representation of $k$-mer sequences, suitable for a range of downstream tasks involving read data. We apply our framework to learn the structure of the $E.\ coli$ genome, and demonstrate its use in simulated ancient DNA (aDNA) read mapping and identification of structural variations. Furthermore, we illustrate the potential of using this type of model for metagenomic species identification. We show how incorporating a domain-specific noise model can enhance embedding robustness, and how a supervised contrastive learning setting can be adopted when a linear reference genome is available, by introducing a distance thresholding parameter $Γ$. The model can also be trained fully self-supervised on read data, enabling analysis without the need to construct a full genome assembly using specialized algorithms. Small prediction heads based on a pre-trained embedding are shown to perform on par with BWA-aln, the current gold standard approach for aDNA mapping, in terms of accuracy and runtime for short genomes. Given the method's favorable scaling properties with respect to total genome size, inference using our approach is highly promising for metagenomic applications and for mapping to genomes comparable in size to the human genome.

Abstract:
Causal discovery in multi-omic datasets is crucial for understanding the bigger picture of gene regulatory mechanisms, but remains challenging due to high dimensionality, differentiation of direct from indirect relationships, and hidden confounders. We introduce GENESIS (GEne Network inference from Expression SIgnals and SNPs), a constraint-based algorithm that leverages the natural causal precedence of genotypes to infer ancestral relationships in transcriptomic data. Unlike traditional causal discovery methods that start with a fully connected graph, GENESIS initialises an empty ancestrality matrix and iteratively populates it with direct, indirect or non-causal relationships using a series of provably sound marginal and conditional independence tests. By integrating genotypes as fixed causal anchors, GENESIS provides a principled ``head start'' to classical causal discovery algorithms, restricting the search space to biologically plausible edges. We test GENESIS on synthetic and real-world genomic datasets. This framework offers a powerful avenue for uncovering causal pathways in complex traits, with promising applications to functional genomics, drug discovery, and precision medicine.

Abstract:
Respiratory viral infections pose a global health burden, yet the cellular immune responses driving protection or pathology remain unclear. Natural infection cohorts often lack pre-exposure baseline data and structured temporal sampling. In contrast, inoculation and vaccination trials generate insightful longitudinal transcriptomic data. However, the scattering of these datasets across platforms, along with inconsistent metadata and preprocessing procedure, hinders AI-driven discovery. To address these challenges, we developed the Human Respiratory Viral Immunization LongitudinAl Gene Expression (HR-VILAGE-3K3M) repository: an AI-ready, rigorously curated dataset that integrates 14,136 RNA-seq profiles from 3,178 subjects across 66 studies encompassing over 2.56 million cells. Spanning vaccination, inoculation, and mixed exposures, the dataset includes microarray, bulk RNA-seq, and single-cell RNA-seq from whole blood, PBMCs, and nasal swabs, sourced from GEO, ImmPort, and ArrayExpress. We harmonized subject-level metadata, standardized outcome measures, applied unified preprocessing pipelines with rigorous quality control, and aligned all data to official gene symbols. To demonstrate the utility of HR-VILAGE-3K3M, we performed predictive modeling of vaccine responders and evaluated batch-effect correction methods. Beyond these initial demonstrations, it supports diverse systems immunology applications and benchmarking of feature selection and transfer learning algorithms. Its scale and heterogeneity also make it ideal for pretraining foundation models of the human immune response and for advancing multimodal learning frameworks. As the largest longitudinal transcriptomic resource for human respiratory viral immunization, it provides an accessible platform for reproducible AI-driven research, accelerating systems immunology and vaccine development against emerging viral threats.

Abstract:
The advent of single-cell Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (scATAC-seq) offers an innovative perspective for deciphering regulatory mechanisms by assembling a vast repository of single-cell chromatin accessibility data. While foundation models have achieved significant success in single-cell transcriptomics, there is currently no foundation model for scATAC-seq that supports zero-shot high-quality cell identification and comprehensive multi-omics analysis simultaneously. Key challenges lie in the high dimensionality and sparsity of scATAC-seq data, as well as the lack of a standardized schema for representing open chromatin regions (OCRs). Here, we present ChromFound, a foundation model tailored for scATAC-seq. ChromFound utilizes a hybrid architecture and genome-aware tokenization to effectively capture genome-wide long contexts and regulatory signals from dynamic chromatin landscapes. Pretrained on 1.97 million cells from 30 tissues and 6 disease conditions, ChromFound demonstrates broad applicability across 6 diverse tasks. Notably, it achieves robust zero-shot performance in generating universal cell representations and exhibits excellent transferability in cell type annotation and cross-omics prediction. By uncovering enhancer-gene links undetected by existing computational methods, ChromFound offers a promising framework for understanding disease risk variants in the noncoding genome.

Abstract:
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) reveals cell heterogeneity, with cell clustering playing a key role in identifying cell types and marker genes. Recent advances, especially graph neural networks (GNNs)-based methods, have significantly improved clustering performance. However, the analysis of scRNA-seq data remains challenging due to noise, sparsity, and high dimensionality. Compounding these challenges, GNNs often suffer from over-smoothing, limiting their ability to capture complex biological information. In response, we propose scSiameseClu, a novel Siamese Clustering framework for interpreting single-cell RNA-seq data, comprising of 3 key steps: (1) Dual Augmentation Module, which applies biologically informed perturbations to the gene expression matrix and cell graph relationships to enhance representation robustness; (2) Siamese Fusion Module, which combines cross-correlation refinement and adaptive information fusion to capture complex cellular relationships while mitigating over-smoothing; and (3) Optimal Transport Clustering, which utilizes Sinkhorn distance to efficiently align cluster assignments with predefined proportions while maintaining balance. Comprehensive evaluations on seven real-world datasets demonstrate that scSiameseClu outperforms state-of-the-art methods in single-cell clustering, cell type annotation, and cell type classification, providing a powerful tool for scRNA-seq data interpretation.

Abstract:
Compendium Manager is a command-line tool written in Python to automate the provisioning, launch, and evaluation of bioinformatics pipelines. Although workflow management tools such as Snakemake and Nextflow enable users to automate the processing of samples within a single sequencing project, integrating many datasets in bulk requires launching and monitoring hundreds or thousands of pipelines. We present the Compendium Manager, a lightweight command-line tool to enable launching and monitoring analysis pipelines at scale. The tool can gauge progress through a list of projects, load results into a shared database, and record detailed processing metrics for later evaluation and reproducibility.

Abstract:
Colorectal cancer remains a major global health concern, with early detection being pivotal for improving patient outcomes. In this study, we leveraged high throughput methylation profiling of cellfree DNA to identify and validate diagnostic biomarkers for CRC. The GSE124600 study data were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus, as the discovery cohort, comprising 142 CRC and 132 normal cfDNA methylation profiles obtained via MCTA seq. After preprocessing and filtering, 97,863 CpG sites were retained for further analysis. Differential methylation analysis using statistical tests identified 30,791 CpG sites as significantly altered in CRC samples, where p is less than 0.05. Univariate scoring enabled the selection of top ranking features, which were further refined using multiple feature selection algorithms, including Recursive Feature Elimination, Sequential Feature Selection, and SVC L1. Various machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, and Multi layer Perceptron were trained and tested using independent validation datasets. The best performance was achieved with an MLP model trained on 25 features selected by RFE, reaching an AUROC of 0.89 and MCC of 0.78 on validation data. Additionally, a deep learning based convolutional neural network achieved an AUROC of 0.78. Functional annotation of the most predictive CpG sites identified several genes involved in key cellular processes, some of which were validated for differential expression in CRC using the GEPIA2 platform. Our study highlights the potential of cfDNA methylation markers combined with ML and DL models for noninvasive and accurate CRC detection, paving the way for clinically relevant diagnostic tools.

Abstract:
Obesity prevalence in Indonesian adults increased from 10.5% in 2007 to 23.4% in 2023. Studies showed that genetic predisposition significantly influences obesity susceptibility. To aid this, polygenic risk scores (PRS) help aggregate the effects of numerous genetic variants to assess genetic risk. However, 91% of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) involve European populations, limiting their applicability to Indonesians due to genetic diversity. This study aims to develop and validate an ancestry adjusted PRS for obesity in the Indonesian population using principal component analysis (PCA) method constructed from the 1000 Genomes Project data and our own genomic data from approximately 2,800 Indonesians. We calculate PRS for obesity using all races, then determine the first four principal components using ancestry-informative SNPs and develop a linear regression model to predict PRS based on these principal components. The raw PRS is adjusted by subtracting the predicted score to obtain an ancestry adjusted PRS for the Indonesian population. Our results indicate that the ancestry-adjusted PRS improves obesity risk prediction. Compared to the unadjusted PRS, the adjusted score improved classification performance with a 5% increase in area under the ROC curve (AUC). This approach underscores the importance of population-specific adjustments in genetic risk assessments to enable more effective personalized healthcare and targeted intervention strategies for diverse populations.

Abstract:
The investigation of plant transcriptional regulation constitutes a fundamental basis for crop breeding, where cis-regulatory elements (CREs), as the key factor determining gene expression, have become the focus of crop genetic improvement research. Deep learning techniques, leveraging their exceptional capacity for high-dimensional feature extraction and nonlinear regulatory relationship modeling, have been extensively employed in this field. However, current methodologies present notable limitations: single CNN-based architectures struggle to capture long-range regulatory interactions, while existing CNN-Transformer hybrid models demonstrate proneness to overfitting and inadequate generalization in cross-species prediction contexts. To address these challenges, this study proposes DeepPlantCRE, a deep-learning framework for plant gene expression prediction and CRE Extraction. The model employs a Transformer-CNN hybrid architecture that achieves enhanced Accuracy, AUC-ROC, and F1-score metrics over existing baselines (DeepCRE and PhytoExpr), with improved generalization performance and overfitting inhibiting. Cross-species validation experiments conducted on gene expression datasets from \textit{Gossypium}, \textit{Arabidopsis thaliana}, \textit{Solanum lycopersicum}, \textit{Sorghum bicolor}, and \textit{Arabidopsis thaliana} reveal that the model achieves peak prediction accuracy of 92.3\%, particularly excelling in complex genomic data analysis. Furthermore, interpretability investigations using DeepLIFT and Transcription Factor Motif Discovery from the importance scores algorithm (TF-MoDISco) demonstrate that the derived motifs from our model exhibit high concordance with known transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) such as MYR2, TSO1 in JASPAR plant database, substantiating the potential of biological interpretability and practical agricultural application of DeepPlantCRE.

Abstract:
Deep learning-based AI models have been extensively applied in genomics, achieving remarkable success across diverse applications. As these models gain prominence, there exists an urgent need for interpretability methods to establish trustworthiness in model-driven decisions. For genetic researchers, interpretable insights derived from these models hold significant value in providing novel perspectives for understanding biological processes. Current interpretability analyses in genomics predominantly rely on intuition and experience rather than rigorous theoretical foundations. In this review, we systematically categorize interpretability methods into input-based and model-based approaches, while critically evaluating their limitations through concrete biological application scenarios. Furthermore, we establish theoretical underpinnings to elucidate the origins of these constraints through formal mathematical demonstrations, aiming to assist genetic researchers in better understanding and designing models in the future. Finally, we provide feasible suggestions for future research on interpretability in the field of genetics.

Comment: ICLR 2025 Workshop on Machine Learning for Genomics Explorations

Abstract:
The emergence of telomere-to-telomere (T2T) genome assemblies has opened new avenues for comparative genomics, yet effective tokenization strategies for genomic sequences remain underexplored. In this pilot study, we apply Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) to nine T2T primate genomes including three human assemblies by training independent BPE tokenizers with a fixed vocabulary of 512,000 tokens using our custom tool, dnaBPE. Our analysis reveals that only 11,569 tokens are shared across all assemblies, while nearly 991,854 tokens are unique to a single genome, indicating a rapid decline in shared vocabulary with increasing assembly comparisons. Moreover, phylogenetic trees derived from token overlap failed to recapitulate established primate relationships, a discrepancy attributed to the disproportionate influence of species-specific high-copy repetitive elements. These findings underscore the dual nature of BPE tokenization: while it effectively compresses repetitive sequences, its sensitivity to high-copy elements limits its utility as a universal tool for comparative genomics. We discuss potential hybrid strategies and repeat-masking approaches to refine genomic tokenization, emphasizing the need for domain-specific adaptations in the development of large-scale genomic language models. The dnaBPE tool used in this study is open-source and available at https://github.com/aglabx/dnaBPE.

Abstract:
All cells respond to changes in both their internal milieu and the environment around them through the regulation of their genes. Despite decades of effort, there remain huge gaps in our knowledge of both the function of many genes (the so-called y-ome) and how they adapt to changing environments via regulation. Here we describe a joint experimental and theoretical dissection of the regulation of a broad array of over 100 biologically interesting genes in E. coli across 39 diverse environments, permitting us to discover the binding sites and transcription factors that mediate regulatory control. Using a combination of mutagenesis, massively parallel reporter assays, mass spectrometry and tools from information theory and statistical physics, we go from complete ignorance of a promoter's environment-dependent regulatory architecture to predictive models of its behavior. As a proof of principle of the biological insights to be gained from such a study, we chose a combination of genes from the y-ome, toxin-antitoxin pairs, and genes hypothesized to be part of regulatory modules; in all cases, we discovered a host of new insights into their underlying regulatory landscape and resulting biological function.

Abstract:
The rise of large language models and multi-agent systems has sparked growing interest in AI scientists capable of autonomous biological research. However, existing benchmarks either focus on reasoning without data or on data analysis with predefined statistical answers, lacking realistic, data-driven evaluation settings. Here, we introduce the Biological AI Scientist Benchmark (BaisBench), a benchmark designed to assess AI scientists' ability to generate biological discoveries through data analysis and reasoning with external knowledge. BaisBench comprises two tasks: cell type annotation on 31 expert-labeled single-cell datasets, and scientific discovery through answering 198 multiple-choice questions derived from the biological insights of 41 recent single-cell studies. Systematic experiments on state-of-the-art AI scientists and LLM agents showed that while promising, current models still substantially underperform human experts on both tasks. We hope BaisBench will fill this gap and serve as a foundation for advancing and evaluating AI models for scientific discovery. The benchmark can be found at: https://github.com/EperLuo/BaisBench.

Abstract:
De novo assembly enables investigations of unknown genomes, paving the way for personalized medicine and disease management. However, it faces immense computational challenges arising from the excessive data volumes and algorithmic complexity.   While state-of-the-art de novo assemblers utilize distributed systems for extreme-scale genome assembly, they demand substantial computational and memory resources. They also fail to address the inherent challenges of de novo assembly, including a large memory footprint, memory-bound behavior, and irregular data patterns stemming from complex, interdependent data structures. Given these challenges, de novo assembly merits a custom hardware solution, though existing approaches have not fully addressed the limitations.   We propose NMP-PaK, a hardware-software co-design that accelerates scalable de novo genome assembly through near-memory processing (NMP). Our channel-level NMP architecture addresses memory bottlenecks while providing sufficient scratchpad space for processing elements. Customized processing elements maximize parallelism while efficiently handling large data structures that are both dynamic and interdependent. Software optimizations include customized batch processing to reduce the memory footprint and hybrid CPU-NMP processing to address hardware underutilization caused by irregular data patterns.   NMP-PaK conducts the same genome assembly while incurring a 14X smaller memory footprint compared to the state-of-the-art de novo assembly. Moreover, NMP-PaK delivers a 16X performance improvement over the CPU baseline, with a 2.4X reduction in memory operations. Consequently, NMP-PaK achieves 8.3X greater throughput than state-of-the-art de novo assembly under the same resource constraints, showcasing its superior computational efficiency.

Abstract:
A significant advancement in bioinformatics is using genome graph techniques to improve variation discovery across organisms. Traditional approaches, such as bwa mem, rely on linear reference genomes for genomic analyses but may introduce biases when applied to highly diverse bacterial genomes of the same species. Pangenome graphs provide an alternative paradigm for evaluating structural and minor variations within a graphical framework, including insertions, deletions, and single nucleotide polymorphisms. Pangenome graphs enhance the detection and interpretation of complex genetic variants by representing the full genetic diversity of a species. In this study, we present a robust and reliable bioinformatics pipeline utilising the PanGenome Graph Builder (PGGB) and the Variation Graph toolbox (vg giraffe) to align whole-genome sequencing data, call variants against a graph reference, and construct pangenomes from assembled genomes. Our results demonstrate that leveraging pangenome graphs over a single linear reference genome significantly improves mapping rates and variant calling accuracy for simulated and actual bacterial pathogens datasets.

Abstract:
Understanding cell identity and function through single-cell level sequencing data remains a key challenge in computational biology. We present a novel framework that leverages gene-specific textual annotations from the NCBI Gene database to generate biologically contextualized cell embeddings. For each cell in a single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) dataset, we rank genes by expression level, retrieve their NCBI Gene descriptions, and transform these descriptions into vector embedding representations using large language models (LLMs). The models used include OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002, text-embedding-3-small, and text-embedding-3-large (Jan 2024), as well as domain-specific models BioBERT and SciBERT. Embeddings are computed via an expression-weighted average across the top N most highly expressed genes in each cell, providing a compact, semantically rich representation. This multimodal strategy bridges structured biological data with state-of-the-art language modeling, enabling more interpretable downstream applications such as cell-type clustering, cell vulnerability dissection, and trajectory inference.

Abstract:
Duplicate marking is a critical preprocessing step in gene sequence analysis to flag redundant reads arising from polymerase chain reaction(PCR) amplification and sequencing artifacts. Although Picard MarkDuplicates is widely recognized as the gold-standard tool, its single-threaded implementation and reliance on global sorting result in significant computational and resource overhead, limiting its efficiency on large-scale datasets. Here, we introduce FastDup: a high-performance, scalable solution that follows the speculation-and-test mechanism. FastDup achieves up to 20x throughput speedup and guarantees 100\% identical output compared to Picard MarkDuplicates. FastDup is a C++ program available from GitHub (https://github.com/zzhofict/FastDup.git) under the MIT license.

Comment: Accepted at IEEE IPDPS 2025 Conference

Abstract:
This paper describes a new asynchronous algorithm and implementation for the problem of k-mer counting (KC), which concerns quantifying the frequency of length k substrings in a DNA sequence. This operation is common to many computational biology workloads and can take up to 77% of the total runtime of de novo genome assembly. The performance and scalability of the current state-of-the-art distributed-memory KC algorithm are hampered by multiple rounds of Many-To-Many collectives. Therefore, we develop an asynchronous algorithm (DAKC) that uses fine-grained, asynchronous messages to obviate most of this global communication while utilizing network bandwidth efficiently via custom message aggregation protocols. DAKC can perform strong scaling up to 256 nodes (512 sockets / 6K cores) and can count k-mers up to 9x faster than the state-of-the-art distributed-memory algorithm, and up to 100x faster than the shared-memory alternative. We also provide an analytical model to understand the hardware resource utilization of our asynchronous KC algorithm and provide insights on the performance.

Abstract:
Gene finding is the task of identifying the locations of coding sequences within the vast amount of genetic code contained in the genome. With an ever increasing quantity of raw genome sequences, gene finding is an important avenue towards understanding the genetic information of (novel) organisms, as well as learning shared patterns across evolutionarily diverse species. The current state of the art are graphical models usually trained per organism and requiring manually curated datasets. However, these models lack the flexibility to incorporate deep learning representation learning techniques that have in recent years been transformative in the analysis of pro tein sequences, and which could potentially help gene finders exploit the growing number of the sequenced genomes to expand performance across multiple organisms. Here, we propose a novel approach, combining learned embeddings of raw genetic sequences with exact decoding using a latent conditional random field. We show that the model achieves performance matching the current state of the art, while increasing training robustness, and removing the need for manually fitted length distributions. As language models for DNA improve, this paves the way for more performant cross-organism gene-finders.

Since genes are the foundation of cellular life, building gene regulatory networks (GRN) is essential to understand and predict the effects of genetic perturbations. However, current methods fail to fully leverage gene-related information, and solely rely on simple evaluation metrics to construct coarse-grained GRN. More importantly, they ignore functional differences between biotypes, limiting the ability to capture potential gene interactions. In this work, we leverage pre-trained large language model and DNA sequence model to extract features from gene descriptions and DNA sequence data, respectively, which serve as the initialization for gene representations. Additionally, we introduce gene biotype information for the first time in genetic perturbation, simulating the distinct roles of genes with different biotypes in regulating cellular processes, while capturing implicit gene relationships through graph structure learning (GSL). We propose GRAPE, a heterogeneous graph neural network (HGNN) that leverages gene representations initialized with features from descriptions and sequences, models the distinct roles of genes with different biotypes, and dynamically refines the GRN through GSL. The results on publicly available datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract:
DNA microarray technology enables the simultaneous measurement of expression levels of thousands of genes, thereby facilitating the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying complex diseases such as brain tumors and the identification of diagnostic genetic signatures. To derive meaningful biological insights from the high-dimensional and complex gene features obtained through this technology and to analyze gene properties in detail, classical AI-based approaches such as machine learning and deep learning are widely employed. However, these methods face various limitations in managing high-dimensional vector spaces and modeling the intricate relationships among genes. In particular, challenges such as hyperparameter tuning, computational costs, and high processing power requirements can hinder their efficiency. To overcome these limitations, quantum computing and quantum AI approaches are gaining increasing attention. Leveraging quantum properties such as superposition and entanglement, quantum methods enable more efficient parallel processing of high-dimensional data and offer faster and more effective solutions to problems that are computationally demanding for classical methods. In this study, a novel model called "Deep VQC" is proposed, based on the Variational Quantum Classifier approach. Developed using microarray data containing 54,676 gene features, the model successfully classified four different types of brain tumors-ependymoma, glioblastoma, medulloblastoma, and pilocytic astrocytoma-alongside healthy samples with high accuracy. Furthermore, compared to classical ML algorithms, our model demonstrated either superior or comparable classification performance. These results highlight the potential of quantum AI methods as an effective and promising approach for the analysis and classification of complex structures such as brain tumors based on gene expression features.

Abstract:
Integrating heterogeneous biomedical data including imaging, omics, and clinical records supports accurate diagnosis and personalised care. Graph-based models fuse such non-Euclidean data by capturing spatial and relational structure, yet clinical uptake requires regulator-ready interpretability. We present the first technical survey of interpretable graph based models for multimodal biomedical data, covering 26 studies published between Jan 2019 and Sep 2024. Most target disease classification, notably cancer and rely on static graphs from simple similarity measures, while graph-native explainers are rare; post-hoc methods adapted from non-graph domains such as gradient saliency, and SHAP predominate. We group existing approaches into four interpretability families, outline trends such as graph-in-graph hierarchies, knowledge-graph edges, and dynamic topology learning, and perform a practical benchmark. Using an Alzheimer disease cohort, we compare Sensitivity Analysis, Gradient Saliency, SHAP and Graph Masking. SHAP and Sensitivity Analysis recover the broadest set of known AD pathways and Gene-Ontology terms, whereas Gradient Saliency and Graph Masking surface complementary metabolic and transport signatures. Permutation tests show all four beat random gene sets, but with distinct trade-offs: SHAP and Graph Masking offer deeper biology at higher compute cost, while Gradient Saliency and Sensitivity Analysis are quicker though coarser. We also provide a step-by-step flowchart covering graph construction, explainer choice and resource budgeting to help researchers balance transparency and performance. This review synthesises the state of interpretable graph learning for multimodal medicine, benchmarks leading techniques, and charts future directions, from advanced XAI tools to under-studied diseases, serving as a concise reference for method developers and translational scientists.

Abstract:
Mixture interpretation is a central challenge in forensic science, where evidence often contains contributions from multiple sources. In the context of DNA analysis, biological samples recovered from crime scenes may include genetic material from several individuals, necessitating robust statistical tools to assess whether a specific person of interest (POI) is among the contributors. Methods based on capillary electrophoresis (CE) are currently in use worldwide, but offer limited resolution in complex mixtures. Advancements in massively parallel sequencing (MPS) technologies provide a richer, more detailed representation of DNA mixtures, but require new analytical strategies to fully leverage this information. In this work, we present a Bayesian framework for evaluating whether a POIs DNA is present in an MPS-based forensic sample. The model accommodates known contributors, such as the victim, and uses a novel string edit distance to quantify similarity between observed alleles and sequencing artifacts. The resulting Bayes factors enable effective discrimination between samples that do and do not contain the POIs DNA, demonstrating strong performance in both hypothesis testing and classification settings.

Abstract:
Unsupervised learning of disease subtypes from multi-omics data presents a significant opportunity for advancing personalized medicine. We introduce OmicsCL, a modular contrastive learning framework that jointly embeds heterogeneous omics modalities-such as gene expression, DNA methylation, and miRNA expression-into a unified latent space. Our method incorporates a survival-aware contrastive loss that encourages the model to learn representations aligned with survival-related patterns, without relying on labeled outcomes. Evaluated on the TCGA BRCA dataset, OmicsCL uncovers clinically meaningful clusters and achieves strong unsupervised concordance with patient survival. The framework demonstrates robustness across hyperparameter configurations and can be tuned to prioritize either subtype coherence or survival stratification. Ablation studies confirm that integrating survival-aware loss significantly enhances the predictive power of learned embeddings. These results highlight the promise of contrastive objectives for biological insight discovery in high-dimensional, heterogeneous omics data.

Abstract:
Aim: This in silico study sought to identify specific biomarkers for mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) through the analysis of publicly available gene and miRNA databases, hypothesizing their influence on neuronal structure, axonal integrity, and regeneration. Methods: This study implemented a three-step process: (1) Data searching for mTBI-related genes in Gene and MalaCard databases and literature review ; (2) Data analysis involved performing functional annotation through GO and KEGG, identifying hub genes using Cytoscape, mapping protein-protein interactions via DAVID and STRING, and predicting miRNA targets using miRSystem, miRWalk2.0, and mirDIP (3) RNA-sequencing analysis applied to the mTBI dataset GSE123336. Results: Eleven candidate hub genes associated with mTBI outcome were identified: APOE, S100B, GFAP, BDNF, AQP4, COMT, MBP, UCHL1, DRD2, ASIC1, and CACNA1A. Enrichment analysis linked these genes to neuron projection regeneration and synaptic plasticity. miRNAs linked to the mTBI candidate genes were hsa-miR-9-5p, hsa-miR-204-5p, hsa-miR-1908-5p, hsa-miR-16-5p, hsa-miR-10a-5p, has-miR-218-5p, has-miR-34a-5p, and has-miR-199b-5p. The RNA sequencing revealed 2664 differentially expressed miRNAs post-mTBI, with 17 showing significant changes at the time of injury and 48 hours post-injury. Two miRNAs were positively correlated with direct head hits. Conclusion: Our study indicates that specific genes and miRNAs, particularly hsa-miR-10a-5p, may influence mTBI outcomes. Our research may guide future mTBI diagnostics, emphasizing the need to measure and track these specific genes and miRNAs in diverse cohorts.

Abstract:
Background: Praying mantises, members of the order Mantodea, play important roles in agriculture, medicine, bionics, and entertainment. However, the scarcity of genomic resources has hindered extensive studies on mantis evolution and behaviour. Results: Here, we present the chromosome-scale reference genomes of five mantis species: the European mantis (Mantis religiosa), Chinese mantis (Tenodera sinensis), triangle dead leaf mantis (Deroplatys truncata), orchid mantis (Hymenopus coronatus), and metallic mantis (Metallyticus violaceus). We found that transposable element expansion is the major force governing genome size in Mantodea. Based on whole-alignments, we deduced that the Mantodea ancestor may have had only one X chromosome and that translocations between the X chromosome and an autosome may have occurred in the lineage of the superfamily Mantoidea. Furthermore, we found a lower evolutionary rate for the metallic mantis than for the other mantises. We also found that Mantodea underwent rapid radiation after the K-Pg mass extinction event, which could have contributed to the confusion in species classification. Conclusions: We present the chromosome-scale reference genomes of five mantis species to reveal the X-chromosome evolution, clarify the phylogeny relationship, and transposable element expansion.

Abstract:
We present a novel approach for taxonomic analysis of chloroplast genomes in angiosperms using the Pan-genome Research Toolkit (PGR-TK). Comparative plots generated by PGR-TK across diverse angiosperm genera reveal a wide range of structural complexity, from straightforward to highly intricate patterns. Notably, the characteristic quadripartite plastome structure, comprising the large single copy (LSC), small single copy (SSC), and inverted repeat (IR) regions, is clearly identifiable in over 75% of the genera analyzed. Our findings also underscore several occurrences of species mis-annotations in public genomic databases, which are readily detected through visual anomalies in the PGR-TK plots. While more complex plot patterns remain difficult to interpret, they likely reflect underlying biological variation or technical inconsistencies in genome assembly. Overall, this approach effectively integrates classical botanical visualization with modern molecular taxonomy, providing a powerful tool for genome-based classification in plant systematics.

Abstract:
Mappings from biological sequences (DNA, RNA, protein) to quantitative measures of sequence functionality play an important role in contemporary biology. We are interested in the related tasks of (i) inferring predictive sequence-to-function maps and (ii) decomposing sequence-function maps to elucidate the contributions of individual subsequences. Because each sequence-function map can be written as a weighted sum over subsequences in multiple ways, meaningfully interpreting these weights requires ``gauge-fixing,'' i.e., defining a unique representation for each map. Recent work has established that most existing gauge-fixed representations arise as the unique solutions to $L_2$-regularized regression in an overparameterized ``weight space'' where the choice of regularizer defines the gauge. Here, we establish the relationship between regularized regression in overparameterized weight space and Gaussian process approaches that operate in ``function space,'' i.e.~the space of all real-valued functions on a finite set of sequences. We disentangle how weight space regularizers both impose an implicit prior on the learned function and restrict the optimal weights to a particular gauge. We show how to construct regularizers that correspond to arbitrary explicit Gaussian process priors combined with a wide variety of gauges and characterize the implicit function space priors associated with the most common weight space regularizers. Finally, we derive the posterior distribution of a broad class of sequence-to-function statistics, including gauge-fixed weights and multiple systems for expressing higher-order epistatic coefficients. We show that such distributions can be efficiently computed for product-kernel priors using a kernel trick.

Abstract:
The subcellular localization of RNAs, including long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), messenger RNAs (mRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs) and other smaller RNAs, plays a critical role in determining their biological functions. For instance, lncRNAs are predominantly associated with chromatin and act as regulators of gene transcription and chromatin structure, while mRNAs are distributed across the nucleus and cytoplasm, facilitating the transport of genetic information for protein synthesis. Understanding RNA localization sheds light on processes like gene expression regulation with spatial and temporal precision. However, traditional wet lab methods for determining RNA localization, such as in situ hybridization, are often time-consuming, resource-demanding, and costly. To overcome these challenges, computational methods leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have emerged as powerful alternatives, enabling large-scale prediction of RNA subcellular localization. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the latest advancements in AI-based approaches for RNA subcellular localization prediction, covering various RNA types and focusing on sequence-based, image-based, and hybrid methodologies that combine both data types. We highlight the potential of these methods to accelerate RNA research, uncover molecular pathways, and guide targeted disease treatments. Furthermore, we critically discuss the challenges in AI/ML approaches for RNA subcellular localization, such as data scarcity and lack of benchmarks, and opportunities to address them. This review aims to serve as a valuable resource for researchers seeking to develop innovative solutions in the field of RNA subcellular localization and beyond.

Abstract:
The inference of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) is a foundational stride towards deciphering the fundamentals of complex biological systems. Inferring a possible regulatory link between two genes can be formulated as a link prediction problem. Inference of GRNs via gene coexpression profiling data may not always reflect true biological interactions, as its susceptibility to noise and misrepresenting true biological regulatory relationships. Most GRN inference methods face several challenges in the network reconstruction phase. Therefore, it is important to encode gene expression values, leverege the prior knowledge gained from the available inferred network structures and positional informations of the input network nodes towards inferring a better and more confident GRN network reconstruction. In this paper, we explore the integration of multiple inferred networks to enhance the inference of Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs). Primarily, we employ autoencoder embeddings to capture gene expression patterns directly from raw data, preserving intricate biological signals. Then, we embed the prior knowledge from GRN structures transforming them into a text-like representation using random walks, which are then encoded with a masked language model, BERT, to generate global embeddings for each gene across all networks. Additionally, we embed the positional encodings of the input gene networks to better identify the position of each unique gene within the graph. These embeddings are integrated into graph transformer-based model, termed GT-GRN, for GRN inference. The GT-GRN model effectively utilizes the topological structure of the ground truth network while incorporating the enriched encoded information. Experimental results demonstrate that GT-GRN significantly outperforms existing GRN inference methods, achieving superior accuracy and highlighting the robustness of our approach.

Abstract:
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables high-resolution analysis of cellular heterogeneity, but its complexity, which is marked by high dimensionality, sparsity, and batch effects, which poses major computational challenges. Transformer-based models have made significant advances in this domain but are often limited by their quadratic complexity and suboptimal handling of long-range dependencies. In this work, we introduce GeneMamba, a scalable and efficient foundation model for single-cell transcriptomics built on state space modeling. Leveraging the Bi-Mamba architecture, GeneMamba captures bidirectional gene context with linear-time complexity, offering substantial computational gains over transformer baselines. The model is pretrained on nearly 30 million cells and incorporates biologically informed objectives, including pathway-aware contrastive loss and rank-based gene encoding. We evaluate GeneMamba across diverse tasks, including multi-batch integration, cell type annotation, and gene-gene correlation, demonstrating strong performance, interpretability, and robustness. These results position GeneMamba as a practical and powerful alternative to transformer-based methods, advancing the development of biologically grounded, scalable tools for large-scale single-cell data analysis.

Abstract:
Recent advances in applying deep learning in genomics include DNA-language and single-cell foundation models. However, these models take only one data type as input. We introduce dynamic token adaptation and demonstrate how it combines these models to predict gene regulation at the single-cell level in different genetic contexts. Although the method is generalisable, we focus on an illustrative example by training an adapter from DNA-sequence embeddings to a single-cell foundation model's token embedding space. As a qualitative evaluation, we assess the impact of DNA sequence changes on the model's learned gene regulatory networks by mutating the transcriptional start site of the transcription factor GATA4 in silico, observing predicted expression changes in its target genes in fetal cardiomyocytes.

Abstract:
Background: Spatial transcriptomics have emerged as a powerful tool in biomedical research because of its ability to capture both the spatial contexts and abundance of the complete RNA transcript profile in organs of interest. However, limitations of the technology such as the relatively low resolution and comparatively insufficient sequencing depth make it difficult to reliably extract real biological signals from these data. To alleviate this challenge, we propose a novel transfer learning framework, referred to as TransST, to adaptively leverage the cell-labeled information from external sources in inferring cell-level heterogeneity of a target spatial transcriptomics data.   Results: Applications in several real studies as well as a number of simulation settings show that our approach significantly improves existing techniques. For example, in the breast cancer study, TransST successfully identifies five biologically meaningful cell clusters, including the two subgroups of cancer in situ and invasive cancer; in addition, only TransST is able to separate the adipose tissues from the connective issues among all the studied methods.   Conclusions: In summary, the proposed method TransST is both effective and robust in identifying cell subclusters and detecting corresponding driving biomarkers in spatial transcriptomics data.

Abstract:
Predicting phenotype from genotype is a central challenge in genetics. Traditional approaches in quantitative genetics typically analyze this problem using methods based on linear regression. These methods generally assume that the genetic architecture of complex traits can be parameterized in terms of an additive model, where the effects of loci are independent, plus (in some cases) pairwise epistatic interactions between loci. However, these models struggle to analyze more complex patterns of epistasis or subtle gene-environment interactions. Recent advances in machine learning, particularly attention-based models, offer a promising alternative. Initially developed for natural language processing, attention-based models excel at capturing context-dependent interactions and have shown exceptional performance in predicting protein structure and function. Here, we apply attention-based models to quantitative genetics. We analyze the performance of this attention-based approach in predicting phenotype from genotype using simulated data across a range of models with increasing epistatic complexity, and using experimental data from a recent quantitative trait locus mapping study in budding yeast. We find that our model demonstrates superior out-of-sample predictions in epistatic regimes compared to standard methods. We also explore a more general multi-environment attention-based model to jointly analyze genotype-phenotype maps across multiple environments and show that such architectures can be used for "transfer learning" - predicting phenotypes in novel environments with limited training data.

Abstract:
Thalassemia, a blood disorder and one of the most prevalent hereditary genetic disorders worldwide, is often caused by copy number variations (CNVs) in the hemoglobin genes. This disorder has incredible diversity, with a large number of distinct profiles corresponding to alterations of different regions in the genes. Correctly classifying an individual's profile is critical as it impacts treatment, prognosis, and genetic counseling. However, genetic classification is challenging due to the large number of profiles worldwide, and often requires a large number of sequential tests. Targeted next generation sequencing (NGS), which characterizes segments of an individual's genome, has the potential to dramatically reduce the cost of testing and increase accuracy. In this work, we introduce a probabilistic state space model for profiling thalassemia from targeted NGS data, which naturally characterize the spatial ordering of the genes along the chromosome. We then use decision theory to choose the best profile among the different options. Due to our use of Bayesian methodology, we are also able to detect low-quality samples to be excluded from consideration, an important component of clinical screening. We evaluate our model on a dataset of 57 individuals, including both controls and cases with a variety of thalassemia profiles. Our model has a sensitivity of 0.99 and specificity of 0.93 for thalassemia detection, and accuracy of 91.5\% for characterizing subtypes. Furthermore, the specificity and accuracy rise to $0.96$ and 93.9\% when low-quality samples are excluded using our automated quality control method. This approach outperforms alternative methods, particularly in specificity, and is broadly applicable to other disorders.

Abstract:
Deep learning techniques have driven significant progress in various analytical tasks within 3D genomics in computational biology. However, a holistic understanding of 3D genomics knowledge remains underexplored. Here, we propose MIX-HIC, the first multimodal foundation model of 3D genome that integrates both 3D genome structure and epigenomic tracks, which obtains unified and comprehensive semantics. For accurate heterogeneous semantic fusion, we design the cross-modal interaction and mapping blocks for robust unified representation, yielding the accurate aggregation of 3D genome knowledge. Besides, we introduce the first large-scale dataset comprising over 1 million pairwise samples of Hi-C contact maps and epigenomic tracks for high-quality pre-training, enabling the exploration of functional implications in 3D genomics. Extensive experiments show that MIX-HIC can significantly surpass existing state-of-the-art methods in diverse downstream tasks. This work provides a valuable resource for advancing 3D genomics research.

Accurate diagnosis of Mendelian diseases is crucial for precision therapy and assistance in preimplantation genetic diagnosis. However, existing methods often fall short of clinical standards or depend on extensive datasets to build pretrained machine learning models. To address this, we introduce an innovative LLM-Driven multi-agent debate system (MD2GPS) with natural language explanations of the diagnostic results. It utilizes a language model to transform results from data-driven and knowledge-driven agents into natural language, then fostering a debate between these two specialized agents. This system has been tested on 1,185 samples across four independent datasets, enhancing the TOP1 accuracy from 42.9% to 66% on average. Additionally, in a challenging cohort of 72 cases, MD2GPS identified potential pathogenic genes in 12 patients, reducing the diagnostic time by 90%. The methods within each module of this multi-agent debate system are also replaceable, facilitating its adaptation for diagnosing and researching other complex diseases.

Abstract:
Advancements in biomedical research have driven continuous innovations in sensing and diagnostic technologies. Among these, nanopore based single molecule sensing and sequencing is rapidly emerging as a powerful and versatile sensing methodology. Advancements in nanopore based approaches require concomitant improvements in the electronic readout methods employed, from the point of low noise, bandwidth and form factor. This article focuses on current sensing circuits designed and employed for ultra low noise nanopore signal readout, addressing the fundamental limitations of traditional off chip transimpedance amplifiers (TIAs), which suffer from high input parasitic capacitance, bandwidth constraints, and increased noise at high frequencies. This review explores the latest design schemes and circuit structures classified into on-chip and off-chip TIA designs, highlighting their design implementation, performance, respective challenges and explores the interplay between noise performance, capacitance, and bandwidth across diverse transimpedance amplifier (TIA) configurations. Emphasis is placed on characterizing noise response under varying parasitic capacitance and operational frequencies, a systematic evaluation not extensively addressed in prior literature while also considering the allowable input current compliance range limitations. The review also compares the widely used Axopatch 200B system to the designs reported in literature. The findings offer valuable insights into optimizing TIA designs for enhanced signal integrity in high speed and high sensitivity applications focusing on noise reduction, impedance matching, DC blocking, and offset cancellation techniques.

Abstract:
As genome sequencing is finding utility in a wide variety of domains beyond the confines of traditional medical settings, its computational pipeline faces two significant challenges. First, the creation of up to 0.5 GB of data per minute imposes substantial communication and storage overheads. Second, the sequencing pipeline is bottlenecked at the basecalling step, consuming >40% of genome analysis time. A range of proposals have attempted to address these challenges, with limited success. We propose to address these challenges with a Compute-in-Memory Basecalling Accelerator (CiMBA), the first embedded ($\sim25$mm$^2$) accelerator capable of real-time, on-device basecalling, coupled with AnaLog (AL)-Dorado, a new family of analog focused basecalling DNNs. Our resulting hardware/software co-design greatly reduces data communication overhead, is capable of a throughput of 4.77 million bases per second, 24x that required for real-time operation, and achieves 17x/27x power/area efficiency over the best prior basecalling embedded accelerator while maintaining a high accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art software basecallers.

Abstract:
The ability to quickly and accurately identify microbial species in a sample, known as metagenomic profiling, is critical across various fields, from healthcare to environmental science. This paper introduces a novel method to profile signals coming from sequencing devices in parallel with determining their nucleotide sequences, a process known as basecalling, via a multi-objective deep neural network for simultaneous basecalling and multi-class genome classification. We introduce a new loss strategy where losses for basecalling and classification are back-propagated separately, with model weights combined for the shared layers, and a pre-configured ranking strategy allowing top-K species accuracy, giving users flexibility to choose between higher accuracy or higher speed at identifying the species. We achieve state-of-the-art basecalling accuracies, while classification accuracies meet and exceed the results of state-of-the-art binary classifiers, attaining an average of 92.5%/98.9% accuracy at identifying the top-1/3 species among a total of 17 genomes in the Wick bacterial dataset. The work presented here has implications for future studies in metagenomic profiling by accelerating the bottleneck step of matching the DNA sequence to the correct genome.

Abstract:
Motivation: Viruses represent the most abundant biological entities on the planet and play vital roles in diverse ecosystems. Cataloging viruses across various environments is essential for understanding their properties and functions. Metagenomic sequencing has emerged as the most comprehensive method for virus discovery, enabling the sequencing of all genetic materials, including viruses, from host or environmental samples. However, distinguishing viral sequences from the vast background of cellular organism-derived reads in metagenomic data remains a significant challenge. While several learning-based tools, such as VirSorter2 and geNomad, have shown promise in identifying viral contigs, they often experience varying degrees of false positive rates due to noise in sequencing and assembly, shared genes between viruses and their hosts, and the formation of proviruses within host genomes. This highlights the urgent need for an accurate and efficient method to evaluate the quality of viral contigs. Results: To address these challenges, we introduce ViralQC, a tool designed to assess the quality of reported viral contigs or bins. ViralQC identifies contamination regions within putative viral sequences using foundation models trained on viral and cellular genomes and estimates viral completeness through protein organization alignment. We evaluate ViralQC on multiple datasets and compare its performance against CheckV, the state-of-the-art in virus quality assessment. Notably, ViralQC correctly identifies 38% more contamination than CheckV, while maintaining a median absolute error of only 3%. In addition, ViralQC delivers more accurate results for medium- to high-quality (>50% completeness) contigs, demonstrating its superior performance in completeness estimation.

Abstract:
Explainability is necessary for many tasks in biomedical research. Recent explainability methods have focused on attention, gradient, and Shapley value. These do not handle data with strong associated prior knowledge and fail to constrain explainability results based on known relationships between predictive features.   We propose GraphPINE, a graph neural network (GNN) architecture leveraging domain-specific prior knowledge to initialize node importance optimized during training for drug response prediction. Typically, a manual post-prediction step examines literature (i.e., prior knowledge) to understand returned predictive features. While node importance can be obtained for gradient and attention after prediction, node importance from these methods lacks complementary prior knowledge; GraphPINE seeks to overcome this limitation. GraphPINE differs from other GNN gating methods by utilizing an LSTM-like sequential format. We introduce an importance propagation layer that unifies 1) updates for feature matrix and node importance and 2) uses GNN-based graph propagation of feature values. This initialization and updating mechanism allows for informed feature learning and improved graph representation.   We apply GraphPINE to cancer drug response prediction using drug screening and gene data collected for over 5,000 gene nodes included in a gene-gene graph with a drug-target interaction (DTI) graph for initial importance. The gene-gene graph and DTIs were obtained from curated sources and weighted by article count discussing relationships between drugs and genes. GraphPINE achieves a PR-AUC of 0.894 and ROC-AUC of 0.796 across 952 drugs. Code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/GraphPINE-40DE.

Abstract:
Long-range dependencies are critical for understanding genomic structure and function, yet most conventional methods struggle with them. Widely adopted transformer-based models, while excelling at short-context tasks, are limited by the attention module's quadratic computational complexity and inability to extrapolate to sequences longer than those seen in training. In this work, we explore State Space Models (SSMs) as a promising alternative by benchmarking two SSM-inspired architectures, Caduceus and Hawk, on long-range genomics modeling tasks under conditions parallel to a 50M parameter transformer baseline. We discover that SSMs match transformer performance and exhibit impressive zero-shot extrapolation across multiple tasks, handling contexts 10 to 100 times longer than those seen during training, indicating more generalizable representations better suited for modeling the long and complex human genome. Moreover, we demonstrate that these models can efficiently process sequences of 1M tokens on a single GPU, allowing for modeling entire genomic regions at once, even in labs with limited compute. Our findings establish SSMs as efficient and scalable for long-context genomic analysis.

Abstract:
Essential life processes take place across multiple space and time scales in living organisms but understanding their mechanistic interactions remains an ongoing challenge. Advanced multiscale modeling techniques are providing new opportunities and insights into these complex processes. In cells, meters of chromatin are folded into a nucleus with a diameter on the order of microns. The three-dimensional chromatin structure coupled with biochemical processes that turn genes on or off, specify a given cell type through a complicated set of interactions collectively referred to as epigenetics. Important epigenetic processes include the differential accessibility of genomic loci to transcription factors and chemical modifications to DNA and DNA-binding molecules such as histones. The dynamics of these epigenetic processes span timescales from milliseconds to years. How do chemical modifications consisting of a handful of atoms cooperate to modulate genome folding at the scale of the nucleus and impact organism outcomes? In this review, we highlight the inherently multiscale nature of chromatin organization, with a focus on computational modeling to bridge the gaps in our understanding of biochemical processes across scales. We review relevant chromatin biology, including major types of epigenetic modifications as well as the higher order chromatin structures to present a multiscale view of chromatin. We also review relevant computational methods to simulate chromatin structure, function, and dynamics, as well as experimental techniques that inform and validate said models. Finally, we argue that multiscale modeling provides a path forward towards understanding emergent behavior in this inherently multiscale system.

Abstract:
Viral mutations pose significant threats to public health by increasing infectivity, strengthening vaccine resistance, and altering disease severity. To track these evolving patterns, agencies like the CDC annually evaluate thousands of virus strains, underscoring the urgent need to understand viral mutagenesis and evolution in depth. In this study, we integrate genomic analysis, clustering, and three leading dimensionality reduction approaches, namely, principal component analysis (PCA), t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), and uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP)-to investigate the effects of COVID-19 on influenza virus propagation. By applying these methods to extensive pre- and post-pandemic influenza datasets, we reveal how selective pressures during the pandemic have influenced the diversity of influenza genetics. Our findings indicate that combining robust dimension reduction with clustering yields critical insights into the complex dynamics of viral mutation, informing both future research directions and strategies for public health intervention.

Abstract:
In primates, loci associated with adaptive trait variation often fall in non-coding regions. Understanding the mechanisms linking these regulatory variants to fitness-relevant phenotypes remains challenging, but can be addressed using functional genomic data. However, such data are rarely generated at scale in non-human primates. When they are, only select tissues, cell types, developmental stages, and cellular environments are typically considered, despite appreciation that adaptive variants often exhibit context-dependent effects. In this review, we 1) discuss why context-dependent regulatory loci might be especially evolutionarily relevant in primates, 2) explore challenges and emerging solutions for mapping such context-dependent variation, and 3) discuss the scientific questions these data could address. We argue that filling this gap will provide critical insights into evolutionary processes, human disease, and regulatory adaptation.

Abstract:
Background: Esophageal cancer poses a significant global health challenge, with the incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), a predominant subtype, increasing notably in Western countries. Cathepsins, a family of lysosomal proteolytic enzymes, have been implicated in the progression of various tumors. However, the causal relationship between the cathepsin family and EAC remains unresolved. Methods: To evaluate these potential causal associations, integrative analyses were conducted, integrating Mendelian randomization (MR), transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS), single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), and single-cell expression quantitative trait locus (sc-eQTL) analyses. Results: Univariable and multivariable MR analyses demonstrated that elevated levels of cathepsin B (CTSB) were associated with a reduced risk of EAC. The TWAS analysis identified a negative association between CTSB expression in esophageal tissue and EAC, consistent with experimental validation using immunohistochemistry. The scRNA-seq data analysis indicated that CTSB expression was predominantly localized in macrophages infiltrating EAC. Colocalization analysis incorporating sc-eQTL data specific to macrophages confirmed a shared causal variant between CTSB and macrophages. Additionally, MR analysis of CTSB and macrophage scavenger receptor (MSR) types I and II established their interrelationship, suggesting that CTSB may influence the proinflammatory phenotype of macrophages, ultimately affecting EAC risk. Conclusions: This integrative analysis, utilizing MR, TWAS, scRNA-seq, and sc-eQTL data, identified a significant causal association between CTSB and EAC, potentially mediated through macrophage MSR regulation. These findings suggest that targeting cathepsin B could represent a novel strategy for the diagnosis and treatment of EAC.

Abstract:
Epigenetics encompasses mechanisms that can alter the expression of genes without changing the underlying genetic sequence. The epigenetic regulation of gene expression is initiated and sustained by several mechanisms such as DNA methylation, histone modifications, chromatin conformation, and non-coding RNA. The changes in gene regulation and expression can manifest in the form of various diseases and disorders such as cancer and congenital deformities. Over the last few decades, high throughput experimental approaches have been used to identify and understand epigenetic changes, but these laboratory experimental approaches and biochemical processes are time-consuming and expensive. To overcome these challenges, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) approaches have been extensively used for mapping epigenetic modifications to their phenotypic manifestations. In this paper we provide a narrative review of published research on AI models trained on epigenomic data to address a variety of problems such as prediction of disease markers, gene expression, enhancer promoter interaction, and chromatin states. The purpose of this review is twofold as it is addressed to both AI experts and epigeneticists. For AI researchers, we provided a taxonomy of epigenetics research problems that can benefit from an AI-based approach. For epigeneticists, given each of the above problems we provide a list of candidate AI solutions in the literature. We have also identified several gaps in the literature, research challenges, and recommendations to address these challenges.

Abstract:
In mammalian and vertebrate genomes, the promoter regions of the gene and their distal enhancers may be located millions of base-pairs from each other, while a promoter may not interact with the closest enhancer. Since base-pair proximity is not a good indicator of these interactions, there is considerable work toward developing methods for predicting Enhancer-Promoter Interactions (EPI). Several machine learning methods have reported increasingly higher accuracies for predicting EPI. Typically, these approaches randomly split the dataset of Enhancer-Promoter (EP) pairs into training and testing subsets followed by model training. However, the aforementioned random splitting causes information leakage by assigning EP pairs from the same genomic region to both testing and training sets, leading to performance overestimation. In this paper we propose to use a more thorough training and testing paradigm i.e., Leave-one-chromosome-out (LOCO) cross-validation for EPI-prediction. We demonstrate that a deep learning algorithm, which gives higher accuracies when trained and tested on random-splitting setting, drops drastically in performance under LOCO setting, confirming overestimation of performance. We further propose a novel hybrid deep neural network for EPI-prediction that fuses k-mer features of the nucleotide sequence. We show that the hybrid architecture performs significantly better in the LOCO setting, demonstrating it can learn more generalizable aspects of EP interactions. With this paper we are also releasing the LOCO splitting-based EPI dataset. Research data is available in this public repository: https://github.com/malikmtahir/EPI

Abstract:
Genome sequence analysis, which analyzes the DNA sequences of organisms, drives advances in many critical medical and biotechnological fields. Given its importance and the exponentially growing volumes of genomic sequence data, there are extensive efforts to accelerate genome sequence analysis. In this work, we demonstrate a major bottleneck that greatly limits and diminishes the benefits of state-of-the-art genome sequence analysis accelerators: the data preparation bottleneck, where genomic sequence data is stored in compressed form and needs to be decompressed and formatted first before an accelerator can operate on it. To mitigate this bottleneck, we propose SAGe, an algorithm-architecture co-design for highly-compressed storage and high-performance access of large-scale genomic sequence data. The key challenge is to improve data preparation performance while maintaining high compression ratios (comparable to genomic-specific compression algorithms) at low hardware cost. We address this challenge by leveraging key properties of genomic datasets to co-design (i) a new (de)compression algorithm, (ii) hardware that decompresses data with lightweight operations and efficient streaming accesses, (iii) storage data layout, and (iv) interface commands to access data. SAGe is highly versatile as it supports datasets from different sequencing technologies and species. Thanks to its lightweight design, SAGe can be seamlessly integrated with a broad range of genome sequence analysis hardware accelerators to mitigate their data preparation bottlenecks. Our results demonstrate that SAGe improves the average end-to-end performance and energy efficiency of two state-of-the-art genome sequence analysis accelerators by 3.0x-32.1x and 13.0x-34.0x, respectively, compared to when the accelerators rely on state-of-the-art decompression tools.

Abstract:
Genome annotation is essential for understanding the functional elements within genomes. While automated methods are indispensable for processing large-scale genomic data, they often face challenges in accurately predicting gene structures and functions. Consequently, manual curation by domain experts remains crucial for validating and refining these predictions. These combined outcomes from automated tools and manual curation highlight the importance of integrating human expertise with AI capabilities to improve both the accuracy and efficiency of genome annotation. However, the manual curation process is inherently labor-intensive and time-consuming, making it difficult to scale for large datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a conceptual framework, Human-AI Collaborative Genome Annotation (HAICoGA), which leverages the synergistic partnership between humans and artificial intelligence to enhance human capabilities and accelerate the genome annotation process. Additionally, we explore the potential of integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into this framework to support and augment specific tasks. Finally, we discuss emerging challenges and outline open research questions to guide further exploration in this area.

Abstract:
Recent breakthroughs in single-cell technology have ushered in unparalleled opportunities to decode the molecular intricacy of intricate biological systems, especially those linked to diseases unique to humans. However, these progressions have also ushered in novel obstacles-specifically, the efficient annotation of extensive, long-tailed single-cell data pertaining to disease conditions. To effectively surmount this challenge, we introduce Celler, a state-of-the-art generative pre-training model crafted specifically for the annotation of single-cell data. Celler incorporates two groundbreaking elements: First, we introduced the Gaussian Inflation (GInf) Loss function. By dynamically adjusting sample weights, GInf Loss significantly enhances the model's ability to learn from rare categories while reducing the risk of overfitting for common categories. Secondly, we introduce an innovative Hard Data Mining (HDM) strategy into the training process, specifically targeting the challenging-to-learn minority data samples, which significantly improved the model's predictive accuracy. Additionally, to further advance research in this field, we have constructed a large-scale single-cell dataset: Celler-75, which encompasses 40 million cells distributed across 80 human tissues and 75 specific diseases. This dataset provides critical support for comprehensively exploring the potential of single-cell technology in disease research. Our code is available at https://github.com/AI4science-ym/HiCeller.

Abstract:
Motivation: Bulk RNA-Seq is a widely used method for studying gene expression across a variety of contexts. The significance of RNA-Seq studies has grown with the advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies. Computational methods have been developed for each stage of the identification of differentially expressed genes. Nevertheless, there are few studies exploring the association between different types of methods. In this study, we evaluated the impact of the association of methodologies in the results of differential expression analysis. By adopting two data sets with qPCR data (to gold-standard reference), seven methods were implemented and assessed in R packages (EBSeq, edgeR, DESeq2, limma, SAMseq, NOISeq, and Knowseq), which was performed and assessed separately and in association. The results were evaluated considering the adopted qPCR data. Results: Here, we introduce consexpressionR, an R package that automates differential expression analysis using consensus of at least seven methodologies, producing more assertive results with a significant reduction in false positives. Availability: consexpressionR is an R package available via source code and support are available at GitHub (https://github.com/costasilvati/consexpressionR).

Abstract:
The AGP format is a tab-separated table format describing how components of a genome assembly fit together. A standard submission format for genome assemblies is a fasta file giving the sequence of contigs along with an AGP file showing how these components are assembled into larger pieces like scaffolds or chromosomes. For this reason, many scaffolding software pipelines output assemblies in this format. However, although many programs for assembling and scaffolding genomes read and write this format, there is currently no published software for making edits to AGP files when performing assembly curation. We present agptools, a suite of command-line programs that can perform common operations on AGP files, such as breaking and joining sequences, inverting pieces of assembly components, assembling contigs into larger sequences based on an AGP file, and transforming between coordinate systems of different assembly layouts. Additionally, agptools includes an API that writers of other software packages can use to read, write, and manipulate AGP files within their own programs. Agptools gives bioinformaticians a simple, robust, and reproducible way to edit genome assemblies that avoids the shortfalls of other methods for editing AGP files.

Abstract:
In mass spectrometry-based proteomics, experts usually project data onto a single set of reference sequences, overlooking the influence of common haplotypes (combinations of genetic variants inherited together from a parent). We recently introduced ProHap, a tool for generating customized protein haplotype databases. Here, we present ProHap Explorer, a visualization interface designed to investigate the influence of common haplotypes on the human proteome. It enables users to explore haplotypes, their effects on protein sequences, and the identification of non-canonical peptides in public mass spectrometry datasets. The design builds on well-established representations in biological sequence analysis, ensuring familiarity for domain experts while integrating novel interactive elements tailored to proteogenomic data exploration. User interviews with proteomics experts confirmed the tool's utility, highlighting its ability to reveal whether haplotypes affect proteins of interest. By facilitating the intuitive exploration of proteogenomic variation, ProHap Explorer supports research in personalized medicine and the development of targeted therapies.

Abstract:
With the surge in the number of variants of uncertain significance (VUS) reported in ClinVar in recent years, there is an imperative to resolve VUS at scale. Multiplexed assays of variant effect (MAVEs), which allow the functional consequence of 100s to 1000s of genetic variants to be measured in a single experiment, are emerging as a powerful source of evidence which can be used in clinical gene variant classification. Increasingly, multiple published MAVEs are available for the same gene, sometimes measuring different aspects of variant impact. When multiple functional roles of a gene need to be considered, combining data from multiple MAVEs may provide a more comprehensive measure of the consequence of a genetic variant, which could impact variant classifications. Here, we provide guidance for combining such multiplexed functional data, incorporating a stepwise process from data curation and collection to model generation and validation. We demonstrate the potential and pitfalls of this approach by showing the integration of multiplexed functional data from five MAVEs for the gene TP53, two MAVEs for the gene LDLR and two MAVEs for PTEN. We also present a web applet that allows users to test various methods for combining score sets from multiple assays, calculate integrated functional scores for all variants, and assess whether combining data enables the application of stronger evidence for pathogenicity or benignity. By following these steps with appropriate guardrails, researchers can maximize the value of MAVEs, strengthen the functional evidence for clinical variant classification, and potentially uncover novel mechanisms of pathogenicity for clinically relevant genes.

Abstract:
Accurate variant descriptions are of paramount importance in the field of genetics. The domain is confronted with increasingly complex variants, making it more challenging to generate proper variant descriptions. We present a graph based on all minimal alignments that is a complete representation of a variant and we provide three complementary extraction methods to derive variant descriptions from this graph. Our experiments show that our method in comparison with dbSNP results in identical HGVS descriptions for simple variants and more meaningful descriptions for complex variants.

Abstract:
As a system of integrated homeostasis, life is susceptible to disruptions by visceral inflammation, which can disturb internal environment equilibrium. The role of body-spread subcutaneous fascia (scFascia) in this process is poorly understood. In the rat model of Salmonella-induced dysentery, scRNA-seq of scFascia and deep-learning analysis revealed Warburg-like metabolic reprogramming in macrophages (MPs) with reduced citrate cycle activity. Cd34+/Pdgfra+ telocytes (CPTCs) regulated MPs differentiation and proliferation via Wnt/Fgf signal, suggesting a pathological crosstalk pattern in the scFascia, herein termed the fascia-visceral inflammatory crosstalk pattern (FVICP). PySCENIC analysis indicated increased activity transcription factors Fosl1, Nfkb2, and Atf4, modulated by CPTCs signaling to MPs, downregulating aerobic respiration and upregulating cell cycle, DNA replication, and transcription. This study highlights scFascia's role in immunomodulation and metabolic reprogramming during visceral inflammation, underscoring its function in systemic homeostasis.

Abstract:
Deep learning architectures such as convolutional neural networks and Transformers have revolutionized biological sequence modeling, with recent advances driven by scaling up foundation and task-specific models. The computational resources and large datasets required, however, limit their applicability in biological contexts. We introduce Lyra, a subquadratic architecture for sequence modeling, grounded in the biological framework of epistasis for understanding sequence-to-function relationships. Mathematically, we demonstrate that state space models efficiently capture global epistatic interactions and combine them with projected gated convolutions for modeling local relationships. We demonstrate that Lyra is performant across over 100 wide-ranging biological tasks, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in many key areas, including protein fitness landscape prediction, biophysical property prediction (e.g. disordered protein region functions) peptide engineering applications (e.g. antibody binding, cell-penetrating peptide prediction), RNA structure analysis, RNA function prediction, and CRISPR guide design. It achieves this with orders-of-magnitude improvements in inference speed and reduction in parameters (up to 120,000-fold in our tests) compared to recent biology foundation models. Using Lyra, we were able to train and run every task in this study on two or fewer GPUs in under two hours, democratizing access to biological sequence modeling at SOTA performance, with potential applications to many fields.

Abstract:
This study explores the application of machine learning-based genetic linguistics for identifying heavy metal response genes in rice (Oryza sativa). By integrating convolutional neural networks and random forest algorithms, we developed a hybrid model capable of extracting and learning meaningful features from gene sequences, such as k-mer frequencies and physicochemical properties. The model was trained and tested on datasets of genes, achieving high predictive performance (precision: 0.89, F1-score: 0.82). RNA-seq and qRT-PCR experiments conducted on rice leaves which exposed to Hg0, revealed differential expression of genes associated with heavy metal responses, which validated the model's predictions. Co-expression network analysis identified 103 related genes, and a literature review indicated that these genes are highly likely to be involved in heavy metal-related biological processes. By integrating and comparing the analysis results with those of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), the validity of the new machine learning method was further demonstrated. This study highlights the efficacy of combining machine learning with genetic linguistics for large-scale gene prediction. It demonstrates a cost-effective and efficient approach for uncovering molecular mechanisms underlying heavy metal responses, with potential applications in developing stress-tolerant crop varieties.

Abstract:
We introduce Gene42, a novel family of Genomic Foundation Models (GFMs) designed to manage context lengths of up to 192,000 base pairs (bp) at a single-nucleotide resolution. Gene42 models utilize a decoder-only (LLaMA-style) architecture with a dense self-attention mechanism. Initially trained on fixed-length sequences of 4,096 bp, our models underwent continuous pretraining to extend the context length to 192,000 bp. This iterative extension allowed for the comprehensive processing of large-scale genomic data and the capture of intricate patterns and dependencies within the human genome. Gene42 is the first dense attention model capable of handling such extensive long context lengths in genomics, challenging state-space models that often rely on convolutional operators among other mechanisms. Our pretrained models exhibit notably low perplexity values and high reconstruction accuracy, highlighting their strong ability to model genomic data. Extensive experiments on various genomic benchmarks have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks, including biotype classification, regulatory region identification, chromatin profiling prediction, variant pathogenicity prediction, and species classification. The models are publicly available at huggingface.co/inceptionai.

Abstract:
How a single fertilized cell gives rise to a complex array of specialized cell types in development is a central question in biology. The cells grow, divide, and acquire differentiated characteristics through poorly understood molecular processes. A key approach to studying developmental processes is to infer the tree graph of cell lineage division and differentiation histories, providing an analytical framework for dissecting individual cells' molecular decisions during replication and differentiation. Although genetically engineered lineage-tracing methods have advanced the field, they are either infeasible or ethically constrained in many organisms. In contrast, modern single-cell technologies can measure high-content molecular profiles (e.g., transcriptomes) in a wide range of biological systems.   Here, we introduce CellTreeQM, a novel deep learning method based on transformer architectures that learns an embedding space with geometric properties optimized for tree-graph inference. By formulating lineage reconstruction as a tree-metric learning problem, we have systematically explored supervised, weakly supervised, and unsupervised training settings and present a Lineage Reconstruction Benchmark to facilitate comprehensive evaluation of our learning method. We benchmarked the method on (1) synthetic data modeled via Brownian motion with independent noise and spurious signals and (2) lineage-resolved single-cell RNA sequencing datasets. Experimental results show that CellTreeQM recovers lineage structures with minimal supervision and limited data, offering a scalable framework for uncovering cell lineage relationships in challenging animal models. To our knowledge, this is the first method to cast cell lineage inference explicitly as a metric learning task, paving the way for future computational models aimed at uncovering the molecular dynamics of cell lineage.

Abstract:
Cancer progression involves the sequential accumulation of genetic alterations that cumulatively shape the tumour phenotype. In prostate cancer, tumours can follow divergent evolutionary trajectories that lead to distinct subtypes, but the causes of this divergence remain unclear. While causal inference could elucidate the factors involved, conventional methods are unsuitable due to the possibility of unobserved confounders and ambiguity in the direction of causality. Here, we propose a method that circumvents these issues and apply it to genomic data from 829 prostate cancer patients. We identify several genetic alterations that drive divergence as well as others that prevent this transition, locking tumours into one trajectory. Further analysis reveals that these genetic alterations may cause each other, implying a positive-feedback loop that accelerates divergence. Our findings provide insights into how cancer subtypes emerge and offer a foundation for genomic surveillance strategies aimed at monitoring the progression of prostate cancer.

Abstract:
An important goal in cancer research is the survival prognosis of a patient based on a minimal panel of genomic and molecular markers such as genes or proteins. Purely data-driven models without any biological knowledge can produce non-interpretable results. We propose a penalized semiparametric Bayesian Cox model with graph-structured selection priors for sparse identification of multi-omics features by making use of a biologically meaningful graph via a Markov random field (MRF) prior to capturing known relationships between multi-omics features. Since the fixed graph in the MRF prior is for the prior probability distribution, it is not a hard constraint to determine variable selection, so the proposed model can verify known information and has the potential to identify new and novel biomarkers for drawing new biological knowledge. Our simulation results show that the proposed Bayesian Cox model with graph-based prior knowledge results in more trustable and stable variable selection and non-inferior survival prediction, compared to methods modeling the covariates independently without any prior knowledge. The results also indicate that the performance of the proposed model is robust to a partially correct graph in the MRF prior, meaning that in a real setting where not all the true network information between covariates is known, the graph can still be useful. The proposed model is applied to the primary invasive breast cancer patients data in The Cancer Genome Atlas project.

Abstract:
Identifying transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) is crucial for understanding gene regulation, as these sites enable transcription factors (TFs) to bind to DNA and modulate gene expression. Despite advances in high-throughput sequencing, accurately identifying TFBS remains challenging due to the vast genomic data and complex binding patterns. GCBLANE, a graph-enhanced convolutional bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) attention network, is introduced to address this issue. It integrates convolutional, multi-head attention, and recurrent layers with a graph neural network to detect key features for TFBS prediction. On 690 ENCODE ChIP-Seq datasets, GCBLANE achieved an average AUC of 0.943, and on 165 ENCODE datasets, it reached an AUC of 0.9495, outperforming advanced models that utilize multimodal approaches, including DNA shape information. This result underscores GCBLANE's effectiveness compared to other methods. By combining graph-based learning with sequence analysis, GCBLANE significantly advances TFBS prediction.

Abstract:
Metabolism plays a crucial role in sleep regulation, yet its effects are challenging to track in real time. This study introduces a machine learning-based framework to analyze sleep patterns and identify how metabolic changes influence sleep at specific time points. We first established that sleep periods in Drosophila melanogaster function independently, with no causal relationship between different sleep episodes. Using gradient boosting models and explainable artificial intelligence techniques, we quantified the influence of time-dependent sleep features. Causal inference and autocorrelation analyses further confirmed that sleep states at different times are statistically independent, providing a robust foundation for exploring metabolic effects on sleep. Applying this framework to flies with altered monocarboxylate transporter 2 expression, we found that changes in ketone transport modified sleep stability and disrupted transitions between day and night sleep. In an Alzheimers disease model, metabolic interventions such as beta hydroxybutyrate supplementation and intermittent fasting selectively influenced the timing of day to night transitions rather than uniformly altering sleep duration. Autoencoder based similarity scoring and wavelet analysis reinforced that metabolic effects on sleep were highly time dependent. This study presents a novel approach to studying sleep-metabolism interactions, revealing that metabolic states exert their strongest influence at distinct time points, shaping sleep stability and circadian transitions.

Abstract:
Background: Several studies show that large language models (LLMs) struggle with phenotype-driven gene prioritization for rare diseases. These studies typically use Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms to prompt foundation models like GPT and LLaMA to predict candidate genes. However, in real-world settings, foundation models are not optimized for domain-specific tasks like clinical diagnosis, yet inputs are unstructured clinical notes rather than standardized terms. How LLMs can be instructed to predict candidate genes or disease diagnosis from unstructured clinical notes remains a major challenge. Methods: We introduce RAG-driven CoT and CoT-driven RAG, two methods that combine Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to analyze clinical notes. A five-question CoT protocol mimics expert reasoning, while RAG retrieves data from sources like HPO and OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man). We evaluated these approaches on rare disease datasets, including 5,980 Phenopacket-derived notes, 255 literature-based narratives, and 220 in-house clinical notes from Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia. Results: We found that recent foundations models, including Llama 3.3-70B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B, outperformed earlier versions such as Llama 2 and GPT-3.5. We also showed that RAG-driven CoT and CoT-driven RAG both outperform foundation models in candidate gene prioritization from clinical notes; in particular, both methods with DeepSeek backbone resulted in a top-10 gene accuracy of over 40% on Phenopacket-derived clinical notes. RAG-driven CoT works better for high-quality notes, where early retrieval can anchor the subsequent reasoning steps in domain-specific evidence, while CoT-driven RAG has advantage when processing lengthy and noisy notes.

Abstract:
Pangenomes serve as a framework for joint analysis of genomes of related organisms. Several pangenome models were proposed, offering different functionalities, applications provided by available tools, their efficiency etc. Among them, two graph-based models are particularly widely used: variation graphs and de Bruijn graphs. In the current paper we propose an axiomatization of the desirable properties of a graph representation of a collection of strings. We show the relationship between variation graphs satisfying these criteria and de Bruijn graphs. This relationship can be used to efficiently build a variation graph representing a given set of genomes, transfer annotations between both models, compare the results of analyzes based on each model etc.

Abstract:
Genotype-to-Phenotype (G2P) prediction plays a pivotal role in crop breeding, enabling the identification of superior genotypes based on genomic data. Rice (Oryza sativa), one of the most important staple crops, faces challenges in improving yield and resilience due to the complex genetic architecture of agronomic traits and the limited sample size in breeding datasets. Current G2P prediction methods, such as GWAS and linear models, often fail to capture complex non-linear relationships between genotypes and phenotypes, leading to suboptimal prediction accuracy. Additionally, population stratification and overfitting are significant obstacles when models are applied to small datasets with diverse genetic backgrounds. This study introduces the Learnable Group Transform (LGT) method, which aims to overcome these challenges by combining the advantages of traditional linear models with advanced machine learning techniques. LGT utilizes a group-based transformation of genotype data to capture spatial relationships and genetic structures across diverse rice populations, offering flexibility to generalize even with limited data. Through extensive experiments on the Rice529 dataset, a panel of 529 rice accessions, LGT demonstrated substantial improvements in prediction accuracy for multiple agronomic traits, including yield and plant height, compared to state-of-the-art baselines such as linear models and recent deep learning approaches. Notably, LGT achieved an R^2 improvement of up to 15\% for yield prediction, significantly reducing error and demonstrating its ability to extract meaningful signals from high-dimensional, noisy genomic data. These results highlight the potential of LGT as a powerful tool for genomic prediction in rice breeding, offering a promising solution for accelerating the identification of high-yielding and resilient rice varieties.

Abstract:
Repetitive DNA sequences underpin genome architecture and evolutionary processes, yet they remain challenging to classify accurately. Terrier is a deep learning model designed to overcome these challenges by classifying repetitive DNA sequences using a publicly available, curated repeat sequence library trained under the RepeatMasker schema. Poor representation of taxa within repeat databases often limits the classification accuracy and reproducibility of current repeat annotation methods, limiting our understanding of repeat evolution and function. Terrier overcomes these challenges by leveraging deep learning for improved accuracy. Trained on Repbase, which includes over 100,000 repeat families -- four times more than Dfam -- Terrier maps 97.1% of Repbase sequences to RepeatMasker categories, offering the most comprehensive classification system available. When benchmarked against DeepTE, TERL, and TEclass2 in model organisms (rice, fruit flies, humans, and mice), Terrier achieved superior accuracy while classifying a broader range of sequences. Further validation in non-model amphibian, flatworm and Northern krill genomes highlights its effectiveness in improving classification in non-model species, facilitating research on repeat-driven evolution, genomic instability, and phenotypic variation.

Abstract:
Cis-regulatory elements (CREs), such as promoters and enhancers, are relatively short DNA sequences that directly regulate gene expression. The fitness of CREs, measured by their ability to modulate gene expression, highly depends on the nucleotide sequences, especially specific motifs known as transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs). Designing high-fitness CREs is crucial for therapeutic and bioengineering applications. Current CRE design methods are limited by two major drawbacks: (1) they typically rely on iterative optimization strategies that modify existing sequences and are prone to local optima, and (2) they lack the guidance of biological prior knowledge in sequence optimization. In this paper, we address these limitations by proposing a generative approach that leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to fine-tune a pre-trained autoregressive (AR) model. Our method incorporates data-driven biological priors by deriving computational inference-based rewards that simulate the addition of activator TFBSs and removal of repressor TFBSs, which are then integrated into the RL process. We evaluate our method on promoter design tasks in two yeast media conditions and enhancer design tasks for three human cell types, demonstrating its ability to generate high-fitness CREs while maintaining sequence diversity.

Abstract:
Genes, proteins and other biological entities influence one another via causal molecular networks. Causal relationships in such networks are mediated by complex and diverse mechanisms, through latent variables, and are often specific to cellular context. It remains challenging to characterise such networks in practice. Here, we present a novel framework to evaluate large language models (LLMs) for zero-shot inference of causal relationships in biology. In particular, we systematically evaluate causal claims obtained from an LLM using real-world interventional data. This is done over one hundred variables and thousands of causal hypotheses. Furthermore, we consider several prompting and retrieval-augmentation strategies, including large, and potentially conflicting, collections of scientific articles. Our results show that with tailored augmentation and prompting, even relatively small LLMs can capture meaningful aspects of causal structure in biological systems. This supports the notion that LLMs could act as orchestration tools in biological discovery, by helping to distil current knowledge in ways amenable to downstream analysis. Our approach to assessing LLMs with respect to experimental data is relevant for a broad range of problems at the intersection of causal learning, LLMs and scientific discovery.

Abstract:
The advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies has revolutionized genome analysis by enabling the rapid and cost-effective sequencing of large genomes. Despite these advancements, the increasing complexity and volume of genomic data present significant challenges related to accuracy, scalability, and computational efficiency. These challenges are mainly due to various forms of unwanted and unhandled variations in sequencing data, collectively referred to as noise. In this dissertation, we address these challenges by providing a deep understanding of different types of noise in genomic data and developing techniques to mitigate the impact of noise on genome analysis.   First, we introduce BLEND, a noise-tolerant hashing mechanism that quickly identifies both exactly matching and highly similar sequences with arbitrary differences using a single lookup of their hash values. Second, to enable scalable and accurate analysis of noisy raw nanopore signals, we propose RawHash, a novel mechanism that effectively reduces noise in raw nanopore signals and enables accurate, real-time analysis by proposing the first hash-based similarity search technique for raw nanopore signals. Third, we extend the capabilities of RawHash with RawHash2, an improved mechanism that 1) provides a better understanding of noise in raw nanopore signals to reduce it more effectively and 2) improves the robustness of mapping decisions. Fourth, we explore the broader implications and new applications of raw nanopore signal analysis by introducing Rawsamble, the first mechanism for all-vs-all overlapping of raw signals using hash-based search. Rawsamble enables the construction of de novo assemblies directly from raw signals without basecalling, which opens up new directions and uses for raw nanopore signal analysis.

Abstract:
Genomic language models (gLMs) have shown mostly modest success in identifying evolutionarily constrained elements in mammalian genomes. To address this issue, we introduce a novel framework for training gLMs that explicitly models nucleotide evolution on phylogenetic trees using multispecies whole-genome alignments. Our approach integrates an alignment into the loss function during training but does not require it for making predictions, thereby enhancing the model's applicability. We applied this framework to train PhyloGPN, a model that excels at predicting functionally disruptive variants from a single sequence alone and demonstrates strong transfer learning capabilities.

Abstract:
Comparing specific types of organisms as they are found across environmental conditions has helped inform how genes and gene products of these organisms relate to phenotypes and adaptation. In this study, we examine metatranscriptomic data as found for oceanic fungi across different oceanic sampling sites. A specific set of three genes was chosen for evaluation based on conserved orthology, known association with core physiological processes in fungi, and level of abundance within oceanic metatranscriptomic data. We report upon a potential association of genetic variance with environmental conditions of iron, salt and phosphate in oceanic waters based on heatmap visualization and PERMANOVA analysis.

Abstract:
Motivation: PCR is more economical and quicker than Next Generation Sequencing for detecting target organisms, with primer design being a critical step. In epidemiology with rapidly mutating viruses, designing effective primers is challenging. Traditional methods require substantial manual intervention and struggle to ensure effective primer design across different strains. For organisms with large, similar genomes like Escherichia coli and Shigella flexneri, differentiating between species is also difficult but crucial.   Results: We developed Primer C-VAE, a model based on a Variational Auto-Encoder framework with Convolutional Neural Networks to identify variants and generate specific primers. Using SARS-CoV-2, our model classified variants (alpha, beta, gamma, delta, omicron) with 98% accuracy and generated variant-specific primers. These primers appeared with >95% frequency in target variants and <5% in others, showing good performance in in-silico PCR tests. For Alpha, Delta, and Omicron, our primer pairs produced fragments <200 bp, suitable for qPCR detection. The model also generated effective primers for organisms with longer gene sequences like E. coli and S. flexneri.   Conclusion: Primer C-VAE is an interpretable deep learning approach for developing specific primer pairs for target organisms. This flexible, semi-automated and reliable tool works regardless of sequence completeness and length, allowing for qPCR applications and can be applied to organisms with large and highly similar genomes.

Abstract:
Genome length varies widely among organisms, from compact genomes of prokaryotes to vast and complex genomes of eukaryotes. In this study, we theoretically identify the evolutionary pressures that may have driven this divergence in genome length. We use a parameter-free model to study genome length evolution under selection pressure to minimize replication time and maximize information storage capacity. We show that prokaryotes tend to reduce genome length, constrained by a single replication origin, while eukaryotes expand their genomes by incorporating multiple replication origins. We propose a connection between genome length and cellular energetics, suggesting that endosymbiotic organelles, mitochondria and chloroplasts, evolutionarily regulate the number of replication origins, thereby influencing genome length in eukaryotes. We show that the above two selection pressures also lead to strict equalization of the number of purines and their corresponding base-pairing pyrimidines within a single DNA strand, known as Chagraff's second parity rule, a hitherto unexplained observation in genomes of nearly all known species. This arises from the symmetrization of replichore length, another observation that has been shown to hold across species, which our model reproduces. The model also reproduces other experimentally observed phenomena, such as a general preference for deletions over insertions, and elongation and high variance of genome lengths under reduced selection pressure for replication rate, termed the C-value paradox. We highlight the possibility of regulation of the firing of latent replication origins in response to cues from the extracellular environment leading to the regulation of cell cycle rates in multicellular eukaryotes.

Abstract:
Genotype-to-Phenotype prediction can promote advances in modern genomic research and crop improvement, guiding precision breeding and genomic selection. However, high-dimensional nonlinear features often hinder the accuracy of genotype-to-phenotype prediction by increasing computational complexity. The challenge also limits the predictive accuracy of traditional approaches. Therefore, effective solutions are needed to improve the accuracy of genotype-to-phenotype prediction. In our paper, we propose MLFformer. MLFformer is a Transformer-based architecture that incorporates the Fast Attention mechanism and a multilayer perceptron module to handle high-dimensional nonlinear features. In MLFformer, the Fast Attention mechanism is utilized to handle computational complexity and enhance processing efficiency. In addition, the MLP structure further captures high-dimensional nonlinear features. Through experiments, the results show that MLFformer reduces the average MAPE by 7.73% compared to the vanilla Transformer. In univariate and multivariate prediction scenarios, MLFformer achieves the best predictive performance among all compared models.

Abstract:
Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is a critical post-transcriptional surveillance mechanism that degrades transcripts with premature termination codons, safeguarding transcriptome integrity and shaping disease phenotypes. However, accurately predicting NMD efficiency remains challenging, as existing models often rely on simplistic rule-based heuristics or limited feature sets, constraining their accuracy and generalizability. Using paired DNA and RNA data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we benchmark embedding-only models and demonstrate that they underperform compared to a simple rule-based approach. To address this, we develop NMDEP (NMD Efficiency Predictor), an integrative framework that combines optimized rule-based methods, sequence embeddings, and curated biological features, achieving state-of-the-art predictive performance. Through explainable AI, we identify key NMD determinants, reaffirming established factors such as variant position while uncovering novel contributors like ribosome loading. Applied to over 2.9 million simulated stop-gain variants, NMDEP facilitates large-scale mRNA degradation assessments, advancing variant interpretation and disease research.

Abstract:
mRNA-based vaccines have become a major focus in the pharmaceutical industry. The coding sequence as well as the Untranslated Regions (UTRs) of an mRNA can strongly influence translation efficiency, stability, degradation, and other factors that collectively determine a vaccine's effectiveness. However, optimizing mRNA sequences for those properties remains a complex challenge. Existing deep learning models often focus solely on coding region optimization, overlooking the UTRs. We present Helix-mRNA, a structured state-space-based and attention hybrid model to address these challenges. In addition to a first pre-training, a second pre-training stage allows us to specialise the model with high-quality data. We employ single nucleotide tokenization of mRNA sequences with codon separation, ensuring prior biological and structural information from the original mRNA sequence is not lost. Our model, Helix-mRNA, outperforms existing methods in analysing both UTRs and coding region properties. It can process sequences 6x longer than current approaches while using only 10% of the parameters of existing foundation models. Its predictive capabilities extend to all mRNA regions. We open-source the model (https://github.com/helicalAI/helical) and model weights (https://huggingface.co/helical-ai/helix-mRNA).

Abstract:
We consider the problem of predicting gene expressions from DNA sequences. A key challenge of this task is to find the regulatory elements that control gene expressions. Here, we introduce Seq2Exp, a Sequence to Expression network explicitly designed to discover and extract regulatory elements that drive target gene expression, enhancing the accuracy of the gene expression prediction. Our approach captures the causal relationship between epigenomic signals, DNA sequences and their associated regulatory elements. Specifically, we propose to decompose the epigenomic signals and the DNA sequence conditioned on the causal active regulatory elements, and apply an information bottleneck with the Beta distribution to combine their effects while filtering out non-causal components. Our experiments demonstrate that Seq2Exp outperforms existing baselines in gene expression prediction tasks and discovers influential regions compared to commonly used statistical methods for peak detection such as MACS3. The source code is released as part of the AIRS library (https://github.com/divelab/AIRS/).

Abstract:
Single-cell proteomics (SCP) is transforming our understanding of biological complexity by shifting from bulk proteomics, where signals are averaged over thousands of cells, to the proteome analysis of individual cells. This granular perspective reveals distinct cell states, population heterogeneity, and the underpinnings of disease pathogenesis that bulk approaches may obscure. However, SCP demands exceptional sensitivity, precise cell handling, and robust data processing to overcome the inherent challenges of analyzing picogram-level protein samples without amplification. Recent innovations in sample preparation, separations, data acquisition strategies, and specialized mass spectrometry instrumentation have substantially improved proteome coverage and throughput. Approaches that integrate complementary omics, streamline multi-step sample processing, and automate workflows through microfluidics and specialized platforms promise to further push SCP boundaries. Advances in computational methods, especially for data normalization and imputation, address the pervasive issue of missing values, enabling more reliable downstream biological interpretations. Despite these strides, higher throughput, reproducibility, and consensus best practices remain pressing needs in the field. This mini review summarizes the latest progress in SCP technology and software solutions, highlighting how closer integration of analytical, computational, and experimental strategies will facilitate deeper and broader coverage of single-cell proteomes.

Abstract:
Advances in natural language processing and large language models have sparked growing interest in modeling DNA, often referred to as the "language of life". However, DNA modeling poses unique challenges. First, it requires the ability to process ultra-long DNA sequences while preserving single-nucleotide resolution, as individual nucleotides play a critical role in DNA function. Second, success in this domain requires excelling at both generative and understanding tasks: generative tasks hold potential for therapeutic and industrial applications, while understanding tasks provide crucial insights into biological mechanisms and diseases. To address these challenges, we propose HybriDNA, a decoder-only DNA language model that incorporates a hybrid Transformer-Mamba2 architecture, seamlessly integrating the strengths of attention mechanisms with selective state-space models. This hybrid design enables HybriDNA to efficiently process DNA sequences up to 131kb in length with single-nucleotide resolution. HybriDNA achieves state-of-the-art performance across 33 DNA understanding datasets curated from the BEND, GUE, and LRB benchmarks, and demonstrates exceptional capability in generating synthetic cis-regulatory elements (CREs) with desired properties. Furthermore, we show that HybriDNA adheres to expected scaling laws, with performance improving consistently as the model scales from 300M to 3B and 7B parameters. These findings underscore HybriDNA's versatility and its potential to advance DNA research and applications, paving the way for innovations in understanding and engineering the "language of life".

Abstract:
Recent advancements in spatial transcriptomics technologies allow researchers to simultaneously measure RNA expression levels for hundreds to thousands of genes while preserving spatial information within tissues, providing critical insights into spatial gene expression patterns, tissue organization, and gene functionality. However, existing methods for clustering spatially variable genes (SVGs) into co-expression modules often fail to detect rare or unique spatial expression patterns. To address this, we present spatial transcriptomics iterative hierarchical clustering (stIHC), a novel method for clustering SVGs into co-expression modules, representing groups of genes with shared spatial expression patterns. Through three simulations and applications to spatial transcriptomics datasets from technologies such as 10x Visium, 10x Xenium, and Spatial Transcriptomics, stIHC outperforms clustering approaches used by popular SVG detection methods, including SPARK, SPARK-X, MERINGUE, and SpatialDE. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis confirms that genes within each module share consistent biological functions, supporting the functional relevance of spatial co-expression. Robust across technologies with varying gene numbers and spatial resolution, stIHC provides a powerful tool for decoding the spatial organization of gene expression and the functional structure of complex tissues.

Abstract:
Trajectory inference is used to order single-cell omics data along a path that reflects a continuous transition between cells. This approach is useful for studying processes like cell differentiation, where a stem cell matures into a specialized cell type, or investigating state changes in pathological conditions. In the current article, we provide a general introduction to trajectory inference, explaining the concepts and assumptions underlying the different methods. We then briefly discuss the strengths and weaknesses of different trajectory inference methods. We also describe best practices for using trajectory inference, such as how to validate the results and how to interpret them in the context of biological knowledge. Finally, the article will discuss some of the applications of trajectory inference in single-cell omics research. These applications include studying cell differentiation, development, and disease. We provide examples of how trajectory inference has been used to gain new insights into these processes.

Abstract:
Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) has significantly advanced our understanding of the disease etiology of neurodegenerative disorders. However, the low quality of specimens derived from postmortem brain tissues, combined with the high variability caused by disease heterogeneity, makes it challenging to integrate snRNA-seq data from multiple sources for precise analyses. To address these challenges, we present scMamba, a pre-trained model designed to improve the quality and utility of snRNA-seq analysis, with a particular focus on neurodegenerative diseases. Inspired by the recent Mamba model, scMamba introduces a novel architecture that incorporates a linear adapter layer, gene embeddings, and bidirectional Mamba blocks, enabling efficient processing of snRNA-seq data while preserving information from the raw input. Notably, scMamba learns generalizable features of cells and genes through pre-training on snRNA-seq data, without relying on dimension reduction or selection of highly variable genes. We demonstrate that scMamba outperforms benchmark methods in various downstream tasks, including cell type annotation, doublet detection, imputation, and the identification of differentially expressed genes.

Abstract:
The integration of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics (ST) data is crucial for understanding gene expression in spatial context. Existing methods for such integration have limited performance, with structural similarity often below 60\%, We attribute this limitation to the failure to consider causal relationships between genes. We present CausalGeD, which combines diffusion and autoregressive processes to leverage these relationships. By generalizing the Causal Attention Transformer from image generation to gene expression data, our model captures regulatory mechanisms without predefined relationships. Across 10 tissue datasets, CausalGeD outperformed state-of-the-art baselines by 5- 32\% in key metrics, including Pearson's correlation and structural similarity, advancing both technical and biological insights.

Abstract:
How can we identify causal genetic mechanisms that govern bacterial traits? Initial efforts entrusting machine learning models to handle the task of predicting phenotype from genotype return high accuracy scores. However, attempts to extract any meaning from the predictive models are found to be corrupted by falsely identified "causal" features. Relying solely on pattern recognition and correlations is unreliable, significantly so in bacterial genomics settings where high-dimensionality and spurious associations are the norm. Though it is not yet clear whether we can overcome this hurdle, significant efforts are being made towards discovering potential high-risk bacterial genetic variants. In view of this, we set up open problems surrounding phenotype prediction from bacterial whole-genome datasets and extending those to learning causal effects, and discuss challenges that impact the reliability of a machine's decision-making when faced with datasets of this nature.

Abstract:
The interactions between DNA, RNA, and proteins are fundamental to biological processes, as illustrated by the central dogma of molecular biology. Although modern biological pre-trained models have achieved great success in analyzing these macromolecules individually, their interconnected nature remains underexplored. This paper follows the guidance of the central dogma to redesign both the data and model pipeline and offers a comprehensive framework, Life-Code, that spans different biological functions. As for data flow, we propose a unified pipeline to integrate multi-omics data by reverse-transcribing RNA and reverse-translating amino acids into nucleotide-based sequences. As for the model, we design a codon tokenizer and a hybrid long-sequence architecture to encode the interactions between coding and non-coding regions through masked modeling pre-training. To model the translation and folding process with coding sequences, Life-Code learns protein structures of the corresponding amino acids by knowledge distillation from off-the-shelf protein language models. Such designs enable Life-Code to capture complex interactions within genetic sequences, providing a more comprehensive understanding of multi-omics with the central dogma. Extensive experiments show that Life-Code achieves state-of-the-art results on various tasks across three omics, highlighting its potential for advancing multi-omics analysis and interpretation.

Advancements in DNA sequencing technologies have significantly improved our ability to decode genomic sequences. However, the prediction and interpretation of these sequences remain challenging due to the intricate nature of genetic material. Large language models (LLMs) have introduced new opportunities for biological sequence analysis. Recent developments in genomic language models have underscored the potential of LLMs in deciphering DNA sequences. Nonetheless, existing models often face limitations in robustness and application scope, primarily due to constraints in model structure and training data scale. To address these limitations, we present GENERator, a generative genomic foundation model featuring a context length of 98k base pairs (bp) and 1.2B parameters. Trained on an expansive dataset comprising 386B bp of eukaryotic DNA, the GENERator demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across both established and newly proposed benchmarks. The model adheres to the central dogma of molecular biology, accurately generating protein-coding sequences that translate into proteins structurally analogous to known families. It also shows significant promise in sequence optimization, particularly through the prompt-responsive generation of enhancer sequences with specific activity profiles. These capabilities position the GENERator as a pivotal tool for genomic research and biotechnological advancement, enhancing our ability to interpret and predict complex biological systems and enabling precise genomic interventions. Implementation details and supplementary resources are available at https://github.com/GenerTeam/GENERator.

Abstract:
In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art results in various biological sequence analysis tasks, such as sequence classification, structure prediction, and function prediction. Similar to advancements in AI for other scientific fields, deeper research into biological LLMs has begun to focus on using these models to rediscover important existing biological laws or uncover entirely new patterns in biological sequences. This study leverages GPT-like LLMs to utilize language transfer capabilities to rediscover the genetic code rules of the central dogma. In our experimental design, we transformed the central dogma into a binary classification problem of aligning DNA sequences with protein sequences, where positive examples are matching DNA and protein sequences, and negative examples are non-matching pairs. We first trained a GPT-2 model from scratch using a dataset comprising protein sequences, DNA sequences, and sequences from languages such as English and Chinese. Subsequently, we fine-tuned the model using the natural language sentences similarity judgment dataset from PAWS-X. When tested on a dataset for DNA and protein sequence alignment judgment, the fine-tuned model achieved a classification accuracy of 81%. The study also analyzed factors contributing to this zero-shot capability, including model training stability and types of training data. This research demonstrates that LLMs can, through the transfer of natural language capabilities and solely relying on the analysis of sequences themselves, rediscover the central dogma without prior knowledge of it. This study bridges natural language and genetic language, opening a new door for AI-driven biological research.

Abstract:
Conditional generation models for longitudinal sequences can generate new or modified trajectories given a conditioning input. While effective at generating entire sequences, these models typically lack control over the timing and scope of the edits. Most existing approaches either operate on univariate sequences or assume that the condition affects all variables and time steps. However, many scientific and clinical applications require more precise interventions, where a condition takes effect only after a specific time and influences only a subset of variables. We introduce CLEF, a controllable sequence editing model for conditional generation of immediate and delayed effects in multivariate longitudinal sequences. CLEF learns temporal concepts that encode how and when a condition alters future sequence evolution. These concepts allow CLEF to apply targeted edits to the affected time steps and variables while preserving the rest of the sequence. We evaluate CLEF on 6 datasets spanning cellular reprogramming and patient health trajectories, comparing against 9 state-of-the-art baselines. CLEF improves immediate sequence editing accuracy by up to 36.01% (MAE). Unlike prior models, CLEF enables one-step conditional generation at arbitrary future times, outperforming them in delayed sequence editing by up to 65.71% (MAE). We test CLEF under counterfactual inference assumptions and show up to 63.19% (MAE) improvement on zero-shot conditional generation of counterfactual trajectories. In a case study of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, CLEF identifies clinical interventions that generate realistic counterfactual trajectories shifted toward healthier outcomes.

Abstract:
Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable generalizability across diverse tasks, yet genomic foundation models (GFMs) still require separate finetuning for each downstream application, creating significant overhead as model sizes grow. Moreover, existing GFMs are constrained by rigid output formats, limiting their applicability to various genomic tasks. In this work, we revisit the transformer-based auto-regressive models and introduce Omni-DNA, a family of cross-modal multi-task models ranging from 20 million to 1 billion parameters. Our approach consists of two stages: (i) pretraining on DNA sequences with next token prediction objective, and (ii) expanding the multi-modal task-specific tokens and finetuning for multiple downstream tasks simultaneously. When evaluated on the Nucleotide Transformer and GB benchmarks, Omni-DNA achieves state-of-the-art performance on 18 out of 26 tasks. Through multi-task finetuning, Omni-DNA addresses 10 acetylation and methylation tasks at once, surpassing models trained on each task individually. Finally, we design two complex genomic tasks, DNA2Function and Needle-in-DNA, which map DNA sequences to textual functional descriptions and images, respectively, indicating Omni-DNA's cross-modal capabilities to broaden the scope of genomic applications.

Abstract:
The exploration of cellular heterogeneity within the tumor microenvironment (TME) via single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is essential for understanding cancer progression and response to therapy. Current scRNA-seq approaches, however, lack spatial context and rely on incomplete datasets of ligand-receptor interactions (LRIs), limiting accurate cell type annotation and cell-cell communication (CCC) inference. This study addresses these challenges using a novel graph neural network (GNN) model that enhances cell type prediction and cell interaction analysis. Our study utilized a dataset consisting of 49,020 cells from 19 patients across three cancer types: Leukemia, Breast Invasive Carcinoma, and Colorectal Cancer. The proposed scGSL model demonstrated robust performance, achieving an average accuracy of 84.83%, precision of 86.23%, recall of 81.51%, and an F1 score of 80.92% across all datasets. These metrics represent a significant enhancement over existing methods, which typically exhibit lower performance metrics. Additionally, by reviewing existing literature on gene interactions within the TME, the scGSL model proves to robustly identify biologically meaningful gene interactions in an unsupervised manner, validated by significant expression differences in key gene pairs across various cancers.

Abstract:
Transcription factors are proteins that regulate the expression of genes by binding to specific genomic regions known as Transcription Factor Binding Sites (TFBSs), typically located in the promoter regions of those genes. Accurate prediction of these binding sites is essential for understanding the complex gene regulatory networks underlying various cellular functions. In this regard, many deep learning models have been developed for such prediction, but there is still scope of improvement. In this work, we have developed a deep learning model which uses pre-trained DNABERT, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) module, a Modified Convolutional Block Attention Module (MCBAM), a Multi-Scale Convolutions with Attention (MSCA) module and an output module. The pre-trained DNABERT is used for sequence embedding, thereby capturing the long-term dependencies in the DNA sequences while the CNN, MCBAM and MSCA modules are useful in extracting higher-order local features. TFBS-Finder is trained and tested on 165 ENCODE ChIP-seq datasets. We have also performed ablation studies as well as cross-cell line validations and comparisons with other models. The experimental results show the superiority of the proposed method in predicting TFBSs compared to the existing methodologies. The codes and the relevant datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/NimishaGhosh/TFBS-Finder/.

Abstract:
The rise of single-cell sequencing technologies has revolutionized the exploration of drug resistance, revealing the crucial role of cellular heterogeneity in advancing precision medicine. By building computational models from existing single-cell drug response data, we can rapidly annotate cellular responses to drugs in subsequent trials. To this end, we developed scGSDR, a model that integrates two computational pipelines grounded in the knowledge of cellular states and gene signaling pathways, both essential for understanding biological gene semantics. scGSDR enhances predictive performance by incorporating gene semantics and employs an interpretability module to identify key pathways contributing to drug resistance phenotypes. Our extensive validation, which included 16 experiments covering 11 drugs, demonstrates scGSDR's superior predictive accuracy, when trained with either bulk-seq or scRNA-seq data, achieving high AUROC, AUPR, and F1 Scores. The model's application has extended from single-drug predictions to scenarios involving drug combinations. Leveraging pathways of known drug target genes, we found that scGSDR's cell-pathway attention scores are biologically interpretable, which helped us identify other potential drug-related genes. Literature review of top-ranking genes in our predictions such as BCL2, CCND1, the AKT family, and PIK3CA for PLX4720; and ICAM1, VCAM1, NFKB1, NFKBIA, and RAC1 for Paclitaxel confirmed their relevance. In conclusion, scGSDR, by incorporating gene semantics, enhances predictive modeling of cellular responses to diverse drugs, proving invaluable for scenarios involving both single drug and combination therapies and effectively identifying key resistance-related pathways, thus advancing precision medicine and targeted therapy development.

Abstract:
Over the last decade, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified numerous genetic variants associated with complex diseases. These associations have the potential to reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying complex diseases and lead to the identification of novel drug targets. Despite these advancements, the biological pathways and mechanisms linking genetic variants to complex diseases are still not fully understood. Most trait-associated variants reside in non-coding regions and are presumed to influence phenotypes through regulatory effects on gene expression. Yet, it is often unclear which genes they regulate and in which cell types this regulation occurs. Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) aim to bridge this gap by detecting trait-associated tissue gene expression regulated by GWAS variants. However, traditional TWAS approaches frequently overlook the critical contributions of trans-regulatory effects and fail to integrate comprehensive regulatory networks. Here, we present a novel framework that leverages tissue-specific gene regulatory networks (GRNs) to integrate cis- and trans-genetic regulatory effects into the TWAS framework for complex diseases. We validate our approach using coronary artery disease (CAD), utilizing data from the STARNET project, which provides multi-tissue gene expression and genetic data from around 600 living patients with cardiovascular disease. Preliminary results demonstrate the potential of our GRN-driven framework to uncover more genes and pathways that may underlie CAD. This framework extends traditional TWAS methodologies by utilizing tissue-specific regulatory insights and advancing the understanding of complex disease genetic architecture.

Abstract:
Rare diseases are challenging to diagnose due to limited patient data and genetic diversity. Despite advances in variant prioritization, many cases remain undiagnosed. While large language models (LLMs) have performed well in medical exams, their effectiveness in diagnosing rare genetic diseases has not been assessed. To identify causal genes, we benchmarked various LLMs for gene prioritization. Using multi-agent and Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) classification, we categorized patients based on phenotypes and solvability levels. As gene set size increased, LLM performance deteriorated, so we used a divide-and-conquer strategy to break the task into smaller subsets. At baseline, GPT-4 outperformed other LLMs, achieving near 30% accuracy in ranking causal genes correctly. The multi-agent and HPO approaches helped distinguish confidently solved cases from challenging ones, highlighting the importance of known gene-phenotype associations and phenotype specificity. We found that cases with specific phenotypes or clear associations were more accurately solved. However, we observed biases toward well-studied genes and input order sensitivity, which hindered gene prioritization. Our divide-and-conquer strategy improved accuracy by overcoming these biases. By utilizing HPO classification, novel multi-agent techniques, and our LLM strategy, we improved causal gene identification accuracy compared to our baseline evaluation. This approach streamlines rare disease diagnosis, facilitates reanalysis of unsolved cases, and accelerates gene discovery, supporting the development of targeted diagnostics and therapies.

Abstract:
The rapid emergence of single-cell data has facilitated the study of many different biological conditions at the cellular level. Cluster analysis has been widely applied to identify cell types, capturing the essential patterns of the original data in a much more concise form. One challenge in the cluster analysis of cells is matching clusters extracted from datasets of different origins or conditions. Many existing algorithms cannot recognize new cell types present in only one of the two samples when establishing a correspondence between clusters obtained from two samples. Additionally, when there are more than two samples, it is advantageous to align clusters across all samples simultaneously rather than performing pairwise alignment. Our approach aims to construct a taxonomy for cell clusters across all samples to better annotate these clusters and effectively extract features for downstream analysis. A new system for constructing cell-type taxonomy has been developed by combining the technique of Optimal Transport with Relaxed Marginal Constraints (OT-RMC) and the simultaneous alignment of clusters across multiple samples. OT-RMC allows us to address challenges that arise when the proportions of clusters vary substantially between samples or when some clusters do not appear in all the samples. Experiments on more than twenty datasets demonstrate that the taxonomy constructed by this new system can yield highly accurate annotation of cell types. Additionally, sample-level features extracted based on the taxonomy result in accurate classification of samples.

Abstract:
The emergence of the Next Generation Sequencing increases drastically the volume of transcriptomic data. Although many standalone algorithms and workflows for novel microRNA (miRNA) prediction have been proposed, few are designed for processing large volume of sequence data from large genomes, and even fewer further annotate functional miRNAs by analyzing multiple libraries. We propose an improved pipeline for a high volume data facility by implementing mirLibSpark based on the Apache Spark framework. This pipeline is the fastest actual method, and provides an accuracy improvement compared to the standard. In this paper, we deliver the first distributed functional miRNA predictor as a standalone and fully automated package. It is an efficient and accurate miRNA predictor with functional insight. Furthermore, it compiles with the gold-standard requirement on plant miRNA predictions.

Abstract:
Motivation: Nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDVs) are notable for their large genomes and extensive gene repertoires, which contribute to their widespread environmental presence and critical roles in processes such as host metabolic reprogramming and nutrient cycling. Metagenomic sequencing has emerged as a powerful tool for uncovering novel NCLDVs in environmental samples. However, identifying NCLDV sequences in metagenomic data remains challenging due to their high genomic diversity, limited reference genomes, and shared regions with other microbes. Existing alignment-based and machine learning methods struggle with achieving optimal trade-offs between sensitivity and precision. Results: In this work, we present GiantHunter, a reinforcement learning-based tool for identifying NCLDVs from metagenomic data. By employing a Monte Carlo tree search strategy, GiantHunter dynamically selects representative non-NCLDV sequences as the negative training data, enabling the model to establish a robust decision boundary. Benchmarking on rigorously designed experiments shows that GiantHunter achieves high precision while maintaining competitive sensitivity, improving the F1-score by 10% and reducing computational cost by 90% compared to the second-best method. To demonstrate its real-world utility, we applied GiantHunter to 60 metagenomic datasets collected from six cities along the Yangtze River, located both upstream and downstream of the Three Gorges Dam. The results reveal significant differences in NCLDV diversity correlated with proximity to the dam, likely influenced by reduced flow velocity caused by the dam. These findings highlight the potential of GiantSeeker to advance our understanding of NCLDVs and their ecological roles in diverse environments.

Abstract:
The integration of bioinformatics predictions and experimental validation plays a pivotal role in advancing biological research, from understanding molecular mechanisms to developing therapeutic strategies. Bioinformatics tools and methods offer powerful means for predicting gene functions, protein interactions, and regulatory networks, but these predictions must be validated through experimental approaches to ensure their biological relevance. This review explores the various methods and technologies used for experimental validation, including gene expression analysis, protein-protein interaction verification, and pathway validation. We also discuss the challenges involved in translating computational predictions to experimental settings and highlight the importance of collaboration between bioinformatics and experimental research. Finally, emerging technologies, such as CRISPR gene editing, next-generation sequencing, and artificial intelligence, are shaping the future of bioinformatics validation and driving more accurate and efficient biological discoveries.

Abstract:
Normalization is a critical step in quantitative analyses of biological processes. Recent works show that cross-platform integration and normalization enable machine learning (ML) training on RNA microarray and RNA-seq data, but no independent datasets were used in their studies. Therefore, it is unclear how to improve ML modelling performance on independent RNA array and RNA-seq based datasets. Inspired by the house-keeping genes that are commonly used in experimental biology, this study tests the hypothesis that non-differentially expressed genes (NDEG) may improve normalization of transcriptomic data and subsequently cross-platform modelling performance of ML models. Microarray and RNA-seq datasets of the TCGA breast cancer were used as independent training and test datasets, respectively, to classify the molecular subtypes of breast cancer. NDEG (p>0.85) and differentially expressed genes (DEG, p<0.05) were selected based on the p values of ANOVA analysis and used for subsequent data normalization and classification, respectively. Models trained based on data from one platform were used for testing on the other platform. Our data show that NDEG and DEG gene selection could effectively improve the model classification performance. Normalization methods based on parametric statistical analysis were inferior to those based on nonparametric statistics. In this study, the LOG_QN and LOG_QNZ normalization methods combined with the neural network classification model seem to achieve better performance. Therefore, NDEG-based normalization appears useful for cross-platform testing on completely independent datasets. However, more studies are required to examine whether NDEG-based normalization can improve ML classification performance in other datasets and other omic data types.

Abstract:
The proliferation of omics datasets in public repositories has created unprecedented opportunities for biomedical research but has also posed significant challenges for their integration, particularly due to missing genes and platform-specific discrepancies. Traditional gene expression metaanalysis often focuses on individual genes, leading to data loss and limited biological insights when there are missing genes across different studies. To address these limitations, we propose GSEMA (Gene Set Enrichment Meta-Analysis), a novel methodology that leverages singlesample enrichment scoring to aggregate gene expression data into pathway-level matrices. By applying meta-analysis techniques to enrichment scores, GSEMA preserves the magnitude and directionality of effects, enabling the definition of pathway activity across datasets. Using simulated data and case studies on Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and Parkinson's Disease (PD), we demonstrate that GSEMA outperforms other methods in controlling false positive rates while providing meaningful biological interpretations. GSEMA methodology is implemented as an R package available on CRAN repository

Abstract:
The commercial value of economically significant fruits, including date palm fruit (dates), is influenced by various factors, such as biochemical composition and morphological features like size, shape, and visual appearance, which are key determinants of their quality and market value. Dates are typically consumed at the dry stage (Tamar), during which they exhibit a wide range of physical characteristics, such as color, length, weight, and skin appearance. Understanding the genetic basis of these traits is crucial for improving crop quality and breeding new cultivars. In this study, we integrated a genome dataset from highly diverse date cultivars with phenotypes of dry fruit such as length, width, area, and weight, identifying multiple significant genetic loci (SNPs) associated with these traits. We also identified candidate genes located near the associated SNPs that are involved in biological processes such as cell differentiation, proliferation, growth, and the regulation of signalling pathways for growth regulators like auxin and abscisic acid, as observed in other plants. Gene expression analysis reveals that many of these genes are highly expressed in the early stage of fruit development when the fruit attains its maximum size and weight. These findings will enhance our understanding of genetic determinants of fruit size particularly at the commercially important Tamar stage.

Abstract:
Analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data is often conducted through network projections such as coexpression networks, primarily due to the abundant availability of network analysis tools for downstream tasks. However, this approach has several limitations: loss of higher-order information, inefficient data representation caused by converting a sparse dataset to a fully connected network, and overestimation of coexpression due to zero-inflation. To address these limitations, we propose conceptualizing scRNA-seq expression data as hypergraphs, which are generalized graphs in which the hyperedges can connect more than two vertices. In the context of scRNA-seq data, the hypergraph nodes represent cells and the edges represent genes. Each hyperedge connects all cells where its corresponding gene is actively expressed and records the expression of the gene across different cells. This hypergraph conceptualization enables us to explore multi-way relationships beyond the pairwise interactions in coexpression networks without loss of information. We propose two novel clustering methods: (1) the Dual-Importance Preference Hypergraph Walk (DIPHW) and (2) the Coexpression and Memory-Integrated Dual-Importance Preference Hypergraph Walk (CoMem-DIPHW). They outperform established methods on both simulated and real scRNA-seq datasets. The improvement brought by our proposed methods is especially significant when data modularity is weak. Furthermore, CoMem-DIPHW incorporates the gene coexpression network, cell coexpression network, and the cell-gene expression hypergraph from the single-cell abundance counts data altogether for embedding computation. This approach accounts for both the local level information from single-cell level gene expression and the global level information from the pairwise similarity in the two coexpression networks.

Abstract:
Genome-centric analysis of metagenomic samples is a powerful method for understanding the function of microbial communities. Calculating read coverage is a central part of analysis, enabling differential coverage binning for recovery of genomes and estimation of microbial community composition. Coverage is determined by processing read alignments to reference sequences of either contigs or genomes. Per-reference coverage is typically calculated in an ad-hoc manner, with each software package providing its own implementation and specific definition of coverage. Here we present a unified software package CoverM which calculates several coverage statistics for contigs and genomes in an ergonomic and flexible manner. It uses 'Mosdepth arrays' for computational efficiency and avoids unnecessary I/O overhead by calculating coverage statistics from streamed read alignment results. CoverM is free software available at https://github.com/wwood/coverm. CoverM is implemented in Rust, with Python (https://github.com/apcamargo/pycoverm) and Julia (https://github.com/JuliaBinaryWrappers/CoverM_jll.jl) interfaces.

Abstract:
Live-cell imaging experiments have shown that the distal dynamics between enhancers and promoters are unexpectedly rapid and incompatible with standard polymer models. The discordance between the compact static chromatin organization and dynamics is a conundrum that violates the expected structure-function relationship. We developed a theory to predict chromatin dynamics by accurately determining three-dimensional (3D) structures from static Hi-C contact maps or fixed-cell imaging data. Using the calculated 3D coordinates, the theory accurately forecasts experimentally observed two-point chromatin dynamics. It predicts rapid enhancer-promoter interactions and uncovers a scaling relationship between two-point relaxation time and genomic separation, closely matching recent measurements. The theory predicts that cohesin depletion accelerates single-locus diffusion while significantly slowing relaxation dynamics within topologically associating domains (TADs). Our results demonstrate that chromatin dynamics can be reliably inferred from static structural data, reinforcing the notion that 3D chromatin structure governs dynamic behavior. This general framework offers powerful tools for exploring chromatin dynamics across diverse biological contexts.

Abstract:
Recent advances in cellular research demonstrate that scRNA-seq characterizes cellular heterogeneity, while spatial transcriptomics reveals the spatial distribution of gene expression. Cell representation is the fundamental issue in the two fields. Here, we propose Topology-encoded Latent Hyperbolic Geometry (TopoLa), a computational framework enhancing cell representations by capturing fine-grained intercellular topological relationships. The framework introduces a new metric, TopoLa distance (TLd), which quantifies the geometric distance between cells within latent hyperbolic space, capturing the network's topological structure more effectively. With this framework, the cell representation can be enhanced considerably by performing convolution on its neighboring cells. Performance evaluation across seven biological tasks, including scRNA-seq data clustering and spatial transcriptomics domain identification, shows that TopoLa significantly improves the performance of several state-of-the-art models. These results underscore the generalizability and robustness of TopoLa, establishing it as a valuable tool for advancing both biological discovery and computational methodologies.

Abstract:
Understanding how molecular changes caused by genetic variation drive disease risk is crucial for deciphering disease mechanisms. However, interpreting genome sequences is challenging because of the vast size of the human genome, and because its consequences manifest across a wide range of cells, tissues and scales -- spanning from molecular to whole organism level. Here, we present Phenformer, a multi-scale genetic language model that learns to generate mechanistic hypotheses as to how differences in genome sequence lead to disease-relevant changes in expression across cell types and tissues directly from DNA sequences of up to 88 million base pairs. Using whole genome sequencing data from more than 150 000 individuals, we show that Phenformer generates mechanistic hypotheses about disease-relevant cell and tissue types that match literature better than existing state-of-the-art methods, while using only sequence data. Furthermore, disease risk predictors enriched by Phenformer show improved prediction performance and generalisation to diverse populations. Accurate multi-megabase scale interpretation of whole genomes without additional experimental data enables both a deeper understanding of molecular mechanisms involved in disease and improved disease risk prediction at the level of individuals.

Abstract:
Accurately identifying cancer samples is crucial for precise diagnosis and effective patient treatment. Traditional methods falter with high-dimensional and high feature-to-sample count ratios, which are critical for classifying cancer samples. This study aims to develop a novel feature selection framework specifically for transcriptome data and propose two ensemble classifiers. For feature selection, we partition the transcriptome dataset vertically based on feature types. Then apply the Boruta feature selection process on each of the partitions, combine the results, and apply Boruta again on the combined result. We repeat the process with different parameters of Boruta and prepare the final feature set. Finally, we constructed two ensemble ML models based on LR, SVM and XGBoost classifiers with max voting and averaging probability approach. We used 10-fold cross-validation to ensure robust and reliable classification performance. With 97.11\% accuracy and 0.9996 AUC value, our approach performs better compared to existing state-of-the-art methods to classify 33 types of cancers. A set of 12 types of cancer is traditionally challenging to differentiate between each other due to their similarity in tissue of origin. Our method accurately identifies over 90\% of samples from these 12 types of cancers, which outperforms all known methods presented in existing literature. The gene set enrichment analysis reveals that our framework's selected features have enriched the pathways highly related to cancers. This study develops a feature selection framework to select features highly related to cancer development and leads to identifying different types of cancer samples with higher accuracy.

Abstract:
The standard of care for ovarian cancer comprises cytoreductive surgery, followed by adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy plus taxane therapy and maintenance therapy with the antiangiogenic compound bevacizumab and/or a PARP inhibitor. Nevertheless, there is currently no clear clinical indication for the use of bevacizumab, highlighting the urgent need for biomarkers to assess the response to bevacizumab. In the present study, based on a novel RNA-seq dataset (n=181) and a previously published microarray-based dataset (n=377), we have identified an expression signature potentially associated with benefit from bevacizumab addition and assumed to reflect cancer stemness acquisition driven by activation of CTCFL. Patients with this signature demonstrated improved overall survival when bevacizumab was added to standard chemotherapy in both novel (HR=0.41(0.23-0.74), adj.p-value=7.70e-03) and previously published cohorts (HR=0.51(0.34-0.75), adj.p-value=3.25e-03), while no significant differences in survival explained by treatment were observed in patients negative for this signature. In addition to the CTCFL signature, we found several other reproducible expression signatures which may also represent biomarker candidates not related to established molecular subtypes of ovarian cancer and require further validation studies based on additional RNA-seq data.

Abstract:
By use of complex network dynamics and graph-based machine learning, we identified critical determinants of lineage-specific plasticity across the single-cell transcriptomics of pediatric high-grade glioma (pHGGs) subtypes: IDHWT glioblastoma and K27M-mutant glioma. Our study identified network interactions regulating glioma morphogenesis via the tumor-immune microenvironment, including neurodevelopmental programs, calcium dynamics, iron metabolism, metabolic reprogramming, and feedback loops between MAPK/ERK and WNT signaling. These relationships highlight the emergence of a hybrid spectrum of cellular states navigating a disrupted neuro-differentiation hierarchy. We identified transition genes such as DKK3, NOTCH2, GATAD1, GFAP, and SEZ6L in IDHWT glioblastoma, and H3F3A, ANXA6, HES6/7, SIRT2, FXYD6, PTPRZ1, MEIS1, CXXC5, and NDUFAB1 in K27M subtypes. We also identified MTRNR2L1, GAPDH, IGF2, FKBP variants, and FXYD7 as transition genes that influence cell fate decision-making across both subsystems. Our findings suggest pHGGs are developmentally trapped in states exhibiting maladaptive behaviors, and hybrid cellular identities. In effect, tumor heterogeneity (metastability) and plasticity emerge as stress-response patterns to immune-inflammatory microenvironments and oxidative stress. Furthermore, we show that pHGGs are steered by developmental trajectories from radial glia predominantly favoring neocortical cell fates, in telencephalon and prefrontal cortex (PFC) differentiation. By addressing underlying patterning processes and plasticity networks as therapeutic vulnerabilities, our findings provide precision medicine strategies aimed at modulating glioma cell fates and overcoming therapeutic resistance. We suggest transition therapy toward neuronal-like lineage differentiation as a potential therapy to help stabilize pHGG plasticity and aggressivity.

Abstract:
Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) are complex and lack effective treatment due to their poorly understood mechanism. The increasingly used data analysis from Single nucleus RNA Sequencing (snRNA-seq) allows to explore transcriptomic events at a single cell level, yet face challenges in interpreting the mechanisms underlying a disease. On the other hand, Neural Network (NN) models can handle complex data to offer insights but can be seen as black boxes with poor interpretability. In this context, explainable AI (XAI) emerges as a solution that could help to understand disease-associated mechanisms when combined with efficient NN models. However, limited research explores XAI in single-cell data. In this work, we implement a method for identifying disease-related genes and the mechanistic explanation of disease progression based on NN model combined with SHAP. We analyze available Huntington's disease (HD) data to identify both HD-altered genes and mechanisms by adding Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) comparing two methods, differential gene expression analysis (DGE) and NN combined with SHAP approach. Our results show that DGE and SHAP approaches offer both common and differential sets of altered genes and pathways, reinforcing the usefulness of XAI methods for a broader perspective of disease.

Abstract:
Accurately predicting chronological age from DNA methylation patterns is crucial for advancing biological age estimation. However, this task is made challenging by Epigenetic Correlation Drift (ECD) and Heterogeneity Among CpGs (HAC), which reflect the dynamic relationship between methylation and age across different life stages. To address these issues, we propose a novel two-phase algorithm. The first phase employs similarity searching to cluster methylation profiles by age group, while the second phase uses Explainable Boosting Machines (EBM) for precise, group-specific prediction. Our method not only improves prediction accuracy but also reveals key age-related CpG sites, detects age-specific changes in aging rates, and identifies pairwise interactions between CpG sites. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms traditional epigenetic clocks and machine learning models, offering a more accurate and interpretable solution for biological age estimation with significant implications for aging research.

Abstract:
Alpha satellite DNA is large tandem arrays of 150-400 bp units, and its origin remains an evolutionary mystery. In this research, we identified 1,545 alpha-satellite-like (SatL) repeat units in the nuclear genome of jewel wasp Nasonia vitripennis. Among them, thirty-nine copies of SatL were organized in two palindromic arrays in mitochondria, resulting in a 50% increase in the genome size. Strikingly, genomic neighborhood analyses of 1,516 nuclear SatL repeats revealed that they are located in NuMT (nuclear mitochondrial DNA) regions, and SatL phylogeny matched perfectly with mitochondrial genes and NuMT pseudogenes. These results support that SatL arrays originated from ten independent mitochondria insertion events into the nuclear genome within the last 500,000 years, after divergence from its sister species N. giraulti. Dramatic repeat GC-percent elevation (from 33.9% to 50.4%) is a hallmark of rapid SatL sequence evolution in mitochondria due to GC-biased gene conversion facilitated by the palindromic sequence pairing of the two mitochondrial SatL arrays. The nuclear SatL repeat arrays underwent substantial copy number expansion, from 12-15 (SatL1) to over 400 copies (SatL4). The oldest SatL4B array consists of four types of repeat units derived from deletions in the AT-rich region of ancestral repeats, and complex high-order structures have evolved through duplications. We also discovered similar repeat insertions into the nuclear genome of Muscidifurax, suggesting this mechanism can be common in insects. This is the first report of the mitochondrial origin of nuclear satellite sequences, and our findings shed new light on the origin and evolution of satellite DNA.

Abstract:
We pretrain METAGENE-1, a 7-billion-parameter autoregressive transformer model, which we refer to as a metagenomic foundation model, on a novel corpus of diverse metagenomic DNA and RNA sequences comprising over 1.5 trillion base pairs. This dataset is sourced from a large collection of human wastewater samples, processed and sequenced using deep metagenomic (next-generation) sequencing methods. Unlike genomic models that focus on individual genomes or curated sets of specific species, the aim of METAGENE-1 is to capture the full distribution of genomic information present within this wastewater, to aid in tasks relevant to pandemic monitoring and pathogen detection. We carry out byte-pair encoding (BPE) tokenization on our dataset, tailored for metagenomic sequences, and then pretrain our model. In this paper, we first detail the pretraining dataset, tokenization strategy, and model architecture, highlighting the considerations and design choices that enable the effective modeling of metagenomic data. We then show results of pretraining this model on our metagenomic dataset, providing details about our losses, system metrics, and training stability over the course of pretraining. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of METAGENE-1, which achieves state-of-the-art results on a set of genomic benchmarks and new evaluations focused on human-pathogen detection and genomic sequence embedding, showcasing its potential for public health applications in pandemic monitoring, biosurveillance, and early detection of emerging health threats.

Abstract:
Chromatin immunoprecipitation with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) provides insights into both the genomic location occupied by the protein of interest and the difference in DNA occupancy between experimental states. Given that ChIP-seq data is collected experimentally, an important step for determining regions with differential DNA occupancy between states is between-sample normalization. While between-sample normalization is crucial for downstream differential binding analysis, the technical conditions underlying between-sample normalization methods have yet to be examined for ChIP-seq. We identify three important technical conditions underlying ChIP-seq between-sample normalization methods: balanced differential DNA occupancy, equal total DNA occupancy, and equal background binding across states. To illustrate satisfying the selected normalization method's technical conditions for downstream differential binding analysis, we simulate ChIP-seq read count data where different combinations of the technical conditions are violated. We then externally verify our simulation results using experimental data. Based on our findings, we suggest that researchers use their understanding of the ChIP-seq experiment at hand to guide their choice of between-sample normalization method. Alternatively, researchers can use a high-confidence peakset, which is the intersection of the differentially bound peaksets obtained from using different between-sample normalization methods. In our two experimental analyses, roughly half of the called peaks were called as differentially bound for every normalization method. High-confidence peaks are less sensitive to choice of between-sample normalization method and could be a more robust basis for identifying genomic regions with differential DNA occupancy between experimental states when there is uncertainty about which technical conditions are satisfied.

Abstract:
Gene panel selection aims to identify the most informative genomic biomarkers in label-free genomic datasets. Traditional approaches, which rely on domain expertise, embedded machine learning models, or heuristic-based iterative optimization, often introduce biases and inefficiencies, potentially obscuring critical biological signals. To address these challenges, we present an iterative gene panel selection strategy that harnesses ensemble knowledge from existing gene selection algorithms to establish preliminary boundaries or prior knowledge, which guide the initial search space. Subsequently, we incorporate reinforcement learning through a reward function shaped by expert behavior, enabling dynamic refinement and targeted selection of gene panels. This integration mitigates biases stemming from initial boundaries while capitalizing on RL's stochastic adaptability. Comprehensive comparative experiments, case studies, and downstream analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, highlighting its improved precision and efficiency for label-free biomarker discovery. Our results underscore the potential of this approach to advance single-cell genomics data analysis.

Abstract:
Host-response-based diagnostics can improve the accuracy of diagnosing bacterial and viral infections, thereby reducing inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions. However, the existing cohorts with limited sample size and coarse infections types are unable to support the exploration of an accurate and generalizable diagnostic model. Here, we curate the largest infection host-response transcriptome data, including 11,247 samples across 89 blood transcriptome datasets from 13 countries and 21 platforms. We build a diagnostic model for pathogen prediction starting from a pan-infection model as foundation (AUC = 0.97) based on the pan-infection dataset. Then, we utilize knowledge distillation to efficiently transfer the insights from this "teacher" model to four lightweight pathogen "student" models, i.e., staphylococcal infection (AUC = 0.99), streptococcal infection (AUC = 0.94), HIV infection (AUC = 0.93), and RSV infection (AUC = 0.94), as well as a sepsis "student" model (AUC = 0.99). The proposed knowledge distillation framework not only facilitates the diagnosis of pathogens using pan-infection data, but also enables an across-disease study from pan-infection to sepsis. Moreover, the framework enables high-degree lightweight design of diagnostic models, which is expected to be adaptively deployed in clinical settings.

Abstract:
Despite decades of effort, understanding the shape of genome space in biology remains a challenge due to the similarity, variability, diversity, and plasticity of evolutionary relationships among species, genes, or other biological entities. We present a k-mer topology method, the first of its kind, to delineate the shape of the genome space. K-mer topology examines the topological persistence and the evolution of the homotopic shape of the sequences of k nucleotides in species, organisms, and genes using persistent Laplacians, a new multiscale combinatorial approach. We also propose a topological genetic distance between species by their topological invariants and non-harmonic spectra over scales. This new metric defines the topological phylogenetic trees of genomes, facilitating species classification and clustering. K-mer topology substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods on a variety of benchmark datasets, including mammalian mitochondrial genomes, Rhinovirus, SARS-CoV-2 variants, Ebola virus, Hepatitis E virus, Influenza hemagglutinin genes, and whole bacterial genomes. K-mer topology reveals the intrinsic shapes of the genome space and can be directly applied to the rational design of viral vaccines.

Abstract:
Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable advancements, primarily due to their capabilities in modeling the hidden relationships within text sequences. This innovation presents a unique opportunity in the field of life sciences, where vast collections of single-cell omics data from multiple species provide a foundation for training foundational models. However, the challenge lies in the disparity of data scales across different species, hindering the development of a comprehensive model for interpreting genetic data across diverse organisms. In this study, we propose an innovative hybrid approach that integrates the general knowledge capabilities of LLMs with domain-specific representation models for single-cell omics data interpretation. We begin by focusing on genes as the fundamental unit of representation. Gene representations are initialized using functional descriptions, leveraging the strengths of mature language models such as LLaMA-2. By inputting single-cell gene-level expression data with prompts, we effectively model cellular representations based on the differential expression levels of genes across various species and cell types. In the experiments, we constructed developmental cells from humans and mice, specifically targeting cells that are challenging to annotate. We evaluated our methodology through basic tasks such as cell annotation and visualization analysis. The results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach compared to other methods using LLMs, highlighting significant improvements in accuracy and interoperability. Our hybrid approach enhances the representation of single-cell data and offers a robust framework for future research in cross-species genetic analysis.

Emerging topics in biomedical research are continuously expanding, providing a wealth of information about genes and their function. This rapid proliferation of knowledge presents unprecedented opportunities for scientific discovery and formidable challenges for researchers striving to keep abreast of the latest advancements. One significant challenge is navigating the vast corpus of literature to extract vital gene-related information, a time-consuming and cumbersome task. To enhance the efficiency of this process, it is crucial to address several key challenges: (1) the overwhelming volume of literature, (2) the complexity of gene functions, and (3) the automated integration and generation. In response, we propose GeneSUM, a two-stage automated gene summary extractor utilizing a large language model (LLM). Our approach retrieves and eliminates redundancy of target gene literature and then fine-tunes the LLM to refine and streamline the summarization process. We conducted extensive experiments to validate the efficacy of our proposed framework. The results demonstrate that LLM significantly enhances the integration of gene-specific information, allowing more efficient decision-making in ongoing research.

Abstract:
Kidney stones are a common and debilitating health issue, and genetic factors play a crucial role in determining susceptibility. While Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have identified numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) linked to kidney stone risk, translating these findings into effective clinical tools remains a challenge. In this study, we explore the potential of deep learning techniques, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to enhance Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) models for predicting kidney stone susceptibility. Using a curated dataset of kidney stone-associated SNPs from a recent GWAS, we apply CNNs to model non-linear genetic interactions and improve prediction accuracy. Our approach includes SNP selection, genotype filtering, and model training using a dataset of 560 individuals, divided into training and testing subsets. We compare our CNN-based model with traditional machine learning models, including logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machines, demonstrating that the CNN outperforms these models in terms of classification accuracy and ROC-AUC. The proposed model achieved a validation accuracy of 62%, with an ROC-AUC of 0.68, suggesting its potential for improving genetic-based risk prediction for kidney stones. This study contributes to the growing field of genomics-driven precision medicine and highlights the promise of deep learning in enhancing PRS models for complex diseases.

Abstract:
Deep learning is an advanced technology that relies on large-scale data and complex models for feature extraction and pattern recognition. It has been widely applied across various fields, including computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition. In recent years, deep learning has demonstrated significant potential in the realm of proteomics informatics, particularly in deciphering complex biological information. The introduction of this technology not only accelerates the processing speed of protein data but also enhances the accuracy of predictions regarding protein structure and function. This provides robust support for both fundamental biology research and applied biotechnological studies. Currently, deep learning is primarily focused on applications such as protein sequence analysis, three-dimensional structure prediction, functional annotation, and the construction of protein interaction networks. These applications offer numerous advantages to proteomic research. Despite its growing prevalence in this field, deep learning faces several challenges including data scarcity, insufficient model interpretability, and computational complexity; these factors hinder its further advancement within proteomics. This paper comprehensively reviews the applications of deep learning in proteomics along with the challenges it encounters. The aim is to provide a systematic theoretical discussion and practical basis for research in this domain to facilitate ongoing development and innovation of deep learning technologies within proteomics.

Abstract:
DNA data storage is rapidly emerging as a promising solution for long-term data archiving, largely due to its exceptional durability. However, the synthesis of DNA strands remains a significant bottleneck in terms of cost and speed. To address this, new methods have been developed that encode information by concatenating long data-carrying DNA sequences from pre-synthesized DNA subsequences - known as motifs - from a library.   Reading back data from DNA storage relies on basecalling - the process of translating raw nanopore sequencing signals into DNA base sequences using machine learning models. These sequences are then decoded back into binary data. However, current basecalling approaches are not optimized for decoding motif-carrying DNA: they first predict individual bases from the raw signal and only afterward attempt to identify higher-level motifs. This two-step, motif-agnostic process is both imprecise and inefficient.   In this paper we introduce Motif Caller, a machine learning model designed to directly detect entire motifs from raw nanopore signals, bypassing the need for intermediate basecalling. By targeting motifs directly, Motif Caller leverages richer signal features associated with each motif, resulting in significantly improved accuracy. This direct approach also enhances the efficiency of data retrieval in motif-based DNA storage systems.

Abstract:
Foundation models have made significant strides in understanding the genomic language of DNA sequences. However, previous models typically adopt the tokenization methods designed for natural language, which are unsuitable for DNA sequences due to their unique characteristics. In addition, the optimal approach to tokenize DNA remains largely under-explored, and may not be intuitively understood by humans even if discovered. To address these challenges, we introduce MxDNA, a novel framework where the model autonomously learns an effective DNA tokenization strategy through gradient decent. MxDNA employs a sparse Mixture of Convolution Experts coupled with a deformable convolution to model the tokenization process, with the discontinuous, overlapping, and ambiguous nature of meaningful genomic segments explicitly considered. On Nucleotide Transformer Benchmarks and Genomic Benchmarks, MxDNA demonstrates superior performance to existing methods with less pretraining data and time, highlighting its effectiveness. Finally, we show that MxDNA learns unique tokenization strategy distinct to those of previous methods and captures genomic functionalities at a token level during self-supervised pretraining. Our MxDNA aims to provide a new perspective on DNA tokenization, potentially offering broad applications in various domains and yielding profound insights.

Abstract:
Over the past few years, technological advances have allowed for measurement of omics data at the cell level, creating a new type of data generally referred to as single-cell (sc) omics. On the other hand, the so-called spatial omics are a family of techniques that generate biological information in a spatial domain, for instance, in the volume of a tissue. In this survey, we are mostly interested in the intersection between sc and spatial (scs) omics and in the challenges and opportunities that this new type of data pose for downstream data analysis methodologies. Our goal is to cover all major omics modalities, including transcriptomics, genomics, epigenomics, proteomics and metabolomics.

Abstract:
With the rapid development of high-throughput sequencing platforms, an increasing number of omics technologies, such as genomics, metabolomics, and transcriptomics, are being applied to disease genetics research. However, biological data often exhibit high dimensionality and significant noise, making it challenging to effectively distinguish disease subtypes using a single-omics approach. To address these challenges and better capture the interactions among DNA, RNA, and proteins described by the central dogma, numerous studies have leveraged artificial intelligence to develop multi-omics models for disease research. These AI-driven models have improved the accuracy of disease prediction and facilitated the identification of genetic loci associated with diseases, thus advancing precision medicine. This paper reviews the mathematical definitions of multi-omics, strategies for integrating multi-omics data, applications of artificial intelligence and deep learning in multi-omics, the establishment of foundational models, and breakthroughs in multi-omics technologies, drawing insights from over 130 related articles. It aims to provide practical guidance for computational biologists to better understand and effectively utilize AI-based multi-omics machine learning algorithms in the context of central dogma.

Abstract:
Liver cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with its high genetic heterogeneity complicating diagnosis and treatment. This study introduces DLSOM, a deep learning framework utilizing stacked autoencoders to analyze the complete somatic mutation landscape of 1,139 liver cancer samples, covering 20,356 protein-coding genes. By transforming high-dimensional mutation data into three low-dimensional features, DLSOM enables robust clustering and identifies five distinct liver cancer subtypes with unique mutational, functional, and biological profiles. Subtypes SC1 and SC2 exhibit higher mutational loads, while SC3 has the lowest, reflecting mutational heterogeneity. Novel and COSMIC-associated mutational signatures reveal subtype-specific molecular mechanisms, including links to hypermutation and chemotherapy resistance. Functional analyses further highlight the biological relevance of each subtype. This comprehensive framework advances precision medicine in liver cancer by enabling the development of subtype-specific diagnostics, biomarkers, and therapies, showcasing the potential of deep learning in addressing cancer complexity.

Abstract:
DNA barcodes are crucial in biodiversity analysis for building automatic identification systems that recognize known species and discover unseen species. Unlike human genome modeling, barcode-based invertebrate identification poses challenges in the vast diversity of species and taxonomic complexity. Among Transformer-based foundation models, BarcodeBERT excelled in species-level identification of invertebrates, highlighting the effectiveness of self-supervised pretraining on barcode-specific datasets. Recently, structured state space models (SSMs) have emerged, with a time complexity that scales sub-quadratically with the context length. SSMs provide an efficient parameterization of sequence modeling relative to attention-based architectures. Given the success of Mamba and Mamba-2 in natural language, we designed BarcodeMamba, a performant and efficient foundation model for DNA barcodes in biodiversity analysis. We conducted a comprehensive ablation study on the impacts of self-supervised training and tokenization methods, and compared both versions of Mamba layers in terms of expressiveness and their capacity to identify "unseen" species held back from training. Our study shows that BarcodeMamba has better performance than BarcodeBERT even when using only 8.3% as many parameters, and improves accuracy to 99.2% on species-level accuracy in linear probing without fine-tuning for "seen" species. In our scaling study, BarcodeMamba with 63.6% of BarcodeBERT's parameters achieved 70.2% genus-level accuracy in 1-nearest neighbor (1-NN) probing for unseen species.

Abstract:
Spatial summary statistics based on point process theory are widely used to quantify the spatial organization of cell populations in single-cell spatial proteomics data. Among these, Ripley's $K$ is a popular metric for assessing whether cells are spatially clustered or are randomly dispersed. However, the key assumption of spatial homogeneity is frequently violated in spatial proteomics data, leading to overestimates of cell clustering and colocalization. To address this, we propose a novel $K$-based method, termed \textit{KAMP} (\textbf{K} adjustment by \textbf{A}nalytical \textbf{M}oments of the \textbf{P}ermutation distribution), for quantifying the spatial organization of cells in spatial proteomics samples. \textit{KAMP} leverages background cells in each sample along with a new closed-form representation of the first and second moments of the permutation distribution of Ripley's $K$ to estimate an empirical null model. Our method is robust to inhomogeneity, computationally efficient even in large datasets, and provides approximate $p$-values for testing spatial clustering and colocalization. Methodological developments are motivated by a spatial proteomics study of 103 women with ovarian cancer, where our analysis using \textit{KAMP} shows a positive association between immune cell clustering and overall patient survival. Notably, we also find evidence that using $K$ without correcting for sample inhomogeneity may bias hazard ratio estimates in downstream analyses. \textit{KAMP} completes this analysis in just 5 minutes, compared to 538 minutes for the only competing method that adequately addresses inhomogeneity.

Abstract:
Multilingual transfer ability, which reflects how well models fine-tuned on one source language can be applied to other languages, has been well studied in multilingual pre-trained models. However, the existence of such capability transfer between natural language and gene sequences/languages remains under explored.This study addresses this gap by drawing inspiration from the sentence-pair classification task used for evaluating sentence similarity in natural language. We constructed two analogous tasks: DNA-pair classification(DNA sequence similarity) and DNA-protein-pair classification(gene coding determination). These tasks were designed to validate the transferability of capabilities from natural language to gene sequences. Even a small-scale pre-trained model like GPT-2-small, which was pre-trained on English, achieved an accuracy of 78% on the DNA-pair classification task after being fine-tuned on English sentence-pair classification data(XTREME PAWS-X). While training a BERT model on multilingual text, the precision reached 89%. On the more complex DNA-protein-pair classification task, however, the model's output was barely distinguishable from random output.Experimental validation has confirmed that the transfer of capabilities from natural language to biological language is unequivocally present. Building on this foundation, we have also investigated the impact of model parameter scale and pre-training on this capability transfer. We provide recommendations for facilitating the transfer of capabilities from natural language to genetic language,as well as new approaches for conducting biological research based on this capability.This study offers an intriguing new perspective on exploring the relationship between natural language and genetic language.

Abstract:
Classifying genome sequences based on metadata has been an active area of research in comparative genomics for decades with many important applications across the life sciences. Established methods for classifying genomes can be broadly grouped into sequence alignment-based and alignment-free models. Conventional alignment-based models rely on genome similarity measures calculated based on local sequence alignments or consistent ordering among sequences. However, such methods are computationally expensive when dealing with large ensembles of even moderately sized genomes. In contrast, alignment-free (AF) approaches measure genome similarity based on summary statistics in an unsupervised setting and are efficient enough to analyze large datasets. However, both alignment-based and AF methods typically assume fixed scoring rubrics that lack the flexibility to assign varying importance to different parts of the sequences based on prior knowledge. In this study, we integrate AI and network science approaches to develop a comparative genomic analysis framework that addresses these limitations. Our approach, termed the Genome Misclassification Network Analysis (GMNA), simultaneously leverages misclassified instances, a learned scoring rubric, and label information to classify genomes based on associated metadata and better understand potential drivers of misclassification. We evaluate the utility of the GMNA using Naive Bayes and convolutional neural network models, supplemented by additional experiments with transformer-based models, to construct SARS-CoV-2 sampling location classifiers using over 500,000 viral genome sequences and study the resulting network of misclassifications. We demonstrate the global health potential of the GMNA by leveraging the SARS-CoV-2 genome misclassification networks to investigate the role human mobility played in structuring geographic clustering of SARS-CoV-2.

Abstract:
High quality ancient DNA (aDNA) is essential for molecular paleontology. Due to DNA degradation and contamination by environmental DNA (eDNA), current research is limited to fossils less than 1 million years old. The study successfully extracted DNA from Lycoptera davidi fossils from the Early Cretaceous period, dating 120 million years ago. Using high-throughput sequencing, 1,258,901 DNA sequences were obtained. We established a rigorous protocol known as the mega screen method. Using this method, we identified 243 original in situ DNA (oriDNA) sequences, likely from the Lycoptera genome. These sequences have an average length of over 100 base pairs and show no signs of deamination. Additionally, 10 transposase coding sequences were discovered, shedding light on a unique self-renewal mechanism in the genome. This study provides valuable DNA data for understanding ancient fish evolution and advances paleontological research.

Abstract:
This article critically examines the methodologies applied in ancient DNA (aDNA) research, particularly those developed by Dr. Pääbo's team, which have significantly influenced the field. The focus is on the challenges of distinguishing original in situ DNA (oriDNA) from environmental DNA (eDNA) contamination in fossil samples. Recent analyses indicate that even with rigorous extraction and sequencing protocols, a considerable amount of eDNA remains present, often misinterpreted as oriDNA. This misidentification risks the accuracy of species ascription and evolutionary interpretations derived from fossil analyses. The paper explores fossil preservation's physical and chemical dynamics, which allow eDNA from similar and disparate species to infiltrate bone matrices. We propose enhancements to methodological frameworks, such as broader BLAST database usage and stringent E-value criteria, to improve species-specific aDNA identification. Additionally, the article critiques the reliance on deamination patterns as a definitive marker for aDNA, suggesting a reevaluation of this criterion due to its inconsistency and the potential for misleading sequencing results. Ultimately, our findings advocate for a more cautious and refined approach to aDNA research, ensuring more reliable and verifiable scientific outcomes

Abstract:
Recent developments in next generation sequencing technology have led to the creation of extensive, open-source protein databases consisting of hundreds of millions of sequences. To render these sequences applicable in biomedical applications, they must be meticulously annotated by wet lab testing or extracting them from existing literature. Over the last few years, researchers have developed numerous automatic annotation systems, particularly deep learning models based on machine learning and artificial intelligence, to address this issue. In this work, we propose a transformer-based fusion model capable of predicting Gene Ontology (GO) terms from full-scale protein sequences, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy compared to other contemporary machine learning annotation systems. The approach performs particularly well on clustered split datasets, which comprise training and testing samples originating from distinct distributions that are structurally diverse. This demonstrates that the model is able to understand both short and long term dependencies within the enzyme's structure and can precisely identify the motifs associated with the various GO terms. Furthermore, the technique is lightweight and less computationally expensive compared to the benchmark methods, while at the same time not unaffected by sequence length, rendering it appropriate for diverse applications with varying sequence lengths.

Abstract:
Recent advances in self-supervised models for natural language, vision, and protein sequences have inspired the development of large genomic DNA language models (DNALMs). These models aim to learn generalizable representations of diverse DNA elements, potentially enabling various genomic prediction, interpretation and design tasks. Despite their potential, existing benchmarks do not adequately assess the capabilities of DNALMs on key downstream applications involving an important class of non-coding DNA elements critical for regulating gene activity. In this study, we introduce DART-Eval, a suite of representative benchmarks specifically focused on regulatory DNA to evaluate model performance across zero-shot, probed, and fine-tuned scenarios against contemporary ab initio models as baselines. Our benchmarks target biologically meaningful downstream tasks such as functional sequence feature discovery, predicting cell-type specific regulatory activity, and counterfactual prediction of the impacts of genetic variants. We find that current DNALMs exhibit inconsistent performance and do not offer compelling gains over alternative baseline models for most tasks, while requiring significantly more computational resources. We discuss potentially promising modeling, data curation, and evaluation strategies for the next generation of DNALMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/kundajelab/DART-Eval.

Abstract:
Pangenome variation graphs (PVGs) allow for the representation of genetic diversity in a more nuanced way than traditional reference-based approaches. Here we focus on how PVGs are a powerful tool for studying genetic variation in viruses, offering insights into the complexities of viral quasispecies, mutation rates, and population dynamics. PVGs originated in human genomics and hold great promise for viral genomics. Previous work has been constrained by small sample sizes and gene-centric methods, PVGs enable a more comprehensive approach to studying viral diversity. Large viral genome collections should be used to make PVGs, which offer significant advantages: we outline accessible tools to achieve this. This spans PVG construction, PVG file formats, PVG manipulation and analysis, PVG visualisation, measuring PVG openness, and mapping reads to PVGs. Additionally, the development of PVG-specific formats for mutation representation and personalised PVGs that reflect specific research questions will further enhance PVG applications. Challenges remain, particularly in managing nested variants, optimising error detection, optimising k-mer/minimizer-based approaches for AT-rich genomes, incorporating long read sequencing data, and scalable visualisation approaches. Nevertheless, PVGs offer a new opportunities for viral population genomics, and a testing ground for tool development prior to application to larger eukaryotic genomes. These advances will enable more accurate and comprehensive detection of viral mutations, contributing to a deeper understanding of viral evolution and genotype-phenotype associations.

Abstract:
The development of single-cell and spatial transcriptomics has revolutionized our capacity to investigate cellular properties, functions, and interactions in both cellular and spatial contexts. However, the analysis of single-cell and spatial omics data remains challenging. First, single-cell sequencing data are high-dimensional and sparse, often contaminated by noise and uncertainty, obscuring the underlying biological signals. Second, these data often encompass multiple modalities, including gene expression, epigenetic modifications, and spatial locations. Integrating these diverse data modalities is crucial for enhancing prediction accuracy and biological interpretability. Third, while the scale of single-cell sequencing has expanded to millions of cells, high-quality annotated datasets are still limited. Fourth, the complex correlations of biological tissues make it difficult to accurately reconstruct cellular states and spatial contexts. Traditional feature engineering-based analysis methods struggle to deal with the various challenges presented by intricate biological networks. Deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool capable of handling high-dimensional complex data and automatically identifying meaningful patterns, offering significant promise in addressing these challenges. This review systematically analyzes these challenges and discusses related deep learning approaches. Moreover, we have curated 21 datasets from 9 benchmarks, encompassing 58 computational methods, and evaluated their performance on the respective modeling tasks. Finally, we highlight three areas for future development from a technical, dataset, and application perspective. This work will serve as a valuable resource for understanding how deep learning can be effectively utilized in single-cell and spatial transcriptomics analyses, while inspiring novel approaches to address emerging challenges.

Abstract:
Timestamp automatic annotation (TAA) is a crucial procedure for analyzing time-series ScRNA-seq data, as they unveil dynamic biological developments and cell regeneration process. However, current TAA methods heavily rely on manual timestamps, often overlooking their reliability. This oversight can significantly degrade the performance of timestamp automatic annotation due to noisy timestamps. Nevertheless, the current approach for addressing this issue tends to select less critical cleaned samples for timestamp calibration. To tackle this challenge, we have developed a novel timestamp calibration model called ScPace for handling noisy labeled time-series ScRNA-seq data. This approach incorporates a latent variable indicator within a base classifier instead of probability sampling to detect noisy samples effectively. To validate our proposed method, we conducted experiments on both simulated and real time-series ScRNA-seq datasets. Cross-validation experiments with different artificial mislabeling rates demonstrate that ScPace outperforms previous approaches. Furthermore, after calibrating the timestamps of the original time-series ScRNA-seq data using our method, we performed supervised pseudotime analysis, revealing that ScPace enhances its performance significantly. These findings suggest that ScPace is an effective tool for timestamp calibration by enabling reclassification and deletion of detected noisy labeled samples while maintaining robustness across diverse ranges of time-series ScRNA-seq datasets.

Abstract:
Motivation: The three-dimensional (3D) organization of the genome plays a critical role in regulating gene expression and maintaining cellular homeostasis. Disruptions in this spatial organization can result in abnormal chromatin interactions, contributing to the development of various diseases including cancer. Advances in chromosome conformation capture technologies, such as Hi-C, have enabled researchers to study genome architecture at high resolution. However, the efficient visualization and interpretation of these complex datasets remain a major challenge, particularly when integrating genomic annotations and inter-chromosomal interactions.   Results: We present gghic, an R package that extends the ggplot2 framework to enable intuitive and customizable visualization of genomic interaction data. gghic introduces novel layers for generating triangular heatmaps of chromatin interactions and annotating them with features such as chromatin loops, topologically associated domains (TADs), gene/transcript models, and data tracks (e.g., ChIP-seq signals). The package supports data from multiple chromosomes, facilitating the exploration of inter-chromosomal interactions. Built to integrate seamlessly with the R/Bioconductor ecosystem, gghic is compatible with widely used genomic data formats, including HiCExperiment and GInteractions objects. We demonstrate the utility of gghic by replicating a published figure showing a translocation event in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), highlighting its ability to integrate genomic annotations and generate publication-quality figures.   Availability and implementation: The R package can be accessed at https://github.com/jasonwong-lab/gghic and is distributed under the GNU General Public License version 3.0.

Abstract:
Over the past decade, the revolution in single-cell sequencing has enabled the simultaneous molecular profiling of various modalities across thousands of individual cells, allowing scientists to investigate the diverse functions of complex tissues and uncover underlying disease mechanisms. Among all the analytical steps, assigning individual cells to specific types is fundamental for understanding cellular heterogeneity. However, this process is usually labor-intensive and requires extensive expert knowledge. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their ability to efficiently process and synthesize vast corpora of text to automatically extract essential biological knowledge, such as marker genes, potentially promoting more efficient and automated cell type annotations. To thoroughly evaluate the capability of modern instruction-tuned LLMs in automating the cell type identification process, we introduce SOAR, a comprehensive benchmarking study of LLMs for cell type annotation tasks in single-cell genomics. Specifically, we assess the performance of 8 instruction-tuned LLMs across 11 datasets, spanning multiple cell types and species. Our study explores the potential of LLMs to accurately classify and annotate cell types in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, while extending their application to multiomics data through cross-modality translation. Additionally, we evaluate the effectiveness of chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting techniques in generating detailed biological insights during the annotation process. The results demonstrate that LLMs can provide robust interpretations of single-cell data without requiring additional fine-tuning, advancing the automation of cell type annotation in genomics research.

Abstract:
$\textbf{Motivation:}$ Hierarchical data structures are prevalent across several fields of research, as they represent an organised and efficient approach to study complex interconnected systems. Their significance is particularly evident in microbiome analysis, where microbial communities are classified at various taxonomic levels along the phylogenetic tree. In light of this trend, the R/Bioconductor community has established a reproducible analytical framework for hierarchical data, which relies on the highly generic and optimised TreeSummarizedExperiment data container. However, using this framework requires basic proficiency in programming.   $\textbf{Results:}$ To reduce the entry requirements, we developed iSEEtree, an R shiny app which provides a visual interface for the analysis and exploration of TreeSummarizedExperiment objects, thereby expanding the interactive graphics capabilities of related work to hierarchical structures. This way, users can interactively explore several aspects of their data without the need for extensive knowledge of R programming. We describe how iSEEtree enables the exploration of hierarchical multi-table data and demonstrate its functionality with applications to microbiome analysis.   $\textbf{Availability and Implementation:}$ iSEEtree was implemented in the R programming language and is available on Bioconductor at https://bioconductor.org/packages/iSEEtree under an Artistic 2.0 license.   $\textbf{Contact:}$ giulio.benedetti@utu.fi or leo.lahti@utu.fi.

Abstract:
The rise of complex multicellular ecosystems Neoproterozoic time was preceded by a microbial Proterozoic biosphere, where productivity may have been largely restricted to microbial mats made up of bacteria including oxygenic photosynthetic Cyanobacteria, anoxygenic phototrophs, and heterotrophs. In modern environments, analogous microbial mats can be found in restricted environments such as carbonate tidal flats and terrestrial hot springs. Here, we report metagenomic sequence data from an analog in the hot springs of Waikite Valley, Aotearoa New Zealand, where carbon-rich, slightly-alkaline geothermal waters support diverse phototrophic microbial mats.   The Waikite Valley hot spring in the Taupo Volcanic Zone of Aotearoa New Zealand was sampled in duplicate at 8 points along a temperature gradient transect of the outflow, from ~62 C (near the source) to ~37 C (~100 meters downstream). ~686 Gb of shotgun metagenomic sequence data was generated by Illumina Novaseq. Each sample was assembled using SPAdes, followed by binning of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) by MetaBAT. These data are useful for the genomic analysis of novel phototrophic bacteria, as well as for ecological comparisons between thermophilic communities with varying temperatures but otherwise similar conditions.

Abstract:
Spatial omics assays allow for the molecular characterisation of cells in their spatial context. Notably, the two main technological streams, imaging-based and high-throughput sequencing-based, can give rise to very different data modalities. The characteristics of the two data types are well known in adjacent fields such as spatial statistics as point patterns and lattice data, and there is a wide range of tools available. This paper discusses the application of spatial statistics to spatially-resolved omics data and in particular, discusses various advantages, challenges, and nuances. This work is accompanied by a vignette, pasta, that showcases the usefulness of spatial statistics in biology using several R packages.

Abstract:
Chromosomal inversions are structural mutations resulting in the reversal of the gene order along the corresponding genomic region. Due to their influence on recombination patterns, they can have a major influence on genetic variation and the evolutionary process. Accordingly, inversions can act as supergenes that keep together co-adapted gene complexes that form the genetic basis of many complex phenotypes in diverse organisms. In this book chapter, I will present an analysis pipeline to investigate the influence of two common cosmopolitan inversion, In(2L)t and In(3R)Payne, on genome-wide genetic variation and differentiation in world-wide populations of the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster. We will use single-individual and pooled resequencing data in combination with population genomics analysis tools to explore the impact of these two inversions on genetic variation, population structure, and clinal variation in natural populations.

Abstract:
Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) is a method that captures gene expression profiles aligned with spatial coordinates. The discrete spatial distribution and the super-high dimensional sequencing results make ST data challenging to be modeled effectively. In this paper, we manage to model ST in a continuous and compact manner by the proposed tool, SUICA, empowered by the great approximation capability of Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) that can enhance both the spatial density and the gene expression. Concretely within the proposed SUICA, we incorporate a graph-augmented Autoencoder to effectively model the context information of the unstructured spots and provide informative embeddings that are structure-aware for spatial mapping. We also tackle the extremely skewed distribution in a regression-by-classification fashion and enforce classification-based loss functions for the optimization of SUICA. By extensive experiments of a wide range of common ST platforms under varying degradations, SUICA outperforms both conventional INR variants and SOTA methods regarding numerical fidelity, statistical correlation, and bio-conservation. The prediction by SUICA also showcases amplified gene signatures that enriches the bio-conservation of the raw data and benefits subsequent analysis.

Abstract:
Recent advancements in multimodal pre-training models have significantly advanced computational pathology. However, current approaches predominantly rely on visual-language models, which may impose limitations from a molecular perspective and lead to performance bottlenecks. Here, we introduce a Unified Molecule-enhanced Pathology Image REpresentationn Learning framework (UMPIRE). UMPIRE aims to leverage complementary information from gene expression profiles to guide the multimodal pre-training, enhancing the molecular awareness of pathology image representation learning. We demonstrate that this molecular perspective provides a robust, task-agnostic training signal for learning pathology image embeddings. Due to the scarcity of paired data, approximately 4 million entries of spatial transcriptomics gene expression were collected to train the gene encoder. By leveraging powerful pre-trained encoders, UMPIRE aligns the encoders across over 697K pathology image-gene expression pairs. The performance of UMPIRE is demonstrated across various molecular-related downstream tasks, including gene expression prediction, spot classification, and mutation state prediction in whole slide images. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of multimodal data integration and open new avenues for exploring computational pathology enhanced by molecular perspectives. The code and pre-trained weights are available at https://github.com/Hanminghao/UMPIRE.

Abstract:
Building a general-purpose task model similar to ChatGPT has been an important research direction for gene large language models. Instruction fine-tuning is a key component in building ChatGPT, but existing instructions are primarily based on natural language. Natural language and gene sequences have significant differences in tokenization and encoding. Therefore, constructing a multilingual model that can handle both natural language and gene sequences is crucial for solving this problem.In this paper, we expand the capabilities of the LLaMA large language model to include gene language. This involves expanding the vocabulary using the Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) method, specifically tailored for DNA and protein sequences, and conducting further pre-training on these sequences. We then convert various downstream gene task data into a unified format for instruction fine-tuning and further fine-tune the model on this data.Our study demonstrates that a mixed model of gene and natural language, fine-tuned with instructions, achieves results comparable to the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) in tasks such as gene classification and gene sequence interaction. This provides a promising direction for building a unified large language model for gene tasks.

Abstract:
Genomic variants, including copy number variants (CNVs) and genome-wide associa-tion study (GWAS) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), represent structural alterations that influence genomic diversity and disease susceptibility. While coding region variants have been extensively studied, non-coding and regulatory variants present significant challenges due to their potential impacts on gene regulation, which are often obscured by the complexity of the ge-nome. Chromatin interactions, which organize the genome spatially and regulate gene expression through enhancer-promoter contacts, predominantly occur in non-coding regions. Notably, more than 90% of enhancers, crucial for gene regulation, reside in these non-coding regions, underscor-ing their importance in interpreting the regulatory effects of CNVs and GWAS-associated SNPs. In this study, we integrate chromatin interaction data with CNV and GWAS data to uncover the functional implications of non-coding variants. By leveraging this integrated approach, we pro-vide new insights into how structural variants and disease-associated SNPs disrupt regulatory networks, advancing our understanding of genetic complexity. These findings offer potential av-enues for personalized medicine by elucidating disease mechanisms and guiding therapeutic strategies tailored to individual genomic profiles. This research underscores the critical role of chromatin interactions in revealing the regulatory consequences of non-coding variants, bridging the gap between genetic variation and phenotypic outcomes.

Abstract:
Spatial transcriptomics (ST) provides high-resolution pathological images and whole-transcriptomic expression profiles at individual spots across whole-slide scales. This setting makes it an ideal data source to develop multimodal foundation models. Although recent studies attempted to fine-tune visual encoders with trainable gene encoders based on spot-level, the absence of a wider slide perspective and spatial intrinsic relationships limits their ability to capture ST-specific insights effectively. Here, we introduce ST-Align, the first foundation model designed for ST that deeply aligns image-gene pairs by incorporating spatial context, effectively bridging pathological imaging with genomic features. We design a novel pretraining framework with a three-target alignment strategy for ST-Align, enabling (1) multi-scale alignment across image-gene pairs, capturing both spot- and niche-level contexts for a comprehensive perspective, and (2) cross-level alignment of multimodal insights, connecting localized cellular characteristics and broader tissue architecture. Additionally, ST-Align employs specialized encoders tailored to distinct ST contexts, followed by an Attention-Based Fusion Network (ABFN) for enhanced multimodal fusion, effectively merging domain-shared knowledge with ST-specific insights from both pathological and genomic data. We pre-trained ST-Align on 1.3 million spot-niche pairs and evaluated its performance through two downstream tasks across six datasets, demonstrating superior zero-shot and few-shot capabilities. ST-Align highlights the potential for reducing the cost of ST and providing valuable insights into the distinction of critical compositions within human tissue.

Abstract:
Counting distinct permutations with replacement, especially when involving multiple subwords, is a longstanding challenge in combinatorial analysis, with critical applications in cryptography, bioinformatics, and statistical modeling. This paper introduces a novel framework that presents closed-form formulas for calculating distinct permutations with replacement, fundamentally reducing the time complexity from exponential to linear relative to the sequence length for single-subword calculations. We then extend our foundational formula to handle multiple subwords through the development of an additional formula. Unlike traditional methods relying on brute-force enumeration or recursive algorithms, our approach leverages novel combinatorial constructs and advanced mathematical techniques to achieve unprecedented efficiency. This comprehensive advancement in reducing computational complexity not only simplifies permutation counting but also establishes a new benchmark for scalability and versatility. We also demonstrate the practical utility of our formulas through diverse applications, including the simultaneous identification of multiple genetic motifs in DNA sequences and complex pattern analysis in cryptographic systems, using a computer program that runs the proposed formulae.

Abstract:
A key challenge in differential abundance analysis of microbial samples is that the counts for each sample are compositional, resulting in biased comparisons of the absolute abundance across study groups. Normalization-based differential abundance analysis methods rely on external normalization factors that account for the compositionality by standardizing the counts onto a common numerical scale. However, existing normalization methods have struggled at maintaining the false discovery rate in settings where the variance or compositional bias is large. This article proposes a novel framework for normalization that can reduce bias in differential abundance analysis by re-conceptualizing normalization as a group-level task. We present two normalization methods within the group-wise framework: group-wise relative log expression (G-RLE) and fold-truncated sum scaling (FTSS). G-RLE and FTSS achieve higher statistical power for identifying differentially abundant taxa than existing methods in model-based and synthetic data simulation settings, while maintaining the false discovery rate in challenging scenarios where existing methods suffer. The best results are obtained from using FTSS normalization with the differential abundance analysis method MetagenomeSeq. Code for implementing the methods and replicating the analysis can be found at our GitHub page (https://github.com/dclarkboucher/microbiome_groupwise_normalization).

Abstract:
Zebrafish are an ideal system to study the effect(s) of chemical, genetic, and environmental perturbations on development due to their high fecundity and fast growth. Recently, single cell sequencing has emerged as a powerful tool to measure the effect of these perturbations at a whole embryo scale. These types of experiments rely on the ability to isolate nuclei from a large number of individually barcoded zebrafish embryos in parallel. Here we report a method for efficiently isolating high-quality nuclei from zebrafish embryos in a 96-well plate format by bead homogenization in a lysis buffer. Through head-to-head sciPlex-RNA-seq experiments, we demonstrate that this method represents a substantial improvement over enzymatic dissociation and that it is compatible with a wide range of developmental stages.

Abstract:
In cancer research, the term epigenetics was used in the 1970s in its modern sense encompassing non-genetic events modifying the chromatin state, mainly to oppose the emerging oncogene paradigm. However, starting from the establishment of this prominent concept, the importance of these epigenetic phenomena in cancer rarely led to questioning the causal role of genetic alterations. Only in the last 10 years, the accumulation of problematic data, better experimental technologies, and some ambitious models pushed the idea that epigenetics could be at least as important as genetics in early oncogenesis. Until this year, a direct demonstration of epigenetic oncogenesis was still lacking. Now Parreno, Cavalli and colleagues, using a refined experimental model in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, enforced the initiation of tumours solely by imposing a transient loss of Polycomb repression, leading to a purely epigenetic oncogenesis phenomenon. Despite a few caveats that we discuss, this pioneering work represents a major breakpoint in cancer research that leads us to consider the theoretical and conceptual implications on oncogenesis and to search for links between this artificial experimental model and naturally occurring processes, while revisiting cancer theories that were previously proposed as alternatives to the oncogene-centered paradigm.

Abstract:
DNA microarray gene-expression data has been widely used to identify cancerous gene signatures. Microarray can increase the accuracy of cancer diagnosis and prognosis. However, analyzing the large amount of gene expression data from microarray chips pose a challenge for current machine learning researches. One of the challenges lie within classification of healthy and cancerous tissues is high dimensionality of gene expressions. High dimensionality decreases the accuracy of the classification. This research aims to apply a hybrid model of Genetic Algorithm and Neural Network to overcome the problem during subset selection of informative genes. Whereby, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) reduced dimensionality during feature selection and then a Multi-Layer perceptron Neural Network (MLP) is applied to classify selected genes. The performance evaluated by considering to the accuracy and the number of selected genes. Experimental results show the proposed method suggested high accuracy and minimum number of selected genes in comparison with other machine learning algorithms.

Abstract:
Diabetes, particularly Type 2 diabetes (T2D), poses a substantial global health burden, compounded by its associated complications such as cardiovascular diseases, kidney failure, and vision impairment. Early detection of T2D is critical for improving healthcare outcomes and optimizing resource allocation. In this study, we address the gap in early T2D detection by leveraging machine learning (ML) techniques on gene expression data obtained from T2D patients. Our primary objective was to enhance the accuracy of early T2D detection through advanced ML methodologies and increase the model's trustworthiness using the explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) technique. Analyzing the biological mechanisms underlying T2D through gene expression datasets represents a novel research frontier, relatively less explored in previous studies. While numerous investigations have focused on utilizing clinical and demographic data for T2D prediction, the integration of molecular insights from gene expression datasets offers a unique and promising avenue for understanding the pathophysiology of the disease. By employing six ML classifiers on data sourced from NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), we observed promising performance across all models. Notably, the XGBoost classifier exhibited the highest accuracy, achieving 97%. Our study addresses a notable gap in early T2D detection methodologies, emphasizing the importance of leveraging gene expression data and advanced ML techniques.

Abstract:
The advancement of novel combinatorial CRISPR screening technologies enables the identification of synergistic gene combinations on a large scale. This is crucial for developing novel and effective combination therapies, but the combinatorial space makes exhaustive experimentation infeasible. We introduce NAIAD, an active learning framework that efficiently discovers optimal gene pairs capable of driving cells toward desired cellular phenotypes. NAIAD leverages single-gene perturbation effects and adaptive gene embeddings that scale with the training data size, mitigating overfitting in small-sample learning while capturing complex gene interactions as more data is collected. Evaluated on four CRISPR combinatorial perturbation datasets totaling over 350,000 genetic interactions, NAIAD, trained on small datasets, outperforms existing models by up to 40\% relative to the second-best. NAIAD's recommendation system prioritizes gene pairs with the maximum predicted effects, resulting in the highest marginal gain in each AI-experiment round and accelerating discovery with fewer CRISPR experimental iterations. Our NAIAD framework (https://github.com/NeptuneBio/NAIAD) improves the identification of novel, effective gene combinations, enabling more efficient CRISPR library design and offering promising applications in genomics research and therapeutic development.

Abstract:
The continually increasing volume of DNA sequence data has resulted in a growing demand for fast implementations of core algorithms. Computation of pairwise alignments between candidate haplotypes and sequencing reads using Pair-HMMs is a key component in DNA variant calling tools such as the GATK HaplotypeCaller but can be highly time consuming due to its quadratic time complexity and the large number of pairs to be aligned. Unfortunately, previous approaches to accelerate this task using the massively parallel processing capabilities of modern GPUs are limited by inefficient memory access schemes. This established the need for significantly faster solutions. We address this need by presenting gpuPairHMM -- a novel GPU-based parallelization scheme for the dynamic-programming based Pair-HMM forward algorithm based on wavefronts and warp-shuffles. It gains efficiency by minimizing both memory accesses and instructions. We show that our approach achieves close-to-peak performance on several generations of modern CUDA-enabled GPUs (Volta, Ampere, Ada, Hopper). It also outperforms prior implementations on GPUs, CPUs, and FPGAs by a factor of at least 8.6, 10.4, and 14.5, respectively. gpuPairHMM is publicly available at https://github.com/asbschmidt/gpuPairHMM.

Abstract:
The Genebass dataset, released by Karczewski et al. (2022), provides a comprehensive resource elucidating associations between genes and 4,529 phenotypes based on nearly 400,000 exomes from the UK Biobank. This extensive dataset enables the evaluation of gene set enrichment across a wide range of phenotypes, facilitating the inference of associations between specified gene sets and phenotypic traits. Despite its potential, no established method for applying gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to Genebass data exists. To address this gap, we propose utilizing fast pre-ranked gene set enrichment analysis (FGSEA) as a novel approach to determine whether a specified set of genes is significantly enriched in phenotypes within the UK Biobank. We developed an R package, ukbFGSEA, to implement this analysis, completed with a hands-on tutorial. Our approach has been validated by analyzing gene sets associated with autism spectrum disorder, developmental disorder, and neurodevelopmental disorders, demonstrating its capability to reveal established and novel associations.

Abstract:
Objective: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disease characterized by unpredictable flares. This study aimed to develop a novel proteomics-based risk prediction model specifically for Asian SLE populations to enhance personalized disease management and early intervention. Methods: A longitudinal cohort study was conducted over 48 weeks, including 139 SLE patients monitored every 12 weeks. Patients were classified into flare (n = 53) and non-flare (n = 86) groups. Baseline plasma samples underwent data-independent acquisition (DIA) proteomics analysis, and phenome-wide Mendelian randomization (PheWAS) was performed to evaluate causal relationships between proteins and clinical predictors. Logistic regression (LR) and random forest (RF) models were used to integrate proteomic and clinical data for flare risk prediction. Results: Five proteins (SAA1, B4GALT5, GIT2, NAA15, and RPIA) were significantly associated with SLE Disease Activity Index-2K (SLEDAI-2K) scores and 1-year flare risk, implicating key pathways such as B-cell receptor signaling and platelet degranulation. SAA1 demonstrated causal effects on flare-related clinical markers, including hemoglobin and red blood cell counts. A combined model integrating clinical and proteomic data achieved the highest predictive accuracy (AUC = 0.769), surpassing individual models. SAA1 was highlighted as a priority biomarker for rapid flare discrimination. Conclusion: The integration of proteomic and clinical data significantly improves flare prediction in Asian SLE patients. The identification of key proteins and their causal relationships with flare-related clinical markers provides valuable insights for proactive SLE management and personalized therapeutic approaches.

Abstract:
Reproducibility in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) is crucial for ensuring reliable genomic research outcomes. However, limited access to original genomic datasets (mainly due to privacy concerns) prevents researchers from reproducing experiments to validate results. In this paper, we propose a novel method for GWAS reproducibility validation that detects unintentional errors without the need for dataset sharing. Our approach leverages p-values from GWAS outcome reports to estimate contingency tables for each single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and calculates the Hamming distance between the minor allele frequencies (MAFs) derived from these contingency tables and publicly available phenotype-specific MAF data. By comparing the average Hamming distance, we validate results that fall within a trusted threshold as reliable, while flagging those that exceed the threshold for further inspection. This approach not only allows researchers to validate the correctness of GWAS findings of other researchers, but it also provides a self-check step for the researchers before they publish their findings. We evaluate our approach using three real-life SNP datasets from OpenSNP, showing its ability to detect unintentional errors effectively, even when small errors occur, such as 1\% of SNPs being reported incorrectly. This novel validation technique offers a promising solution to the GWAS reproducibility challenge, balancing the need for rigorous validation with the imperative of protecting sensitive genomic data, thereby enhancing trust and accuracy in genetic research.

Abstract:
Characterizing non-coding variant function remains an important challenge in human genetics. Genomic deep learning models have emerged as a promising approach to enable in silico prediction of variant effects. These include supervised sequence-to-activity models, which predict molecular phenotypes such as genome-wide chromatin states or gene expression levels directly from DNA sequence, and self-supervised genomic language models. Here, we review progress in leveraging these models for non-coding variant effect prediction. We describe practical considerations for making such predictions and categorize the types of ground truth data used to evaluate variant effect predictions, providing insight into the settings in which current models are most useful. Our Review highlights key considerations for practitioners and opportunities for improvement in model development and evaluation.

Abstract:
Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) serve as crucial regulators in numerous biological processes. Although they share sequence similarities with messenger RNAs (mRNAs), lncRNAs perform entirely different roles, providing new avenues for biological research. The emergence of next-generation sequencing technologies has greatly advanced the detection and identification of lncRNA transcripts and deep learning-based approaches have been introduced to classify long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). These advanced methods have significantly enhanced the efficiency of identifying lncRNAs. However, many of these methods are devoid of robustness and accuracy due to the extended length of the sequences involved. To tackle this issue, we have introduced a novel pre-trained bidirectional encoder representation called LoRA-BERT. LoRA-BERT is designed to capture the importance of nucleotide-level information during sequence classification, leading to more robust and satisfactory outcomes. In a comprehensive comparison with commonly used sequence prediction tools, we have demonstrated that LoRA-BERT outperforms them in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Our results indicate that, when utilizing the transformer model, LoRA-BERT achieves state-of-the-art performance in predicting both lncRNAs and mRNAs for human and mouse species. Through the utilization of LoRA-BERT, we acquire valuable insights into the traits of lncRNAs and mRNAs, offering the potential to aid in the comprehension and detection of diseases linked to lncRNAs in humans.

Abstract:
Genetic screens mediated via CRISPR-Cas9 combined with high-content readouts have emerged as powerful tools for biological discovery. However, computational analyses of these screens come with additional challenges beyond those found with standard scRNA-seq analyses. For example, perturbation-induced variations of interest may be subtle and masked by other dominant source of variation shared with controls, and variable guide efficiency results in some cells not undergoing genetic perturbation despite expressing a guide RNA. While a number of methods have been developed to address the former problem by explicitly disentangling perturbation-induced variations from those shared with controls, less attention has been paid to the latter problem of noisy perturbation labels. To address this issue, here we propose ContrastiveVI+, a generative modeling framework that both disentangles perturbation-induced from non-perturbation-related variations while also inferring whether cells truly underwent genomic edits. Applied to three large-scale Perturb-seq datasets, we find that ContrastiveVI+ better recovers known perturbation-induced variations compared to previous methods while successfully identifying cells that escaped the functional consequences of guide RNA expression. An open-source implementation of our model is available at \url{https://github.com/insitro/contrastive_vi_plus}.

Abstract:
AI language models (LMs) show promise for biological sequence analysis. We re-engineered open-source LMs (GPT-2, BLOOM, DistilRoBERTa, ELECTRA, and Mamba, ranging from 70M to 12B parameters) for microbial sequence classification. The models achieved F1 scores up to 95 and operated 16,580x faster and at 2.9x the recall of BLASTP. They effectively classified the algal dark proteome - uncharacterized proteins comprising about 65% of total proteins - validated on new data including a new, complete Hi-C/Pacbio Chlamydomonas genome. Larger (>1B) LA4SR models reached high accuracy (F1 > 86) when trained on less than 2% of available data, rapidly achieving strong generalization capacity. High accuracy was achieved when training data had intact or scrambled terminal information, demonstrating robust generalization to incomplete sequences. Finally, we provide custom AI explainability software tools for attributing amino acid patterns to AI generative processes and interpret their outputs in evolutionary and biophysical contexts.

Abstract:
As a powerful tool for characterizing cellular subpopulations and cellular heterogeneity, single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology offers advantages of high throughput and multidimensional analysis. However, the process of data acquisition is often constrained by high cost and limited sample availability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a hybrid model based on Diffusion model and White-Box transformer that aims to generate synthetic and biologically plausible scRNA-seq data. Diffusion model progressively introduce noise into the data and then recover the original data through a denoising process, a forward and reverse process that is particularly suitable for generating complex data distributions. White-Box transformer is a deep learning architecture that emphasizes mathematical interpretability. By minimizing the encoding rate of the data and maximizing the sparsity of the representation, it not only reduces the computational burden, but also provides clear insight into underlying structure. Our White-Box Diffusion Transformer combines the generative capabilities of Diffusion model with the mathematical interpretability of White-Box transformer. Through experiments using six different single-cell RNA-Seq datasets, we visualize both generated and real data using t-SNE dimensionality reduction technique, as well as quantify similarity between generated and real data using various metrics to demonstrate comparable performance of White-Box Diffusion Transformer and Diffusion Transformer in generating scRNA-seq data alongside significant improvements in training efficiency and resource utilization.

Abstract:
Single-cell RNA sequencing enables high-resolution analysis of cellular heterogeneity, yet disentangling biological signal from batch effects remains a major challenge. Existing batch-correction algorithms suppress or discard batch-related variation rather than modeling it. We propose scMEDAL, single-cell Mixed Effects Deep Autoencoder Learning, a framework that separately models batch-invariant and batch-specific effects using two complementary subnetworks. The principal innovation, scMEDAL-RE, is a random-effects Bayesian autoencoder that learns batch-specific representations while preserving biologically meaningful information confounded with batch effects signal often lost under standard correction. Complementing it, the fixed-effects subnetwork, scMEDAL-FE, trained via adversarial learning provides a default batch-correction component. Evaluations across diverse conditions (autism, leukemia, cardiovascular), cell types, and technical and biological effects show that scMEDAL-RE produces interpretable, batch-specific embeddings that complement both scMEDAL-FE and established correction methods (scVI, Scanorama, Harmony, SAUCIE), yielding more accurate prediction of disease status, donor group, and tissue. scMEDAL also provides generative visualizations, including counterfactual reconstructions of a cell's expression as if acquired in another batch. The framework allows substitution of the fixed-effects component with other correction methods, while retaining scMEDAL-RE's enhanced predictive power and visualization. Overall, scMEDAL is a versatile, interpretable framework that complements existing correction, providing enhanced insight into cellular heterogeneity and data acquisition.

Abstract:
A 3D chaos game is shown to be a useful way for encoding DNA sequences. Since matching subsequences in DNA converge in space in 3D chaos game encoding, a DNA sequence's 3D chaos game representation can be used to compare DNA sequences without prior alignment and without truncating or padding any of the sequences. Two proposed methods inspired by shape-similarity comparison techniques show that this form of encoding can perform as well as alignment-based techniques for building phylogenetic trees. The first method uses the volume overlap of intersecting spheres and the second uses shape signatures by summarizing the coordinates, oriented angles, and oriented distances of the 3D chaos game trajectory. The methods are tested using: (1) the first exon of the beta-globin gene for 11 species, (2) mitochondrial DNA from four groups of primates, and (3) a set of synthetic DNA sequences. Simulations show that the proposed methods produce distances that reflect the number of mutation events; additionally, on average, distances resulting from deletion mutations are comparable to those produced by substitution mutations.

Abstract:
The classification of genetic variants, particularly Variants of Uncertain Significance (VUS), poses a significant challenge in clinical genetics and precision medicine. Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as transformative tools in this realm. These models can uncover intricate patterns and predictive insights that traditional methods might miss, thus enhancing the predictive accuracy of genetic variant pathogenicity.   This study investigates the integration of state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPN-MSA, ESM1b, and AlphaMissense, which leverage DNA and protein sequence data alongside structural insights to form a comprehensive analytical framework for variant classification. Our approach evaluates these integrated models using the well-annotated ProteinGym and ClinVar datasets, setting new benchmarks in classification performance. The models were rigorously tested on a set of challenging variants, demonstrating substantial improvements over existing state-of-the-art tools, especially in handling ambiguous and clinically uncertain variants.   The results of this research underline the efficacy of combining multiple modeling approaches to significantly refine the accuracy and reliability of genetic variant classification systems. These findings support the deployment of these advanced computational models in clinical environments, where they can significantly enhance the diagnostic processes for genetic disorders, ultimately pushing the boundaries of personalized medicine by offering more detailed and actionable genetic insights.

Abstract:
Predicting how genetic variation affects phenotypic outcomes at the organismal, cellular, and molecular levels requires deciphering the cis-regulatory code, the sequence rules by which non-coding regions regulate genes. In this perspective, we discuss recent computational progress and challenges towards solving this fundamental problem. We describe how cis-regulatory elements are mapped and how their sequence rules can be learned and interpreted with sequence-to-function neural networks, with the goal of identifying genetic variants in human disease. We also discuss how studies of the 3D chromatin organization could help identifying long-range regulatory effects and how current methods for mapping gene regulatory networks could better describe biological processes. We point out current gaps in knowledge along with technical limitations and benchmarking challenges of computational methods. Finally, we discuss newly emerging technologies, such as spatial transcriptomics, and outline strategies for creating a more general model of the cis-regulatory code that is more broadly applicable across cell types and individuals.

Abstract:
A path-covering problem on a directed acyclic graph (DAG) requires finding a set of source-to-sink paths that cover all the nodes, all the arcs, or subsets thereof, and additionally they are optimal with respect to some function. In this paper we study safe sequences of nodes or arcs, namely sequences that appear in some path of every path cover of a DAG.   We show that safe sequences admit a simple characterization via cutnodes. Moreover, we establish a connection between maximal safe sequences and leaf-to-root paths in the source- and sink-dominator trees of the DAG, which may be of independent interest in the extensive literature on dominators. With dominator trees, safe sequences admit an O(n)-size representation and a linear-time output-sensitive enumeration algorithm running in time O(m + o), where n and m are the number of nodes and arcs, respectively, and o is the total length of the maximal safe sequences.   We then apply maximal safe sequences to simplify Integer Linear Programs (ILPs) for two path-covering problems, LeastSquares and MinPathError, which are at the core of RNA transcript assembly problems from bioinformatics. On various datasets, maximal safe sequences can be computed in under 0.1 seconds per graph, on average, and ILP solvers whose search space is reduced in this manner exhibit significant speed-ups. For example on graphs with a large width, average speed-ups are in the range 50-250x for MinPathError and in the range 80-350x for LeastSquares. Optimizing ILPs using safe sequences can thus become a fast building block of practical RNA transcript assembly tools, and more generally, of path-covering problems.

Abstract:
Research on long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) has garnered significant attention due to their critical roles in gene regulation and disease mechanisms. However, the complexity and diversity of lncRNA sequences, along with the limited knowledge of their functional mechanisms and the regulation of their expressions, pose significant challenges to lncRNA studies. Given the tremendous success of large language models (LLMs) in capturing complex dependencies in sequential data, this study aims to systematically explore the potential and limitations of LLMs in the sequence analysis related to the transcriptional regulation of lncRNA genes. Our extensive experiments demonstrated promising performance of fine-tuned genome foundation models on progressively complex tasks. Furthermore, we conducted an insightful analysis of the critical impact of task complexity, model selection, data quality, and biological interpretability for the studies of the regulation of lncRNA gene expression.

Abstract:
Human excrement composting (HEC) is a sustainable strategy for human excrement (HE) management that recycles nutrients and mitigates health risks while reducing reliance on freshwater, fossil fuels, and fertilizers. We present a comprehensive microbial time series analysis of HEC and show that the initial gut-like microbiome of HEC systems transitions to a microbiome similar to soil and traditional compost in fifteen biological replicates tracked weekly for one year.

Abstract:
The effective visualization of genomic data is crucial for exploring and interpreting complex relationships within and across genes and genomes. Despite advances in developing dedicated bioinformatics software, common visualization tools often fail to efficiently integrate the diverse datasets produced in comparative genomics, lack intuitive interfaces to construct complex plots and are missing functionalities to inspect the underlying data iteratively and at scale. Here, we introduce gggenomes, a versatile R package designed to overcome these challenges by extending the widely used ggplot2 framework for comparative genomics. gggenomes is available from CRAN and GitHub, accompanied by detailed and user-friendly documentation (https://thackl.github.io/gggenomes).

Abstract:
Following its success for vision and text, the "foundation model" (FM) paradigm -- pretraining large models on massive data, then fine-tuning on target tasks -- has rapidly expanded to domains in the sciences, engineering, healthcare, and beyond. Has this achieved what the original FMs accomplished, i.e. the supplanting of traditional supervised learning in their domains? To answer we look at three modalities -- genomics, satellite imaging, and time series -- with multiple recent FMs and compare them to a standard supervised learning workflow: model development, hyperparameter tuning, and training, all using only data from the target task. Across these three specialized domains, we find that it is consistently possible to train simple supervised models -- no more complicated than a lightly modified wide ResNet or UNet -- that match or even outperform the latest foundation models. Our work demonstrates that the benefits of large-scale pretraining have yet to be realized in many specialized areas, reinforces the need to compare new FMs to strong, well-tuned baselines, and introduces two new, easy-to-use, open-source, and automated workflows for doing so.

Abstract:
Obtaining effective representations of DNA sequences is crucial for genome analysis. Metagenomic binning, for instance, relies on genome representations to cluster complex mixtures of DNA fragments from biological samples with the aim of determining their microbial compositions. In this paper, we revisit k-mer-based representations of genomes and provide a theoretical analysis of their use in representation learning. Based on the analysis, we propose a lightweight and scalable model for performing metagenomic binning at the genome read level, relying only on the k-mer compositions of the DNA fragments. We compare the model to recent genome foundation models and demonstrate that while the models are comparable in performance, the proposed model is significantly more effective in terms of scalability, a crucial aspect for performing metagenomic binning of real-world datasets.

Abstract:
Accurate survival prediction is essential for personalized cancer treatment. However, genomic data - often a more powerful predictor than pathology data - is costly and inaccessible. We present the cross-modal genomic feature translation and alignment network for enhanced survival prediction from histopathology images (PathoGen-X). It is a deep learning framework that leverages both genomic and imaging data during training, relying solely on imaging data at testing. PathoGen-X employs transformer-based networks to align and translate image features into the genomic feature space, enhancing weaker imaging signals with stronger genomic signals. Unlike other methods, PathoGen-X translates and aligns features without projecting them to a shared latent space and requires fewer paired samples. Evaluated on TCGA-BRCA, TCGA-LUAD, and TCGA-GBM datasets, PathoGen-X demonstrates strong survival prediction performance, emphasizing the potential of enriched imaging models for accessible cancer prognosis.

Title: Fast and scalable Wasserstein-1 neural optimal transport solver for single-cell perturbation prediction

Abstract:
\textbf{Motivation:} Predicting single-cell perturbation responses requires mapping between two unpaired single-cell data distributions. Optimal transport (OT) theory provides a principled framework for constructing such mappings by minimizing transport cost. Recently, Wasserstein-2 ($W_2$) neural optimal transport solvers (\textit{e.g.}, CellOT) have been employed for this prediction task. However, $W_2$ OT relies on the general Kantorovich dual formulation, which involves optimizing over two conjugate functions, leading to a complex min-max optimization problem that converges slowly. \\ \textbf{Results:} To address these challenges, we propose a novel solver based on the Wasserstein-1 ($W_1$) dual formulation. Unlike $W_2$, the $W_1$ dual simplifies the optimization to a maximization problem over a single 1-Lipschitz function, thus eliminating the need for time-consuming min-max optimization. While solving the $W_1$ dual only reveals the transport direction and does not directly provide a unique optimal transport map, we incorporate an additional step using adversarial training to determine an appropriate transport step size, effectively recovering the transport map. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed $W_1$ neural optimal transport solver can mimic the $W_2$ OT solvers in finding a unique and ``monotonic" map on 2D datasets. Moreover, the $W_1$ OT solver achieves performance on par with or surpasses $W_2$ OT solvers on real single-cell perturbation datasets. Furthermore, we show that $W_1$ OT solver achieves $25 \sim 45\times$ speedup, scales better on high dimensional transportation task, and can be directly applied on single-cell RNA-seq dataset with highly variable genes. \\ \textbf{Availability and Implementation:} Our implementation and experiments are open-sourced at https://github.com/poseidonchan/w1ot.

Abstract:
The success of machine learning models relies heavily on effectively representing high-dimensional data. However, ensuring data representations capture human-understandable concepts remains difficult, often requiring the incorporation of prior knowledge and decomposition of data into multiple subspaces. Traditional linear methods fall short in modeling more than one space, while more expressive deep learning approaches lack interpretability. Here, we introduce Supervised Independent Subspace Principal Component Analysis ($\texttt{sisPCA}$), a PCA extension designed for multi-subspace learning. Leveraging the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC), $\texttt{sisPCA}$ incorporates supervision and simultaneously ensures subspace disentanglement. We demonstrate $\texttt{sisPCA}$'s connections with autoencoders and regularized linear regression and showcase its ability to identify and separate hidden data structures through extensive applications, including breast cancer diagnosis from image features, learning aging-associated DNA methylation changes, and single-cell analysis of malaria infection. Our results reveal distinct functional pathways associated with malaria colonization, underscoring the essentiality of explainable representation in high-dimensional data analysis.

Abstract:
This study evaluates the concordance between RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and NanoString technologies for gene expression analysis in non-human primates (NHPs) infected with Ebola virus (EBOV). We performed a detailed comparison of both platforms, demonstrating a strong correlation between them, with Spearman coefficients for 56 out of 62 samples ranging from 0.78 to 0.88, with a mean of 0.83 and a median of 0.85. Bland-Altman analysis further confirmed high consistency, with most measurements falling within 95% confidence limits. A machine learning approach, using the Supervised Magnitude-Altitude Scoring (SMAS) method trained on NanoString data, identified OAS1 as a key marker for distinguishing RT-qPCR positive from negative samples. Remarkably, when applied to RNA-Seq data, OAS1 also achieved 100% accuracy in differentiating infected from uninfected samples using logistic regression, demonstrating its robustness across platforms. Further differential expression analysis identified 12 common genes including ISG15, OAS1, IFI44, IFI27, IFIT2, IFIT3, IFI44L, MX1, MX2, OAS2, RSAD2, and OASL which demonstrated the highest levels of statistical significance and biological relevance across both platforms. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis confirmed that these genes are directly involved in key immune and viral infection pathways, reinforcing their importance in EBOV infection. In addition, RNA-Seq uniquely identified genes such as CASP5, USP18, and DDX60, which play key roles in immune regulation and antiviral defense. This finding highlights the broader detection capabilities of RNA-Seq and underscores the complementary strengths of both platforms in providing a comprehensive and accurate assessment of gene expression changes during Ebola virus infection.

Abstract:
Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) technology is a powerful tool for unraveling the complexity of biological systems. One of essential and fundamental tasks in scRNA-seq data analysis is Cell Type Annotation (CTA). In spite of tremendous efforts in developing machine learning methods for this problem, several challenges remains. They include identifying Out-of-Domain (OOD) cell types, quantifying the uncertainty of unseen cell type annotations, and determining interpretable cell type-specific gene drivers for an OOD case. OOD cell types are often associated with therapeutic responses and disease origins, making them critical for precision medicine and early disease diagnosis. Additionally, scRNA-seq data contains tens thousands of gene expressions. Pinpointing gene drivers underlying CTA can provide deep insight into gene regulatory mechanisms and serve as disease biomarkers. In this study, we develop a new method, eDOC, to address aforementioned challenges. eDOC leverages a transformer architecture with evidential learning to annotate In-Domain (IND) and OOD cell types as well as to highlight genes that contribute both IND cells and OOD cells in a single cell resolution. Rigorous experiments demonstrate that eDOC significantly improves the efficiency and effectiveness of OOD cell type and gene driver identification compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Our findings suggest that eDOC may provide new insights into single-cell biology.
