    "abstract": "Machine- and deep-learning approaches for biological sequences depend critically on transforming raw DNA, RNA, and protein FASTA files into informative numerical representations. However, this process is often fragmented across multiple libraries and preprocessing steps, which creates a barrier for researchers without extensive computational expertise. To address this gap, we developed deepFEPS, an open-source toolkit that unifies state-of-the-art feature extraction methods for sequence data within a single, reproducible workflow. deepFEPS integrates five families of modern feature extractors - k-mer embeddings (Word2Vec, FastText), document-level embeddings (Doc2Vec), transformer-based encoders (DNABERT, ProtBERT, and ESM2), autoencoder-derived latent features, and graph-based embeddings - into one consistent platform. The system accepts FASTA input via a web interface or command-line tool, exposes key model parameters, and outputs analysis-ready feature matrices (CSV). Each run is accompanied by an automatic quality-control report including sequence counts, dimensionality, sparsity, variance distributions, class balance, and diagnostic visualizations. By consolidating advanced sequence embeddings into one environment, deepFEPS reduces preprocessing overhead, improves reproducibility, and shortens the path from raw sequences to downstream machine- and deep-learning applications. deepFEPS lowers the practical barrier to modern representation learning for bioinformatics, enabling both novice and expert users to generate advanced embeddings for classification, clustering, and predictive modeling. Its unified framework supports exploratory analyses, high-throughput studies, and integration into institutional workflows, while remaining extensible to emerging models and methods.

    "abstract": "The ancestral recombination graph (ARG) is the model of choice in statistical genetics to model population ancestries. Software capable of simulating ARGs on a genome scale within a reasonable amount of time are now widely available for most practical use cases. While the inverse problem of inferring ancestries from a sample of haplotypes has seen major progress in the last decade, it does not enjoy the same level of advancement as its counterpart. Up until recently, even moderately sized samples could only be handled using heuristics. In recent years, the possibility of model-based inference for datasets closer to \"real world\" scenarios has become a reality, largely due to the development of threading-based samplers. This article introduces Moonshine.jl, a Julia package that has the ability, among other things, to infer ARGs for samples of thousands of human haplotypes of sizes on the order of hundreds of megabases within a reasonable amount of time. On recent hardware, our package is able to infer an ARG for samples of densely haplotyped (over one marker/kilobase) human chromosomes of sizes up to 10000 in well under a day on data simulated by msprime. Scaling up simulation on a compute cluster is straightforward thanks to a strictly single-threaded implementation. While model-based, it does not resort to threading but rather places restrictions on probability distributions typically used in simulation software in order to enforce sample consistency. In addition to being efficient, a strong emphasis is placed on ease of use and integration into the biostatistical software ecosystem.",

    "abstract": "Representation learning on multi-omics data is challenging due to extreme dimensionality, modality heterogeneity, and cohort-specific batch effects. While pre-trained transformer backbones have shown broad generalization capabilities in biological sequence modeling, their application to multi-omics integration remains underexplored. We present MoRE (Multi-Omics Representation Embedding), a framework that repurposes frozen pre-trained transformers to align heterogeneous assays into a shared latent space. Unlike purely generative approaches, MoRE employs a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategy, prioritizing cross-sample and cross-modality alignment over simple sequence reconstruction. Specifically, MoRE attaches lightweight, modality-specific adapters and a task-adaptive fusion layer to the frozen backbone. It optimizes a masked modeling objective jointly with supervised contrastive and batch-invariant alignment losses, yielding structure-preserving embeddings that generalize across unseen cell types and platforms. We benchmark MoRE against established baselines, including scGPT, scVI, and Harmony with Scrublet, evaluating integration fidelity, rare population detection, and modality transfer. Our results demonstrate that MoRE achieves competitive batch robustness and biological conservation while significantly reducing trainable parameters compared to fully fine-tuned models. This work positions MoRE as a practical step toward general-purpose omics foundation models.",

    "title": "Fast and Flexible Flow Decompositions in General Graphs via Dominators",
    "abstract": "Multi-assembly methods rely at their core on a flow decomposition problem, namely, decomposing a weighted graph into weighted paths or walks. However, most results over the past decade have focused on decompositions over directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). This limitation has lead to either purely heuristic methods, or in applications transforming a graph with cycles into a DAG via preprocessing heuristics. In this paper we show that flow decomposition problems can be solved in practice also on general graphs with cycles, via a framework that yields fast and flexible Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulations.   Our key technique relies on the graph-theoretic notion of dominator tree, which we use to find all safe sequences of edges, that are guaranteed to appear in some walk of any flow decomposition solution. We generalize previous results from DAGs to cyclic graphs, by showing that maximal safe sequences correspond to extensions of common leaves of two dominator trees, and that we can find all of them in time linear in their size. Using these, we can accelerate MILPs for any flow decomposition into walks in general graphs, by setting to (at least) 1 suitable variables encoding solution walks, and by setting to 0 other walks variables non-reachable to and from safe sequences. This reduces model size and eliminates costly linearizations of MILP variable products.   We experiment with three decomposition models (Minimum Flow Decomposition, Least Absolute Errors and Minimum Path Error), on four bacterial datasets. Our pre-processing enables up to thousand-fold speedups and solves even under 30 seconds many instances otherwise timing out. We thus hope that our dominator-based MILP simplification framework, and the accompanying software library can become building blocks in multi-assembly applications.",

    "title": "The TAG array of a multiple sequence alignment",
    "abstract": "Modern genomic analyses increasingly rely on pangenomes, that is, representations of the genome of entire populations. The simplest representation of a pangenome is a set of individual genome sequences. Compared to e.g. sequence graphs, this has the advantage that efficient exact search via indexes based on the Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) is possible, that no chimeric sequences are created, and that the results are not influenced by heuristics. However, such an index may report a match in thousands of positions even if these all correspond to the same locus, making downstream analysis unnecessarily expensive. For sufficiently similar sequences (e.g. human chromosomes), a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) can be computed. Since an MSA tends to group similar strings in the same columns, it is likely that a string occurring thousands of times in the pangenome can be described by very few columns in the MSA. We describe a method to tag entries in the BWT with the corresponding column in the MSA and develop an index that can map matches in the BWT to columns in the MSA in time proportional to the output. As a by-product, we can efficiently project a match to a designated reference genome, a capability that current pangenome aligners based on the BWT lack.",

    "abstract": "Spatial transcriptomics (ST) is a novel technology that enables the observation of gene expression at the resolution of individual spots within pathological tissues. ST quantifies the expression of tens of thousands of genes in a tissue section; however, heavy observational noise is often introduced during measurement. In prior studies, to ensure meaningful assessment, both training and evaluation have been restricted to only a small subset of highly variable genes, and genes outside this subset have also been excluded from the training process. However, since there are likely co-expression relationships between genes, low-expression genes may still contribute to the estimation of the evaluation target. In this paper, we propose $Auxiliary \\ Gene \\ Learning$ (AGL) that utilizes the benefit of the ignored genes by reformulating their expression estimation as auxiliary tasks and training them jointly with the primary tasks. To effectively leverage auxiliary genes, we must select a subset of auxiliary genes that positively influence the prediction of the target genes. However, this is a challenging optimization problem due to the vast number of possible combinations. To overcome this challenge, we propose Prior-Knowledge-Based Differentiable Top-$k$ Gene Selection via Bi-level Optimization (DkGSB), a method that ranks genes by leveraging prior knowledge and relaxes the combinatorial selection problem into a differentiable top-$k$ selection problem. The experiments confirm the effectiveness of incorporating auxiliary genes and show that the proposed method outperforms conventional auxiliary task learning approaches.",

Simple static resource allocation methods struggle to handle the variability in per-chromosome RAM demands, resulting in poor resource utilization and long runtimes. In this work, we propose multiple mechanisms for adaptive, RAM-efficient parallelization of chromosome-level bioinformatics workflows. First, we develop a symbolic regression model that estimates per-chromosome memory consumption for a given task and introduces an interpolating bias to conservatively minimize over-allocation. Second, we present a dynamic scheduler that adaptively predicts RAM usage with a polynomial regression model, treating task packing as a Knapsack problem to optimally batch jobs based on predicted memory requirements. Additionally, we present a static scheduler that optimizes chromosome processing order to minimize peak memory while preserving throughput. Our proposed methods, evaluated on simulations and real-world genomic pipelines, provide new mechanisms to reduce memory overruns and balance load across threads. We thereby achieve faster end-to-end execution, showcasing the potential to optimize large-scale genomic workflows.",

    "abstract": "Biological data sets are often high-dimensional, noisy, and governed by complex interactions among sparse signals. This poses major challenges for interpretability and reliable feature selection. Tasks such as identifying motif interactions in genomics exemplify these difficulties, as only a small subset of biologically relevant features (e.g., motifs) are typically active, and their effects are often non-linear and context-dependent. While statistical approaches often result in more interpretable models, deep learning models have proven effective in modeling complex interactions and prediction accuracy, yet their black-box nature limits interpretability. We introduce BaGGLS, a flexible and interpretable probabilistic binary regression model designed for high-dimensional biological inference involving feature interactions. BaGGLS incorporates a Bayesian group global-local shrinkage prior, aligned with the group structure introduced by interaction terms. This prior encourages sparsity while retaining interpretability, helping to isolate meaningful signals and suppress noise. To enable scalable inference, we employ a partially factorized variational approximation that captures posterior skewness and supports efficient learning even in large feature spaces. In extensive simulations, we can show that BaGGLS outperforms the other methods with regard to interaction detection and is many times faster than MCMC sampling under the horseshoe prior. We also demonstrate the usefulness of BaGGLS in the context of interaction discovery from motif scanner outputs and noisy attribution scores from deep learning models. This shows that BaGGLS is a promising approach for uncovering biologically relevant interaction patterns, with potential applicability across a range of high-dimensional tasks in computational biology.",

The conventional TNM staging system is inadequate for personalized medicine. We aimed to develop and validate a novel multiple instance learning model TDAM-CRC using histopathological whole-slide images for accurate prognostic prediction and to uncover its underlying molecular mechanisms. We trained the model on the TCGA discovery cohort (n=581), validated it in an independent external cohort (n=1031), and further we integrated multi-omics data to improve model interpretability and identify novel prognostic biomarkers. The results demonstrated that the TDAM-CRC achieved robust risk stratification in both cohorts. Its predictive performance significantly outperformed the conventional clinical staging system and multiple state-of-the-art models. The TDAM-CRC risk score was confirmed as an independent prognostic factor in multivariable analysis. Multi-omics analysis revealed that the high-risk subtype is closely associated with metabolic reprogramming and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Through interaction network analysis, we identified and validated Mitochondrial Ribosomal Protein L37 (MRPL37) as a key hub gene linking deep pathomic features to clinical prognosis. We found that high expression of MRPL37, driven by promoter hypomethylation, serves as an independent biomarker of favorable prognosis. Finally, we constructed a nomogram incorporating the TDAM-CRC risk score and clinical factors to provide a precise and interpretable clinical decision-making tool for CRC patients. Our AI-driven pathological model TDAM-CRC provides a robust tool for improved CRC risk stratification, reveals new molecular targets, and facilitates personalized clinical decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Trained on massive cross-species DNA corpora, DNA large language models (LLMs) learn the fundamental \"grammar\" and evolutionary patterns of genomic sequences. This makes them powerful priors for DNA sequence modeling, particularly over long ranges. However, two major constraints hinder their use in practice: the quadratic computational cost of self-attention and the growing memory required for key-value (KV) caches during autoregressive decoding. These constraints force the use of heuristics such as fixed-window truncation or sliding windows, which compromise fidelity on ultra-long sequences by discarding distant information. We introduce FOCUS (Feature-Oriented Compression for Ultra-long Self-attention), a progressive context-compression module that can be plugged into pretrained DNA LLMs. FOCUS combines the established k-mer representation in genomics with learnable hierarchical compression: it inserts summary tokens at k-mer granularity and progressively compresses attention key and value activations across multiple Transformer layers, retaining only the summary KV states across windows while discarding ordinary-token KV. A shared-boundary windowing scheme yields a stationary cross-window interface that propagates long-range information with minimal loss. We validate FOCUS on an Evo-2-based DNA LLM fine-tuned on GRCh38 chromosome 1 with self-supervised training and randomized compression schedules to promote robustness across compression ratios. On held-out human chromosomes, FOCUS achieves near-lossless fidelity: compressing a 1 kb context into only 10 summary tokens (about 100x) shifts the average per-nucleotide probability by only about 0.0004. Compared to a baseline without compression, FOCUS reduces KV-cache memory and converts effective inference scaling from O(N^2) to near-linear O(N), enabling about 100x longer inference windows on commodity GPUs with near-lossless fidelity.",

    "abstract": "Modeling genomic sequences faces two unsolved challenges: the information density varies widely across different regions, while there is no clearly defined minimum vocabulary unit. Relying on either four primitive bases or independently designed DNA tokenizers, existing approaches with naive masked language modeling pre-training often fail to adapt to the varying complexities of genomic sequences. Leveraging Token Merging techniques, this paper introduces a hierarchical architecture that jointly optimizes a dynamic genomic tokenizer and latent Transformers with context-aware pre-training tasks. As for network structures, the tokenization module automatically chunks adjacent bases into words by stacking multiple layers of the differentiable token merging blocks with local-window constraints, then a Latent Encoder captures the global context of these merged words by full-attention blocks. Symmetrically employing a Latent Decoder and a Local Decoder, MergeDNA learns with two pre-training tasks: Merged Token Reconstruction simultaneously trains the dynamic tokenization module and adaptively filters important tokens, while Adaptive Masked Token Modeling learns to predict these filtered tokens to capture informative contents. Extensive experiments show that MergeDNA achieves superior performance on three popular DNA benchmarks and several multi-omics tasks with fine-tuning or zero-shot evaluation, outperforming typical tokenization methods and large-scale DNA foundation models.",

    "abstract": "Unsupervised learning on high-dimensional RNA-seq data can reveal molecular subtypes beyond standard labels. We combine an autoencoder-based representation with clustering and stability analysis to search for rare but reproducible genomic subtypes. On the UCI \"Gene Expression Cancer RNA-Seq\" dataset (801 samples, 20,531 genes; BRCA, COAD, KIRC, LUAD, PRAD), a pan-cancer analysis shows clusters aligning almost perfectly with tissue of origin (Cramer's V = 0.887), serving as a negative control. We therefore reframe the problem within KIRC (n = 146): we select the top 2,000 highly variable genes, standardize them, train a feed-forward autoencoder (128-dimensional latent space), and run k-means for k = 2-10. While global indices favor small k, scanning k with a pre-specified discovery rule (rare < 10 percent and stable with Jaccard >= 0.60 across 20 seeds after Hungarian alignment) yields a simple solution at k = 5 (silhouette = 0.129, DBI = 2.045) with a rare cluster C0 (6.85 percent of patients) that is highly stable (Jaccard = 0.787). Cluster-vs-rest differential expression (Welch's t-test, Benjamini-Hochberg FDR) identifies coherent markers. Overall, pan-cancer clustering is dominated by tissue of origin, whereas a stability-aware within-cancer approach reveals a rare, reproducible KIRC subtype.",

    "abstract": "In-context learning (ICL) -- the capacity of a model to infer and apply abstract patterns from examples provided within its input -- has been extensively studied in large language models trained for next-token prediction on human text. In fact, prior work often attributes this emergent behavior to distinctive statistical properties in human language. This raises a fundamental question: can ICL arise organically in other sequence domains purely through large-scale predictive training?   To explore this, we turn to genomic sequences, an alternative symbolic domain rich in statistical structure. Specifically, we study the Evo2 genomic model, trained predominantly on next-nucleotide (A/T/C/G) prediction, at a scale comparable to mid-sized LLMs. We develop a controlled experimental framework comprising symbolic reasoning tasks instantiated in both linguistic and genomic forms, enabling direct comparison of ICL across genomic and linguistic models. Our results show that genomic models, like their linguistic counterparts, exhibit log-linear gains in pattern induction as the number of in-context demonstrations increases. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first evidence of organically emergent ICL in genomic sequences, supporting the hypothesis that ICL arises as a consequence of large-scale predictive modeling over rich data. These findings extend emergent meta-learning beyond language, pointing toward a unified, modality-agnostic view of in-context learning.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), especially temporally resolved datasets, enables genome-wide profiling of gene expression dynamics at single-cell resolution across discrete time points. However, current technologies provide only sparse, static snapshots of cell states and are inherently influenced by technical noise, complicating the inference and representation of continuous transcriptional dynamics. Although embedding methods can reduce dimensionality and mitigate technical noise, the majority of existing approaches typically treat trajectory inference separately from embedding construction, often neglecting temporal structure. To address this challenge, here we introduce CellStream, a novel deep learning framework that jointly learns embedding and cellular dynamics from single-cell snapshot data by integrating an autoencoder with unbalanced dynamical optimal transport. Compared to existing methods, CellStream generates dynamics-informed embeddings that robustly capture temporal developmental processes while maintaining high consistency with the underlying data manifold. We demonstrate CellStream's effectiveness on both simulated datasets and real scRNA-seq data, including spatial transcriptomics. Our experiments indicate significant quantitative improvements over state-of-the-art methods in representing cellular trajectories with enhanced temporal coherence and reduced noise sensitivity. Overall, CellStream provides a new tool for learning and representing continuous streams from the noisy, static snapshots of single-cell gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Efficient and consistent string processing is critical in the exponentially growing genomic data era. Locally Consistent Parsing (LCP) addresses this need by partitioning an input genome string into short, exactly matching substrings (e.g., \"cores\"), ensuring consistency across partitions. Labeling the cores of an input string consistently not only provides a compact representation of the input but also enables the reapplication of LCP to refine the cores over multiple iterations, providing a progressively longer and more informative set of substrings for downstream analyses.   We present the first iterative implementation of LCP with Lcptools and demonstrate its effectiveness in identifying cores with minimal collisions. Experimental results show that the number of cores at the i^th iteration is O(n/c^i) for c ~ 2.34, while the average length and the average distance between consecutive cores are O(c^i). Compared to the popular sketching techniques, LCP produces significantly fewer cores, enabling a more compact representation and faster analyses. To demonstrate the advantages of LCP in genomic string processing in terms of computation and memory efficiency, we also introduce LCPan, an efficient variation graph constructor. We show that LCPan generates variation graphs >10x faster than vg, while using >13x less memory.",

    "abstract": "Classes, as fundamental elements of Computer Vision, have been extensively studied within incremental learning frameworks. In contrast, tokens, which play essential roles in many research fields, exhibit similar characteristics of growth, yet investigations into their incremental learning remain significantly scarce. This research gap primarily stems from the holistic nature of tokens in language, which imposes significant challenges on the design of incremental learning frameworks for them. To overcome this obstacle, in this work, we turn to a type of token, gene, for a large-scale biological dataset--single-cell transcriptomics--to formulate a pipeline for gene incremental learning and establish corresponding evaluations. We found that the forgetting problem also exists in gene incremental learning, thus we adapted existing class incremental learning methods to mitigate the forgetting of genes. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrated the soundness of our framework design and evaluations, as well as the effectiveness of our method adaptations. Finally, we provide a complete benchmark for gene incremental learning in single-cell transcriptomics.",

Conventional approaches represent each cell as a vector in Euclidean space, which limits their ability to capture intrinsic correlations and multiscale geometric structures. We propose a multiscale framework based on Grassmann manifolds that integrates machine learning with subspace geometry for single-cell data analysis. By generating embeddings under multiple representation scales, the framework combines their features from different geometric views into a unified Grassmann manifold. A power-based scale sampling function is introduced to control the selection of scales and balance in- formation across resolutions. Experiments on nine benchmark single-cell RNA-seq datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively preserves meaningful structures and provides stable clustering performance, particularly for small to medium-sized datasets. These results suggest that Grassmann manifolds offer a coherent and informative foundation for analyzing single cell data.",

    "abstract": "The identification of disease-gene associations is instrumental in understanding the mechanisms of diseases and developing novel treatments. Besides identifying genes from RNA-Seq datasets, it is often necessary to identify gene clusters that have relationships with a disease. In this work, we propose a graph-based method for using an RNA-Seq dataset with known genes related to a disease and perform a robust clustering analysis to identify clusters of genes. Our method involves the construction of a gene co-expression network, followed by the computation of gene embeddings leveraging Node2Vec+, an algorithm applying weighted biased random walks and skipgram with negative sampling to compute node embeddings from undirected graphs with weighted edges. Finally, we perform spectral clustering to identify clusters of genes. All processes in our entire method are jointly optimized for stability, robustness, and optimality by applying Tree-structured Parzen Estimator. Our method was applied to an RNA-Seq dataset of known genes that have associations with Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD). We also performed tests to validate and verify the robustness and statistical significance of our methods due to the stochastic nature of the involved processes. Our results show that our method is capable of generating consistent and robust clustering results. Our method can be seamlessly applied to other RNA-Seq datasets due to our process of joint optimization, ensuring the stability and optimality of the several steps in our method, including the construction of a gene co-expression network, computation of gene embeddings, and clustering of genes. Our work will aid in the discovery of natural structures in the RNA-Seq data, and understanding gene regulation and gene functions not just for AMD but for any disease in general.",

    "abstract": "Detecting chemical modifications on RNA molecules remains a key challenge in epitranscriptomics. Traditional reverse transcription-based sequencing methods introduce enzyme- and sequence-dependent biases and fragment RNA molecules, confounding the accurate mapping of modifications across the transcriptome. Nanopore direct RNA sequencing offers a powerful alternative by preserving native RNA molecules, enabling the detection of modifications at single-molecule resolution. However, current computational tools can identify only a limited subset of modification types within well-characterized sequence contexts for which ample training data exists. Here, we introduce a model-free computational method that reframes modification detection as an anomaly detection problem, requiring only canonical (unmodified) RNA reads without any other annotated data. For each nanopore read, our approach extracts robust, modification-sensitive features from the raw ionic current signal at a site using the signature transform, then computes an anomaly score by comparing the resulting feature vector to its nearest neighbors in an unmodified reference dataset. We convert anomaly scores into statistical p-values to enable anomaly detection at both individual read and site levels. Validation on densely-modified \\textit{E. coli} rRNA demonstrates that our approach detects known sites harboring diverse modification types, without prior training on these modifications. We further applyied this framework to dengue virus (DENV) transcripts and mammalian mRNAs. For DENV sfRNA, it led to revealing a novel 2'-O-methylated site, which we validate orthogonally by qRT-PCR assays. These results demonstrate that our model-free approach operates robustly across different types of RNAs and datasets generated with different nanopore sequencing chemistries.",

    "abstract": "The discovery of genetic risk factors has transformed human genetics, yet the pace of new gene identification has slowed despite the exponential expansion of sequencing and biobank resources. Current approaches are optimized for the extremes of the allele frequency spectrum: rare, high-penetrance variants identified through burden testing, and common, low-effect variants mapped by genome-wide association studies. Between these extremes lies variants of intermediate frequency and effect size where statistical power is limited, pathogenicity is often misclassified, and gene discovery lags behind empirical evidence of heritable contribution. This 'missing middle' represents a critical blind spot across disease areas, from neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders to cancer and aging. In this review, we organize strategies for risk gene identification by variant frequency class, highlighting methodological strengths and constraints at each scale. We draw on lessons across fields to illustrate how innovations in variant annotation, joint modeling, phenotype refinement, and network-based inference can extend discovery into the intermediate range. By framing the frequency spectrum as a unifying axis, we provide a conceptual map of current capabilities, their limitations, and emerging directions toward more comprehensive risk gene discovery.",

    "abstract": "Since its emergence, SARS-CoV-2 has demonstrated a rapid and unpredictable evolutionary trajectory, characterized by the continual emergence of immune-evasive variants. This poses persistent challenges to public health and vaccine development.   While large-scale generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs) have revolutionized the modeling of sequential data, their direct applications to noisy viral genomic sequences are limited. In this paper, we introduce PETRA(Pretrained Evolutionary TRAnsformer), a novel transformer approach based on evolutionary trajectories derived from phylogenetic trees rather than raw RNA sequences. This method effectively mitigates sequencing noise and captures the hierarchical structure of viral evolution.   With a weighted training framework to address substantial geographical and temporal imbalances in global sequence data, PETRA excels in predicting future SARS-CoV-2 mutations, achieving a weighted recall@1 of 9.45% for nucleotide mutations and 17.10\\% for spike amino-acid mutations, compared to 0.49% and 6.64% respectively for the best baseline. PETRA also demonstrates its ability to aid in the real-time mutation prediction of major clades like 24F(XEC) and 25A(LP.8.1). The code is open sourced on https://github.com/xz-keg/PETra",

    "abstract": "Computational modeling of single-cell gene expression is crucial for understanding cellular processes, but generating realistic expression profiles remains a major challenge. This difficulty arises from the count nature of gene expression data and complex latent dependencies among genes. Existing generative models often impose artificial gene orderings or rely on shallow neural network architectures. We introduce a scalable latent diffusion model for single-cell gene expression data, which we refer to as scLDM, that respects the fundamental exchangeability property of the data. Our VAE uses fixed-size latent variables leveraging a unified Multi-head Cross-Attention Block (MCAB) architecture, which serves dual roles: permutation-invariant pooling in the encoder and permutation-equivariant unpooling in the decoder. We enhance this framework by replacing the Gaussian prior with a latent diffusion model using Diffusion Transformers and linear interpolants, enabling high-quality generation with multi-conditional classifier-free guidance. We show its superior performance in a variety of experiments for both observational and perturbational single-cell data, as well as downstream tasks like cell-level classification.",

    "abstract": "In clinical proteomics, available input is often limited. In addition, phospho-proteomics is of particular interest since the dysregulation of these post-translational modifications (PTMs) has been implicated in various diseases such as cancer. We therefore assessed the feasibility of low input phospho-proteomics via phospho-bulk titration and low-input starting material. We found that there was identification of more phospho-peptides through phospho-bulk titration because of sample loss during preparation of low input starting material. Additionally, we explored various lysis buffers and boiling times for efficiency of decrosslinking formalin-fixed cells since cells and tissues are often fixed for preservation and sorting via FACS. We found that boiling in 0.05M Tris pH 7.6 with 5% SDS for 60 min yielded the highest number of phospho-peptides. Lastly, we applied Evotips Pure and phospho-bulk titration to treated Jurkat cells and identified 7 phospho-sites involved in T-cell stimulation.",

NABench aggregates 162 high-throughput assays and curates 2.6 million mutated sequences spanning diverse DNA and RNA families, with standardized splits and rich metadata. We show that NABench surpasses prior nucleotide fitness benchmarks in scale, diversity, and data quality. Under a unified evaluation suite, we rigorously assess 29 representative foundation models across zero-shot, few-shot prediction, transfer learning, and supervised settings. The results quantify performance heterogeneity across tasks and nucleic-acid types, demonstrating clear strengths and failure modes for different modeling choices and establishing strong, reproducible baselines.

    "abstract": "Diagnosing rare diseases requires linking gene findings with often unstructured reference text. Current pipelines collect many candidate genes, but clinicians still spend a lot of time filtering false positives and combining evidence from papers and databases. A key challenge is language: phenotype descriptions and inheritance patterns are written in prose, not fully captured by tables. Large language models (LLMs) can read such text, but clinical use needs grounding in citable knowledge and stable, repeatable behavior. We explore a knowledge-grounded and language-aware reranking layer on top of a high-recall first-stage pipeline. The goal is to improve precision and explainability, not to replace standard bioinformatics steps. We use expert-built context and a consensus method to reduce LLM variability, producing shorter, better-justified gene lists for expert review. LA-MARRVEL achieves the highest accuracy, outperforming other methods -- including traditional bioinformatics diagnostic tools (AI-MARRVEL, Exomiser, LIRICAL) and naive large language models (e.g., Anthropic Claude) -- with an average Recall@5 of 94.10%, a +3.65 percentage-point improvement over AI-MARRVEL. The LLM-generated reasoning provides clear prose on phenotype matching and inheritance patterns, making clinical review faster and easier. LA-MARRVEL has three parts: expert-engineered context that enriches phenotype and disease information; a ranked voting algorithm that combines multiple LLM runs to choose a consensus ranked gene list; and the AI-MARRVEL pipeline that provides first-stage ranks and gene annotations, already known as a state-of-the-art method in Rare Disease Diagnosis on BG, DDD, and UDN cohorts. The online AI-MARRVEL includes LA-MARRVEL as an LLM feature at https://ai.marrvel.org . We evaluate LA-MARRVEL on three datasets from independent cohorts of real-world diagnosed patients.",

Analyzing whole-genome bisulfite sequencing from 1075 Arabidopsis thaliana accessions grown at 10°C, 16°C, and 22°C, we quantified single-cytosine diversity using Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD). Diversity consistently peaked at intermediate methylation levels across the CpG, CHG, and CHH sequence contexts. Temperature modulated this diversity, primarily impacting intermediately methylated sites, with non-CG contexts (CHG and CHH) exhibiting increased diversity at warmer temperatures. Notably, at 22°C, CHH diversity patterns indicated altered balance between the RdDM and CMT2 pathways that regulate specific transposable element (TE) superfamilies. Furthermore, accessions from Southern Europe displayed higher non-CG diversity at 22°C compared to Northern European accessions. Our findings reveal that temperature influences the epigenomic diversity landscape, highlighting context-dependent plasticity, a dynamic interplay between silencing pathways, and potential geographic adaptation in response to environmental cues.",

As the volume of this data grows, so does interest in analyzing it through deep learning. However, the heterogeneity of genomic interval data, where each dataset defines its own regions, creates barriers for machine learning methods that require consistent, discrete vocabularies. Methods: We introduce gtars-tokenizers, a high-performance library that maps genomic intervals to a predefined universe or vocabulary of regions, analogous to text tokenization in natural language processing. Built in Rust with bindings for Python, R, CLI, and WebAssembly, gtars-tokenizers implements two overlap methods (BITS and AIList) and integrates seamlessly with modern ML frameworks through Hugging Face-compatible APIs. Results: The gtars-tokenizers package achieves top efficiency for large-scale datasets, while enabling genomic intervals to be processed using standard ML workflows in PyTorch and TensorFlow without ad hoc preprocessing. This token-based approach bridges genomics and machine learning, supporting scalable and standardized analysis of interval data across diverse computational environments.

    "abstract": "Motivation: Advances in high-throughput chromatin conformation capture have provided insight into the three-dimensional structure and organization of chromatin. While bulk Hi-C experiments capture spatio-temporally averaged chromatin interactions across millions of cells, single-cell Hi-C experiments report on the chromatin interactions of individual cells. Supervised and unsupervised algorithms have been developed to embed single-cell Hi-C maps and identify different cell types. However, single-cell Hi-C maps are often difficult to cluster due to their high sparsity, with state-of-the-art algorithms achieving a maximum Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) of only < 0.4 on several datasets while requiring labels for training.   Results: We introduce a novel unsupervised algorithm, Single-cell Clustering Using Diagonal Diffusion Operators (SCUDDO), to embed and cluster single-cell Hi-C maps. We evaluate SCUDDO on three previously difficult-to-cluster single-cell Hi-C datasets, and show that it can outperform other current algorithms in ARI by > 0.2. Further, SCUDDO outperforms all other tested algorithms even when we restrict the number of intrachromosomal maps for each cell type and when we use only a small fraction of contacts in each Hi-C map. Thus, SCUDDO can capture the underlying latent features of single-cell Hi-C maps and provide accurate labeling of cell types even when cell types are not known a priori.

To address this, we present a probabilistic hierarchical Bayesian model that deconvolves bulk RNA-seq data into constituent cell-type expression profiles and proportions, leveraging a high-resolution single-cell reference. We apply our model to human endometrial tissue across the menstrual cycle, a context characterized by dramatic hormone-driven cellular composition changes. Our extended framework provides a principled inference of cell type proportions and cell-specific gene expression changes across cycle phases. We demonstrate the model's structure, priors, and inference strategy in detail, and we validate its performance with simulations and comparisons to existing methods. The results reveal dynamic shifts in epithelial, stromal, and immune cell fractions between menstrual phases, and identify cell-type-specific differential gene expression associated with endometrial function (e.g., decidualization markers in stromal cells during the secretory phase). We further conduct robustness tests and show that our Bayesian approach is resilient to reference mismatches and noise. Finally, we discuss the biological significance of our findings, potential clinical implications for fertility and endometrial disorders, and future directions, including integration of spatial transcriptomics.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell RNA-seq foundation models achieve strong performance on downstream tasks but remain black boxes, limiting their utility for biological discovery. Recent work has shown that sparse dictionary learning can extract concepts from deep learning models, with promising applications in biomedical imaging and protein models. However, interpreting biological concepts remains challenging, as biological sequences are not inherently human-interpretable. We introduce a novel concept-based interpretability framework for single-cell RNA-seq models with a focus on concept interpretation and evaluation. We propose an attribution method with counterfactual perturbations that identifies genes that influence concept activation, moving beyond correlational approaches like differential expression analysis. We then provide two complementary interpretation approaches: an expert-driven analysis facilitated by an interactive interface and an ontology-driven method with attribution-based biological pathway enrichment. Applying our framework to two well-known single-cell RNA-seq models from the literature, we interpret concepts extracted by Top-K Sparse Auto-Encoders trained on two immune cell datasets. With a domain expert in immunology, we show that concepts improve interpretability compared to individual neurons while preserving the richness and informativeness of the latent representations. This work provides a principled framework for interpreting what biological knowledge foundation models have encoded, paving the way for their use for hypothesis generation and discovery.",

Our method achieves excellent performance on benchmark datasets in terms of batch correction, modality alignment, and biological signal preservation.

While there are a few commonly used visualization tools for genomics data, many tools target specific use cases for genomics data interpretation and offer only a limited, predefined set of visualization types. Moreover, static visualizations often fail to support exploratory analysis. Developing interactive visualizations and tools typically requires significant time and technical expertise, even when supported by modern LLM-powered coding assistants, and the resulting visualizations can be difficult to share among collaborators. We developed Gosling Designer, an all-in-one platform for editing, exploring, and sharing visualizations of genomics data.

    "abstract": "Background: Patients carrying MEF2C haploinsufficiency develop a recognizable neurodevelopmental syndrome featuring intellectual disability, treatment-resistant seizures, and autism spectrum behaviors. While MEF2C's critical roles in cardiac development and neuronal function are well-established, its specific transcriptional operations within microglia (the brain's resident immune cells) have remained surprisingly undefined. This knowledge gap is particularly notable given that MEF2C syndrome patients consistently present with neurological symptoms while cardiac abnormalities are rarely observed.   Results: We used human iPSC-derived microglia with MEF2C knockout to perform integrated ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analyses. Our data demonstrate that MEF2C directly binds 1,258 genomic loci and regulates 755 differentially expressed genes (FDR < 0.05). Integration identified 69 high-confidence direct targets with statistically significant overlap (p = 8.87 x 10^-5). The most dramatic changes included ADAMDEC1, a microglia-enriched metalloprotease for extracellular matrix remodeling (log2FC = -4.76, adj. p = 3.30 x 10^-19), and CARD11, an NF-kappaB signaling component (log2FC = -5.16, adj. p = 5.95 x 10^-5). Pathway analysis revealed profound disruption of Fc-gamma receptor signaling (p = 3.11 x 10^-7), alongside widespread changes in immune response and synaptic organization pathways.   Conclusion: These findings establish MEF2C as a master transcriptional regulator coordinating both immune effector functions and synaptic interaction programs in microglia. The observed changes, particularly in Fc receptor signaling critical for synaptic pruning, likely underlie the neurological manifestations of MEF2C syndrome.

The algorithm parallelizes the most computationally intensive phases (Best Hit detection and Bidirectional Best Hit extraction) through data decomposition and a thread pool strategy, while employing lightweight data structures to reduce memory usage. Benchmarks on synthetic datasets show that PanDelos-plus achieves up to 14x faster execution and reduces memory usage by up to 96%, while maintaining accuracy. These improvements enable population-scale comparative genomics to be performed on standard multicore workstations, making large-scale bacterial pangenome analysis accessible for routine use in everyday research.",

    "abstract": "Arsenic (As), a widespread environmental toxin, poses major health risks due to its inorganic forms (iAs), which are linked to cancer, cardiovascular disease, and endocrine disruption. Although its toxic effects have been extensively studied, the molecular mechanisms underlying arsenic-induced perturbations remain incompletely understood. This complexity arises from its ability to reprogram epigenetic landscapes, alter gene expression, and disrupt metabolic balance through interconnected regulatory networks. Existing studies often analyze epigenomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic datasets independently, overlooking their interdependence. Here, we present a coupled matrix factorization (CMF) framework based on the PARAFAC2-AOADMM model for joint integration of DNA methylation (RRBS), RNA-seq, and metabolomics data from mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and epiblast-like cells (EpiLCs) exposed to arsenic. By jointly decomposing multi-omics matrices, our approach identifies shared and dataset-specific components that capture coordinated molecular responses to arsenic exposure. This integrative methodology demonstrates the potential of CMF-based models in computational toxicology and offers a generalizable framework for dissecting complex multi-layered biological perturbations.",

    "abstract": "Motivation: Standard genome-wide association studies in cancer genomics rely on statistical significance with multiple testing correction, but systematically fail in underpowered cohorts. In TCGA breast cancer (n=967, 133 deaths), low event rates (13.8%) create severe power limitations, producing false negatives for known drivers and false positives for large passenger genes. Results: We developed a five-criteria computational framework integrating causal inference (inverse probability weighting, doubly robust estimation) with orthogonal biological validation (expression, mutation patterns, literature evidence). Applied to TCGA-BRCA mortality analysis, standard Cox+FDR detected zero genes at FDR<0.05, confirming complete failure in underpowered settings. Our framework correctly identified RYR2 -- a cardiac gene with no cancer function -- as a false positive despite nominal significance (p=0.024), while identifying KMT2C as a complex candidate requiring validation despite marginal significance (p=0.047, q=0.954). Power analysis revealed median power of 15.1% across genes, with KMT2C achieving only 29.8% power (HR=1.55), explaining borderline statistical significance despite strong biological evidence. The framework distinguished true signals from artifacts through mutation pattern analysis: RYR2 showed 29.8% silent mutations (passenger signature) with no hotspots, while KMT2C showed 6.7% silent mutations with 31.4% truncating variants (driver signature). This multi-evidence approach provides a template for analyzing underpowered cohorts, prioritizing biological interpretability over purely statistical significance.

    "abstract": "Cancer exhibits diverse and complex phenotypes driven by multifaceted molecular interactions. Recent biomedical research has emphasized the comprehensive study of such diseases by integrating multi-omics datasets (genome, proteome, transcriptome, epigenome). This approach provides an efficient method for identifying genetic variants associated with cancer and offers a deeper understanding of how the disease develops and spreads. However, it is challenging to comprehend complex interactions among the features of multi-omics datasets compared to single omics. In this paper, we analyze lung cancer multi-omics datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Using four statistical methods, LIMMA, the T test, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), and the Wilcoxon test, we identified differentially expressed genes across gene expression, DNA methylation, and miRNA expression data. We then integrated these multi-omics data using the Kernel Machine Regression (KMR) approach. Our findings reveal significant interactions among the three omics: gene expression, miRNA expression, and DNA methylation in lung cancer. From our data analysis, we identified 38 genes significantly associated with lung cancer. From our data analysis, we identified 38 genes significantly associated with lung cancer. Among these, eight genes of highest ranking (PDGFRB, PDGFRA, SNAI1, ID1, FGF11, TNXB, ITGB1, ZIC1) were highlighted by rigorous statistical analysis. Furthermore, in silico studies identified three top-ranked potential candidate drugs (Selinexor, Orapred, and Capmatinib) that could play a crucial role in the treatment of lung cancer. These proposed drugs are also supported by the findings of other independent studies, which underscore their potential efficacy in the fight against lung cancer.",

    "abstract": "Nanopore sequencing enables real-time long-read DNA sequencing with reads exceeding 10 kilobases, but inherent error rates of 12-15 percent present significant computational challenges for read alignment. The critical seed chaining step must connect exact k-mer matches between reads and reference genomes while filtering spurious matches, yet state-of-the-art methods rely on fixed gap penalty functions unable to adapt to varying genomic contexts including tandem repeats and structural variants. This paper presents RawHash3, a hybrid framework combining graph neural networks with classical dynamic programming for adaptive seed chaining that maintains real-time performance while providing statistical guarantees. We formalize seed chaining as graph learning where seeds constitute nodes with 12-dimensional feature vectors and edges encode 8-dimensional spatial relationships including gap consistency. Our architecture employs three-layer EdgeConv GNN with confidence-based method selection that dynamically switches between learned guidance and algorithmic fallback. Comprehensive evaluation on 1,000 synthetic nanopore reads with 5,200 test seeds demonstrates RawHash3 achieves 99.94 percent precision and 40.07 percent recall, representing statistically significant 25.0 percent relative improvement over baseline with p less than 0.001. The system maintains median inference latency of 1.59ms meeting real-time constraints, while demonstrating superior robustness with 100 percent success rate under 20 percent label corruption versus baseline degradation to 30.3 percent. Cross-validation confirms stability establishing graph neural networks as viable approach for production genomics pipelines.",

No existing simulator jointly models gene-gene and cell-cell interactions. We introduce qSimCells, a novel quantum computing-based simulator that employs entanglement to model intra- and inter-cellular interactions, generating realistic single-cell transcriptomes with cellular heterogeneity. The core innovation is a quantum kernel that uses a parameterized quantum circuit with CNOT gates to encode complex, nonlinear gene regulatory network (GRN) as well as cell-cell communication topologies with explicit causal directionality. The resulting synthetic data exhibits non-classical dependencies: standard correlation-based analyses (Pearson and Spearman) fail to recover the programmed causal pathways and instead report spurious associations driven by high baseline gene-expression probabilities. Furthermore, applying cell-cell communication detection to the simulated data validates the true mechanistic links, revealing a robust, up to 75-fold relative increase in inferred communication probability only when quantum entanglement is active. These results demonstrate that the quantum kernel is essential for producing high-fidelity ground-truth datasets and highlight the need for advanced inference techniques to capture the complex, non-classical dependencies inherent in gene regulation.",

Hence, researchers require a standardized benchmark to evaluate DNA Language Models (DNA LMs) capabilities. However, evaluating DNA LMs is a complex task that intersects genomic's domain-specific challenges and machine learning methodologies, where seemingly minor implementation details can significantly compromise benchmark validity. We demonstrate this through BEND (Benchmarking DNA Language Models), where hardware-dependent hyperparameters -- number of data loading workers and buffer sizes -- create spurious performance variations of up to 4% for identical models. The problem stems from inadequate data shuffling interacting with domain specific data characteristics. Experiments with three DNA language models (HyenaDNA, DNABERT-2, ResNet-LM) show these artifacts affect both absolute performance and relative model rankings. We propose a simple solution: pre-shuffling data before storage eliminates hardware dependencies while maintaining efficiency. This work highlights how standard ML practices can interact unexpectedly with domain-specific data characteristics, with broader implications for benchmark design in specialized domains.",

While previous studies have built aging clocks using single-omics data, they often fail to capture the full molecular complexity of human aging. In this work, we leveraged the Human Phenotype Project, a large-scale cohort of 10,000 adults aged 40-70 years, with extensive longitudinal profiling that includes clinical, behavioral, environmental, and multi-omics datasets spanning transcriptomics, lipidomics, metabolomics, and the microbiome. By employing advanced machine learning frameworks capable of modeling nonlinear biological dynamics, we developed and rigorously validated a multi-omics aging clock that robustly predicts diverse health outcomes and future disease risk. Unsupervised clustering of the integrated molecular profiles from multi-omics uncovered distinct biological subtypes of aging, revealing striking heterogeneity in aging trajectories and pinpointing pathway-specific alterations associated with different aging patterns. These findings demonstrate the power of multi-omics integration to decode the molecular landscape of aging and lay the groundwork for personalized healthspan monitoring and precision strategies to prevent age-related diseases.",

Organellar genomes are simpler, smaller, have higher abundance than their nuclear counterparts and contain valuable phylogenetic information, but are yet to be widely used to identify new protist lineages from metagenomes. Here we present \"ChloroScan\", a new bioinformatics pipeline to extract eukaryotic plastid genomes from metagenomes. It incorporates a deep learning contig classifier to identify putative plastid contigs and an automated binning module to recover bins with guidance from a curated marker gene database. Additionally, ChloroScan summarizes the results in different user-friendly formats, including annotated coding sequences and proteins for each bin. We show that ChloroScan recovers more high-quality plastid bins than MetaBAT2 for simulated metagenomes. The practical utility of ChloroScan is illustrated by recovering 16 medium to high-quality metagenome assembled genomes from four protist-size fractioned metagenomes, with several bins showing high taxonomic novelty.",

    "abstract": "Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) datasets are fundamental to genetic studies but pose significant privacy risks when shared. The correlation of SNPs with each other makes strong adversarial attacks such as masked-value reconstruction, kin, and membership inference attacks possible. Existing privacy-preserving approaches either apply differential privacy to statistical summaries of these datasets or offer complex methods that require post-processing and the usage of a publicly available dataset to suppress or selectively share SNPs.   In this study, we introduce an innovative framework for generating synthetic SNP sequence datasets using samples derived from time-inhomogeneous hidden Markov models (TIHMMs). To preserve the privacy of the training data, we ensure that each SNP sequence contributes only a bounded influence during training, enabling strong differential privacy guarantees. Crucially, by operating on full SNP sequences and bounding their gradient contributions, our method directly addresses the privacy risks introduced by their inherent correlations.   Through experiments conducted on the real-world 1000 Genomes dataset, we demonstrate the efficacy of our method using privacy budgets of $\\varepsilon \\in [1, 10]$ at $δ=10^{-4}$. Notably, by allowing the transition models of the HMM to be dependent on the location in the sequence, we significantly enhance performance, enabling the synthetic datasets to closely replicate the statistical properties of non-private datasets. This framework facilitates the private sharing of genomic data while offering researchers exceptional flexibility and utility.",

    "abstract": "Identifying cancer driver genes (CDGs) is essential for understanding cancer mechanisms and developing targeted therapies. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have recently been employed to identify CDGs by capturing patterns in biological interaction networks. However, most GNN-based approaches rely on a single protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, ignoring complementary information from other biological networks. Some studies integrate multiple networks by aligning features with consistency constraints to learn unified gene representations for CDG identification. However, such representation-level fusion often assumes congruent gene relationships across networks, which may overlook network heterogeneity and introduce conflicting information. To address this, we propose Soft-Evidence Fusion Graph Neural Network (SEFGNN), a novel framework for CDG identification across multiple networks at the decision level. Instead of enforcing feature-level consistency, SEFGNN treats each biological network as an independent evidence source and performs uncertainty-aware fusion at the decision level using Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST). To alleviate the risk of overconfidence from DST, we further introduce a Soft Evidence Smoothing (SES) module that improves ranking stability while preserving discriminative performance. Experiments on three cancer datasets show that SEFGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and exhibits strong potential in discovering novel CDGs.",

    "abstract": "Nanopore sequencing technologies continue to advance rapidly, offering critical benefits such as real-time analysis, the ability to sequence extremely long DNA fragments (up to millions of bases in a single read), and the option to selectively stop sequencing a molecule before completion. Traditionally, the raw electrical signals generated during sequencing are converted into DNA sequences through a process called basecalling, which typically relies on large neural network models. Raw signal analysis has emerged as a promising alternative to these resource-intensive approaches. While attempts have been made to benchmark conventional basecalling methods, existing evaluation frameworks 1) overlook raw signal analysis techniques, 2) lack the flexibility to accommodate new raw signal analysis tools easily, and 3) fail to include the latest improvements in nanopore datasets. Our goal is to provide an extensible benchmarking framework that enables designing and comparing new methods for raw signal analysis. To this end, we introduce RawBench, the first flexible framework for evaluating raw nanopore signal analysis techniques. RawBench provides modular evaluation of three core pipeline components: 1) reference genome encoding (using different pore models), 2) signal encoding (through various segmentation methods), and 3) representation matching (via different data structures). We extensively evaluate raw signal analysis techniques in terms of 1) quality and performance for read mapping, 2) quality and performance for read classification, and 3) quality of raw signal analysis-assisted basecalling. Our evaluations show that raw signal analysis can achieve competitive quality while significantly reducing resource requirements, particularly in settings where real-time processing or edge deployment is necessary.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning, particularly with the advancement of Large Language Models, has transformed biomolecular modeling, with protein advances (e.g., ESM) inspiring emerging RNA language models such as RiNALMo. Yet how and what these RNA Language Models internally encode about messenger RNA (mRNA) or non-coding RNA (ncRNA) families remains unclear. We present SAE- RNA, interpretability model that analyzes RiNALMo representations and maps them to known human-level biological features. Our work frames RNA interpretability as concept discovery in pretrained embeddings, without end-to-end retraining, and provides practical tools to probe what RNA LMs may encode about ncRNA families. The model can be extended to close comparisons between RNA groups, and supporting hypothesis generation about previously unrecognized relationships.",

    "title": "Predicting cell-specific gene expression profile and knockout impact through deep learning",
    "abstract": "Gene expression data is essential for understanding how genes are regulated and interact within biological systems, providing insights into disease pathways and potential therapeutic targets. Gene knockout has proven to be a fundamental technique in molecular biology, allowing the investigation of the function of specific genes in an organism, as well as in specific cell types. However, gene expression patterns are quite heterogeneous in single-cell transcriptional data from a uniform environment, representing different cell states, which produce cell-type and cell-specific gene knockout impacts. A computational method that can predict the single-cell resolution knockout impact is still lacking. Here, we present a data-driven framework for learning the mapping between gene expression profiles derived from gene assemblages, enabling the accurate prediction of perturbed expression profiles following knockout (KO) for any cell, without relying on prior perturbed data. We systematically validated our framework using synthetic data generated from gene regulatory dynamics models, two mouse knockout single-cell datasets, and high-throughput in vitro CRISPRi Perturb-seq data. Our results demonstrate that the framework can accurately predict both expression profiles and KO effects at the single-cell level. Our approach provides a generalizable tool for inferring gene function at single-cell resolution, offering new opportunities to study genetic perturbations in contexts where large-scale experimental screens are infeasible.",

    "abstract": "Medulloblastoma is a malignant pediatric brain cancer, and the discovery of molecular subgroups is enabling personalized treatment strategies. In 2019, a consensus identified eight novel subtypes within Groups 3 and 4, each displaying heterogeneous characteristics. Classifiers are essential for translating these findings into clinical practice by supporting clinical trials, personalized therapy development and application, and patient monitoring. This study presents a DNA methylation-based, cross-platform machine learning classifier capable of distinguishing these subtypes on both HM450 and EPIC methylation array samples. Across two independent test sets, the model achieved weighted F1 = 0.95 and balanced accuracy = 0.957, consistent across platforms. As the first cross-platform solution, it provides backward compatibility while extending applicability to a newer platform, also enhancing accessibility. It also has the potential to become the first publicly available classifier for these subtypes once deployed through a web application, as planned in the future. This work overall takes steps in the direction of advancing precision medicine and improving clinical outcomes for patients within the majority prevalence medulloblastoma subgroups, groups 3 and 4.",

    "abstract": "Background. Preeclampsia (PE) complicates 2-8% of pregnancies and is marked by placental hypoxia and HIF-pathway activation, especially in early-onset PE (eoPE). Integrating patient tissue analyses with experimental models may reveal common molecular markers of trophoblast hypoxia.   Methods. We analyzed scRNA-seq data from 10 eoPE, 7 late-onset PE (loPE), and corresponding control placentas, identifying villous cytotrophoblast (VCT), syncytiotrophoblast (SCT), and extravillous trophoblast (EVT) subpopulations. BeWo b30 cells were treated for 24 h with CoCl2 (300 $μ$M) or an oxyquinoline derivative (OD, 5 $μ$M) to induce hypoxia. RNA and small RNA sequencing quantified mRNA and microRNA changes. PROGENy inferred pathway activities.   Results. ScRNA-seq revealed highest hypoxia pathway activation in eoPE, with EVT showing maximum activity among trophoblast populations. Nine genes were upregulated across all trophoblast types in eoPE: EBI3, CST6, FN1, RFK, COL17A1, LDHA, PKP2, RPS4Y1, and RPS26. In vitro, OD induced more specific hypoxia responses than CoCl2, with 1,284 versus 3,032 differentially expressed genes respectively. Critically, EBI3, FN1, and COL17A1 showed concordant upregulation in both placental tissue and OD-treated cells, while CoCl2 treatment produced opposite expression patterns. MicroRNA analysis identified hsa-miR-27a-5p and hsa-miR-193b-5p as consistently elevated in both experimental conditions and previously reported in PE placental vesicles. We also identified isoforms of hsa-miR-9-5p and hsa-miR-92b-3p as hypoxia-associated in trophoblast.   Conclusions. EBI3, COL17A1, hsa-miR-27a-5p, and hsa-miR-193b-5p emerge as trophoblast hypoxia markers in PE. Oxyquinoline derivatives offer a more physiologically relevant in vitro hypoxia model than CoCl2. This integrated approach advances understanding of PE pathophysiology and suggests candidate therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "Epilepsy is a chronic neurological condition characterized by recurrent seizures, with global prevalence estimated at 50 million people worldwide. While progress in high-throughput sequencing has allowed for broad-based transcriptomic profiling of brain tissues, the deciphering of these highly complex datasets remains one of the challenges. To address this issue, in this paper we propose a new analysis pipeline that integrates the power of deep learning strategies with GPU-acceleration computation for investigating Gene expression patterns in epilepsy. Specifically, our proposed approach employs GPT-2 XL, a transformer-based Large Language Model (LLM) with 1.5 billion parameters for genomic sequence analysis over the latest NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs based on Hopper architecture. Our proposed method enables efficient preprocessing of RNA sequence data, gene sequence encoding, and subsequent pattern identification. We conducted experiments on two epilepsy datasets including GEO accession GSE264537 and GSE275235. The obtained results reveal several significant transcriptomic modifications, including reduced hippocampal astrogliosis after ketogenic diet treatment as well as restored excitatory-inhibitory signaling equilibrium in zebrafish epilepsy model. Moreover, our results highlight the effectiveness of leveraging LLMs in combination with advanced hardware acceleration for transcriptomic characterization in neurological diseases.",

    "abstract": "Genetic nurture effects and assortative mating (AM) occur across many human behaviors and can bias estimates from traditional genetic models. These influences are typically studied univariately, within the same trait. However, estimation of cross-trait genetic nurture effects and cross-trait AM remains underexplored due to the absence of suitable approaches. To address this, we developed a multivariate extension of the SEM-PGS model for datasets with genotyped and phenotyped parents and offspring, enabling joint estimation of within-trait and cross-trait genetic and environmental influences. By integrating haplotypic polygenic scores (PGS) into a structural equation modeling framework, the model simultaneously estimates same-trait and cross-trait direct effects, genetic nurture, vertical transmission, and assortative mating. We also provide the first formal description of how copaths can be used to model multivariate assortative mating and derive the corresponding parameter expectations in matrix form. Forward-time Monte Carlo simulations under varying conditions of r^2_PGS and N_trio demonstrate that the model yields unbiased estimates of both within-trait and cross-trait effects when assumptions are met. The precision of estimates was adequate with large sample sizes (N_trio > 16k) and improved as PGS predictive power increased. In addition, our simulation results show that failing to model cross-trait effects biases within-trait estimates, underscoring the importance of incorporating cross-trait effects. The multivariate SEM-PGS model offers a powerful and flexible tool for disentangling gene-environment interplay and advancing the understanding of familial influences on human traits.",

    "abstract": "Background: Large foundation models have revolutionized single-cell analysis, yet no kidney-specific model currently exists, and it remains unclear whether organ-focused models can outperform generalized models. The kidney's complex cellular architecture further complicate integration of large-scale omics data, where current frameworks trained on limited datasets struggle to correct batch effects, capture cross-modality variation, and generalize across species. Methods: We developed Nephrobase Cell+, the first kidney-focused large foundation model, pretrained on ~100 billion tokens from ~39.5 million single-cell and single-nucleus profiles across 4,319 samples. Nephrobase Cell+ uses a transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture with gene-token cross-attention and a mixture-of-experts module for scalable representation learning. Results: Nephrobase Cell+ sets a new benchmark for kidney single-cell analysis. It produces tightly clustered, biologically coherent embeddings in human and mouse kidneys, far surpassing previous foundation models such as Geneformer, scGPT, and UCE, as well as traditional methods such as PCA and autoencoders. It achieves the highest cluster concordance and batch-mixing scores, effectively removing donor/assay batch effects while preserving cell-type structure. Cross-species evaluation shows superior alignment of homologous cell types and >90% zero-shot annotation accuracy for major kidney lineages in both human and mouse. Even its 1B-parameter and 500M variants consistently outperform all existing models. Conclusions: Nephrobase Cell+ delivers a unified, high-fidelity representation of kidney biology that is robust, cross-species transferable, and unmatched by current single-cell foundation models, offering a powerful resource for kidney genomics and disease research.",

    "abstract": "Distinguishing the rare \"driver\" mutations that fuel cancer progression from the vast background of \"passenger\" mutations in the non-coding genome is a fundamental challenge in cancer biology. A primary mechanism that non-coding driver mutations contribute to cancer is by affecting gene expression, potentially from millions of nucleotides away. However, existing predictors of gene expression from mutations are unable to simultaneously handle interactions spanning millions of base pairs, the extreme sparsity of somatic mutations, and generalize to unseen genes. To overcome these limitations, we introduce GenVarFormer (GVF), a novel transformer-based architecture designed to learn mutation representations and their impact on gene expression. GVF efficiently predicts the effect of mutations up to 8 million base pairs away from a gene by only considering mutations and their local DNA context, while omitting the vast intermediate sequence. Using data from 864 breast cancer samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we demonstrate that GVF predicts gene expression with 26-fold higher correlation across samples than current models. In addition, GVF is the first model of its kind to generalize to unseen genes and samples simultaneously. Finally, we find that GVF patient embeddings are more informative than ground-truth gene expression for predicting overall patient survival in the most prevalent breast cancer subtype, luminal A. GVF embeddings and gene expression yielded concordance indices of $0.706^{\\pm0.136}$ and $0.573^{\\pm0.234}$, respectively. Our work establishes a new state-of-the-art for modeling the functional impact of non-coding mutations in cancer and provides a powerful new tool for identifying potential driver events and prognostic biomarkers.",

Across multiple multi-species datasets, it outperforms Euclidean baselines on 9 out of 10 tasks involving property prediction, with 10% improvement on average, and excels in out-of-distribution generalization to long and low-GC content sequences; for antibody region annotation, it surpasses hierarchy-aware Euclidean models by 3% in annotation accuracy.

We take a sequence-only route and fine-tune DNABERT-2, a transformer genomic language model that uses byte-pair encoding to learn variable-length tokens from DNA. Using assays curated via the Johnston Cancer Research Centre at Queen's University Belfast, we assembled a balanced corpus of 2.34 million 1 kb enhancer sequences, applied summit-centered extraction and rigorous de-duplication including reverse-complement collapse, and split the data stratified by class. With a 4096-term vocabulary and a 232-token context chosen empirically, the DNABERT-2-117M classifier was trained with Optuna-tuned hyperparameters and evaluated on 350742 held-out sequences. The model reached PR-AUC 0.759, ROC-AUC 0.743, and best F1 0.704 at an optimized threshold (0.359), with recall 0.835 and precision 0.609. Against a CNN-based EnhancerNet trained on the same data, DNABERT-2 delivered stronger threshold-independent ranking and higher recall, although point accuracy was lower. To our knowledge, this is the first study to apply a second-generation genomic language model with BPE tokenization to enhancer classification in colorectal cancer, demonstrating the feasibility of capturing tumor-associated regulatory signals directly from DNA sequence alone. Overall, our results show that transformer-based genomic models can move beyond motif-level encodings toward holistic classification of regulatory elements, offering a novel path for cancer genomics. Next steps will focus on improving precision, exploring hybrid CNN-transformer designs, and validating across independent datasets to strengthen real-world utility.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) is a rapidly escalating global health crisis. While genomic sequencing enables rapid prediction of resistance phenotypes, current computational methods have limitations. Standard machine learning models treat the genome as an unordered collection of features, ignoring the sequential context of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs). State-of-the-art sequence models like Transformers are often too data-hungry and computationally expensive for the moderately-sized datasets that are typical in this domain. To address these challenges, we propose AMR-EnsembleNet, an ensemble framework that synergistically combines sequence-based and feature-based learning. We developed a lightweight, custom 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to efficiently learn predictive sequence motifs from high-dimensional SNP data. This sequence-aware model was ensembled with an XGBoost model, a powerful gradient boosting system adept at capturing complex, non-local feature interactions. We trained and evaluated our framework on a benchmark dataset of 809 E. coli strains, predicting resistance across four antibiotics with varying class imbalance. Our 1D CNN-XGBoost ensemble consistently achieved top-tier performance across all the antibiotics, reaching a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.926 for Ciprofloxacin (CIP) and the highest Macro F1-score of 0.691 for the challenging Gentamicin (GEN) AMR prediction. We also show that our model consistently focuses on SNPs within well-known AMR genes like fusA and parC, confirming it learns the correct genetic signals for resistance. Our work demonstrates that fusing a sequence-aware 1D CNN with a feature-based XGBoost model creates a powerful ensemble, overcoming the limitations of using either an order-agnostic or a standalone sequence model.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong ability in generating rich representations across domains such as natural language processing and generation, computer vision, and multimodal learning. However, their application in biomedical data analysis remains nascent. Single-cell transcriptomic profiling is essential for dissecting cell subtype diversity in development and disease, but rare subtypes pose challenges for scaling laws. We present a computational framework that integrates single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) with LLMs to derive knowledge-informed gene embeddings. Highly expressed genes for each cell are mapped to NCBI Gene descriptions and embedded using models such as text-embedding-ada-002, BioBERT, and SciBERT. Applied to retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), which differ in vulnerability to glaucoma-related neurodegeneration, this strategy improves subtype classification, highlights biologically significant features, and reveals pathways underlying selective neuronal vulnerability. More broadly, it illustrates how LLM-derived embeddings can augment biological analysis under data-limited conditions and lay the groundwork for future foundation models in single-cell biology.",

They remain challenging to detect even with long sequence reads, and the sources of these difficulties are not well quantified.   Results: We identified 35.4 Mb of low-complexity regions (LCRs) in GRCh38. Although these regions cover only 1.2% of the genome, they contain 69.1% of confident SVs in sample HG002. Across long-read SV callers, 77.3-91.3% of erroneous SV calls occur within LCRs, with error rates increasing with LCR length.   Conclusion: SVs are enriched and difficult to call in LCRs. Special care need to be taken for calling and analyzing these variants.",

    "abstract": "Polygenic risk scores can be used to model the individual genetic liability for human traits. Current methods primarily focus on modeling the mean of a phenotype neglecting the variance. However, genetic variants associated with phenotypic variance can provide important insights to gene-environment interaction studies. To overcome this, we propose snpboostlss, a cyclical gradient boosting algorithm for a Gaussian location-scale model to jointly derive sparse polygenic models for both the mean and the variance of a quantitative phenotype. To improve computational efficiency on high-dimensional and large-scale genotype data (large n and large p), we only consider a batch of most relevant variants in each boosting step. We investigate the effect of statins therapy (the environmental factor) on low-density lipoprotein in the UK Biobank cohort using the new snpboostlss algorithm. We are able to verify the interaction between statins usage and the polygenic risk scores for phenotypic variance in both cross sectional and longitudinal analyses. Particularly, following the spirit of target trial emulation, we observe that the treatment effect of statins is more substantial in people with higher polygenic risk scores for phenotypic variance, indicating gene-environment interaction. When applying to body mass index, the newly constructed polygenic risk scores for variance show significant interaction with physical activity and sedentary behavior. Therefore, the polygenic risk scores for phenotypic variance derived by snpboostlss have potential to identify individuals that could benefit more from environmental changes (e.g. medical intervention and lifestyle changes).",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in large language model (LLM) embeddings have enabled powerful representations for biological data, but most applications to date focus only on gene-level information. We present one of the first systematic frameworks to generate variant-level embeddings across the entire human genome. Using curated annotations from FAVOR, ClinVar, and the GWAS Catalog, we constructed semantic text descriptions for 8.9 billion possible variants and generated embeddings at three scales: 1.5 million HapMap3+MEGA variants, ~90 million imputed UK Biobank variants, and ~9 billion all possible variants. Embeddings were produced with both OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large and the open-source Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B models. Baseline experiments demonstrate high predictive accuracy for variant properties, validating the embeddings as structured representations of genomic variation. We outline two downstream applications: embedding-informed hypothesis testing by extending the Frequentist And Bayesian framework to genome-wide association studies, and embedding-augmented genetic risk prediction that enhances standard polygenic risk scores. These resources, publicly available on Hugging Face, provide a foundation for advancing large-scale genomic discovery and precision medicine.",

However, state-of-the-art DNA language models frequently fail to capture this symmetry, producing inconsistent predictions for a sequence and its RC counterpart, which undermines their reliability. In this work, we introduce Reverse-Complement Consistency Regularization (RCCR), a simple and model-agnostic fine-tuning objective that directly penalizes the divergence between a model's prediction on a sequence and the aligned prediction on its reverse complement. We evaluate RCCR across three diverse backbones (Nucleotide Transformer, HyenaDNA, DNABERT-2) on a wide range of genomic tasks, including sequence classification, scalar regression, and profile prediction. Our experiments show that RCCR substantially improves RC robustness by dramatically reducing prediction flips and errors, all while maintaining or improving task accuracy compared to baselines such as RC data augmentation and test-time averaging. By integrating a key biological prior directly into the learning process, RCCR produces a single, intrinsically robust, and computationally efficient model fine-tuning recipe for diverse biology tasks.",

    "abstract": "DNA language models have revolutionized our ability to understand and design DNA sequences--the fundamental language of life--with unprecedented precision, enabling transformative applications in therapeutics, synthetic biology, and gene editing. However, this capability also poses substantial dual-use risks, including the potential for creating pathogens, viruses, and even bioweapons. To address these biosecurity challenges, we introduce two innovative watermarking techniques to reliably track the designed DNA: DNAMark and CentralMark. DNAMark employs synonymous codon substitutions to embed watermarks in DNA sequences while preserving the original function. CentralMark further advances this by creating inheritable watermarks that transfer from DNA to translated proteins, leveraging protein embeddings to ensure detection across the central dogma. Both methods utilize semantic embeddings to generate watermark logits, enhancing robustness against natural mutations, synthesis errors, and adversarial attacks. Evaluated on our therapeutic DNA benchmark, DNAMark and CentralMark achieve F1 detection scores above 0.85 under various conditions, while maintaining over 60% sequence similarity to ground truth and degeneracy scores below 15%. A case study on the CRISPR-Cas9 system underscores CentralMark's utility in real-world settings. This work establishes a vital framework for securing DNA language models, balancing innovation with accountability to mitigate biosecurity risks.",

As genomic resources and publicly available siRNA datasets continue to grow, data-driven models can be leveraged to better understand siRNA-mRNA interactions. To fully exploit such data, curating high-quality siRNA datasets is essential to minimize experimental errors and noise. We propose siDPT: siRNA efficacy Prediction via Debiased Preference-Pair Transformer, a framework that constructs a preference-pair dataset and designs an siRNA-mRNA interactive transformer with debiased ranking objectives to improve siRNA inhibition prediction and generalization.

We present PhenoGnet, a novel graph-based contrastive learning framework designed to predict disease similarity by integrating gene functional interaction networks with the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO). PhenoGnet comprises two key components: an intra-view model that separately encodes gene and phenotype graphs using Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and Graph Attention Networks (GATs), and a cross view model implemented as a shared weight multilayer perceptron (MLP) that aligns gene and phenotype embeddings through contrastive learning. The model is trained using known gene phenotype associations as positive pairs and randomly sampled unrelated pairs as negatives. Diseases are represented by the mean embeddings of their associated genes and/or phenotypes, and pairwise similarity is computed via cosine similarity. Evaluation on a curated benchmark of 1,100 similar and 866 dissimilar disease pairs demonstrates strong performance, with gene based embeddings achieving an AUCPR of 0.9012 and AUROC of 0.8764, outperforming existing state of the art methods. Notably, PhenoGnet captures latent biological relationships beyond direct overlap, offering a scalable and interpretable solution for disease similarity prediction.

However, existing in silico PCR tools have impractical running time for analyses of this scale. In this paper we introduce AmpliconHunter, a highly scalable in silico PCR package distributed as open-source command-line tool and publicly available through a user-friendly web interface at https://ah1.engr.uconn.edu/. AmpliconHunter implements an accurate nearest-neighbor model for melting temperature calculations, allowing for primer-template hybridization with mismatches, along with three complementary methods for estimating off-target amplification. By taking advantage of multi-core parallelism and SIMD operations available on modern CPUs, the AmpliconHunter web server can complete in silico PCR analyses of commonly used degenerate primer pairs against the 2.4M genomes in the latest AllTheBacteria collection in as few as 6-7 hours.",

    "abstract": "TRPM4 is overexpressed in prostate cancer (PCa) associated with metastasis or recurrence. There is paucity of information pertaining to TRPM4 characterization and functions at single-cell level in PCa. This study introduces the CEP-IP framework, a novel explainable machine learning approach for the identification of biologically relevant cell subpopulations in single-cell transcriptomics of pairwise genes. The framework combines cell explanatory power (CEP) classification with inflection point (IP) analysis to assign model performance into individual cells, while stratifying transcriptional space into distinct regions. To demonstrate the CEP-IP framework, generalized additive model (GAM) was applied to model relationships between TRPM4 and co-expressed genes in aggressive PCa and benign prostate cells from scRNA-seq data. Genes were identified using Spearman-Kendall dual-filter. Seven ribosomal genes (RPL10, RPL27, RPL28, RPS2, RPS8, RPS12, RPS26; averaged as Ribo gene set) passed dual-filtering specifically in PCa cells. TRPM4-Ribo modeling outperformed alternative cancer gene sets (deviance explained FDR<0.05). The CEP-IP framework identified top-ranked explanatory power (TREP) cells and stratified them using IP analysis into pre-IP and post-IP regions, creating four distinct cell subpopulations per patient. Gene Ontology analysis revealed pre-IP TREP cells enriched for immune-related processes, while post-IP TREP cells enriched for ribosomal, translation, and cell adhesion pathways. In conclusion, the explainable CEP-IP framework allows for the identification of cancer cell subpopulations with distinctive biology and therapeutic implications, applicable to any pairwise gene analysis.",

    "abstract": "We introduce Genome-Factory, an integrated Python library for tuning, deploying, and interpreting genomic models. Our core contribution is to simplify and unify the workflow for genomic model development: data collection, model tuning, inference, benchmarking, and interpretability. For data collection, Genome-Factory offers an automated pipeline to download genomic sequences and preprocess them. It also includes quality control, such as GC content normalization. For model tuning, Genome-Factory supports three approaches: full-parameter, low-rank adaptation, and adapter-based fine-tuning. It is compatible with a wide range of genomic models. For inference, Genome-Factory enables both embedding extraction and DNA sequence generation. For benchmarking, we include two existing benchmarks and provide a flexible interface for users to incorporate additional benchmarks. For interpretability, Genome-Factory introduces the first open-source biological interpreter based on a sparse auto-encoder. This module disentangles embeddings into sparse, near-monosemantic latent units and links them to interpretable genomic features by regressing on external readouts. To improve accessibility, Genome-Factory features both a zero-code command-line interface and a user-friendly web interface. We validate the utility of Genome-Factory across three dimensions: (i) Compatibility with diverse models and fine-tuning methods; (ii) Benchmarking downstream performance using two open-source benchmarks; (iii) Biological interpretation of learned representations with DNABERT-2. These results highlight its end-to-end usability and practical value for real-world genomic analysis.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a unified framework for evaluating dimensionality reduction techniques in spatial transcriptomics beyond standard PCA approaches. We benchmark six methods PCA, NMF, autoencoder, VAE, and two hybrid embeddings on a cholangiocarcinoma Xenium dataset, systematically varying latent dimensions ($k$=5-40) and clustering resolutions ($ρ$=0.1-1.2). Each configuration is evaluated using complementary metrics including reconstruction error, explained variance, cluster cohesion, and two novel biologically-motivated measures: Cluster Marker Coherence (CMC) and Marker Exclusion Rate (MER). Our results demonstrate distinct performance profiles: PCA provides a fast baseline, NMF maximizes marker enrichment, VAE balances reconstruction and interpretability, while autoencoders occupy a middle ground. We provide systematic hyperparameter selection using Pareto optimal analysis and demonstrate how MER-guided reassignment improves biological fidelity across all methods, with CMC scores improving by up to 12\\% on average. This framework enables principled selection of dimensionality reduction methods tailored to specific spatial transcriptomics analyses.",

    "abstract": "Differentiating between the two main subtypes of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD): Crohns disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) is a persistent clinical challenge due to overlapping presentations. This study introduces a novel computational framework that employs spatial transcriptomics (ST) to create an explainable machine learning model for IBD classification. We analyzed ST data from the colonic mucosa of healthy controls (HC), UC, and CD patients. Using Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), we first identified four recurring cellular niches, representing distinct functional microenvironments within the tissue. From these niches, we systematically engineered 44 features capturing three key aspects of tissue pathology: niche composition, neighborhood enrichment, and niche-gene signals. A multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier trained on these features achieved an accuracy of 0.774 +/- 0.161 for the more challenging three-class problem (HC, UC, and CD) and 0.916 +/- 0.118 in the two-class problem of distinguishing IBD from healthy tissue. Crucially, model explainability analysis revealed that disruptions in the spatial organization of niches were the strongest predictors of general inflammation, while the classification between UC and CD relied on specific niche-gene expression signatures. This work provides a robust, proof-of-concept pipeline that transforms descriptive spatial data into an accurate and explainable predictive tool, offering not only a potential new diagnostic paradigm but also deeper insights into the distinct biological mechanisms that drive IBD subtypes.",

    "abstract": "The gene set analysis (GSA) is a foundational approach for uncovering the molecular functions associated with a group of genes. Recently, LLM-powered methods have emerged to annotate gene sets with biological functions together with coherent explanatory insights. However, existing studies primarily focus on proprietary models, which have been shown to outperform their open-source counterparts despite concerns over cost and data privacy. Furthermore, no research has investigated the application of advanced reasoning strategies to the GSA task. To address this gap, we introduce Gene-R1, a data-augmented learning framework that equips lightweight and open-source LLMs with step-by-step reasoning capabilities tailored to GSA. Experiments on 1,508 in-distribution gene sets demonstrate that Gene-R1 achieves substantial performance gains, matching commercial LLMs. On 106 out-of-distribution gene sets, Gene-R1 performs comparably to both commercial and large-scale LLMs, exhibiting robust generalizability across diverse gene sources.",

While algorithms for identifying LC sequences exist, they either do not define complexity mathematically or are inefficient with long or variable context windows.

We introduce an algorithmic framework for the Minimum-Cost Synthetic Genome Planning problem, aiming to identify the most cost-effective strategy to assemble a target genome from a source genome through a combination of reuse, synthesis, and join operations. By comparing dynamic programming and greedy heuristic strategies under diverse cost regimes, we demonstrate how algorithmic choices influence the cost-efficiency of large-scale genome construction. In parallel, solving the Minimum-Cost Synthetic Genome Planning problem can help us better understand genome architecture and evolution. We applied our framework in case studies on viral genomes, including SARS-CoV-2, to examine how source-target genome similarity shapes construction costs. Our analyses revealed that conserved regions such as ORF1ab can be reconstructed cost-effectively from related templates, while highly variable regions such as the S (spike) gene are more reliant on DNA synthesis, highlighting the biological and economic trade-offs of genome design.",

    "abstract": "The frequency distributions of DNA k-mers are shaped by fundamental biological processes and offer a window into genome structure and evolution. Inspired by analogies to natural language, prior studies have attempted to model genomic k-mer usage using Zipf's law, a rank-frequency law originally formulated for words in human language. However, the extent to which this law accurately captures the distribution of k-mers across diverse species remains unclear. Here, we systematically analyze k-mer frequency spectra across more than 225,000 genome assemblies spanning all three domains of life and viruses. We demonstrate that Zipf's law consistently underperforms in modeling k-mer distributions. In contrast, we propose the truncated power law and Zipf-Mandelbrot distributions, which provide substantially improved fits across taxonomic groups. We show that genome size and GC content influence model performance, with larger and GC-content imbalanced genomes yielding better adherence. Additionally, we perform an extensive analysis on vocabulary expansion and exhaustion across the same organisms using Heaps' law. We apply our modeling framework to evaluate simulated genomes generated by k-let preserving shuffling and deep generative language models. Our results reveal substantial differences between organismal genomes and their synthetic or shuffled counterparts, offering a novel approach to benchmark the biological plausibility of artificial genomes. Collectively, this work establishes new standards for modeling genomic k-mer distributions and provides insights relevant to synthetic biology, and evolutionary sequence analysis.",

We developed a hybrid ensemble feature selection (hEFS) approach that combines data subsampling with multiple prognostic models, integrating both embedded and wrapper-based strategies for survival prediction. Omics features are ranked using a voting-theory-inspired aggregation mechanism across models and subsamples, while the optimal number of features is selected via a Pareto front, balancing predictive accuracy and model sparsity without any user-defined thresholds. When applied to multi-omics datasets from three pancreatic cancer cohorts, hEFS identifies significantly fewer and more stable biomarkers compared to the conventional, late-fusion CoxLasso models, while maintaining comparable discrimination performance. Implemented within the open-source mlr3fselect R package, hEFS offers a robust, interpretable, and clinically valuable tool for prognostic modelling and biomarker discovery in high-dimensional survival settings.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides unprecedented insights into cellular heterogeneity, enabling detailed analysis of complex biological systems at single-cell resolution. However, the high dimensionality and technical noise inherent in scRNA-seq data pose significant analytical challenges. While current embedding methods focus primarily on gene expression levels, they often overlook crucial gene-gene interactions that govern cellular identity and function. To address this limitation, we present a novel embedding approach that integrates both gene expression profiles and data-driven gene-gene interactions. Our method first constructs a Cell-Leaf Graph (CLG) using random forest models to capture regulatory relationships between genes, while simultaneously building a K-Nearest Neighbor Graph (KNNG) to represent expression similarities between cells. These graphs are then combined into an Enriched Cell-Leaf Graph (ECLG), which serves as input for a graph neural network to compute cell embeddings. By incorporating both expression levels and gene-gene interactions, our approach provides a more comprehensive representation of cellular states. Extensive evaluation across multiple datasets demonstrates that our method enhances the detection of rare cell populations and improves downstream analyses such as visualization, clustering, and trajectory inference. This integrated approach represents a significant advance in single-cell data analysis, offering a more complete framework for understanding cellular diversity and dynamics.",

Here, we constructed weighted gene co-expression networks from bulk RNA-seq data of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovial tissue, using pairwise correlation and a percolation-guided thresholding strategy. Community detection with Louvain and Leiden algorithms revealed robust modules, and node-strength ranking identified the top 50 hub genes globally and within communities. To assess novelty, we integrated genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with literature-based evidence from PubMed, highlighting five high-centrality genes with little to no prior RA-specific association. Functional enrichment confirmed their roles in immune-related processes, including adaptive immune response and lymphocyte regulation. Notably, these hubs showed strong positive correlations with T- and B-cell markers and negative correlations with NK-cell markers, consistent with RA immunopathology. Overall, our framework demonstrates how correlation-based network construction, modularity-driven clustering, and centrality-guided novelty scoring can jointly reveal informative structure in omics-scale data. This generalizable approach offers a scalable path to gene prioritization in RA and other autoimmune conditions.",

Our results reveal that no single tool is universally optimal. Performance is highly context-dependent, with tools like CHERRY and iPHoP demonstrating robust, broad applicability, while others, such as RaFAH and PHIST, excel in specific contexts. We further identify a critical trade-off between predictive accuracy, prediction rate, and computational cost.

    "abstract": "Single-cell multi-omics data contain huge information of cellular states, and analyzing these data can reveal valuable insights into cellular heterogeneity, diseases, and biological processes. However, as cell differentiation \\& development is a continuous and dynamic process, it remains challenging to computationally model and infer cell interaction patterns based on single-cell multi-omics data. This paper presents scI2CL, a new single-cell multi-omics fusion framework based on intra- and inter-omics contrastive learning, to learn comprehensive and discriminative cellular representations from complementary multi-omics data for various downstream tasks. Extensive experiments of four downstream tasks validate the effectiveness of scI2CL and its superiority over existing peers. Concretely, in cell clustering, scI2CL surpasses eight state-of-the-art methods on four widely-used real-world datasets. In cell subtyping, scI2CL effectively distinguishes three latent monocyte cell subpopulations, which are not discovered by existing methods. Simultaneously, scI2CL is the only method that correctly constructs the cell developmental trajectory from hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells to Memory B cells. In addition, scI2CL resolves the misclassification of cell types between two subpopulations of CD4+ T cells, while existing methods fail to precisely distinguish the mixed cells. In summary, scI2CL can accurately characterize cross-omics relationships among cells, thus effectively fuses multi-omics data and learns discriminative cellular representations to support various downstream analysis tasks.",

    "abstract": "Understanding which genes control which traits in an organism remains one of the central challenges in biology. Despite significant advances in data collection technology, our ability to map genes to traits is still limited. This genome-to-phenome (G2P) challenge spans several problem domains, including plant breeding, and requires models capable of reasoning over high-dimensional, heterogeneous, and biologically structured data. Currently, however, many datasets solely capture genetic information or solely capture phenotype information. Additionally, phenotype data is very heterogeneous, which many datasets do not fully capture. The critical drawback is that these datasets are not integrated, that is, they do not link with each other to describe the same biological specimens. This limits machine learning models' ability to be informed on the various aspects of these specimens, impacting the breadth of correlations learned, and therefore their ability to make more accurate predictions. To address this gap, we present the Arabidopsis Genomics-Phenomics (AGP) Dataset, a curated multi-modal dataset linking gene expression profiles with phenotypic trait measurements in Arabidopsis thaliana, a model organism in plant biology. AGP supports tasks such as phenotype prediction and interpretable graph learning. In addition, we benchmark conventional regression and explanatory baselines, including a biologically-informed hypergraph baseline, to validate gene-trait associations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first dataset that provides multi-modal gene information and heterogeneous trait or phenotype data for the same Arabidopsis thaliana specimens. With AGP, we aim to foster the research community towards accurately understanding the connection between genotypes and phenotypes using gene information, higher-order gene pairings, and trait data from several sources.",

    "abstract": "Variations in complex traits are influenced by multiple genetic variants, environmental risk factors, and their interactions. Though substantial progress has been made in identifying single genetic variants associated with complex traits, detecting the gene-gene and gene-environment interactions remains a great challenge. When a large number of genetic variants and environmental risk factors are involved, searching for interactions is limited to pair-wise interactions due to the exponentially increased feature space and computational intensity. Alternatively, recursive partitioning approaches, such as random forests, have gained popularity in high-dimensional genetic association studies. In this article, we propose a U-Statistic-based random forest approach, referred to as Forest U-Test, for genetic association studies with quantitative traits. Through simulation studies, we showed that the Forest U-Test outperformed existing methods. The proposed method was also applied to study Cannabis Dependence CD, using three independent datasets from the Study of Addiction: Genetics and Environment. A significant joint association was detected with an empirical p-value less than 0.001. The finding was also replicated in two independent datasets with p-values of 5.93e-19 and 4.70e-17, respectively.",

PCA and UMAP clustering identified T-cell subsets and differentially expressed genes in TNBC microenvironment. TNBC-related targets were screened via CTD and OMIM databases, with functional pathways analyzed by GO/KEGG enrichment. Molecular docking and PPI networks validated interactions between quercetin and core targets.Results: Quercetin intersected with 79 TNBC targets, including AKT1, EGFR, and MMP9, enriched in EGFR inhibitor resistance and endocrine resistance pathways. Molecular docking revealed the highest affinity between quercetin and GSK3B (-13.2 kJ/mol). AKT1 and MMP9 expression correlated with patient survival.Conclusion: Quercetin may reverse TNBC immunosuppression by multi-target modulation of T-cell function, but clinical application requires solutions for its low bioavailability, such as delivery systems or combination therapies.",

    "abstract": "The surge in multimodal single-cell omics data exposes limitations in traditional, manually defined analysis workflows. AI agents offer a paradigm shift, enabling adaptive planning, executable code generation, traceable decisions, and real-time knowledge fusion. However, the lack of a comprehensive benchmark critically hinders progress. We introduce a novel benchmarking evaluation system to rigorously assess agent capabilities in single-cell omics analysis. This system comprises: a unified platform compatible with diverse agent frameworks and LLMs; multidimensional metrics assessing cognitive program synthesis, collaboration, execution efficiency, bioinformatics knowledge integration, and task completion quality; and 50 diverse real-world single-cell omics analysis tasks spanning multi-omics, species, and sequencing technologies. Our evaluation reveals that Grok-3-beta achieves state-of-the-art performance among tested agent frameworks. Multi-agent frameworks significantly enhance collaboration and execution efficiency over single-agent approaches through specialized role division. Attribution analyses of agent capabilities identify that high-quality code generation is crucial for task success, and self-reflection has the most significant overall impact, followed by retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and planning. This work highlights persistent challenges in code generation, long-context handling, and context-aware knowledge retrieval, providing a critical empirical foundation and best practices for developing robust AI agents in computational biology.",

    "abstract": "Pre-training large language models on genomic sequences is a powerful approach for learning biologically meaningful representations. Masked language modeling (MLM) methods, such as DNABERT and Nucleotide Transformer (NT), achieve strong performance but suffer from partial token supervision, pre-training/fine-tuning mismatches, and high computational costs. We introduce NucEL, the first ELECTRA-style pre-training framework for genomic foundation models, addressing these limitations. Using a discriminator to identify tokens altered by a generator, NucEL provides comprehensive token-level supervision across all sequence positions, improving efficiency over the partial supervision of MLM. Incorporating ModernBERT's hybrid local-global attention and flash attention, NucEL offers an optimized BERT architecture for genomic modeling. Unlike 6-mer tokenization, NucEL uses single-nucleotide tokens for fine-grained resolution, boosting both efficiency and interpretability. Pre-trained on the human genome, NucEL achieves state-of-the-art results on diverse downstream tasks -- regulatory element identification (e.g., promoters, enhancers), transcription factor binding prediction, open chromatin classification, and histone modification profiling -- surpassing similarly sized MLM-based models and rivaling models 25x larger, such as NT. Ablation studies highlight optimal tokenization and masking strategies for ELECTRA-style DNA pre-training. Attention analysis reveals NucEL's superior capture of biologically relevant motifs compared to NT, providing insights into hierarchical learning and regulatory element modeling. These findings demonstrate ELECTRA-style pre-training as an efficient, effective strategy for genomic representation learning with broad implications for genomic research.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental limitation of probabilistic deep learning is its predominant reliance on Gaussian priors. This simplistic assumption prevents models from accurately capturing the complex, non-Gaussian landscapes of natural data, particularly in demanding domains like complex biological data, severely hindering the fidelity of the model for scientific discovery. The physically-grounded Boltzmann distribution offers a more expressive alternative, but it is computationally intractable on classical computers. To date, quantum approaches have been hampered by the insufficient qubit scale and operational stability required for the iterative demands of deep learning. Here, we bridge this gap by introducing the Quantum Boltzmann Machine-Variational Autoencoder (QBM-VAE), a large-scale and long-time stable hybrid quantum-classical architecture. Our framework leverages a quantum processor for efficient sampling from the Boltzmann distribution, enabling its use as a powerful prior within a deep generative model. Applied to million-scale single-cell datasets from multiple sources, the QBM-VAE generates a latent space that better preserves complex biological structures, consistently outperforming conventional Gaussian-based deep learning models like VAE and SCVI in essential tasks such as omics data integration, cell-type classification, and trajectory inference. It also provides a typical example of introducing a physics priori into deep learning to drive the model to acquire scientific discovery capabilities that breaks through data limitations. This work provides the demonstration of a practical quantum advantage in deep learning on a large-scale scientific problem and offers a transferable blueprint for developing hybrid quantum AI models.",

In this work, we developed and evaluated commonly used generative models, including Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Diffusion Models, and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and proposed adaptation tailored to discrete genotype data. We conducted extensive experiments on large-scale datasets, including all chromosomes from cow and multiple chromosomes from human.

Recently, LLMs has been applied effectively to predict structural variations in biological sequences. In this work, we explore the potential of fine-tuned LLMs to predict cardiac diseases and SNPs potentially leading to CVD risk using genetic markers derived from high-throughput genomic profiling. We investigate the effect of genetic patterns associated with cardiac conditions and evaluate how LLMs can learn latent biological relationships from structured and semi-structured genomic data obtained by mapping genetic aspects that are inherited from the family tree. By framing the problem as a Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning task, the models are prompted to generate disease labels and articulate informed clinical deductions across diverse patient profiles and phenotypes.

K-Dense Analyst, part of the broader K-Dense platform, couples planning with validated execution using specialized agents to decompose complex objectives into executable, verifiable tasks within secure computational environments. On BixBench, a comprehensive benchmark for open-ended biological analysis, K-Dense Analyst achieves 29.2% accuracy, surpassing the best-performing language model (GPT-5) by 6.3 percentage points, representing nearly 27% improvement over what is widely considered the most powerful LLM available. Remarkably, K-Dense Analyst achieves this performance using Gemini 2.5 Pro, which attains only 18.3% accuracy when used directly, demonstrating that our architectural innovations unlock capabilities far beyond the underlying model's baseline performance. Our insights demonstrate that autonomous scientific reasoning requires more than enhanced language models, it demands purpose-built systems that can bridge the gap between high-level scientific objectives and low-level computational execution.

Single-cell technologies enable high-resolution measurement of transcriptional responses, but collecting such data is costly and time-consuming, especially when repeated for each cell type. Existing computational methods often require separate models per cell type, limiting scalability and generalization. We present CFM-GP, a method for cell type-agnostic gene perturbation prediction. CFM-GP learns a continuous, time-dependent transformation between unperturbed and perturbed gene expression distributions, conditioned on cell type, allowing a single model to predict across all cell types. Unlike prior approaches that use discrete modeling, CFM-GP employs a flow matching objective to capture perturbation dynamics in a scalable manner. We evaluate on five datasets: SARS-CoV-2 infection, IFN-beta stimulated PBMCs, glioblastoma treated with Panobinostat, lupus under IFN-beta stimulation, and Statefate progenitor fate mapping. CFM-GP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in R-squared and Spearman correlation, and pathway enrichment analysis confirms recovery of key biological pathways.

    "title": "Embedding Is (Almost) All You Need: Retrieval-Augmented Inference for Generalizable Genomic Prediction Tasks",
    "abstract": "Large pre-trained DNA language models such as DNABERT-2, Nucleotide Transformer, and HyenaDNA have demonstrated strong performance on various genomic benchmarks. However, most applications rely on expensive fine-tuning, which works best when the training and test data share a similar distribution. In this work, we investigate whether task-specific fine-tuning is always necessary. We show that simple embedding-based pipelines that extract fixed representations from these models and feed them into lightweight classifiers can achieve competitive performance. In evaluation settings with different data distributions, embedding-based methods often outperform fine-tuning while reducing inference time by 10x to 20x. Our results suggest that embedding extraction is not only a strong baseline but also a more generalizable and efficient alternative to fine-tuning, especially for deployment in diverse or unseen genomic contexts. For example, in enhancer classification, HyenaDNA embeddings combined with zCurve achieve 0.68 accuracy (vs. 0.58 for fine-tuning), with an 88% reduction in inference time and over 8x lower carbon emissions (0.02 kg vs. 0.17 kg CO2). In non-TATA promoter classification, DNABERT-2 embeddings with zCurve or GC content reach 0.85 accuracy (vs. 0.89 with fine-tuning) with a 22x lower carbon footprint (0.02 kg vs. 0.44 kg CO2). These results show that embedding-based pipelines offer over 10x better carbon efficiency while maintaining strong predictive performance.

Proof-of-concept analyses illustrate how SiCmiR can uncover candidate hub-miRNAs in bulk-seq cell lines and hepatocellular carcinoma, scRNA-seq pancreatic ductal carcinoma and ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma and extracellular-vesicle-mediated crosstalk in glioblastoma. Trained on 6462 TCGA paired miRNA-mRNA samples, SiCmiR attains state-of-the-art accuracy on held-out cancers and generalizes to unseen cancer types, drug perturbations and scRNA-seq. We next constructed SiCmiR-Atlas, containing 632 public datasets, 9.36 million cells, 726 cell types, which is the first dedicated database of single-cell mature miRNA expression--providing interactive visualization, biomarker identification and cell-type-resolved miRNA-target networks.

    "title": "GRIT: Graph-Regularized Logit Refinement for Zero-shot Cell Type Annotation",
    "abstract": "Cell type annotation is a fundamental step in the analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. In practice, human experts often rely on the structure revealed by principal component analysis (PCA) followed by $k$-nearest neighbor ($k$-NN) graph construction to guide annotation. While effective, this process is labor-intensive and does not scale to large datasets. Recent advances in CLIP-style models offer a promising path toward automating cell type annotation. By aligning scRNA-seq profiles with natural language descriptions, models like LangCell enable zero-shot annotation. While LangCell demonstrates decent zero-shot performance, its predictions remain suboptimal, particularly in achieving consistent accuracy across all cell types. In this paper, we propose to refine the zero-shot logits produced by LangCell through a graph-regularized optimization framework. By enforcing local consistency over the task-specific PCA-based k-NN graph, our method combines the scalability of the pre-trained models with the structural robustness relied upon in expert annotation. We evaluate our approach on 14 annotated human scRNA-seq datasets from 4 distinct studies, spanning 11 organs and over 200,000 single cells. Our method consistently improves zero-shot annotation accuracy, achieving accuracy gains of up to 10%. Further analysis showcase the mechanism by which GRIT effectively propagates correct signals through the graph, pulling back mislabeled cells toward more accurate predictions. The method is training-free, model-agnostic, and serves as a simple yet effective plug-in for enhancing automated cell type annotation in practice.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the molecular-level mechanisms underpinning Alzheimer's disease (AD) by studying crucial genes associated with the disease remains a challenge. Alzheimer's, being a multifactorial disease, requires understanding the gene-gene interactions underlying it for theranostics and progress. In this article, a novel attempt has been made using a quantum regression to decode how some crucial genes in the AD Amyloid Beta Precursor Protein ($APP$), Sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 14 ($FGF14$), Yin Yang 1 ($YY1$), and Phospholipase D Family Member 3 ($PLD3$) etc. become influenced by other prominent switching genes during disease progression, which may help in gene expression-based therapy for AD. Our proposed Quantum Regression Network (Alz-QNet) introduces a pioneering approach with insights from the state-of-the-art Quantum Gene Regulatory Networks (QGRN) to unravel the gene interactions involved in AD pathology, particularly within the Entorhinal Cortex (EC), where early pathological changes occur. Using the proposed Alz-QNet framework, we explore the interactions between key genes ($APP$, $FGF14$, $YY1$, $EGR1$, $GAS7$, $AKT3$, $SREBF2$, and $PLD3$) within the CE microenvironment of AD patients, studying genetic samples from the database $GSE138852$, all of which are believed to play a crucial role in the progression of AD. Our investigation uncovers intricate gene-gene interactions, shedding light on the potential regulatory mechanisms that underlie the pathogenesis of AD, which help us to find potential gene inhibitors or regulators for theranostics.",

    "abstract": "Modern disease classification often overlooks molecular commonalities hidden beneath divergent clinical presentations. This study introduces a transcriptomics-driven framework for discovering disease relationships by analyzing over 1300 disease-condition pairs using GenoMAS, a fully automated agentic AI system. Beyond identifying robust gene-level overlaps, we develop a novel pathway-based similarity framework that integrates multi-database enrichment analysis to quantify functional convergence across diseases. The resulting disease similarity network reveals both known comorbidities and previously undocumented cross-category links. By examining shared biological pathways, we explore potential molecular mechanisms underlying these connections-offering functional hypotheses that go beyond symptom-based taxonomies. We further show how background conditions such as obesity and hypertension modulate transcriptomic similarity, and identify therapeutic repurposing opportunities for rare diseases like autism spectrum disorder based on their molecular proximity to better-characterized conditions. In addition, this work demonstrates how biologically grounded agentic AI can scale transcriptomic analysis while enabling mechanistic interpretation across complex disease landscapes.

    "abstract": "Genomic language models (gLMs) face a fundamental efficiency challenge: either maintain separate specialized models for each biological modality (DNA and RNA) or develop large multi-modal architectures. Both approaches impose significant computational burdens - modality-specific models require redundant infrastructure despite inherent biological connections, while multi-modal architectures demand massive parameter counts and extensive cross-modality pretraining. To address this limitation, we introduce CodonMoE (Adaptive Mixture of Codon Reformative Experts), a lightweight adapter that transforms DNA language models into effective RNA analyzers without RNA-specific pretraining. Our theoretical analysis establishes CodonMoE as a universal approximator at the codon level, capable of mapping arbitrary functions from codon sequences to RNA properties given sufficient expert capacity. Across four RNA prediction tasks spanning stability, expression, and regulation, DNA models augmented with CodonMoE significantly outperform their unmodified counterparts, with HyenaDNA+CodonMoE series achieving state-of-the-art results using 80% fewer parameters than specialized RNA models. By maintaining sub-quadratic complexity while achieving superior performance, our approach provides a principled path toward unifying genomic language modeling, leveraging more abundant DNA data and reducing computational overhead while preserving modality-specific performance advantages.",

However, uncertainty modeling in unsupervised learning with genomic data remains insufficiently explored. Conventional clustering methods assign a singular identity to each cell, potentially obscuring transitional states during differentiation or mutation. This study introduces a variational Bayesian framework for clustering and analysing single-cell genomic data, employing a Bayesian Gaussian mixture model to estimate the probabilistic association of cells with distinct clusters. This approach captures cellular transitions, yielding biologically coherent insights into neurogenesis and breast cancer progression. The inferred clustering probabilities enable further analyses, including Differential Expression Analysis and pseudotime analysis. Furthermore, we propose utilising the misclustering rate and Area Under the Curve in clustering scRNA-seq data as an innovative metric to quantitatively evaluate overall clustering performance. This methodological advancement enhances the resolution of single-cell data analysis, enabling a more nuanced characterisation of dynamic cellular identities in development and disease.",

    "abstract": "Spatial transcriptomics enables simultaneous measurement of gene expression and tissue morphology, offering unprecedented insights into cellular organization and disease mechanisms. However, the field lacks comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating multimodal learning methods that leverage both histology images and gene expression data. Here, we present HESCAPE, a large-scale benchmark for cross-modal contrastive pretraining in spatial transcriptomics, built on a curated pan-organ dataset spanning 6 different gene panels and 54 donors. We systematically evaluated state-of-the-art image and gene expression encoders across multiple pretraining strategies and assessed their effectiveness on two downstream tasks: gene mutation classification and gene expression prediction. Our benchmark demonstrates that gene expression encoders are the primary determinant of strong representational alignment, and that gene models pretrained on spatial transcriptomics data outperform both those trained without spatial data and simple baseline approaches. However, downstream task evaluation reveals a striking contradiction: while contrastive pretraining consistently improves gene mutation classification performance, it degrades direct gene expression prediction compared to baseline encoders trained without cross-modal objectives. We identify batch effects as a key factor that interferes with effective cross-modal alignment. Our findings highlight the critical need for batch-robust multimodal learning approaches in spatial transcriptomics. To accelerate progress in this direction, we release HESCAPE, providing standardized datasets, evaluation protocols, and benchmarking tools for the community",

    "abstract": "Pan-cancer classification using transcriptomic (RNA-Seq) data can inform tumor subtyping and therapy selection, but is challenging due to extremely high dimensionality and limited sample sizes. In this study, we propose a novel deep learning framework that uses a class-conditional variational autoencoder (cVAE) to augment training data for pan-cancer gene expression classification. Using 801 tumor RNA-Seq samples spanning 5 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we first perform feature selection to reduce 20,531 gene expression features to the 500 most variably expressed genes. A cVAE is then trained on this data to learn a latent representation of gene expression conditioned on cancer type, enabling the generation of synthetic gene expression samples for each tumor class. We augment the training set with these cVAE-generated samples (doubling the dataset size) to mitigate overfitting and class imbalance. A two-layer multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier is subsequently trained on the augmented dataset to predict tumor type. The augmented framework achieves high classification accuracy (~98%) on a held-out test set, substantially outperforming a classifier trained on the original data alone. We present detailed experimental results, including VAE training curves, classifier performance metrics (ROC curves and confusion matrix), and architecture diagrams to illustrate the approach. The results demonstrate that cVAE-based synthetic augmentation can significantly improve pan-cancer prediction performance, especially for underrepresented cancer classes.",

Current automation approaches are often limited by either inflexible workflows that break down in edge cases or by fully autonomous agents that lack the necessary precision for rigorous scientific inquiry. GenoMAS charts a different course by presenting a team of LLM-based scientists that integrates the reliability of structured workflows with the adaptability of autonomous agents. GenoMAS orchestrates six specialized LLM agents through typed message-passing protocols, each contributing complementary strengths to a shared analytic canvas. At the heart of GenoMAS lies a guided-planning framework: programming agents unfold high-level task guidelines into Action Units and, at each juncture, elect to advance, revise, bypass, or backtrack, thereby maintaining logical coherence while bending gracefully to the idiosyncrasies of genomic data.   On the GenoTEX benchmark, GenoMAS reaches a Composite Similarity Correlation of 89.13% for data preprocessing and an F$_1$ of 60.48% for gene identification, surpassing the best prior art by 10.61% and 16.85% respectively.

    "abstract": "Differential expression (DE) analysis is a key task in RNA-seq studies, aiming to identify genes with expression differences across conditions. A central challenge is balancing false discovery rate (FDR) control with statistical power. Parametric methods such as DESeq2 and edgeR achieve high power by modeling gene-level counts using negative binomial distributions and applying empirical Bayes shrinkage. However, these methods may suffer from FDR inflation when model assumptions are mildly violated, especially in large-sample settings. In contrast, non-parametric tests like Wilcoxon offer more robust FDR control but often lack power and do not support covariate adjustment. We propose Nullstrap-DE, a general add-on framework that combines the strengths of both approaches. Designed to augment tools like DESeq2 and edgeR, Nullstrap-DE calibrates FDR while preserving power, without modifying the original method's implementation. It generates synthetic null data from a model fitted under the gene-specific null (no DE), applies the same test statistic to both observed and synthetic data, and derives a threshold that satisfies the target FDR level. We show theoretically that Nullstrap-DE asymptotically controls FDR while maintaining power consistency. Simulations confirm that it achieves reliable FDR control and high power across diverse settings, where DESeq2, edgeR, or Wilcoxon often show inflated FDR or low power. Applications to real datasets show that Nullstrap-DE enhances statistical rigor and identifies biologically meaningful genes.",

Network-based approaches have advanced multi-omics research by effectively capturing biologically relevant relationships among molecular entities. While these methods are powerful for representing molecular interactions, there remains a need for tools specifically designed to effectively utilize these network representations across diverse downstream analyses. To fulfill this need, we introduce BioNeuralNet, a flexible and modular Python framework tailored for end-to-end network-based multi-omics data analysis. BioNeuralNet leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn biologically meaningful low-dimensional representations from multi-omics networks, converting these complex molecular networks into versatile embeddings. BioNeuralNet supports all major stages of multi-omics network analysis, including several network construction techniques, generation of low-dimensional representations, and a broad range of downstream analytical tasks. Its extensive utilities, including diverse GNN architectures, and compatibility with established Python packages (e.g., scikit-learn, PyTorch, NetworkX), enhance usability and facilitate quick adoption. BioNeuralNet is an open-source, user-friendly, and extensively documented framework designed to support flexible and reproducible multi-omics network analysis in precision medicine.",

In this work, we explore embedding-based similarity search methods that learn latent representations capturing deeper structural and functional patterns beyond raw sequence alignment. We systematically evaluate two state-of-the-art vector search libraries, FAISS and ScaNN, on biologically meaningful gene embeddings. Unlike prior studies, our analysis focuses on bioinformatics-specific embeddings and benchmarks their utility for detecting novel sequences, including those from uncharacterized taxa or genes lacking known homologs.

    "abstract": "Functional annotation of microbial genomes is often biased toward protein-coding genes, leaving a vast, unexplored landscape of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) that are critical for regulating bacterial and archaeal physiology, stress response and metabolism. Identifying ncRNAs directly from genomic sequence is a paramount challenge in bioinformatics and biology, essential for understanding the complete regulatory potential of an organism. This paper presents RNAMunin, a machine learning (ML) model that is capable of finding ncRNAs using genomic sequence alone. It is also computationally viable for large sequence datasets such as long read metagenomic assemblies with contigs totaling multiple Gbp. RNAMunin is trained on Rfam sequences extracted from approximately 60 Gbp of long read metagenomes from 16 San Francisco Estuary samples. We know of no other model that can detect ncRNAs based solely on genomic sequence at this scale. Since RNAMunin only requires genomic sequence as input, we do not need for an ncRNA to be transcribed to find it, i.e., we do not need transcriptomics data. We wrote this manuscript in a narrative style in order to best convey how RNAMunin was developed and how it works in detail. Unlike almost all current ML models, at approximately 1M parameters, RNAMunin is very small and very fast.",

Building foundational models for ST can significantly enhance the analysis of vast and complex data sources, unlocking new perspectives on the intricacies of biological tissues. However, modeling ST data is inherently challenging due to the need to extract multi-scale information from tissue slices containing vast numbers of cells. This process requires integrating macro-scale tissue morphology, micro-scale cellular microenvironment, and gene-scale gene expression profile. To address this challenge, we propose SToFM, a multi-scale Spatial Transcriptomics Foundation Model. SToFM first performs multi-scale information extraction on each ST slice, to construct a set of ST sub-slices that aggregate macro-, micro- and gene-scale information. Then an SE(2) Transformer is used to obtain high-quality cell representations from the sub-slices. Additionally, we construct \\textbf{SToCorpus-88M}, the largest high-resolution spatial transcriptomics corpus for pretraining. SToFM achieves outstanding performance on a variety of downstream tasks, such as tissue region semantic segmentation and cell type annotation, demonstrating its comprehensive understanding of ST data through capturing and integrating multi-scale information.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider a tree inference problem motivated by the critical problem in single-cell genomics of reconstructing dynamic cellular processes from sequencing data. In particular, given a population of cells sampled from such a process, we are interested in the problem of ordering the cells according to their progression in the process. This is known as trajectory inference. If the process is differentiation, this amounts to reconstructing the corresponding differentiation tree. One way of doing this in practice is to estimate the shortest-path distance between nodes based on cell similarities observed in sequencing data. Recent sequencing techniques make it possible to measure two types of data: gene expression levels, and RNA velocity, a vector that predicts changes in gene expression. The data then consist of a discrete vector field on a (subset of a) Euclidean space of dimension equal to the number of genes under consideration. By integrating this velocity field, we trace the evolution of gene expression levels in each single cell from some initial stage to its current stage. Eventually, we assume that we have a faithful embedding of the differentiation tree in a Euclidean space, but which we only observe through the curves representing the paths from the root to the nodes. Using varifold distances between such curves, we define a similarity measure between nodes which we prove approximates the shortest-path distance in a tree that is isomorphic to the target tree.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell foundation models such as scGPT represent a significant advancement in single-cell omics, with an ability to achieve state-of-the-art performance on various downstream biological tasks. However, these models are inherently limited in that a vast amount of information in biology exists as text, which they are unable to leverage. There have therefore been several recent works that propose the use of LLMs as an alternative to single-cell foundation models, achieving competitive results. However, there is little understanding of what factors drive this performance, along with a strong focus on using LLMs as an alternative, rather than complementary approach to single-cell foundation models. In this study, we therefore investigate what biological insights contribute toward the performance of LLMs when applied to single-cell data, and introduce scMPT; a model which leverages synergies between scGPT, and single-cell representations from LLMs that capture these insights. scMPT demonstrates stronger, more consistent performance than either of its component models, which frequently have large performance gaps between each other across datasets. We also experiment with alternate fusion methods, demonstrating the potential of combining specialized reasoning models with scGPT to improve performance. This study ultimately showcases the potential for LLMs to complement single-cell foundation models and drive improvements in single-cell analysis.",

    "abstract": "Clustering analysis is fundamental in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data analysis for elucidating cellular heterogeneity and diversity. Recent graph-based scRNA-seq clustering methods, particularly graph neural networks (GNNs), have significantly improved in tackling the challenges of high-dimension, high-sparsity, and frequent dropout events that lead to ambiguous cell population boundaries. However, their reliance on hard graph constructions derived from thresholded similarity matrices presents challenges:(i) The simplification of intercellular relationships into binary edges (0 or 1) by applying thresholds, which restricts the capture of continuous similarity features among cells and leads to significant information loss.(ii) The presence of significant inter-cluster connections within hard graphs, which can confuse GNN methods that rely heavily on graph structures, potentially causing erroneous message propagation and biased clustering outcomes. To tackle these challenges, we introduce scSGC, a Soft Graph Clustering for single-cell RNA sequencing data, which aims to more accurately characterize continuous similarities among cells through non-binary edge weights, thereby mitigating the limitations of rigid data structures. The scSGC framework comprises three core components: (i) a zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB)-based feature autoencoder; (ii) a dual-channel cut-informed soft graph embedding module; and (iii) an optimal transport-based clustering optimization module. Extensive experiments across ten datasets demonstrate that scSGC outperforms 13 state-of-the-art clustering models in clustering accuracy, cell type annotation, and computational efficiency. These results highlight its substantial potential to advance scRNA-seq data analysis and deepen our understanding of cellular heterogeneity.",

    "abstract": "Transformers have revolutionized nucleotide sequence analysis, yet capturing long-range dependencies remains challenging. Recent studies show that autoregressive transformers often exhibit Markovian behavior by relying on fixed-length context windows for next-token prediction. However, standard self-attention mechanisms are computationally inefficient for long sequences due to their quadratic complexity and do not explicitly enforce global transition consistency.   We introduce CARMANIA (Context-Aware Regularization with Markovian Integration for Attention-Based Nucleotide Analysis), a self-supervised pretraining framework that augments next-token (NT) prediction with a transition-matrix (TM) loss. The TM loss aligns predicted token transitions with empirically derived n-gram statistics from each input sequence, encouraging the model to capture higher-order dependencies beyond local context. This integration enables CARMANIA to learn organism-specific sequence structures that reflect both evolutionary constraints and functional organization.   We evaluate CARMANIA across diverse genomic tasks, including regulatory element prediction, functional gene classification, taxonomic inference, antimicrobial resistance detection, and biosynthetic gene cluster classification. CARMANIA outperforms the previous best long-context model by at least 7 percent, matches state-of-the-art on shorter sequences (exceeding prior results on 20 out of 40 tasks while running approximately 2.5 times faster), and shows particularly strong improvements on enhancer and housekeeping gene classification tasks, including up to a 34 percent absolute gain in Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) for enhancer prediction. The TM loss boosts accuracy in 33 of 40 tasks, especially where local motifs or regulatory patterns drive prediction.",

    "abstract": "Genetic transfers are pervasive across both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, encompassing canonical genomic introgression between species or genera and horizontal gene transfer (HGT) across kingdoms. However, DNA transfer between phylogenetically distant species, here defined as remote introgression (RI), has remained poorly explored in evolutionary genomics. In this study, we present RIFinder, a novel phylogeny-based method for RI event detection, and apply it to a comprehensive dataset of 122 grass genomes. Our analysis identifies 622 RI events originating from 543 distinct homologous genes, revealing distinct characteristics among grass subfamilies. Specifically, the subfamily Pooideae exhibits the highest number of introgressed genes while Bambusoideae contains the lowest. Comparisons among accepted genes, their donor copies and native homologs demonstrate that introgressed genes undergo post-transfer localized adaptation, with significant functional enrichment in stress-response pathways. Notably, we identify a large Triticeae-derived segment in a Chloridoideae species Cleistogenes songorica, which is potentially associated with its exceptional drought tolerance. Furthermore, we provide compelling evidence that RI has contributed to the origin and diversification of biosynthetic gene clusters of gramine, a defensive alkaloid chemical, across grass species. Collectively, our study establishes a robust method for RI detection and highlights its critical role in adaptive evolution.",

Recent deep learning models like Geneformer and Mouse-Geneformer perform well on tasks such as cell-type classification and in silico perturbation. However, their species-specific design limits cross-species generalization and translational applications, which are crucial for advancing translational research and drug discovery. We present Mix-Geneformer, a novel Transformer-based model that integrates human and mouse scRNA-seq data into a unified representation via a hybrid self-supervised approach combining Masked Language Modeling (MLM) and SimCSE-based contrastive loss to capture both shared and species-specific gene patterns. A rank-value encoding scheme further emphasizes high-variance gene signals during training. Trained on about 50 million cells from diverse human and mouse organs, Mix-Geneformer matched or outperformed state-of-the-art baselines in cell-type classification and in silico perturbation tasks, achieving 95.8% accuracy on mouse kidney data versus 94.9% from the best existing model. It also successfully identified key regulatory genes validated by in vivo studies. By enabling scalable cross-species transcriptomic modeling, Mix-Geneformer offers a powerful tool for comparative transcriptomics and translational applications. While our results demonstrate strong performance, we also acknowledge limitations, such as the computational cost and variability in zero-shot transfer.",

    "abstract": "Sequence data, such as DNA, RNA, and protein sequences, exhibit intricate, multi-scale structures that pose significant challenges for conventional analysis methods, particularly those relying on alignment or purely statistical representations. In this work, we introduce category-based topological sequence analysis (CTSA ) of genomes. CTSA models a sequence as a resolution category, capturing its hierarchical structure through a categorical construction. Substructure complexes are then derived from this categorical representation, and their persistent homology is computed to extract multi-scale topological features. Our models depart from traditional alignment-free approaches by incorporating structured mathematical formalisms rooted in sequence topology. The resulting topological signatures provide informative representations across a variety of tasks, including the phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 variants and the prediction of protein-nucleic acid binding affinities. Comparative studies were carried out against six state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results demonstrate that CTSA achieves excellent and consistent performance in these tasks, suggesting its general applicability and robustness. Beyond sequence analysis, the proposed framework opens new directions for the integration of categorical and homological theories for biological sequence analysis.",

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers share significant similarities in their encoding strategies for interacting with features from nodes of interest, where Transformers use query-key scores and GNNs use edges. Compared to GNNs, which are unable to encode relative positions, Transformers leverage dynamic attention capabilities to better represent relative relationships, thereby becoming the standard backbones in large-scale sequential pre-training. However, the subtle difference prompts us to consider: if positions are no longer crucial, could we substitute Transformers with Graph Neural Networks in some fields such as Single-Cell Transcriptomics? In this paper, we first explore the similarities and differences between GNNs and Transformers, specifically in terms of relative positions. Additionally, we design a synthetic example to illustrate their equivalence where there are no relative positions between tokens in the sample. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on a large-scale position-agnostic dataset-single-cell transcriptomics-finding that GNNs achieve competitive performance compared to Transformers while consuming fewer computation resources. These findings provide novel insights for researchers in the field of single-cell transcriptomics, challenging the prevailing notion that the Transformer is always the optimum choice.",

For a human sample without such regions, the error rate could be 10 times higher. Although multiple sets of easy regions have been identified to alleviate the issue, they fail to consider non-reference samples or are biased towards existing short-read data or aligners.   Results: Here, using hundreds of high-quality human assemblies, we derived a set of sample-agnostic easy regions where short-read variant calling reaches high accuracy. These regions cover 88.2% of GRCh38, 92.2% of coding regions and 96.3% of ClinVar pathogenic variants. They achieve a good balance between coverage and easiness and can be generated for other human assemblies or species with multiple well assembled genomes.

In this study, we implemented an ensemble of machine learning algorithms to analyze the correlation between genetic and transcriptomic features of cancer cell lines and IC50 values, a reliable metric for drug efficacy. Our analysis involved a reduction of the feature set from an original pool of 38,977 features, demonstrating a strong linear relationship between genetic features and drug responses across various algorithms, including SVR, Linear Regression, and Ridge Regression. Notably, copy number variations (CNVs) emerged as more predictive than mutations, suggesting a significant reevaluation of biomarkers for drug response prediction. Through rigorous statistical methods, we identified a highly reduced set of 421 critical features. This set offers a novel perspective that contrasts with traditional cancer driver genes, underscoring the potential for these biomarkers in designing targeted therapies. Furthermore, our findings advocate for IC50 values as a predictable measurement of drug responses and underscore the need for more data that can represent the dimensionality of genomic data in drug response prediction. Future work will aim to expand the dataset and refine feature selection to enhance the generalizability of the predictive model in clinical settings.",

In contrast, we offer a more realistic view of cellular responses by modeling expression distributions. Our model predicts gene-level histograms conditioned on perturbations and outperforms baselines in capturing higher-order statistics, such as variance, skewness, and kurtosis, at a fraction of the training cost. To generalize to unseen perturbations, we incorporate prior knowledge via gene embeddings from large language models (LLMs).

Such analyses require multivariate models capable of accounting for the complex correlation structures between microbes and metabolites. However, existing multivariate models often suffer from low statistical power for detecting microbiome-metabolome interactions due to small sample sizes and weak biological signals. To address these challenges, we introduce CoMMiT, Co-informed inference of Microbiome-Metabolome Interactions via novel Transfer learning models. Unlike conventional transfer-learning methods that borrow information from external datasets, CoMMiT leverages similarities across metabolites within a single cohort, reducing the risk of negative transfer often caused by differences in sequencing platforms and bioinformatic pipelines across studies. CoMMiT operates under the flexible assumption that auxiliary metabolites are collectively informative for the target metabolite, without requiring individual auxiliary metabolites to be informative. CoMMiT uses a novel data-driven approach to selecting the optimal set of auxiliary metabolites. Using this optimal set, CoMMiT employs a de-biasing framework to enable efficient calculation of p-values, facilitating the identification of statistically significant microbiome-metabolome interactions. Applying CoMMiT to a feeding study reveals biologically meaningful microbiome-metabolome interactions under a low glycemic load diet, demonstrating the diet-host link through gut metabolism.",

Using a two-stage approach, CN-SBM decomposes CNV data into primary and residual components, enabling detection of both large-scale chromosomal alterations and finer aberrations. We derive a scalable variational inference algorithm for application to large cohorts and high-resolution data. Benchmarks on simulated and real datasets show improved model fit over existing methods. Applied to TCGA low-grade glioma data, CN-SBM reveals clinically relevant subtypes and structured residual variation, aiding patient stratification in survival analysis.

    "abstract": "A key challenge in learning from multimodal biological data is missing modalities, where all data from some modalities are missing for some patients. Current fusion methods address this by excluding patients with missing modalities, imputing missing modalities, or making predictions directly with partial modalities. However, they often struggle with diverse missing-modality patterns and the exponential growth of the number of such patterns as the number of modalities increases. To address these limitations, we propose MAGNET (Missing-modality-Aware Graph neural NETwork) for direct prediction with partial modalities, which introduces a patient-modality multi-head attention mechanism to fuse lower-dimensional modality embeddings based on their importance and missingness. MAGNET's complexity increases linearly with the number of modalities while adapting to missing-pattern variability. To generate predictions, MAGNET further constructs a patient graph with fused multimodal embeddings as node features and the connectivity determined by the modality missingness, followed by a conventional graph neural network. Experiments on three public multiomics datasets for cancer classification, with real-world instead of artificial missingness, show that MAGNET outperforms the state-of-the-art fusion methods.

We trace this anomaly to a metric artifact: control-referenced deltas and unweighted error metrics reward mode collapse whenever the control is biased or the biological signal is sparse. Large-scale \\textit{in silico} simulations and analysis of two real-world perturbation datasets confirm that shared reference shifts, not genuine biological change, drives high performance in these evaluations. We introduce differentially expressed gene (DEG)-aware metrics, weighted mean-squared error (WMSE) and weighted delta $R^{2}$ ($R^{2}_{w}(Δ)$) with respect to all perturbations, that measure error in niche signals with high sensitivity. We further introduce negative and positive performance baselines to calibrate these metrics. With these improvements, the mean baseline sinks to null performance while genuine predictors are correctly rewarded. Finally, we show that using WMSE as a loss function reduces mode collapse and improves model performance.",

Several diagnostic methods, such as imaging modalities and Serum Alpha-Fetoprotein (AFP) testing, have been used for HCC detection; however, their effectiveness is limited to later stages of the disease. In contrast, transcriptomic analysis of biposy samples has shown promise for early detection. While machine learning techniques have been applied to transcriptomic data for cancer detection, their clinical adoption remains limited due to challenges such as poor generalizability across different datasets, lack of interpretability, and high computational complexity. To address these limitations, we developed a novel predictive formula for HCC detection using the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN). This formula is based on the expression levels of five genes: VIPR1, CYP1A2, FCN3, ECM1, and LIFR. Derived from the GSE25097 dataset, the formula offers a simple, interpretable, efficient, and accessible approach for HCC identification. It achieves 99% accuracy on the GSE25097 test set and demonstrates robust performance on six additional independent datasets, achieving accuracies of above 90% in all cases. These findings highlight the critical role of these five genes as biomarkers for HCC detection, offering a foundation for future research and clinical applications to improve HCC diagnostic approaches.",

    "title": "Uncovering smooth structures in single-cell data with PCS-guided neighbor embeddings",
    "abstract": "Single-cell sequencing is revolutionizing biology by enabling detailed investigations of cell-state transitions. Many biological processes unfold along continuous trajectories, yet it remains challenging to extract smooth, low-dimensional representations from inherently noisy, high-dimensional single-cell data. Neighbor embedding (NE) algorithms, such as t-SNE and UMAP, are widely used to embed high-dimensional single-cell data into low dimensions. But they often introduce undesirable distortions, resulting in misleading interpretations. Existing evaluation methods for NE algorithms primarily focus on separating discrete cell types rather than capturing continuous cell-state transitions, while dynamic modeling approaches rely on strong assumptions about cellular processes and specialized data. To address these challenges, we build on the Predictability-Computability-Stability (PCS) framework for reliable and reproducible data-driven discoveries. First, we systematically evaluate popular NE algorithms through empirical analysis, simulation, and theory, and reveal their key shortcomings, such as artifacts and instability. We then introduce NESS, a principled and interpretable machine learning approach to improve NE representations by leveraging algorithmic stability and to enable robust inference of smooth biological structures. NESS offers useful concepts, quantitative stability metrics, and efficient computational workflows to uncover developmental trajectories and cell-state transitions in single-cell data. Finally, we apply NESS to six single-cell datasets, spanning pluripotent stem cell differentiation, organoid development, and multiple tissue-specific lineage trajectories. Across these diverse contexts, NESS consistently yields useful biological insights, such as identification of transitional and stable cell states and quantification of transcriptional dynamics during development.",

    "title": "BMFM-DNA: A SNP-aware DNA foundation model to capture variant effects",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) trained on text demonstrated remarkable results on natural language processing (NLP) tasks. These models have been adapted to decipher the language of DNA, where sequences of nucleotides act as \"words\" that encode genomic functions. However, the genome differs fundamentally from natural language, as it lacks clearly defined words or a consistent grammar. Although DNA language models (DNALMs) such as DNABERT, GENA-LM have achieved high level of performance on genome-related biological tasks, these models do not encode biological functions in the presence of sequence variations. To address this problem, we pre-train foundation models that effectively integrate sequence variations, in particular Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), as they underlie important biological functions. Specifically, we use ModernBERT to pre-train two different Biomedical Foundation Models (BMFM), namely, BMFM-DNA-REF in which the model is trained with sequences of varying lengths along with their reverse complements derived from the reference genome and BMFM-DNA-SNP in which the model is trained with sequences created using a novel representation scheme that encodes sequence variations. Our findings indicate that integrating sequence variations into DNALMs helps capture the biological functions as seen in improvements on all fine-tuning tasks. To explore the model's practical utility, we experimented with various strategies for SNP imputation on promoter detection task introduced in DNABERT-2. However, we acknowledge that the current benchmarks are limited in their ability to fully evaluate these models. To enable more comprehensive assessment in the future and encourage community contributions, we release our models through HuggingFace and the code to reproduce the results at https://github.com/BiomedSciAI/biomed-multi-omic",

    "abstract": "Optimal transport provides a robust framework for comparing probability distributions. Its effectiveness is significantly influenced by the choice of the underlying ground metric. Traditionally, the ground metric has either been (i) predefined, e.g., as the Euclidean distance, or (ii) learned in a supervised way, by utilizing labeled data to learn a suitable ground metric for enhanced task-specific performance. Yet, predefined metrics typically cannot account for the inherent structure and varying importance of different features in the data, and existing supervised approaches to ground metric learning often do not generalize across multiple classes or are restricted to distributions with shared supports. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach for learning metrics for arbitrary distributions over a shared metric space. Our method provides a distance between individual points like a global metric, but requires only class labels on a distribution-level for training. The learned global ground metric enables more accurate optimal transport distances, leading to improved performance in embedding, clustering and classification tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness and interpretability of our approach using patient-level scRNA-seq data spanning multiple diseases.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptomic foundation models (TFMs) have recently emerged as powerful tools for analyzing gene expression in cells and tissues, supporting key tasks such as cell-type annotation, batch correction, and perturbation prediction. However, the diversity of model implementations and training strategies across recent TFMs, though promising, makes it challenging to isolate the contribution of individual design choices or evaluate their potential synergies. This hinders the field's ability to converge on best practices and limits the reproducibility of insights across studies. We present BMFM-RNA, an open-source, modular software package that unifies diverse TFM pretraining and fine-tuning objectives within a single framework. Leveraging this capability, we introduce a novel training objective, whole cell expression decoder (WCED), which captures global expression patterns using an autoencoder-like CLS bottleneck representation. In this paper, we describe the framework, supported input representations, and training objectives. We evaluated four model checkpoints pretrained on CELLxGENE using combinations of masked language modeling (MLM), WCED and multitask learning. Using the benchmarking capabilities of BMFM-RNA, we show that WCED-based models achieve performance that matches or exceeds state-of-the-art approaches like scGPT across more than a dozen datasets in both zero-shot and fine-tuning tasks. BMFM-RNA, available as part of the biomed-multi-omics project ( https://github.com/BiomedSciAI/biomed-multi-omic ), offers a reproducible foundation for systematic benchmarking and community-driven exploration of optimal TFM training strategies, enabling the development of more effective tools to leverage the latest advances in AI for understanding cell biology.",

Our contributions are threefold: we leverage Laplacian Positional Encodings (LPEs) to enrich the latent space with crucial cellular relationship information; we develop a conditional score-based diffusion model for effective learning and generation from complex scRNA-seq distributions; and we employ a unique spectral adversarial training scheme on graph edge weights, boosting robustness against structural variations. Extensive experiments on diverse scRNA-seq datasets demonstrate LapDDPM's superior performance, achieving high fidelity and generating biologically-plausible, cell-type-specific samples.

    "abstract": "Motivation: Spliced alignment refers to the alignment of messenger RNA (mRNA) or protein sequences to eukaryotic genomes. It plays a critical role in gene annotation and the study of gene functions. Accurate spliced alignment demands sophisticated modeling of splice sites, but current aligners use simple models, which may affect their accuracy given dissimilar sequences.   Results: We implemented minisplice to learn splice signals with a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) and trained a model with 7,026 parameters for vertebrate and insect genomes. It captures conserved splice signals across phyla and reveals GC-rich introns specific to mammals and birds. We used this model to estimate the empirical splicing probability for every GT and AG in genomes, and modified minimap2 and miniprot to leverage pre-computed splicing probability during alignment. Evaluation on human long-read RNA-seq data and cross-species protein datasets showed our method greatly improves the junction accuracy especially for noisy long RNA-seq reads and proteins of distant homology.

    "abstract": "Generative AI foundation models offer transformative potential for processing structured biological data, particularly in single-cell RNA sequencing, where datasets are rapidly scaling toward billions of cells. We propose the use of agentic foundation models with real-time web search to automate the labeling of experimental data, achieving up to 82.5% accuracy. This addresses a key bottleneck in supervised learning for structured omics data by increasing annotation throughput without manual curation and human error. Our approach enables the development of virtual cell foundation models capable of downstream tasks such as cell-typing and perturbation prediction. As data volume grows, these models may surpass human performance in labeling, paving the way for reliable inference in large-scale perturbation screens. This application demonstrates domain-specific innovation in health monitoring and diagnostics, aligned with efforts like the Human Cell Atlas and Human Tumor Atlas Network.",

    "title": "Viral Dark Matter: Illuminating Protein Function, Ecology, and Biotechnological Promises",
    "abstract": "Viruses are the most abundant biological entities on Earth and play central roles in shaping microbiomes and influencing ecosystem functions. Yet, most viral genes remain uncharacterized, comprising what is commonly referred to as \"viral dark matter.\" Metagenomic studies across diverse environments consistently show that 40-90% of viral genes lack known homologs or annotated functions. This persistent knowledge gap limits our ability to interpret viral sequence data, understand virus-host interactions, and assess the ecological or applied significance of viral genes. Among the most intriguing components of viral dark matter are auxiliary viral genes (AVGs), including auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs), regulatory genes (AReGs), and host physiology-modifying genes (APGs), which may alter host function during infection and contribute to microbial metabolism, stress tolerance, or resistance. In this review, we explore recent advances in the discovery and functional characterization of viral dark matter. We highlight representative examples of novel viral proteins across diverse ecosystems including human microbiomes, soil, oceans, and extreme environments, and discuss what is known, and still unknown, about their roles. We then examine the bioinformatic and experimental challenges that hinder functional characterization, and present emerging strategies to overcome these barriers. Finally, we highlight both the fundamental and applied benefits that multidisciplinary efforts to characterize viral proteins can bring. By integrating computational predictions with experimental validation, and fostering collaboration across disciplines, we emphasize that illuminating viral dark matter is both feasible and essential for advancing microbial ecology and unlocking new tools for biotechnology.",

    "abstract": "Spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies enable gene expression profiling with spatial resolution, offering unprecedented insights into tissue organization and disease heterogeneity. However, current analysis methods often struggle with noisy data, limited scalability, and inadequate modelling of complex cellular relationships. We present SemanticST, a biologically informed, graph-based deep learning framework that models diverse cellular contexts through multi-semantic graph construction. SemanticST builds multiple context-specific graphs capturing spatial proximity, gene expression similarity, and tissue domain structure, and learns disentangled embeddings for each. These are fused using an attention-inspired strategy to yield a unified, biologically meaningful representation. A community-aware min-cut loss improves robustness over contrastive learning, particularly in sparse ST data. SemanticST supports mini-batch training, making it the first graph neural network scalable to large-scale datasets such as Xenium (500,000 cells). Benchmarking across four platforms (Visium, Slide-seq, Stereo-seq, Xenium) and multiple human and mouse tissues shows consistent 20 percentage gains in ARI, NMI, and trajectory fidelity over DeepST, GraphST, and IRIS. In re-analysis of breast cancer Xenium data, SemanticST revealed rare and clinically significant niches, including triple receptor-positive clusters, spatially distinct DCIS-to-IDC transition zones, and FOXC2 tumour-associated myoepithelial cells, suggesting non-canonical EMT programs with stem-like features. SemanticST thus provides a scalable, interpretable, and biologically grounded framework for spatial transcriptomics analysis, enabling robust discovery across tissue types and diseases, and paving the way for spatially resolved tissue atlases and next-generation precision medicine.",

    "abstract": "Raw signal genome analysis (RSGA) has emerged as a promising approach to enable real-time genome analysis by directly analyzing raw electrical signals. However, rapid advancements in sequencing technologies make it increasingly difficult for software-based RSGA to match the throughput of raw signal generation. This paper demonstrates that while hardware acceleration techniques can significantly accelerate RSGA, the high volume of genomic data shifts the performance and energy bottleneck from computation to I/O data movement. As sequencing throughput increases, I/O overhead becomes the main contributor to both runtime and energy consumption. Therefore, there is a need to design a high-performance, energy-efficient system for RSGA that can both alleviate the data movement bottleneck and provide large acceleration capabilities. We propose MARS, a storage-centric system that leverages the heterogeneous resources within modern storage systems (e.g., storage-internal DRAM, storage controller, flash chips) alongside their large storage capacity to tackle both data movement and computational overheads of RSGA in an area-efficient and low-cost manner. MARS accelerates RSGA through a novel hardware/software co-design approach. First, MARS modifies the RSGA pipeline via two filtering mechanisms and a quantization scheme, reducing hardware demands and optimizing for in-storage execution. Second, MARS accelerates the RSGA steps directly within the storage by leveraging both Processing-Near-Memory and Processing-Using-Memory paradigms. Third, MARS orchestrates the execution of all steps to fully exploit in-storage parallelism and minimize data movement. Our evaluation shows that MARS outperforms basecalling-based software and hardware-accelerated state-of-the-art read mapping pipelines by 93x and 40x, on average across different datasets, while reducing their energy consumption by 427x and 72x.",

    "abstract": "Genomic language models (gLMs) hold promise for generating novel, functional DNA sequences for synthetic biology. However, realizing this potential requires models to go beyond evolutionary plausibility and understand how DNA sequence encodes gene expression and regulation. We introduce a benchmark called Nullsettes, which assesses how well models can predict in silico loss-of-function (LOF) mutations, in synthetic expression cassettes with little evolutionary precedent. Testing 12 state-of-the-art gLMs, we find that most fail to consistently detect these strong LOF mutations. All models show a sharp drop in predictive accuracy as the likelihood assigned to the original (nonmutant) sequence decreases, suggesting that gLMs rely heavily on pattern-matching to their evolutionary prior rather than on any mechanistic understanding of gene expression. Our findings highlight fundamental limitations in how gLMs generalize to engineered, non-natural sequences, and underscore the need for benchmarks and modeling strategies that prioritize functional understanding.",

To do so, we first obtained the 100 top AD risk genes, whose baseline spatial transcriptional profiles were obtained from the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA).

    "abstract": "Single-cell transcriptomics and proteomics have become a great source for data-driven insights into biology, enabling the use of advanced deep learning methods to understand cellular heterogeneity and gene expression at the single-cell level. With the advent of spatial-omics data, we have the promise of characterizing cells within their tissue context as it provides both spatial coordinates and intra-cellular transcriptional or protein counts. Proteomics offers a complementary view by directly measuring proteins, which are the primary effectors of cellular function and key therapeutic targets. However, existing models either ignore the spatial information or the complex genetic and proteomic programs within cells. Thus they cannot infer how cell internal regulation adapts to microenvironmental cues. Furthermore, these models often utilize fixed gene vocabularies, hindering their generalizability unseen genes. In this paper, we introduce HEIST, a hierarchical graph transformer foundation model for spatial transcriptomics and proteomics. HEIST models tissues as hierarchical graphs. The higher level graph is a spatial cell graph, and each cell in turn, is represented by its lower level gene co-expression network graph. HEIST achieves this by performing both intra-level and cross-level message passing to utilize the hierarchy in its embeddings and can thus generalize to novel datatypes including spatial proteomics without retraining. HEIST is pretrained on 22.3M cells from 124 tissues across 15 organs using spatially-aware contrastive and masked autoencoding objectives. Unsupervised analysis of HEIST embeddings reveals spatially informed subpopulations missed by prior models. Downstream evaluations demonstrate generalizability to proteomics data and state-of-the-art performance in clinical outcome prediction, cell type annotation, and gene imputation across multiple technologies.",

    "abstract": "As a core mechanism of epigenetic regulation in eukaryotes, protein post-translational modifications (PTMs) require precise prediction to decipher dynamic life activity networks. To address the limitations of existing deep learning models in cross-modal feature fusion, domain generalization, and architectural optimization, this study proposes UniPTMs: the first unified framework for multi-type PTM prediction. The framework innovatively establishes a \"Master-Slave\" dual-path collaborative architecture: The master path dynamically integrates high-dimensional representations of protein sequences, structures, and evolutionary information through a Bidirectional Gated Cross-Attention (BGCA) module, while the slave path optimizes feature discrepancies and recalibration between structural and traditional features using a Low-Dimensional Fusion Network (LDFN). Complemented by a Multi-scale Adaptive convolutional Pyramid (MACP) for capturing local feature patterns and a Bidirectional Hierarchical Gated Fusion Network (BHGFN) enabling multi-level feature integration across paths, the framework employs a Hierarchical Dynamic Weighting Fusion (HDWF) mechanism to intelligently aggregate multimodal features. Enhanced by a novel Hierarchical Contrastive loss function for feature consistency optimization, UniPTMs demonstrates significant performance improvements (3.2%-11.4% MCC and 4.2%-14.3% AP increases) over state-of-the-art models across five modification types and transcends the Single-Type Prediction Paradigm. To strike a balance between model complexity and performance, we have also developed a lightweight variant named UniPTMs-mini.",

To address this limitation, we introduce cGSA, a novel AI-driven framework that enhances GSA by incorporating context-aware pathway prioritization. cGSA integrates gene cluster detection, enrichment analysis, and large language models to identify pathways that are not only statistically significant but also biologically meaningful. Benchmarking on 102 manually curated gene sets across 19 diseases and ten disease-related biological mechanisms shows that cGSA outperforms baseline methods by over 30%, with expert validation confirming its increased precision and interpretability.

Our ensemble designs use minimal trainable parameters but require long-range connections between qubits. We tested these quantum ensembles on synthetic datasets and gene expression data from renal cell carcinoma patients with the task of predicting patient response to immunotherapy. From the performance observed in simulation and initial hardware experiments, we demonstrate how quantum embedding structure affects performance and discuss how to extract informative features and build models that can learn and generalize effectively.

    "abstract": "Natural Language Processing (NLP) has transformed various fields beyond linguistics by applying techniques originally developed for human language to the analysis of biological sequences. This review explores the application of NLP methods to biological sequence data, focusing on genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics. We examine how various NLP methods, from classic approaches like word2vec to advanced models employing transformers and hyena operators, are being adapted to analyze DNA, RNA, protein sequences, and entire genomes. The review also examines tokenization strategies and model architectures, evaluating their strengths, limitations, and suitability for different biological tasks. We further cover recent advances in NLP applications for biological data, such as structure prediction, gene expression, and evolutionary analysis, highlighting the potential of these methods for extracting meaningful insights from large-scale genomic data. As language models continue to advance, their integration into bioinformatics holds immense promise for advancing our understanding of biological processes in all domains of life.",

While the AnnData format is the community standard for storing single-cell datasets, existing data loading solutions for AnnData are often inadequate: some require loading all data into memory, others convert to dense formats that increase storage demands, and many are hampered by slow random disk access. We present scDataset, a PyTorch IterableDataset that operates directly on one or more AnnData files without the need for format conversion. The core innovation is a combination of block sampling and batched fetching, which together balance randomness and I/O efficiency. On the Tahoe 100M dataset, scDataset achieves up to a 48$\\times$ speed-up over AnnLoader, a 27$\\times$ speed-up over HuggingFace Datasets, and an 18$\\times$ speed-up over BioNeMo in single-core settings.

    "abstract": "Climate change is a major threat to crop potential and is characterized by both long-term shifts in temperature and precipitation patterns as well as increased occurrence of extreme weather events, these extreme weather events are the most immediate and intractable threat to agriculture. Crop resilience in the face of stress depends upon the speed and effectiveness with which plants and cropping systems sense and respond to that stress. A variety of agronomic practices including breeding, exogenous inputs (nutrients, water, biostimulants and others) and shifts in cultivation practice have been used to influence plant stress response to achieve the goal of increased plant and cropping system resilience. Traditional breeding is a powerful tool that has resulted in stable and long-term cultivar improvements but is often too slow and complex to meet the diverse, complex and unpredictable challenges of climate induced stresses. Increased inputs (water, nutrients, pesticides etc.) and management strategies (cropping system choice, soil management etc.) can alleviate stress but are often constrained by cost and availability of inputs. Exogenous biostimulants, microbials and plant hormones have shown great promise as mechanisms to optimize natural plant resilience resulting in immediate but non-permanent improvements in plant responses to climate induced stresses. The failure to modernize regulatory frameworks for the use of biostimulants in agriculture will constrain the development of safe effective tools and deprive growers of means to respond to the vagaries of climate change. Here we discuss the scientific rationale for eliminating the regulatory barriers that constrain the potential for biostimulants or products that modulate plant regulatory networks to address climate change challenges and propose a framework for enabling legislation to strengthen cropping system resilience.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that integrating multimodal data fusion techniques for imaging and genetic features is beneficial for the etiological analysis and predictive diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, there are several critical flaws in current deep learning methods. Firstly, there has been insufficient discussion and exploration regarding the selection and encoding of genetic information. Secondly, due to the significantly superior classification value of AD imaging features compared to genetic features, many studies in multimodal fusion emphasize the strengths of imaging features, actively mitigating the influence of weaker features, thereby diminishing the learning of the unique value of genetic features. To address this issue, this study proposes the dynamic multimodal role-swapping network (GenDMR). In GenDMR, we develop a novel approach to encode the spatial organization of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), enhancing the representation of their genomic context. Additionally, to adaptively quantify the disease risk of SNPs and brain region, we propose a multi-instance attention module to enhance model interpretability. Furthermore, we introduce a dominant modality selection module and a contrastive self-distillation module, combining them to achieve a dynamic teacher-student role exchange mechanism based on dominant and auxiliary modalities for bidirectional co-updating of different modal data. Finally, GenDMR achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ADNI public dataset and visualizes attention to different SNPs, focusing on confirming 12 potential high-risk genes related to AD, including the most classic APOE and recently highlighted significant risk genes. This demonstrates GenDMR's interpretable analytical capability in exploring AD genetic features, providing new insights and perspectives for the development of multimodal data fusion techniques.",

With the emergence of disease-modifying therapies, predicting disease risk before symptom onset has become critical. We introduce DuAL-Net, a hybrid deep learning framework for AD dementia prediction using whole genome sequencing (WGS) data. DuAL-Net integrates two components: local probability modeling, which segments the genome into non-overlapping windows, and global annotation-based modeling, which annotates SNPs and reorganizes WGS input to capture long-range functional relationships. Both employ out-of-fold stacking with TabNet and Random Forest classifiers. Final predictions combine local and global probabilities using an optimized weighting parameter alpha. We analyzed WGS data from 1,050 individuals (443 cognitively normal, 607 AD dementia) using five-fold cross-validation. DuAL-Net achieved an AUC of 0.671 using top-ranked SNPs, representing 35.0% and 20.3% higher performance than bottom-ranked and randomly selected SNPs, respectively. ROC analysis demonstrated strong positive correlation between SNP prioritization rank and predictive power. The model identified known AD-associated SNPs as top contributors alongside potentially novel variants. DuAL-Net presents a promising framework improving both predictive accuracy and biological interpretability.

METHODS: We developed a transformer-based ensemble model (TrUE-Net) using Monte Carlo Dropout for uncertainty estimation in AD classification from whole-genome sequencing (WGS). We combined a transformer that preserves single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sequence structure with a concurrent random forest using flattened genotypes. An uncertainty threshold separated samples into an uncertain (high-variance) group and a more certain (low-variance) group. RESULTS: We analyzed 1050 individuals, holding out half for testing. Overall accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) were 0.6514 and 0.6636, respectively. Excluding the uncertain group improved accuracy from 0.6263 to 0.7287 (10.24% increase) and F1 from 0.5843 to 0.8205 (23.62% increase).

    "abstract": "Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) analysis is a powerful, minimally invasive tool for monitoring disease progression, treatment response, and early detection. A major challenge, however, is accurately determining the tissue of origin, especially in complex or heterogeneous disease contexts. To address this, we developed a machine learning framework that leverages tissue-specific DNA methylation signatures to classify both tissue and disease origin from cfDNA data. Our model integrates methylation datasets across diverse epigenomic platforms, including Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS), Illumina Infinium Bead Arrays, and Enzymatic Methyl-seq (EM-seq). To account for platform variability and data sparsity, we applied imputation strategies and harmonized CpG features to enable cross-platform learning. Dimensionality reduction revealed clear tissue-specific clustering of methylation profiles. A random forest classifier trained on these features achieved consistent classification performance (accuracy 0.75-0.8 across test sets and platforms). Notably, our model distinguished clinically relevant tissues such as inflamed synovium and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in arthritis patients and deconvoluted synthetic cfDNA mixtures mimicking real-world liquid biopsy samples. The predicted tissue proportions closely matched the true values, demonstrating the model's potential for both classification and quantitative inference. These results support the feasibility of using cross-platform methylation data and machine learning for scalable, generalizable cfDNA diagnostics and lay the groundwork for future integration of disease-specific epigenetic features to guide clinical decision-making in precision medicine.",

Faced with regional disparities in medical resources and the high cost of genomic assays, using artificial intelligence to infer these mutations and exon variants from routine histopathology images could greatly facilitate precision therapy. Although some prior studies have shown that deep learning can accelerate the prediction of key gene mutations from lung cancer pathology slides, their performance remains suboptimal and has so far been limited mainly to early screening tasks. To address these limitations, we have assembled PathGene, which comprises histopathology images paired with next-generation sequencing reports from 1,576 patients at the Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, and 448 TCGA-LUAD patients. This multi-center dataset links whole-slide images to driver gene mutation status, mutation subtypes, exon, and tumor mutational burden (TMB) status, with the goal of leveraging pathology images to predict mutations, subtypes, exon locations, and TMB for early genetic screening and to advance precision oncology. Unlike existing datasets, we provide molecular-level information related to histopathology images in PathGene to facilitate the development of biomarker prediction models. We benchmarked 11 multiple-instance learning methods on PathGene for mutation, subtype, exon, and TMB prediction tasks. These experimental methods provide valuable alternatives for early genetic screening of lung cancer patients and assisting clinicians to quickly develop personalized precision targeted treatment plans for patients.

Current methods often lead to contamination or platelet loss, compromising data quality and reproducibility.   Objectives: This study aimed to optimize a platelet isolation technique that yields high-purity samples with minimal loss and to identify the most effective mass spectrometry-based proteomic method for analyzing platelet proteins with optimal coverage and sensitivity.   Methods: We refined an isolation protocol by adjusting centrifugation time to reduce blood volume requirements while preserving platelet yield and purity. Using this optimized method, we evaluated three proteomic approaches: Label-free Quantification with Data-Independent Acquisition (LFQ-DIA), Label-free Quantification with Data-Dependent Acquisition (LFQ-DDA), and Tandem Mass Tag labeling with DDA (TMT-DDA).   Results: LFQ-DIA demonstrated superior protein coverage and sensitivity compared to LFQ-DDA and TMT-DDA. The refined isolation protocol effectively minimized contamination and platelet loss. Additionally, age-related differences in platelet protein composition were observed, highlighting the importance of using age-matched controls in biomarker discovery studies.   Conclusions: The optimized platelet isolation protocol provides a cost-effective and reliable method for preparing high-purity samples for proteomics. LFQ-DIA is the most suitable approach for comprehensive platelet protein analysis.

Empirical studies show that their formation correlates with local patterns of epigenetic markers, yet the precise mechanisms linking 1D epigenetic landscapes to 3D chromatin folding remain unclear. Recent models represent chromatin as a spin system, where nucleosomes are treated as discrete-state variables coupled by interaction strengths derived from genomic and epigenomic data. Classical samplers struggle with these models due to high frustration and dense couplings. Here, we present a quantum annealing (QA) approach to efficiently sample chromatin states, embedding an epigenetic Ising model into the topology of D-Wave quantum processors.",

    "abstract": "DNA, encoding genetic instructions for almost all living organisms, fuels groundbreaking advances in genomics and synthetic biology. Recently, DNA Foundation Models have achieved success in designing synthetic functional DNA sequences, even whole genomes, but their susceptibility to jailbreaking remains underexplored, leading to potential concern of generating harmful sequences such as pathogens or toxin-producing genes. In this paper, we introduce GeneBreaker, the first framework to systematically evaluate jailbreak vulnerabilities of DNA foundation models. GeneBreaker employs (1) an LLM agent with customized bioinformatic tools to design high-homology, non-pathogenic jailbreaking prompts, (2) beam search guided by PathoLM and log-probability heuristics to steer generation toward pathogen-like sequences, and (3) a BLAST-based evaluation pipeline against a curated Human Pathogen Database (JailbreakDNABench) to detect successful jailbreaks. Evaluated on our JailbreakDNABench, GeneBreaker successfully jailbreaks the latest Evo series models across 6 viral categories consistently (up to 60\\% Attack Success Rate for Evo2-40B). Further case studies on SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and HIV-1 envelope protein demonstrate the sequence and structural fidelity of jailbreak output, while evolutionary modeling of SARS-CoV-2 underscores biosecurity risks. Our findings also reveal that scaling DNA foundation models amplifies dual-use risks, motivating enhanced safety alignment and tracing mechanisms.

    "abstract": "Inspired by the great success of Masked Language Modeling (MLM) in the natural language domain, the paradigm of self-supervised pre-training and fine-tuning has also achieved remarkable progress in the field of DNA sequence modeling. However, previous methods often relied on massive pre-training data or large-scale base models with huge parameters, imposing a significant computational burden. To address this, many works attempted to use more compact models to achieve similar outcomes but still fell short by a considerable margin. In this work, we propose a Hybrid Architecture Distillation (HAD) approach, leveraging both distillation and reconstruction tasks for more efficient and effective pre-training. Specifically, we employ the NTv2-500M as the teacher model and devise a grouping masking strategy to align the feature embeddings of visible tokens while concurrently reconstructing the invisible tokens during MLM pre-training. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we conducted comprehensive experiments on the Nucleotide Transformer Benchmark and Genomic Benchmark. Compared to models with similar parameters, our model achieved excellent performance. More surprisingly, it even surpassed the distillation ceiling-teacher model on some sub-tasks, which is more than 500 $\\times$ larger. Lastly, we utilize t-SNE for more intuitive visualization, which shows that our model can gain a sophisticated understanding of the intrinsic representation pattern in genomic sequences.",

Although transformer-based language models (LMs) can effectively capture patterns in regulatory DNA, their generative approaches often struggle to produce novel sequences with reliable cell-specific activity. Here, we introduce Ctrl-DNA, a novel constrained reinforcement learning (RL) framework tailored for designing regulatory DNA sequences with controllable cell-type specificity. By formulating regulatory sequence design as a biologically informed constrained optimization problem, we apply RL to autoregressive genomic LMs, enabling the models to iteratively refine sequences that maximize regulatory activity in targeted cell types while constraining off-target effects. Our evaluation on human promoters and enhancers demonstrates that Ctrl-DNA consistently outperforms existing generative and RL-based approaches, generating high-fitness regulatory sequences and achieving state-of-the-art cell-type specificity. Moreover, Ctrl-DNA-generated sequences capture key cell-type-specific transcription factor binding sites (TFBS), short DNA motifs recognized by regulatory proteins that control gene expression, demonstrating the biological plausibility of the generated sequences.",

Here, we revisit genome compartmentalization by examining the role of in vivo DNA packing density fluctuations driven by ATP dependent chromatin remodelers. Leveraging DNA accessibility data, we develop a polymer based model that captures these fluctuations and successfully reproduces genome wide compartment patterns observed in HiC data, without invoking homotypic interactions. Further analysis reveals that density fluctuations in a crowded nuclear environment elevate the system energy, while euchromatin heterochromatin segregation facilitates energy dissipation, offering a thermodynamic advantage for spontaneous compartment formation. These findings suggest that euchromatin heterochromatin segregation may arise through a non equilibrium, self organizing process, providing new insights into genome organization.",

We conducted sex-stratified genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and Post-GWAS analyses to identify genetic variants associated with accelerated brain aging. Distinct gene sets emerged by sex: in females, neurotransmitter transport and mitochondrial stress response genes were implicated; in males, immune and inflammation-related genes dominated. Shared genes, including GMNC and OSTN, were consistently linked to brain volumes across sexes, suggesting core roles in neurostructural maintenance. Tissue expression analyses revealed sex-specific enrichment in pathways tied to neurodegeneration. These findings highlight the importance of sex-stratified approaches in aging research and suggest genetic targets for personalized interventions against age-related cognitive decline.",

    "abstract": "Spatial transcriptomics (ST) has emerged as a powerful technology for bridging histology imaging with gene expression profiling. However, its application has been limited by low throughput and the need for specialized experimental facilities. Prior works sought to predict ST from whole-slide histology images to accelerate this process, but they suffer from two major limitations. First, they do not explicitly model cell-cell interaction as they factorize the joint distribution of whole-slide ST data and predict the gene expression of each spot independently. Second, their encoders struggle with memory constraints due to the large number of spots (often exceeding 10,000) in typical ST datasets. Herein, we propose STFlow, a flow matching generative model that considers cell-cell interaction by modeling the joint distribution of gene expression of an entire slide. It also employs an efficient slide-level encoder with local spatial attention, enabling whole-slide processing without excessive memory overhead. On the recently curated HEST-1k and STImage-1K4M benchmarks, STFlow substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and achieves over 18% relative improvements over the pathology foundation models.",

    "title": "JanusDNA: A Powerful Bi-directional Hybrid DNA Foundation Model",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing and are increasingly applied to other sequential data types, including genetic sequences. However, adapting LLMs to genomics presents significant challenges. Capturing complex genomic interactions requires modeling long-range dependencies within DNA sequences, where interactions often span over 10,000 base pairs, even within a single gene, posing substantial computational burdens under conventional model architectures and training paradigms. Moreover, standard LLM training approaches are suboptimal for DNA: autoregressive training, while efficient, supports only unidirectional understanding. However, DNA is inherently bidirectional, e.g., bidirectional promoters regulate transcription in both directions and account for nearly 11% of human gene expression. Masked language models (MLMs) allow bidirectional understanding but are inefficient, as only masked tokens contribute to the loss per step. To address these limitations, we introduce JanusDNA, the first bidirectional DNA foundation model built upon a novel pretraining paradigm that combines the optimization efficiency of autoregressive modeling with the bidirectional comprehension of masked modeling. JanusDNA adopts a hybrid Mamba, Attention and Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, combining long-range modeling of Attention with efficient sequential learning of Mamba. MoE layers further scale model capacity via sparse activation while keeping computational cost low. Notably, JanusDNA processes up to 1 million base pairs at single nucleotide resolution on a single 80GB GPU. Extensive experiments and ablations show JanusDNA achieves new SOTA results on three genomic representation benchmarks, outperforming models with 250x more activated parameters.

    "abstract": "Sequencing a genome to determine an individual's DNA produces an enormous number of short nucleotide subsequences known as reads, which must be reassembled to reconstruct the full genome. We present a method for analyzing this type of data using contrastive learning, in which an encoder model is trained to produce embeddings that cluster together sequences from the same genomic region. The sequential nature of genomic regions is preserved in the form of trajectories through this embedding space. Trained solely to reflect the structure of the genome, the resulting model provides a general representation of $k$-mer sequences, suitable for a range of downstream tasks involving read data. We apply our framework to learn the structure of the $E.\\ coli$ genome, and demonstrate its use in simulated ancient DNA (aDNA) read mapping and identification of structural variations. Furthermore, we illustrate the potential of using this type of model for metagenomic species identification. We show how incorporating a domain-specific noise model can enhance embedding robustness, and how a supervised contrastive learning setting can be adopted when a linear reference genome is available, by introducing a distance thresholding parameter $Γ$. The model can also be trained fully self-supervised on read data, enabling analysis without the need to construct a full genome assembly using specialized algorithms. Small prediction heads based on a pre-trained embedding are shown to perform on par with BWA-aln, the current gold standard approach for aDNA mapping, in terms of accuracy and runtime for short genomes. Given the method's favorable scaling properties with respect to total genome size, inference using our approach is highly promising for metagenomic applications and for mapping to genomes comparable in size to the human genome.",

Natural infection cohorts often lack pre-exposure baseline data and structured temporal sampling. In contrast, inoculation and vaccination trials generate insightful longitudinal transcriptomic data. However, the scattering of these datasets across platforms, along with inconsistent metadata and preprocessing procedure, hinders AI-driven discovery. To address these challenges, we developed the Human Respiratory Viral Immunization LongitudinAl Gene Expression (HR-VILAGE-3K3M) repository: an AI-ready, rigorously curated dataset that integrates 14,136 RNA-seq profiles from 3,178 subjects across 66 studies encompassing over 2.56 million cells. Spanning vaccination, inoculation, and mixed exposures, the dataset includes microarray, bulk RNA-seq, and single-cell RNA-seq from whole blood, PBMCs, and nasal swabs, sourced from GEO, ImmPort, and ArrayExpress. We harmonized subject-level metadata, standardized outcome measures, applied unified preprocessing pipelines with rigorous quality control, and aligned all data to official gene symbols. To demonstrate the utility of HR-VILAGE-3K3M, we performed predictive modeling of vaccine responders and evaluated batch-effect correction methods. Beyond these initial demonstrations, it supports diverse systems immunology applications and benchmarking of feature selection and transfer learning algorithms. Its scale and heterogeneity also make it ideal for pretraining foundation models of the human immune response and for advancing multimodal learning frameworks. As the largest longitudinal transcriptomic resource for human respiratory viral immunization, it provides an accessible platform for reproducible AI-driven research, accelerating systems immunology and vaccine development against emerging viral threats.",

Key challenges lie in the high dimensionality and sparsity of scATAC-seq data, as well as the lack of a standardized schema for representing open chromatin regions (OCRs). Here, we present ChromFound, a foundation model tailored for scATAC-seq.

    "abstract": "Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) reveals cell heterogeneity, with cell clustering playing a key role in identifying cell types and marker genes. Recent advances, especially graph neural networks (GNNs)-based methods, have significantly improved clustering performance. However, the analysis of scRNA-seq data remains challenging due to noise, sparsity, and high dimensionality. Compounding these challenges, GNNs often suffer from over-smoothing, limiting their ability to capture complex biological information. In response, we propose scSiameseClu, a novel Siamese Clustering framework for interpreting single-cell RNA-seq data, comprising of 3 key steps: (1) Dual Augmentation Module, which applies biologically informed perturbations to the gene expression matrix and cell graph relationships to enhance representation robustness; (2) Siamese Fusion Module, which combines cross-correlation refinement and adaptive information fusion to capture complex cellular relationships while mitigating over-smoothing; and (3) Optimal Transport Clustering, which utilizes Sinkhorn distance to efficiently align cluster assignments with predefined proportions while maintaining balance. Comprehensive evaluations on seven real-world datasets demonstrate that scSiameseClu outperforms state-of-the-art methods in single-cell clustering, cell type annotation, and cell type classification, providing a powerful tool for scRNA-seq data interpretation.",

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer remains a major global health concern, with early detection being pivotal for improving patient outcomes. In this study, we leveraged high throughput methylation profiling of cellfree DNA to identify and validate diagnostic biomarkers for CRC. The GSE124600 study data were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus, as the discovery cohort, comprising 142 CRC and 132 normal cfDNA methylation profiles obtained via MCTA seq. After preprocessing and filtering, 97,863 CpG sites were retained for further analysis. Differential methylation analysis using statistical tests identified 30,791 CpG sites as significantly altered in CRC samples, where p is less than 0.05. Univariate scoring enabled the selection of top ranking features, which were further refined using multiple feature selection algorithms, including Recursive Feature Elimination, Sequential Feature Selection, and SVC L1. Various machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, and Multi layer Perceptron were trained and tested using independent validation datasets. The best performance was achieved with an MLP model trained on 25 features selected by RFE, reaching an AUROC of 0.89 and MCC of 0.78 on validation data. Additionally, a deep learning based convolutional neural network achieved an AUROC of 0.78. Functional annotation of the most predictive CpG sites identified several genes involved in key cellular processes, some of which were validated for differential expression in CRC using the GEPIA2 platform. Our study highlights the potential of cfDNA methylation markers combined with ML and DL models for noninvasive and accurate CRC detection, paving the way for clinically relevant diagnostic tools.",

    "abstract": "Obesity prevalence in Indonesian adults increased from 10.5% in 2007 to 23.4% in 2023. Studies showed that genetic predisposition significantly influences obesity susceptibility. To aid this, polygenic risk scores (PRS) help aggregate the effects of numerous genetic variants to assess genetic risk. However, 91% of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) involve European populations, limiting their applicability to Indonesians due to genetic diversity. This study aims to develop and validate an ancestry adjusted PRS for obesity in the Indonesian population using principal component analysis (PCA) method constructed from the 1000 Genomes Project data and our own genomic data from approximately 2,800 Indonesians. We calculate PRS for obesity using all races, then determine the first four principal components using ancestry-informative SNPs and develop a linear regression model to predict PRS based on these principal components. The raw PRS is adjusted by subtracting the predicted score to obtain an ancestry adjusted PRS for the Indonesian population. Our results indicate that the ancestry-adjusted PRS improves obesity risk prediction. Compared to the unadjusted PRS, the adjusted score improved classification performance with a 5% increase in area under the ROC curve (AUC). This approach underscores the importance of population-specific adjustments in genetic risk assessments to enable more effective personalized healthcare and targeted intervention strategies for diverse populations.",

    "title": "DeepPlantCRE: A Transformer-CNN Hybrid Framework for Plant Gene Expression Modeling and Cross-Species Generalization",
    "abstract": "The investigation of plant transcriptional regulation constitutes a fundamental basis for crop breeding, where cis-regulatory elements (CREs), as the key factor determining gene expression, have become the focus of crop genetic improvement research. Deep learning techniques, leveraging their exceptional capacity for high-dimensional feature extraction and nonlinear regulatory relationship modeling, have been extensively employed in this field. However, current methodologies present notable limitations: single CNN-based architectures struggle to capture long-range regulatory interactions, while existing CNN-Transformer hybrid models demonstrate proneness to overfitting and inadequate generalization in cross-species prediction contexts. To address these challenges, this study proposes DeepPlantCRE, a deep-learning framework for plant gene expression prediction and CRE Extraction. The model employs a Transformer-CNN hybrid architecture that achieves enhanced Accuracy, AUC-ROC, and F1-score metrics over existing baselines (DeepCRE and PhytoExpr), with improved generalization performance and overfitting inhibiting. Cross-species validation experiments conducted on gene expression datasets from \\textit{Gossypium}, \\textit{Arabidopsis thaliana}, \\textit{Solanum lycopersicum}, \\textit{Sorghum bicolor}, and \\textit{Arabidopsis thaliana} reveal that the model achieves peak prediction accuracy of 92.3\\%, particularly excelling in complex genomic data analysis. Furthermore, interpretability investigations using DeepLIFT and Transcription Factor Motif Discovery from the importance scores algorithm (TF-MoDISco) demonstrate that the derived motifs from our model exhibit high concordance with known transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) such as MYR2, TSO1 in JASPAR plant database, substantiating the potential of biological interpretability and practical agricultural application of DeepPlantCRE.",

As these models gain prominence, there exists an urgent need for interpretability methods to establish trustworthiness in model-driven decisions. For genetic researchers, interpretable insights derived from these models hold significant value in providing novel perspectives for understanding biological processes. Current interpretability analyses in genomics predominantly rely on intuition and experience rather than rigorous theoretical foundations. In this review, we systematically categorize interpretability methods into input-based and model-based approaches, while critically evaluating their limitations through concrete biological application scenarios. Furthermore, we establish theoretical underpinnings to elucidate the origins of these constraints through formal mathematical demonstrations, aiming to assist genetic researchers in better understanding and designing models in the future. Finally, we provide feasible suggestions for future research on interpretability in the field of genetics.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of telomere-to-telomere (T2T) genome assemblies has opened new avenues for comparative genomics, yet effective tokenization strategies for genomic sequences remain underexplored. In this pilot study, we apply Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) to nine T2T primate genomes including three human assemblies by training independent BPE tokenizers with a fixed vocabulary of 512,000 tokens using our custom tool, dnaBPE. Our analysis reveals that only 11,569 tokens are shared across all assemblies, while nearly 991,854 tokens are unique to a single genome, indicating a rapid decline in shared vocabulary with increasing assembly comparisons. Moreover, phylogenetic trees derived from token overlap failed to recapitulate established primate relationships, a discrepancy attributed to the disproportionate influence of species-specific high-copy repetitive elements. These findings underscore the dual nature of BPE tokenization: while it effectively compresses repetitive sequences, its sensitivity to high-copy elements limits its utility as a universal tool for comparative genomics. We discuss potential hybrid strategies and repeat-masking approaches to refine genomic tokenization, emphasizing the need for domain-specific adaptations in the development of large-scale genomic language models.

Despite decades of effort, there remain huge gaps in our knowledge of both the function of many genes (the so-called y-ome) and how they adapt to changing environments via regulation. Here we describe a joint experimental and theoretical dissection of the regulation of a broad array of over 100 biologically interesting genes in E. coli across 39 diverse environments, permitting us to discover the binding sites and transcription factors that mediate regulatory control. Using a combination of mutagenesis, massively parallel reporter assays, mass spectrometry and tools from information theory and statistical physics, we go from complete ignorance of a promoter's environment-dependent regulatory architecture to predictive models of its behavior. As a proof of principle of the biological insights to be gained from such a study, we chose a combination of genes from the y-ome, toxin-antitoxin pairs, and genes hypothesized to be part of regulatory modules; in all cases, we discovered a host of new insights into their underlying regulatory landscape and resulting biological function.",

    "abstract": "De novo assembly enables investigations of unknown genomes, paving the way for personalized medicine and disease management. However, it faces immense computational challenges arising from the excessive data volumes and algorithmic complexity.   While state-of-the-art de novo assemblers utilize distributed systems for extreme-scale genome assembly, they demand substantial computational and memory resources. They also fail to address the inherent challenges of de novo assembly, including a large memory footprint, memory-bound behavior, and irregular data patterns stemming from complex, interdependent data structures. Given these challenges, de novo assembly merits a custom hardware solution, though existing approaches have not fully addressed the limitations.   We propose NMP-PaK, a hardware-software co-design that accelerates scalable de novo genome assembly through near-memory processing (NMP). Our channel-level NMP architecture addresses memory bottlenecks while providing sufficient scratchpad space for processing elements. Customized processing elements maximize parallelism while efficiently handling large data structures that are both dynamic and interdependent. Software optimizations include customized batch processing to reduce the memory footprint and hybrid CPU-NMP processing to address hardware underutilization caused by irregular data patterns.   NMP-PaK conducts the same genome assembly while incurring a 14X smaller memory footprint compared to the state-of-the-art de novo assembly. Moreover, NMP-PaK delivers a 16X performance improvement over the CPU baseline, with a 2.4X reduction in memory operations. Consequently, NMP-PaK achieves 8.3X greater throughput than state-of-the-art de novo assembly under the same resource constraints, showcasing its superior computational efficiency.",

The models used include OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002, text-embedding-3-small, and text-embedding-3-large (Jan 2024), as well as domain-specific models BioBERT and SciBERT. Embeddings are computed via an expression-weighted average across the top N most highly expressed genes in each cell, providing a compact, semantically rich representation. This multimodal strategy bridges structured biological data with state-of-the-art language modeling, enabling more interpretable downstream applications such as cell-type clustering, cell vulnerability dissection, and trajectory inference.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes a new asynchronous algorithm and implementation for the problem of k-mer counting (KC), which concerns quantifying the frequency of length k substrings in a DNA sequence. This operation is common to many computational biology workloads and can take up to 77% of the total runtime of de novo genome assembly. The performance and scalability of the current state-of-the-art distributed-memory KC algorithm are hampered by multiple rounds of Many-To-Many collectives. Therefore, we develop an asynchronous algorithm (DAKC) that uses fine-grained, asynchronous messages to obviate most of this global communication while utilizing network bandwidth efficiently via custom message aggregation protocols. DAKC can perform strong scaling up to 256 nodes (512 sockets / 6K cores) and can count k-mers up to 9x faster than the state-of-the-art distributed-memory algorithm, and up to 100x faster than the shared-memory alternative. We also provide an analytical model to understand the hardware resource utilization of our asynchronous KC algorithm and provide insights on the performance.",

    "abstract": "Gene finding is the task of identifying the locations of coding sequences within the vast amount of genetic code contained in the genome. With an ever increasing quantity of raw genome sequences, gene finding is an important avenue towards understanding the genetic information of (novel) organisms, as well as learning shared patterns across evolutionarily diverse species. The current state of the art are graphical models usually trained per organism and requiring manually curated datasets. However, these models lack the flexibility to incorporate deep learning representation learning techniques that have in recent years been transformative in the analysis of pro tein sequences, and which could potentially help gene finders exploit the growing number of the sequenced genomes to expand performance across multiple organisms. Here, we propose a novel approach, combining learned embeddings of raw genetic sequences with exact decoding using a latent conditional random field. We show that the model achieves performance matching the current state of the art, while increasing training robustness, and removing the need for manually fitted length distributions. As language models for DNA improve, this paves the way for more performant cross-organism gene-finders.",

    "abstract": "Predicting genetic perturbations enables the identification of potentially crucial genes prior to wet-lab experiments, significantly improving overall experimental efficiency. Since genes are the foundation of cellular life, building gene regulatory networks (GRN) is essential to understand and predict the effects of genetic perturbations. However, current methods fail to fully leverage gene-related information, and solely rely on simple evaluation metrics to construct coarse-grained GRN. More importantly, they ignore functional differences between biotypes, limiting the ability to capture potential gene interactions. In this work, we leverage pre-trained large language model and DNA sequence model to extract features from gene descriptions and DNA sequence data, respectively, which serve as the initialization for gene representations. Additionally, we introduce gene biotype information for the first time in genetic perturbation, simulating the distinct roles of genes with different biotypes in regulating cellular processes, while capturing implicit gene relationships through graph structure learning (GSL). We propose GRAPE, a heterogeneous graph neural network (HGNN) that leverages gene representations initialized with features from descriptions and sequences, models the distinct roles of genes with different biotypes, and dynamically refines the GRN through GSL. The results on publicly available datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.",

    "abstract": "DNA microarray technology enables the simultaneous measurement of expression levels of thousands of genes, thereby facilitating the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying complex diseases such as brain tumors and the identification of diagnostic genetic signatures. To derive meaningful biological insights from the high-dimensional and complex gene features obtained through this technology and to analyze gene properties in detail, classical AI-based approaches such as machine learning and deep learning are widely employed. However, these methods face various limitations in managing high-dimensional vector spaces and modeling the intricate relationships among genes. In particular, challenges such as hyperparameter tuning, computational costs, and high processing power requirements can hinder their efficiency. To overcome these limitations, quantum computing and quantum AI approaches are gaining increasing attention. Leveraging quantum properties such as superposition and entanglement, quantum methods enable more efficient parallel processing of high-dimensional data and offer faster and more effective solutions to problems that are computationally demanding for classical methods. In this study, a novel model called \"Deep VQC\" is proposed, based on the Variational Quantum Classifier approach. Developed using microarray data containing 54,676 gene features, the model successfully classified four different types of brain tumors-ependymoma, glioblastoma, medulloblastoma, and pilocytic astrocytoma-alongside healthy samples with high accuracy. Furthermore, compared to classical ML algorithms, our model demonstrated either superior or comparable classification performance. These results highlight the potential of quantum AI methods as an effective and promising approach for the analysis and classification of complex structures such as brain tumors based on gene expression features.",

    "abstract": "Integrating heterogeneous biomedical data including imaging, omics, and clinical records supports accurate diagnosis and personalised care. Graph-based models fuse such non-Euclidean data by capturing spatial and relational structure, yet clinical uptake requires regulator-ready interpretability. We present the first technical survey of interpretable graph based models for multimodal biomedical data, covering 26 studies published between Jan 2019 and Sep 2024. Most target disease classification, notably cancer and rely on static graphs from simple similarity measures, while graph-native explainers are rare; post-hoc methods adapted from non-graph domains such as gradient saliency, and SHAP predominate. We group existing approaches into four interpretability families, outline trends such as graph-in-graph hierarchies, knowledge-graph edges, and dynamic topology learning, and perform a practical benchmark. Using an Alzheimer disease cohort, we compare Sensitivity Analysis, Gradient Saliency, SHAP and Graph Masking. SHAP and Sensitivity Analysis recover the broadest set of known AD pathways and Gene-Ontology terms, whereas Gradient Saliency and Graph Masking surface complementary metabolic and transport signatures. Permutation tests show all four beat random gene sets, but with distinct trade-offs: SHAP and Graph Masking offer deeper biology at higher compute cost, while Gradient Saliency and Sensitivity Analysis are quicker though coarser. We also provide a step-by-step flowchart covering graph construction, explainer choice and resource budgeting to help researchers balance transparency and performance. This review synthesises the state of interpretable graph learning for multimodal medicine, benchmarks leading techniques, and charts future directions, from advanced XAI tools to under-studied diseases, serving as a concise reference for method developers and translational scientists.",

In the context of DNA analysis, biological samples recovered from crime scenes may include genetic material from several individuals, necessitating robust statistical tools to assess whether a specific person of interest (POI) is among the contributors. Methods based on capillary electrophoresis (CE) are currently in use worldwide, but offer limited resolution in complex mixtures. Advancements in massively parallel sequencing (MPS) technologies provide a richer, more detailed representation of DNA mixtures, but require new analytical strategies to fully leverage this information. In this work, we present a Bayesian framework for evaluating whether a POIs DNA is present in an MPS-based forensic sample. The model accommodates known contributors, such as the victim, and uses a novel string edit distance to quantify similarity between observed alleles and sequencing artifacts. The resulting Bayes factors enable effective discrimination between samples that do and do not contain the POIs DNA, demonstrating strong performance in both hypothesis testing and classification settings.",

Methods: This study implemented a three-step process: (1) Data searching for mTBI-related genes in Gene and MalaCard databases and literature review ; (2) Data analysis involved performing functional annotation through GO and KEGG, identifying hub genes using Cytoscape, mapping protein-protein interactions via DAVID and STRING, and predicting miRNA targets using miRSystem, miRWalk2.0, and mirDIP (3) RNA-sequencing analysis applied to the mTBI dataset GSE123336. Results: Eleven candidate hub genes associated with mTBI outcome were identified: APOE, S100B, GFAP, BDNF, AQP4, COMT, MBP, UCHL1, DRD2, ASIC1, and CACNA1A. Enrichment analysis linked these genes to neuron projection regeneration and synaptic plasticity. miRNAs linked to the mTBI candidate genes were hsa-miR-9-5p, hsa-miR-204-5p, hsa-miR-1908-5p, hsa-miR-16-5p, hsa-miR-10a-5p, has-miR-218-5p, has-miR-34a-5p, and has-miR-199b-5p. The RNA sequencing revealed 2664 differentially expressed miRNAs post-mTBI, with 17 showing significant changes at the time of injury and 48 hours post-injury. Two miRNAs were positively correlated with direct head hits. Conclusion: Our study indicates that specific genes and miRNAs, particularly hsa-miR-10a-5p, may influence mTBI outcomes. Our research may guide future mTBI diagnostics, emphasizing the need to measure and track these specific genes and miRNAs in diverse cohorts.",

However, the scarcity of genomic resources has hindered extensive studies on mantis evolution and behaviour. Results: Here, we present the chromosome-scale reference genomes of five mantis species: the European mantis (Mantis religiosa), Chinese mantis (Tenodera sinensis), triangle dead leaf mantis (Deroplatys truncata), orchid mantis (Hymenopus coronatus), and metallic mantis (Metallyticus violaceus). We found that transposable element expansion is the major force governing genome size in Mantodea. Based on whole-alignments, we deduced that the Mantodea ancestor may have had only one X chromosome and that translocations between the X chromosome and an autosome may have occurred in the lineage of the superfamily Mantoidea. Furthermore, we found a lower evolutionary rate for the metallic mantis than for the other mantises. We also found that Mantodea underwent rapid radiation after the K-Pg mass extinction event, which could have contributed to the confusion in species classification. Conclusions: We present the chromosome-scale reference genomes of five mantis species to reveal the X-chromosome evolution, clarify the phylogeny relationship, and transposable element expansion.",

Our findings also underscore several occurrences of species mis-annotations in public genomic databases, which are readily detected through visual anomalies in the PGR-TK plots.

    "abstract": "Mappings from biological sequences (DNA, RNA, protein) to quantitative measures of sequence functionality play an important role in contemporary biology. We are interested in the related tasks of (i) inferring predictive sequence-to-function maps and (ii) decomposing sequence-function maps to elucidate the contributions of individual subsequences. Because each sequence-function map can be written as a weighted sum over subsequences in multiple ways, meaningfully interpreting these weights requires ``gauge-fixing,'' i.e., defining a unique representation for each map. Recent work has established that most existing gauge-fixed representations arise as the unique solutions to $L_2$-regularized regression in an overparameterized ``weight space'' where the choice of regularizer defines the gauge. Here, we establish the relationship between regularized regression in overparameterized weight space and Gaussian process approaches that operate in ``function space,'' i.e.~the space of all real-valued functions on a finite set of sequences. We disentangle how weight space regularizers both impose an implicit prior on the learned function and restrict the optimal weights to a particular gauge. We show how to construct regularizers that correspond to arbitrary explicit Gaussian process priors combined with a wide variety of gauges and characterize the implicit function space priors associated with the most common weight space regularizers. Finally, we derive the posterior distribution of a broad class of sequence-to-function statistics, including gauge-fixed weights and multiple systems for expressing higher-order epistatic coefficients. We show that such distributions can be efficiently computed for product-kernel priors using a kernel trick.",

    "abstract": "The subcellular localization of RNAs, including long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), messenger RNAs (mRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs) and other smaller RNAs, plays a critical role in determining their biological functions. For instance, lncRNAs are predominantly associated with chromatin and act as regulators of gene transcription and chromatin structure, while mRNAs are distributed across the nucleus and cytoplasm, facilitating the transport of genetic information for protein synthesis. Understanding RNA localization sheds light on processes like gene expression regulation with spatial and temporal precision. However, traditional wet lab methods for determining RNA localization, such as in situ hybridization, are often time-consuming, resource-demanding, and costly. To overcome these challenges, computational methods leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have emerged as powerful alternatives, enabling large-scale prediction of RNA subcellular localization. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the latest advancements in AI-based approaches for RNA subcellular localization prediction, covering various RNA types and focusing on sequence-based, image-based, and hybrid methodologies that combine both data types. We highlight the potential of these methods to accelerate RNA research, uncover molecular pathways, and guide targeted disease treatments. Furthermore, we critically discuss the challenges in AI/ML approaches for RNA subcellular localization, such as data scarcity and lack of benchmarks, and opportunities to address them. This review aims to serve as a valuable resource for researchers seeking to develop innovative solutions in the field of RNA subcellular localization and beyond.",

    "title": "A Novel Graph Transformer Framework for Gene Regulatory Network Inference",
    "abstract": "The inference of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) is a foundational stride towards deciphering the fundamentals of complex biological systems. Inferring a possible regulatory link between two genes can be formulated as a link prediction problem. Inference of GRNs via gene coexpression profiling data may not always reflect true biological interactions, as its susceptibility to noise and misrepresenting true biological regulatory relationships. Most GRN inference methods face several challenges in the network reconstruction phase. Therefore, it is important to encode gene expression values, leverege the prior knowledge gained from the available inferred network structures and positional informations of the input network nodes towards inferring a better and more confident GRN network reconstruction. In this paper, we explore the integration of multiple inferred networks to enhance the inference of Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs). Primarily, we employ autoencoder embeddings to capture gene expression patterns directly from raw data, preserving intricate biological signals. Then, we embed the prior knowledge from GRN structures transforming them into a text-like representation using random walks, which are then encoded with a masked language model, BERT, to generate global embeddings for each gene across all networks. Additionally, we embed the positional encodings of the input gene networks to better identify the position of each unique gene within the graph. These embeddings are integrated into graph transformer-based model, termed GT-GRN, for GRN inference. The GT-GRN model effectively utilizes the topological structure of the ground truth network while incorporating the enriched encoded information. Experimental results demonstrate that GT-GRN significantly outperforms existing GRN inference methods, achieving superior accuracy and highlighting the robustness of our approach.",

In this work, we introduce GeneMamba, a scalable and efficient foundation model for single-cell transcriptomics built on state space modeling. Leveraging the Bi-Mamba architecture, GeneMamba captures bidirectional gene context with linear-time complexity, offering substantial computational gains over transformer baselines. The model is pretrained on nearly 30 million cells and incorporates biologically informed objectives, including pathway-aware contrastive loss and rank-based gene encoding. We evaluate GeneMamba across diverse tasks, including multi-batch integration, cell type annotation, and gene-gene correlation, demonstrating strong performance, interpretability, and robustness. These results position GeneMamba as a practical and powerful alternative to transformer-based methods, advancing the development of biologically grounded, scalable tools for large-scale single-cell data analysis.",

    "abstract": "Background: Spatial transcriptomics have emerged as a powerful tool in biomedical research because of its ability to capture both the spatial contexts and abundance of the complete RNA transcript profile in organs of interest. However, limitations of the technology such as the relatively low resolution and comparatively insufficient sequencing depth make it difficult to reliably extract real biological signals from these data. To alleviate this challenge, we propose a novel transfer learning framework, referred to as TransST, to adaptively leverage the cell-labeled information from external sources in inferring cell-level heterogeneity of a target spatial transcriptomics data.   Results: Applications in several real studies as well as a number of simulation settings show that our approach significantly improves existing techniques. For example, in the breast cancer study, TransST successfully identifies five biologically meaningful cell clusters, including the two subgroups of cancer in situ and invasive cancer; in addition, only TransST is able to separate the adipose tissues from the connective issues among all the studied methods.   Conclusions: In summary, the proposed method TransST is both effective and robust in identifying cell subclusters and detecting corresponding driving biomarkers in spatial transcriptomics data.",

    "abstract": "Predicting phenotype from genotype is a central challenge in genetics. Traditional approaches in quantitative genetics typically analyze this problem using methods based on linear regression. These methods generally assume that the genetic architecture of complex traits can be parameterized in terms of an additive model, where the effects of loci are independent, plus (in some cases) pairwise epistatic interactions between loci. However, these models struggle to analyze more complex patterns of epistasis or subtle gene-environment interactions. Recent advances in machine learning, particularly attention-based models, offer a promising alternative. Initially developed for natural language processing, attention-based models excel at capturing context-dependent interactions and have shown exceptional performance in predicting protein structure and function. Here, we apply attention-based models to quantitative genetics. We analyze the performance of this attention-based approach in predicting phenotype from genotype using simulated data across a range of models with increasing epistatic complexity, and using experimental data from a recent quantitative trait locus mapping study in budding yeast. We find that our model demonstrates superior out-of-sample predictions in epistatic regimes compared to standard methods. We also explore a more general multi-environment attention-based model to jointly analyze genotype-phenotype maps across multiple environments and show that such architectures can be used for \"transfer learning\" - predicting phenotypes in novel environments with limited training data.",

    "abstract": "Thalassemia, a blood disorder and one of the most prevalent hereditary genetic disorders worldwide, is often caused by copy number variations (CNVs) in the hemoglobin genes. This disorder has incredible diversity, with a large number of distinct profiles corresponding to alterations of different regions in the genes. Correctly classifying an individual's profile is critical as it impacts treatment, prognosis, and genetic counseling. However, genetic classification is challenging due to the large number of profiles worldwide, and often requires a large number of sequential tests. Targeted next generation sequencing (NGS), which characterizes segments of an individual's genome, has the potential to dramatically reduce the cost of testing and increase accuracy. In this work, we introduce a probabilistic state space model for profiling thalassemia from targeted NGS data, which naturally characterize the spatial ordering of the genes along the chromosome. We then use decision theory to choose the best profile among the different options. Due to our use of Bayesian methodology, we are also able to detect low-quality samples to be excluded from consideration, an important component of clinical screening. We evaluate our model on a dataset of 57 individuals, including both controls and cases with a variety of thalassemia profiles. Our model has a sensitivity of 0.99 and specificity of 0.93 for thalassemia detection, and accuracy of 91.5\\% for characterizing subtypes. Furthermore, the specificity and accuracy rise to $0.96$ and 93.9\\% when low-quality samples are excluded using our automated quality control method. This approach outperforms alternative methods, particularly in specificity, and is broadly applicable to other disorders.",

Among these, nanopore based single molecule sensing and sequencing is rapidly emerging as a powerful and versatile sensing methodology. Advancements in nanopore based approaches require concomitant improvements in the electronic readout methods employed, from the point of low noise, bandwidth and form factor. This article focuses on current sensing circuits designed and employed for ultra low noise nanopore signal readout, addressing the fundamental limitations of traditional off chip transimpedance amplifiers (TIAs), which suffer from high input parasitic capacitance, bandwidth constraints, and increased noise at high frequencies. This review explores the latest design schemes and circuit structures classified into on-chip and off-chip TIA designs, highlighting their design implementation, performance, respective challenges and explores the interplay between noise performance, capacitance, and bandwidth across diverse transimpedance amplifier (TIA) configurations. Emphasis is placed on characterizing noise response under varying parasitic capacitance and operational frequencies, a systematic evaluation not extensively addressed in prior literature while also considering the allowable input current compliance range limitations. The review also compares the widely used Axopatch 200B system to the designs reported in literature. The findings offer valuable insights into optimizing TIA designs for enhanced signal integrity in high speed and high sensitivity applications focusing on noise reduction, impedance matching, DC blocking, and offset cancellation techniques.",

    "abstract": "Motivation: Viruses represent the most abundant biological entities on the planet and play vital roles in diverse ecosystems. Cataloging viruses across various environments is essential for understanding their properties and functions. Metagenomic sequencing has emerged as the most comprehensive method for virus discovery, enabling the sequencing of all genetic materials, including viruses, from host or environmental samples. However, distinguishing viral sequences from the vast background of cellular organism-derived reads in metagenomic data remains a significant challenge. While several learning-based tools, such as VirSorter2 and geNomad, have shown promise in identifying viral contigs, they often experience varying degrees of false positive rates due to noise in sequencing and assembly, shared genes between viruses and their hosts, and the formation of proviruses within host genomes. This highlights the urgent need for an accurate and efficient method to evaluate the quality of viral contigs. Results: To address these challenges, we introduce ViralQC, a tool designed to assess the quality of reported viral contigs or bins. ViralQC identifies contamination regions within putative viral sequences using foundation models trained on viral and cellular genomes and estimates viral completeness through protein organization alignment. We evaluate ViralQC on multiple datasets and compare its performance against CheckV, the state-of-the-art in virus quality assessment. Notably, ViralQC correctly identifies 38% more contamination than CheckV, while maintaining a median absolute error of only 3%. In addition, ViralQC delivers more accurate results for medium- to high-quality (>50% completeness) contigs, demonstrating its superior performance in completeness estimation.",

While node importance can be obtained for gradient and attention after prediction, node importance from these methods lacks complementary prior knowledge; GraphPINE seeks to overcome this limitation. GraphPINE differs from other GNN gating methods by utilizing an LSTM-like sequential format. We introduce an importance propagation layer that unifies 1) updates for feature matrix and node importance and 2) uses GNN-based graph propagation of feature values. This initialization and updating mechanism allows for informed feature learning and improved graph representation.   We apply GraphPINE to cancer drug response prediction using drug screening and gene data collected for over 5,000 gene nodes included in a gene-gene graph with a drug-target interaction (DTI) graph for initial importance. The gene-gene graph and DTIs were obtained from curated sources and weighted by article count discussing relationships between drugs and genes. GraphPINE achieves a PR-AUC of 0.894 and ROC-AUC of 0.796 across 952 drugs. Code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/GraphPINE-40DE.",

    "abstract": "Long-range dependencies are critical for understanding genomic structure and function, yet most conventional methods struggle with them. Widely adopted transformer-based models, while excelling at short-context tasks, are limited by the attention module's quadratic computational complexity and inability to extrapolate to sequences longer than those seen in training. In this work, we explore State Space Models (SSMs) as a promising alternative by benchmarking two SSM-inspired architectures, Caduceus and Hawk, on long-range genomics modeling tasks under conditions parallel to a 50M parameter transformer baseline. We discover that SSMs match transformer performance and exhibit impressive zero-shot extrapolation across multiple tasks, handling contexts 10 to 100 times longer than those seen during training, indicating more generalizable representations better suited for modeling the long and complex human genome. Moreover, we demonstrate that these models can efficiently process sequences of 1M tokens on a single GPU, allowing for modeling entire genomic regions at once, even in labs with limited compute. Our findings establish SSMs as efficient and scalable for long-context genomic analysis.",

    "abstract": "Essential life processes take place across multiple space and time scales in living organisms but understanding their mechanistic interactions remains an ongoing challenge. Advanced multiscale modeling techniques are providing new opportunities and insights into these complex processes. In cells, meters of chromatin are folded into a nucleus with a diameter on the order of microns. The three-dimensional chromatin structure coupled with biochemical processes that turn genes on or off, specify a given cell type through a complicated set of interactions collectively referred to as epigenetics. Important epigenetic processes include the differential accessibility of genomic loci to transcription factors and chemical modifications to DNA and DNA-binding molecules such as histones. The dynamics of these epigenetic processes span timescales from milliseconds to years. How do chemical modifications consisting of a handful of atoms cooperate to modulate genome folding at the scale of the nucleus and impact organism outcomes? In this review, we highlight the inherently multiscale nature of chromatin organization, with a focus on computational modeling to bridge the gaps in our understanding of biochemical processes across scales. We review relevant chromatin biology, including major types of epigenetic modifications as well as the higher order chromatin structures to present a multiscale view of chromatin. We also review relevant computational methods to simulate chromatin structure, function, and dynamics, as well as experimental techniques that inform and validate said models. Finally, we argue that multiscale modeling provides a path forward towards understanding emergent behavior in this inherently multiscale system.",

    "abstract": "Background: Esophageal cancer poses a significant global health challenge, with the incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), a predominant subtype, increasing notably in Western countries. Cathepsins, a family of lysosomal proteolytic enzymes, have been implicated in the progression of various tumors. However, the causal relationship between the cathepsin family and EAC remains unresolved. Methods: To evaluate these potential causal associations, integrative analyses were conducted, integrating Mendelian randomization (MR), transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS), single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), and single-cell expression quantitative trait locus (sc-eQTL) analyses. Results: Univariable and multivariable MR analyses demonstrated that elevated levels of cathepsin B (CTSB) were associated with a reduced risk of EAC. The TWAS analysis identified a negative association between CTSB expression in esophageal tissue and EAC, consistent with experimental validation using immunohistochemistry. The scRNA-seq data analysis indicated that CTSB expression was predominantly localized in macrophages infiltrating EAC. Colocalization analysis incorporating sc-eQTL data specific to macrophages confirmed a shared causal variant between CTSB and macrophages. Additionally, MR analysis of CTSB and macrophage scavenger receptor (MSR) types I and II established their interrelationship, suggesting that CTSB may influence the proinflammatory phenotype of macrophages, ultimately affecting EAC risk. Conclusions: This integrative analysis, utilizing MR, TWAS, scRNA-seq, and sc-eQTL data, identified a significant causal association between CTSB and EAC, potentially mediated through macrophage MSR regulation. These findings suggest that targeting cathepsin B could represent a novel strategy for the diagnosis and treatment of EAC.",

    "abstract": "Epigenetics encompasses mechanisms that can alter the expression of genes without changing the underlying genetic sequence. The epigenetic regulation of gene expression is initiated and sustained by several mechanisms such as DNA methylation, histone modifications, chromatin conformation, and non-coding RNA. The changes in gene regulation and expression can manifest in the form of various diseases and disorders such as cancer and congenital deformities. Over the last few decades, high throughput experimental approaches have been used to identify and understand epigenetic changes, but these laboratory experimental approaches and biochemical processes are time-consuming and expensive. To overcome these challenges, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) approaches have been extensively used for mapping epigenetic modifications to their phenotypic manifestations. In this paper we provide a narrative review of published research on AI models trained on epigenomic data to address a variety of problems such as prediction of disease markers, gene expression, enhancer promoter interaction, and chromatin states. The purpose of this review is twofold as it is addressed to both AI experts and epigeneticists. For AI researchers, we provided a taxonomy of epigenetics research problems that can benefit from an AI-based approach. For epigeneticists, given each of the above problems we provide a list of candidate AI solutions in the literature. We have also identified several gaps in the literature, research challenges, and recommendations to address these challenges.",

    "abstract": "In mammalian and vertebrate genomes, the promoter regions of the gene and their distal enhancers may be located millions of base-pairs from each other, while a promoter may not interact with the closest enhancer. Since base-pair proximity is not a good indicator of these interactions, there is considerable work toward developing methods for predicting Enhancer-Promoter Interactions (EPI). Several machine learning methods have reported increasingly higher accuracies for predicting EPI. Typically, these approaches randomly split the dataset of Enhancer-Promoter (EP) pairs into training and testing subsets followed by model training. However, the aforementioned random splitting causes information leakage by assigning EP pairs from the same genomic region to both testing and training sets, leading to performance overestimation. In this paper we propose to use a more thorough training and testing paradigm i.e., Leave-one-chromosome-out (LOCO) cross-validation for EPI-prediction. We demonstrate that a deep learning algorithm, which gives higher accuracies when trained and tested on random-splitting setting, drops drastically in performance under LOCO setting, confirming overestimation of performance. We further propose a novel hybrid deep neural network for EPI-prediction that fuses k-mer features of the nucleotide sequence. We show that the hybrid architecture performs significantly better in the LOCO setting, demonstrating it can learn more generalizable aspects of EP interactions. With this paper we are also releasing the LOCO splitting-based EPI dataset. Research data is available in this public repository: https://github.com/malikmtahir/EPI",

    "abstract": "Genome sequence analysis, which analyzes the DNA sequences of organisms, drives advances in many critical medical and biotechnological fields. Given its importance and the exponentially growing volumes of genomic sequence data, there are extensive efforts to accelerate genome sequence analysis. In this work, we demonstrate a major bottleneck that greatly limits and diminishes the benefits of state-of-the-art genome sequence analysis accelerators: the data preparation bottleneck, where genomic sequence data is stored in compressed form and needs to be decompressed and formatted first before an accelerator can operate on it. To mitigate this bottleneck, we propose SAGe, an algorithm-architecture co-design for highly-compressed storage and high-performance access of large-scale genomic sequence data. The key challenge is to improve data preparation performance while maintaining high compression ratios (comparable to genomic-specific compression algorithms) at low hardware cost. We address this challenge by leveraging key properties of genomic datasets to co-design (i) a new (de)compression algorithm, (ii) hardware that decompresses data with lightweight operations and efficient streaming accesses, (iii) storage data layout, and (iv) interface commands to access data. SAGe is highly versatile as it supports datasets from different sequencing technologies and species. Thanks to its lightweight design, SAGe can be seamlessly integrated with a broad range of genome sequence analysis hardware accelerators to mitigate their data preparation bottlenecks. Our results demonstrate that SAGe improves the average end-to-end performance and energy efficiency of two state-of-the-art genome sequence analysis accelerators by 3.0x-32.1x and 13.0x-34.0x, respectively, compared to when the accelerators rely on state-of-the-art decompression tools.",

To effectively surmount this challenge, we introduce Celler, a state-of-the-art generative pre-training model crafted specifically for the annotation of single-cell data. Celler incorporates two groundbreaking elements: First, we introduced the Gaussian Inflation (GInf) Loss function. By dynamically adjusting sample weights, GInf Loss significantly enhances the model's ability to learn from rare categories while reducing the risk of overfitting for common categories. Secondly, we introduce an innovative Hard Data Mining (HDM) strategy into the training process, specifically targeting the challenging-to-learn minority data samples, which significantly improved the model's predictive accuracy. Additionally, to further advance research in this field, we have constructed a large-scale single-cell dataset: Celler-75, which encompasses 40 million cells distributed across 80 human tissues and 75 specific diseases.

We present agptools, a suite of command-line programs that can perform common operations on AGP files, such as breaking and joining sequences, inverting pieces of assembly components, assembling contigs into larger sequences based on an AGP file, and transforming between coordinate systems of different assembly layouts. Additionally, agptools includes an API that writers of other software packages can use to read, write, and manipulate AGP files within their own programs. Agptools gives bioinformaticians a simple, robust, and reproducible way to edit genome assemblies that avoids the shortfalls of other methods for editing AGP files.",

We recently introduced ProHap, a tool for generating customized protein haplotype databases.

It enables users to explore haplotypes, their effects on protein sequences, and the identification of non-canonical peptides in public mass spectrometry datasets. The design builds on well-established representations in biological sequence analysis, ensuring familiarity for domain experts while integrating novel interactive elements tailored to proteogenomic data exploration. User interviews with proteomics experts confirmed the tool's utility, highlighting its ability to reveal whether haplotypes affect proteins of interest. By facilitating the intuitive exploration of proteogenomic variation, ProHap Explorer supports research in personalized medicine and the development of targeted therapies.",

    "title": "Combining multiplexed functional data to improve variant classification",
    "abstract": "With the surge in the number of variants of uncertain significance (VUS) reported in ClinVar in recent years, there is an imperative to resolve VUS at scale. Multiplexed assays of variant effect (MAVEs), which allow the functional consequence of 100s to 1000s of genetic variants to be measured in a single experiment, are emerging as a powerful source of evidence which can be used in clinical gene variant classification. Increasingly, multiple published MAVEs are available for the same gene, sometimes measuring different aspects of variant impact. When multiple functional roles of a gene need to be considered, combining data from multiple MAVEs may provide a more comprehensive measure of the consequence of a genetic variant, which could impact variant classifications. Here, we provide guidance for combining such multiplexed functional data, incorporating a stepwise process from data curation and collection to model generation and validation. We demonstrate the potential and pitfalls of this approach by showing the integration of multiplexed functional data from five MAVEs for the gene TP53, two MAVEs for the gene LDLR and two MAVEs for PTEN. We also present a web applet that allows users to test various methods for combining score sets from multiple assays, calculate integrated functional scores for all variants, and assess whether combining data enables the application of stronger evidence for pathogenicity or benignity. By following these steps with appropriate guardrails, researchers can maximize the value of MAVEs, strengthen the functional evidence for clinical variant classification, and potentially uncover novel mechanisms of pathogenicity for clinically relevant genes.",

In the rat model of Salmonella-induced dysentery, scRNA-seq of scFascia and deep-learning analysis revealed Warburg-like metabolic reprogramming in macrophages (MPs) with reduced citrate cycle activity. Cd34+/Pdgfra+ telocytes (CPTCs) regulated MPs differentiation and proliferation via Wnt/Fgf signal, suggesting a pathological crosstalk pattern in the scFascia, herein termed the fascia-visceral inflammatory crosstalk pattern (FVICP). PySCENIC analysis indicated increased activity transcription factors Fosl1, Nfkb2, and Atf4, modulated by CPTCs signaling to MPs, downregulating aerobic respiration and upregulating cell cycle, DNA replication, and transcription. This study highlights scFascia's role in immunomodulation and metabolic reprogramming during visceral inflammation, underscoring its function in systemic homeostasis.",

The computational resources and large datasets required, however, limit their applicability in biological contexts. We introduce Lyra, a subquadratic architecture for sequence modeling, grounded in the biological framework of epistasis for understanding sequence-to-function relationships. Mathematically, we demonstrate that state space models efficiently capture global epistatic interactions and combine them with projected gated convolutions for modeling local relationships. We demonstrate that Lyra is performant across over 100 wide-ranging biological tasks, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in many key areas, including protein fitness landscape prediction, biophysical property prediction (e.g. disordered protein region functions) peptide engineering applications (e.g. antibody binding, cell-penetrating peptide prediction), RNA structure analysis, RNA function prediction, and CRISPR guide design. It achieves this with orders-of-magnitude improvements in inference speed and reduction in parameters (up to 120,000-fold in our tests) compared to recent biology foundation models. Using Lyra, we were able to train and run every task in this study on two or fewer GPUs in under two hours, democratizing access to biological sequence modeling at SOTA performance, with potential applications to many fields.",

    "abstract": "This study explores the application of machine learning-based genetic linguistics for identifying heavy metal response genes in rice (Oryza sativa). By integrating convolutional neural networks and random forest algorithms, we developed a hybrid model capable of extracting and learning meaningful features from gene sequences, such as k-mer frequencies and physicochemical properties. The model was trained and tested on datasets of genes, achieving high predictive performance (precision: 0.89, F1-score: 0.82). RNA-seq and qRT-PCR experiments conducted on rice leaves which exposed to Hg0, revealed differential expression of genes associated with heavy metal responses, which validated the model's predictions. Co-expression network analysis identified 103 related genes, and a literature review indicated that these genes are highly likely to be involved in heavy metal-related biological processes. By integrating and comparing the analysis results with those of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), the validity of the new machine learning method was further demonstrated. This study highlights the efficacy of combining machine learning with genetic linguistics for large-scale gene prediction. It demonstrates a cost-effective and efficient approach for uncovering molecular mechanisms underlying heavy metal responses, with potential applications in developing stress-tolerant crop varieties.",

Gene42 models utilize a decoder-only (LLaMA-style) architecture with a dense self-attention mechanism. Initially trained on fixed-length sequences of 4,096 bp, our models underwent continuous pretraining to extend the context length to 192,000 bp. This iterative extension allowed for the comprehensive processing of large-scale genomic data and the capture of intricate patterns and dependencies within the human genome. Gene42 is the first dense attention model capable of handling such extensive long context lengths in genomics, challenging state-space models that often rely on convolutional operators among other mechanisms. Our pretrained models exhibit notably low perplexity values and high reconstruction accuracy, highlighting their strong ability to model genomic data. Extensive experiments on various genomic benchmarks have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks, including biotype classification, regulatory region identification, chromatin profiling prediction, variant pathogenicity prediction, and species classification.

    "abstract": "How a single fertilized cell gives rise to a complex array of specialized cell types in development is a central question in biology. The cells grow, divide, and acquire differentiated characteristics through poorly understood molecular processes. A key approach to studying developmental processes is to infer the tree graph of cell lineage division and differentiation histories, providing an analytical framework for dissecting individual cells' molecular decisions during replication and differentiation. Although genetically engineered lineage-tracing methods have advanced the field, they are either infeasible or ethically constrained in many organisms. In contrast, modern single-cell technologies can measure high-content molecular profiles (e.g., transcriptomes) in a wide range of biological systems.   Here, we introduce CellTreeQM, a novel deep learning method based on transformer architectures that learns an embedding space with geometric properties optimized for tree-graph inference. By formulating lineage reconstruction as a tree-metric learning problem, we have systematically explored supervised, weakly supervised, and unsupervised training settings and present a Lineage Reconstruction Benchmark to facilitate comprehensive evaluation of our learning method. We benchmarked the method on (1) synthetic data modeled via Brownian motion with independent noise and spurious signals and (2) lineage-resolved single-cell RNA sequencing datasets. Experimental results show that CellTreeQM recovers lineage structures with minimal supervision and limited data, offering a scalable framework for uncovering cell lineage relationships in challenging animal models. To our knowledge, this is the first method to cast cell lineage inference explicitly as a metric learning task, paving the way for future computational models aimed at uncovering the molecular dynamics of cell lineage.",

In prostate cancer, tumours can follow divergent evolutionary trajectories that lead to distinct subtypes, but the causes of this divergence remain unclear. While causal inference could elucidate the factors involved, conventional methods are unsuitable due to the possibility of unobserved confounders and ambiguity in the direction of causality. Here, we propose a method that circumvents these issues and apply it to genomic data from 829 prostate cancer patients. We identify several genetic alterations that drive divergence as well as others that prevent this transition, locking tumours into one trajectory. Further analysis reveals that these genetic alterations may cause each other, implying a positive-feedback loop that accelerates divergence. Our findings provide insights into how cancer subtypes emerge and offer a foundation for genomic surveillance strategies aimed at monitoring the progression of prostate cancer.",

    "abstract": "An important goal in cancer research is the survival prognosis of a patient based on a minimal panel of genomic and molecular markers such as genes or proteins. Purely data-driven models without any biological knowledge can produce non-interpretable results. We propose a penalized semiparametric Bayesian Cox model with graph-structured selection priors for sparse identification of multi-omics features by making use of a biologically meaningful graph via a Markov random field (MRF) prior to capturing known relationships between multi-omics features. Since the fixed graph in the MRF prior is for the prior probability distribution, it is not a hard constraint to determine variable selection, so the proposed model can verify known information and has the potential to identify new and novel biomarkers for drawing new biological knowledge. Our simulation results show that the proposed Bayesian Cox model with graph-based prior knowledge results in more trustable and stable variable selection and non-inferior survival prediction, compared to methods modeling the covariates independently without any prior knowledge. The results also indicate that the performance of the proposed model is robust to a partially correct graph in the MRF prior, meaning that in a real setting where not all the true network information between covariates is known, the graph can still be useful. The proposed model is applied to the primary invasive breast cancer patients data in The Cancer Genome Atlas project.",

    "abstract": "Metabolism plays a crucial role in sleep regulation, yet its effects are challenging to track in real time. This study introduces a machine learning-based framework to analyze sleep patterns and identify how metabolic changes influence sleep at specific time points. We first established that sleep periods in Drosophila melanogaster function independently, with no causal relationship between different sleep episodes. Using gradient boosting models and explainable artificial intelligence techniques, we quantified the influence of time-dependent sleep features. Causal inference and autocorrelation analyses further confirmed that sleep states at different times are statistically independent, providing a robust foundation for exploring metabolic effects on sleep. Applying this framework to flies with altered monocarboxylate transporter 2 expression, we found that changes in ketone transport modified sleep stability and disrupted transitions between day and night sleep. In an Alzheimers disease model, metabolic interventions such as beta hydroxybutyrate supplementation and intermittent fasting selectively influenced the timing of day to night transitions rather than uniformly altering sleep duration. Autoencoder based similarity scoring and wavelet analysis reinforced that metabolic effects on sleep were highly time dependent. This study presents a novel approach to studying sleep-metabolism interactions, revealing that metabolic states exert their strongest influence at distinct time points, shaping sleep stability and circadian transitions.",

However, in real-world settings, foundation models are not optimized for domain-specific tasks like clinical diagnosis, yet inputs are unstructured clinical notes rather than standardized terms. How LLMs can be instructed to predict candidate genes or disease diagnosis from unstructured clinical notes remains a major challenge. Methods: We introduce RAG-driven CoT and CoT-driven RAG, two methods that combine Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to analyze clinical notes. A five-question CoT protocol mimics expert reasoning, while RAG retrieves data from sources like HPO and OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man). We evaluated these approaches on rare disease datasets, including 5,980 Phenopacket-derived notes, 255 literature-based narratives, and 220 in-house clinical notes from Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia. Results: We found that recent foundations models, including Llama 3.3-70B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B, outperformed earlier versions such as Llama 2 and GPT-3.5. We also showed that RAG-driven CoT and CoT-driven RAG both outperform foundation models in candidate gene prioritization from clinical notes; in particular, both methods with DeepSeek backbone resulted in a top-10 gene accuracy of over 40% on Phenopacket-derived clinical notes. RAG-driven CoT works better for high-quality notes, where early retrieval can anchor the subsequent reasoning steps in domain-specific evidence, while CoT-driven RAG has advantage when processing lengthy and noisy notes.",

Several pangenome models were proposed, offering different functionalities, applications provided by available tools, their efficiency etc. Among them, two graph-based models are particularly widely used: variation graphs and de Bruijn graphs. In the current paper we propose an axiomatization of the desirable properties of a graph representation of a collection of strings.

    "abstract": "Genotype-to-Phenotype (G2P) prediction plays a pivotal role in crop breeding, enabling the identification of superior genotypes based on genomic data. Rice (Oryza sativa), one of the most important staple crops, faces challenges in improving yield and resilience due to the complex genetic architecture of agronomic traits and the limited sample size in breeding datasets. Current G2P prediction methods, such as GWAS and linear models, often fail to capture complex non-linear relationships between genotypes and phenotypes, leading to suboptimal prediction accuracy. Additionally, population stratification and overfitting are significant obstacles when models are applied to small datasets with diverse genetic backgrounds. This study introduces the Learnable Group Transform (LGT) method, which aims to overcome these challenges by combining the advantages of traditional linear models with advanced machine learning techniques. LGT utilizes a group-based transformation of genotype data to capture spatial relationships and genetic structures across diverse rice populations, offering flexibility to generalize even with limited data. Through extensive experiments on the Rice529 dataset, a panel of 529 rice accessions, LGT demonstrated substantial improvements in prediction accuracy for multiple agronomic traits, including yield and plant height, compared to state-of-the-art baselines such as linear models and recent deep learning approaches. Notably, LGT achieved an R^2 improvement of up to 15\\% for yield prediction, significantly reducing error and demonstrating its ability to extract meaningful signals from high-dimensional, noisy genomic data. These results highlight the potential of LGT as a powerful tool for genomic prediction in rice breeding, offering a promising solution for accelerating the identification of high-yielding and resilient rice varieties.",

Terrier is a deep learning model designed to overcome these challenges by classifying repetitive DNA sequences using a publicly available, curated repeat sequence library trained under the RepeatMasker schema. Poor representation of taxa within repeat databases often limits the classification accuracy and reproducibility of current repeat annotation methods, limiting our understanding of repeat evolution and function. Terrier overcomes these challenges by leveraging deep learning for improved accuracy. Trained on Repbase, which includes over 100,000 repeat families -- four times more than Dfam -- Terrier maps 97.1% of Repbase sequences to RepeatMasker categories, offering the most comprehensive classification system available. When benchmarked against DeepTE, TERL, and TEclass2 in model organisms (rice, fruit flies, humans, and mice), Terrier achieved superior accuracy while classifying a broader range of sequences. Further validation in non-model amphibian, flatworm and Northern krill genomes highlights its effectiveness in improving classification in non-model species, facilitating research on repeat-driven evolution, genomic instability, and phenotypic variation.",

    "title": "Regulatory DNA sequence Design with Reinforcement Learning",
    "abstract": "Cis-regulatory elements (CREs), such as promoters and enhancers, are relatively short DNA sequences that directly regulate gene expression. The fitness of CREs, measured by their ability to modulate gene expression, highly depends on the nucleotide sequences, especially specific motifs known as transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs). Designing high-fitness CREs is crucial for therapeutic and bioengineering applications. Current CRE design methods are limited by two major drawbacks: (1) they typically rely on iterative optimization strategies that modify existing sequences and are prone to local optima, and (2) they lack the guidance of biological prior knowledge in sequence optimization. In this paper, we address these limitations by proposing a generative approach that leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to fine-tune a pre-trained autoregressive (AR) model. Our method incorporates data-driven biological priors by deriving computational inference-based rewards that simulate the addition of activator TFBSs and removal of repressor TFBSs, which are then integrated into the RL process. We evaluate our method on promoter design tasks in two yeast media conditions and enhancer design tasks for three human cell types, demonstrating its ability to generate high-fitness CREs while maintaining sequence diversity.

    "abstract": "Genes, proteins and other biological entities influence one another via causal molecular networks. Causal relationships in such networks are mediated by complex and diverse mechanisms, through latent variables, and are often specific to cellular context. It remains challenging to characterise such networks in practice. Here, we present a novel framework to evaluate large language models (LLMs) for zero-shot inference of causal relationships in biology. In particular, we systematically evaluate causal claims obtained from an LLM using real-world interventional data. This is done over one hundred variables and thousands of causal hypotheses. Furthermore, we consider several prompting and retrieval-augmentation strategies, including large, and potentially conflicting, collections of scientific articles. Our results show that with tailored augmentation and prompting, even relatively small LLMs can capture meaningful aspects of causal structure in biological systems. This supports the notion that LLMs could act as orchestration tools in biological discovery, by helping to distil current knowledge in ways amenable to downstream analysis. Our approach to assessing LLMs with respect to experimental data is relevant for a broad range of problems at the intersection of causal learning, LLMs and scientific discovery.",

    "abstract": "The advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies has revolutionized genome analysis by enabling the rapid and cost-effective sequencing of large genomes. Despite these advancements, the increasing complexity and volume of genomic data present significant challenges related to accuracy, scalability, and computational efficiency. These challenges are mainly due to various forms of unwanted and unhandled variations in sequencing data, collectively referred to as noise. In this dissertation, we address these challenges by providing a deep understanding of different types of noise in genomic data and developing techniques to mitigate the impact of noise on genome analysis.   First, we introduce BLEND, a noise-tolerant hashing mechanism that quickly identifies both exactly matching and highly similar sequences with arbitrary differences using a single lookup of their hash values. Second, to enable scalable and accurate analysis of noisy raw nanopore signals, we propose RawHash, a novel mechanism that effectively reduces noise in raw nanopore signals and enables accurate, real-time analysis by proposing the first hash-based similarity search technique for raw nanopore signals. Third, we extend the capabilities of RawHash with RawHash2, an improved mechanism that 1) provides a better understanding of noise in raw nanopore signals to reduce it more effectively and 2) improves the robustness of mapping decisions. Fourth, we explore the broader implications and new applications of raw nanopore signal analysis by introducing Rawsamble, the first mechanism for all-vs-all overlapping of raw signals using hash-based search. Rawsamble enables the construction of de novo assemblies directly from raw signals without basecalling, which opens up new directions and uses for raw nanopore signal analysis.",

    "abstract": "Motivation: PCR is more economical and quicker than Next Generation Sequencing for detecting target organisms, with primer design being a critical step. In epidemiology with rapidly mutating viruses, designing effective primers is challenging. Traditional methods require substantial manual intervention and struggle to ensure effective primer design across different strains. For organisms with large, similar genomes like Escherichia coli and Shigella flexneri, differentiating between species is also difficult but crucial.   Results: We developed Primer C-VAE, a model based on a Variational Auto-Encoder framework with Convolutional Neural Networks to identify variants and generate specific primers. Using SARS-CoV-2, our model classified variants (alpha, beta, gamma, delta, omicron) with 98% accuracy and generated variant-specific primers. These primers appeared with >95% frequency in target variants and <5% in others, showing good performance in in-silico PCR tests. For Alpha, Delta, and Omicron, our primer pairs produced fragments <200 bp, suitable for qPCR detection. The model also generated effective primers for organisms with longer gene sequences like E. coli and S. flexneri.   Conclusion: Primer C-VAE is an interpretable deep learning approach for developing specific primer pairs for target organisms. This flexible, semi-automated and reliable tool works regardless of sequence completeness and length, allowing for qPCR applications and can be applied to organisms with large and highly similar genomes.",

    "abstract": "Genome length varies widely among organisms, from compact genomes of prokaryotes to vast and complex genomes of eukaryotes. In this study, we theoretically identify the evolutionary pressures that may have driven this divergence in genome length. We use a parameter-free model to study genome length evolution under selection pressure to minimize replication time and maximize information storage capacity. We show that prokaryotes tend to reduce genome length, constrained by a single replication origin, while eukaryotes expand their genomes by incorporating multiple replication origins. We propose a connection between genome length and cellular energetics, suggesting that endosymbiotic organelles, mitochondria and chloroplasts, evolutionarily regulate the number of replication origins, thereby influencing genome length in eukaryotes. We show that the above two selection pressures also lead to strict equalization of the number of purines and their corresponding base-pairing pyrimidines within a single DNA strand, known as Chagraff's second parity rule, a hitherto unexplained observation in genomes of nearly all known species. This arises from the symmetrization of replichore length, another observation that has been shown to hold across species, which our model reproduces. The model also reproduces other experimentally observed phenomena, such as a general preference for deletions over insertions, and elongation and high variance of genome lengths under reduced selection pressure for replication rate, termed the C-value paradox. We highlight the possibility of regulation of the firing of latent replication origins in response to cues from the extracellular environment leading to the regulation of cell cycle rates in multicellular eukaryotes.",

In our paper, we propose MLFformer. MLFformer is a Transformer-based architecture that incorporates the Fast Attention mechanism and a multilayer perceptron module to handle high-dimensional nonlinear features. In MLFformer, the Fast Attention mechanism is utilized to handle computational complexity and enhance processing efficiency. In addition, the MLP structure further captures high-dimensional nonlinear features. Through experiments, the results show that MLFformer reduces the average MAPE by 7.73% compared to the vanilla Transformer. In univariate and multivariate prediction scenarios, MLFformer achieves the best predictive performance among all compared models.",

    "abstract": "Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is a critical post-transcriptional surveillance mechanism that degrades transcripts with premature termination codons, safeguarding transcriptome integrity and shaping disease phenotypes. However, accurately predicting NMD efficiency remains challenging, as existing models often rely on simplistic rule-based heuristics or limited feature sets, constraining their accuracy and generalizability. Using paired DNA and RNA data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we benchmark embedding-only models and demonstrate that they underperform compared to a simple rule-based approach. To address this, we develop NMDEP (NMD Efficiency Predictor), an integrative framework that combines optimized rule-based methods, sequence embeddings, and curated biological features, achieving state-of-the-art predictive performance. Through explainable AI, we identify key NMD determinants, reaffirming established factors such as variant position while uncovering novel contributors like ribosome loading. Applied to over 2.9 million simulated stop-gain variants, NMDEP facilitates large-scale mRNA degradation assessments, advancing variant interpretation and disease research.",

    "abstract": "mRNA-based vaccines have become a major focus in the pharmaceutical industry. The coding sequence as well as the Untranslated Regions (UTRs) of an mRNA can strongly influence translation efficiency, stability, degradation, and other factors that collectively determine a vaccine's effectiveness. However, optimizing mRNA sequences for those properties remains a complex challenge. Existing deep learning models often focus solely on coding region optimization, overlooking the UTRs. We present Helix-mRNA, a structured state-space-based and attention hybrid model to address these challenges. In addition to a first pre-training, a second pre-training stage allows us to specialise the model with high-quality data. We employ single nucleotide tokenization of mRNA sequences with codon separation, ensuring prior biological and structural information from the original mRNA sequence is not lost. Our model, Helix-mRNA, outperforms existing methods in analysing both UTRs and coding region properties. It can process sequences 6x longer than current approaches while using only 10% of the parameters of existing foundation models. Its predictive capabilities extend to all mRNA regions. We open-source the model (https://github.com/helicalAI/helical) and model weights (https://huggingface.co/helical-ai/helix-mRNA).",

Here, we introduce Seq2Exp, a Sequence to Expression network explicitly designed to discover and extract regulatory elements that drive target gene expression, enhancing the accuracy of the gene expression prediction. Our approach captures the causal relationship between epigenomic signals, DNA sequences and their associated regulatory elements. Specifically, we propose to decompose the epigenomic signals and the DNA sequence conditioned on the causal active regulatory elements, and apply an information bottleneck with the Beta distribution to combine their effects while filtering out non-causal components. Our experiments demonstrate that Seq2Exp outperforms existing baselines in gene expression prediction tasks and discovers influential regions compared to commonly used statistical methods for peak detection such as MACS3.

    "abstract": "Single-cell proteomics (SCP) is transforming our understanding of biological complexity by shifting from bulk proteomics, where signals are averaged over thousands of cells, to the proteome analysis of individual cells. This granular perspective reveals distinct cell states, population heterogeneity, and the underpinnings of disease pathogenesis that bulk approaches may obscure. However, SCP demands exceptional sensitivity, precise cell handling, and robust data processing to overcome the inherent challenges of analyzing picogram-level protein samples without amplification. Recent innovations in sample preparation, separations, data acquisition strategies, and specialized mass spectrometry instrumentation have substantially improved proteome coverage and throughput. Approaches that integrate complementary omics, streamline multi-step sample processing, and automate workflows through microfluidics and specialized platforms promise to further push SCP boundaries. Advances in computational methods, especially for data normalization and imputation, address the pervasive issue of missing values, enabling more reliable downstream biological interpretations. Despite these strides, higher throughput, reproducibility, and consensus best practices remain pressing needs in the field. This mini review summarizes the latest progress in SCP technology and software solutions, highlighting how closer integration of analytical, computational, and experimental strategies will facilitate deeper and broader coverage of single-cell proteomes.",

    "abstract": "Advances in natural language processing and large language models have sparked growing interest in modeling DNA, often referred to as the \"language of life\". However, DNA modeling poses unique challenges. First, it requires the ability to process ultra-long DNA sequences while preserving single-nucleotide resolution, as individual nucleotides play a critical role in DNA function. Second, success in this domain requires excelling at both generative and understanding tasks: generative tasks hold potential for therapeutic and industrial applications, while understanding tasks provide crucial insights into biological mechanisms and diseases. To address these challenges, we propose HybriDNA, a decoder-only DNA language model that incorporates a hybrid Transformer-Mamba2 architecture, seamlessly integrating the strengths of attention mechanisms with selective state-space models. This hybrid design enables HybriDNA to efficiently process DNA sequences up to 131kb in length with single-nucleotide resolution. HybriDNA achieves state-of-the-art performance across 33 DNA understanding datasets curated from the BEND, GUE, and LRB benchmarks, and demonstrates exceptional capability in generating synthetic cis-regulatory elements (CREs) with desired properties. Furthermore, we show that HybriDNA adheres to expected scaling laws, with performance improving consistently as the model scales from 300M to 3B and 7B parameters. These findings underscore HybriDNA's versatility and its potential to advance DNA research and applications, paving the way for innovations in understanding and engineering the \"language of life\".",

However, existing methods for clustering spatially variable genes (SVGs) into co-expression modules often fail to detect rare or unique spatial expression patterns. To address this, we present spatial transcriptomics iterative hierarchical clustering (stIHC), a novel method for clustering SVGs into co-expression modules, representing groups of genes with shared spatial expression patterns. Through three simulations and applications to spatial transcriptomics datasets from technologies such as 10x Visium, 10x Xenium, and Spatial Transcriptomics, stIHC outperforms clustering approaches used by popular SVG detection methods, including SPARK, SPARK-X, MERINGUE, and SpatialDE. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis confirms that genes within each module share consistent biological functions, supporting the functional relevance of spatial co-expression. Robust across technologies with varying gene numbers and spatial resolution, stIHC provides a powerful tool for decoding the spatial organization of gene expression and the functional structure of complex tissues.",

To address these challenges, we present scMamba, a pre-trained model designed to improve the quality and utility of snRNA-seq analysis, with a particular focus on neurodegenerative diseases. Inspired by the recent Mamba model, scMamba introduces a novel architecture that incorporates a linear adapter layer, gene embeddings, and bidirectional Mamba blocks, enabling efficient processing of snRNA-seq data while preserving information from the raw input. Notably, scMamba learns generalizable features of cells and genes through pre-training on snRNA-seq data, without relying on dimension reduction or selection of highly variable genes. We demonstrate that scMamba outperforms benchmark methods in various downstream tasks, including cell type annotation, doublet detection, imputation, and the identification of differentially expressed genes.",

Although modern biological pre-trained models have achieved great success in analyzing these macromolecules individually, their interconnected nature remains underexplored. This paper follows the guidance of the central dogma to redesign both the data and model pipeline and offers a comprehensive framework, Life-Code, that spans different biological functions. As for data flow, we propose a unified pipeline to integrate multi-omics data by reverse-transcribing RNA and reverse-translating amino acids into nucleotide-based sequences. As for the model, we design a codon tokenizer and a hybrid long-sequence architecture to encode the interactions between coding and non-coding regions through masked modeling pre-training. To model the translation and folding process with coding sequences, Life-Code learns protein structures of the corresponding amino acids by knowledge distillation from off-the-shelf protein language models. Such designs enable Life-Code to capture complex interactions within genetic sequences, providing a more comprehensive understanding of multi-omics with the central dogma. Extensive experiments show that Life-Code achieves state-of-the-art results on various tasks across three omics, highlighting its potential for advancing multi-omics analysis and interpretation.",

Similar to advancements in AI for other scientific fields, deeper research into biological LLMs has begun to focus on using these models to rediscover important existing biological laws or uncover entirely new patterns in biological sequences. This study leverages GPT-like LLMs to utilize language transfer capabilities to rediscover the genetic code rules of the central dogma. In our experimental design, we transformed the central dogma into a binary classification problem of aligning DNA sequences with protein sequences, where positive examples are matching DNA and protein sequences, and negative examples are non-matching pairs. We first trained a GPT-2 model from scratch using a dataset comprising protein sequences, DNA sequences, and sequences from languages such as English and Chinese. Subsequently, we fine-tuned the model using the natural language sentences similarity judgment dataset from PAWS-X. When tested on a dataset for DNA and protein sequence alignment judgment, the fine-tuned model achieved a classification accuracy of 81%. The study also analyzed factors contributing to this zero-shot capability, including model training stability and types of training data. This research demonstrates that LLMs can, through the transfer of natural language capabilities and solely relying on the analysis of sequences themselves, rediscover the central dogma without prior knowledge of it.

    "abstract": "Conditional generation models for longitudinal sequences can generate new or modified trajectories given a conditioning input. While effective at generating entire sequences, these models typically lack control over the timing and scope of the edits. Most existing approaches either operate on univariate sequences or assume that the condition affects all variables and time steps. However, many scientific and clinical applications require more precise interventions, where a condition takes effect only after a specific time and influences only a subset of variables. We introduce CLEF, a controllable sequence editing model for conditional generation of immediate and delayed effects in multivariate longitudinal sequences. CLEF learns temporal concepts that encode how and when a condition alters future sequence evolution. These concepts allow CLEF to apply targeted edits to the affected time steps and variables while preserving the rest of the sequence. We evaluate CLEF on 6 datasets spanning cellular reprogramming and patient health trajectories, comparing against 9 state-of-the-art baselines. CLEF improves immediate sequence editing accuracy by up to 36.01% (MAE). Unlike prior models, CLEF enables one-step conditional generation at arbitrary future times, outperforming them in delayed sequence editing by up to 65.71% (MAE). We test CLEF under counterfactual inference assumptions and show up to 63.19% (MAE) improvement on zero-shot conditional generation of counterfactual trajectories. In a case study of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, CLEF identifies clinical interventions that generate realistic counterfactual trajectories shifted toward healthier outcomes.",

Our approach consists of two stages: (i) pretraining on DNA sequences with next token prediction objective, and (ii) expanding the multi-modal task-specific tokens and finetuning for multiple downstream tasks simultaneously. When evaluated on the Nucleotide Transformer and GB benchmarks, Omni-DNA achieves state-of-the-art performance on 18 out of 26 tasks. Through multi-task finetuning, Omni-DNA addresses 10 acetylation and methylation tasks at once, surpassing models trained on each task individually. Finally, we design two complex genomic tasks, DNA2Function and Needle-in-DNA, which map DNA sequences to textual functional descriptions and images, respectively, indicating Omni-DNA's cross-modal capabilities to broaden the scope of genomic applications.

    "abstract": "The exploration of cellular heterogeneity within the tumor microenvironment (TME) via single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is essential for understanding cancer progression and response to therapy. Current scRNA-seq approaches, however, lack spatial context and rely on incomplete datasets of ligand-receptor interactions (LRIs), limiting accurate cell type annotation and cell-cell communication (CCC) inference. This study addresses these challenges using a novel graph neural network (GNN) model that enhances cell type prediction and cell interaction analysis. Our study utilized a dataset consisting of 49,020 cells from 19 patients across three cancer types: Leukemia, Breast Invasive Carcinoma, and Colorectal Cancer. The proposed scGSL model demonstrated robust performance, achieving an average accuracy of 84.83%, precision of 86.23%, recall of 81.51%, and an F1 score of 80.92% across all datasets. These metrics represent a significant enhancement over existing methods, which typically exhibit lower performance metrics. Additionally, by reviewing existing literature on gene interactions within the TME, the scGSL model proves to robustly identify biologically meaningful gene interactions in an unsupervised manner, validated by significant expression differences in key gene pairs across various cancers.

    "abstract": "Transcription factors are proteins that regulate the expression of genes by binding to specific genomic regions known as Transcription Factor Binding Sites (TFBSs), typically located in the promoter regions of those genes. Accurate prediction of these binding sites is essential for understanding the complex gene regulatory networks underlying various cellular functions. In this regard, many deep learning models have been developed for such prediction, but there is still scope of improvement. In this work, we have developed a deep learning model which uses pre-trained DNABERT, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) module, a Modified Convolutional Block Attention Module (MCBAM), a Multi-Scale Convolutions with Attention (MSCA) module and an output module. The pre-trained DNABERT is used for sequence embedding, thereby capturing the long-term dependencies in the DNA sequences while the CNN, MCBAM and MSCA modules are useful in extracting higher-order local features. TFBS-Finder is trained and tested on 165 ENCODE ChIP-seq datasets. We have also performed ablation studies as well as cross-cell line validations and comparisons with other models. The experimental results show the superiority of the proposed method in predicting TFBSs compared to the existing methodologies.

    "abstract": "The rise of single-cell sequencing technologies has revolutionized the exploration of drug resistance, revealing the crucial role of cellular heterogeneity in advancing precision medicine. By building computational models from existing single-cell drug response data, we can rapidly annotate cellular responses to drugs in subsequent trials. To this end, we developed scGSDR, a model that integrates two computational pipelines grounded in the knowledge of cellular states and gene signaling pathways, both essential for understanding biological gene semantics. scGSDR enhances predictive performance by incorporating gene semantics and employs an interpretability module to identify key pathways contributing to drug resistance phenotypes. Our extensive validation, which included 16 experiments covering 11 drugs, demonstrates scGSDR's superior predictive accuracy, when trained with either bulk-seq or scRNA-seq data, achieving high AUROC, AUPR, and F1 Scores. The model's application has extended from single-drug predictions to scenarios involving drug combinations. Leveraging pathways of known drug target genes, we found that scGSDR's cell-pathway attention scores are biologically interpretable, which helped us identify other potential drug-related genes. Literature review of top-ranking genes in our predictions such as BCL2, CCND1, the AKT family, and PIK3CA for PLX4720; and ICAM1, VCAM1, NFKB1, NFKBIA, and RAC1 for Paclitaxel confirmed their relevance. In conclusion, scGSDR, by incorporating gene semantics, enhances predictive modeling of cellular responses to diverse drugs, proving invaluable for scenarios involving both single drug and combination therapies and effectively identifying key resistance-related pathways, thus advancing precision medicine and targeted therapy development.",

    "title": "A network-driven framework for enhancing gene-disease association studies in coronary artery disease",
    "abstract": "Over the last decade, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified numerous genetic variants associated with complex diseases. These associations have the potential to reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying complex diseases and lead to the identification of novel drug targets. Despite these advancements, the biological pathways and mechanisms linking genetic variants to complex diseases are still not fully understood. Most trait-associated variants reside in non-coding regions and are presumed to influence phenotypes through regulatory effects on gene expression. Yet, it is often unclear which genes they regulate and in which cell types this regulation occurs. Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) aim to bridge this gap by detecting trait-associated tissue gene expression regulated by GWAS variants. However, traditional TWAS approaches frequently overlook the critical contributions of trans-regulatory effects and fail to integrate comprehensive regulatory networks. Here, we present a novel framework that leverages tissue-specific gene regulatory networks (GRNs) to integrate cis- and trans-genetic regulatory effects into the TWAS framework for complex diseases. We validate our approach using coronary artery disease (CAD), utilizing data from the STARNET project, which provides multi-tissue gene expression and genetic data from around 600 living patients with cardiovascular disease. Preliminary results demonstrate the potential of our GRN-driven framework to uncover more genes and pathways that may underlie CAD. This framework extends traditional TWAS methodologies by utilizing tissue-specific regulatory insights and advancing the understanding of complex disease genetic architecture.",

    "abstract": "Rare diseases are challenging to diagnose due to limited patient data and genetic diversity. Despite advances in variant prioritization, many cases remain undiagnosed. While large language models (LLMs) have performed well in medical exams, their effectiveness in diagnosing rare genetic diseases has not been assessed. To identify causal genes, we benchmarked various LLMs for gene prioritization. Using multi-agent and Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) classification, we categorized patients based on phenotypes and solvability levels. As gene set size increased, LLM performance deteriorated, so we used a divide-and-conquer strategy to break the task into smaller subsets. At baseline, GPT-4 outperformed other LLMs, achieving near 30% accuracy in ranking causal genes correctly. The multi-agent and HPO approaches helped distinguish confidently solved cases from challenging ones, highlighting the importance of known gene-phenotype associations and phenotype specificity. We found that cases with specific phenotypes or clear associations were more accurately solved. However, we observed biases toward well-studied genes and input order sensitivity, which hindered gene prioritization. Our divide-and-conquer strategy improved accuracy by overcoming these biases. By utilizing HPO classification, novel multi-agent techniques, and our LLM strategy, we improved causal gene identification accuracy compared to our baseline evaluation. This approach streamlines rare disease diagnosis, facilitates reanalysis of unsolved cases, and accelerates gene discovery, supporting the development of targeted diagnostics and therapies.",

    "abstract": "The rapid emergence of single-cell data has facilitated the study of many different biological conditions at the cellular level. Cluster analysis has been widely applied to identify cell types, capturing the essential patterns of the original data in a much more concise form. One challenge in the cluster analysis of cells is matching clusters extracted from datasets of different origins or conditions. Many existing algorithms cannot recognize new cell types present in only one of the two samples when establishing a correspondence between clusters obtained from two samples. Additionally, when there are more than two samples, it is advantageous to align clusters across all samples simultaneously rather than performing pairwise alignment. Our approach aims to construct a taxonomy for cell clusters across all samples to better annotate these clusters and effectively extract features for downstream analysis. A new system for constructing cell-type taxonomy has been developed by combining the technique of Optimal Transport with Relaxed Marginal Constraints (OT-RMC) and the simultaneous alignment of clusters across multiple samples. OT-RMC allows us to address challenges that arise when the proportions of clusters vary substantially between samples or when some clusters do not appear in all the samples. Experiments on more than twenty datasets demonstrate that the taxonomy constructed by this new system can yield highly accurate annotation of cell types. Additionally, sample-level features extracted based on the taxonomy result in accurate classification of samples.",

    "abstract": "Motivation: Nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDVs) are notable for their large genomes and extensive gene repertoires, which contribute to their widespread environmental presence and critical roles in processes such as host metabolic reprogramming and nutrient cycling. Metagenomic sequencing has emerged as a powerful tool for uncovering novel NCLDVs in environmental samples. However, identifying NCLDV sequences in metagenomic data remains challenging due to their high genomic diversity, limited reference genomes, and shared regions with other microbes. Existing alignment-based and machine learning methods struggle with achieving optimal trade-offs between sensitivity and precision. Results: In this work, we present GiantHunter, a reinforcement learning-based tool for identifying NCLDVs from metagenomic data. By employing a Monte Carlo tree search strategy, GiantHunter dynamically selects representative non-NCLDV sequences as the negative training data, enabling the model to establish a robust decision boundary. Benchmarking on rigorously designed experiments shows that GiantHunter achieves high precision while maintaining competitive sensitivity, improving the F1-score by 10% and reducing computational cost by 90% compared to the second-best method. To demonstrate its real-world utility, we applied GiantHunter to 60 metagenomic datasets collected from six cities along the Yangtze River, located both upstream and downstream of the Three Gorges Dam. The results reveal significant differences in NCLDV diversity correlated with proximity to the dam, likely influenced by reduced flow velocity caused by the dam. These findings highlight the potential of GiantSeeker to advance our understanding of NCLDVs and their ecological roles in diverse environments.",

    "abstract": "Normalization is a critical step in quantitative analyses of biological processes. Recent works show that cross-platform integration and normalization enable machine learning (ML) training on RNA microarray and RNA-seq data, but no independent datasets were used in their studies. Therefore, it is unclear how to improve ML modelling performance on independent RNA array and RNA-seq based datasets. Inspired by the house-keeping genes that are commonly used in experimental biology, this study tests the hypothesis that non-differentially expressed genes (NDEG) may improve normalization of transcriptomic data and subsequently cross-platform modelling performance of ML models. Microarray and RNA-seq datasets of the TCGA breast cancer were used as independent training and test datasets, respectively, to classify the molecular subtypes of breast cancer. NDEG (p>0.85) and differentially expressed genes (DEG, p<0.05) were selected based on the p values of ANOVA analysis and used for subsequent data normalization and classification, respectively. Models trained based on data from one platform were used for testing on the other platform. Our data show that NDEG and DEG gene selection could effectively improve the model classification performance. Normalization methods based on parametric statistical analysis were inferior to those based on nonparametric statistics. In this study, the LOG_QN and LOG_QNZ normalization methods combined with the neural network classification model seem to achieve better performance. Therefore, NDEG-based normalization appears useful for cross-platform testing on completely independent datasets. However, more studies are required to examine whether NDEG-based normalization can improve ML classification performance in other datasets and other omic data types.",

To address these limitations, we propose GSEMA (Gene Set Enrichment Meta-Analysis), a novel methodology that leverages singlesample enrichment scoring to aggregate gene expression data into pathway-level matrices. By applying meta-analysis techniques to enrichment scores, GSEMA preserves the magnitude and directionality of effects, enabling the definition of pathway activity across datasets. Using simulated data and case studies on Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and Parkinson's Disease (PD), we demonstrate that GSEMA outperforms other methods in controlling false positive rates while providing meaningful biological interpretations.

    "abstract": "The commercial value of economically significant fruits, including date palm fruit (dates), is influenced by various factors, such as biochemical composition and morphological features like size, shape, and visual appearance, which are key determinants of their quality and market value. Dates are typically consumed at the dry stage (Tamar), during which they exhibit a wide range of physical characteristics, such as color, length, weight, and skin appearance. Understanding the genetic basis of these traits is crucial for improving crop quality and breeding new cultivars. In this study, we integrated a genome dataset from highly diverse date cultivars with phenotypes of dry fruit such as length, width, area, and weight, identifying multiple significant genetic loci (SNPs) associated with these traits. We also identified candidate genes located near the associated SNPs that are involved in biological processes such as cell differentiation, proliferation, growth, and the regulation of signalling pathways for growth regulators like auxin and abscisic acid, as observed in other plants. Gene expression analysis reveals that many of these genes are highly expressed in the early stage of fruit development when the fruit attains its maximum size and weight. These findings will enhance our understanding of genetic determinants of fruit size particularly at the commercially important Tamar stage.",

    "title": "Hypergraph Representations of scRNA-seq Data for Improved Clustering with Random Walks",
    "abstract": "Analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data is often conducted through network projections such as coexpression networks, primarily due to the abundant availability of network analysis tools for downstream tasks. However, this approach has several limitations: loss of higher-order information, inefficient data representation caused by converting a sparse dataset to a fully connected network, and overestimation of coexpression due to zero-inflation. To address these limitations, we propose conceptualizing scRNA-seq expression data as hypergraphs, which are generalized graphs in which the hyperedges can connect more than two vertices. In the context of scRNA-seq data, the hypergraph nodes represent cells and the edges represent genes. Each hyperedge connects all cells where its corresponding gene is actively expressed and records the expression of the gene across different cells. This hypergraph conceptualization enables us to explore multi-way relationships beyond the pairwise interactions in coexpression networks without loss of information. We propose two novel clustering methods: (1) the Dual-Importance Preference Hypergraph Walk (DIPHW) and (2) the Coexpression and Memory-Integrated Dual-Importance Preference Hypergraph Walk (CoMem-DIPHW). They outperform established methods on both simulated and real scRNA-seq datasets. The improvement brought by our proposed methods is especially significant when data modularity is weak. Furthermore, CoMem-DIPHW incorporates the gene coexpression network, cell coexpression network, and the cell-gene expression hypergraph from the single-cell abundance counts data altogether for embedding computation. This approach accounts for both the local level information from single-cell level gene expression and the global level information from the pairwise similarity in the two coexpression networks.",

Coverage is determined by processing read alignments to reference sequences of either contigs or genomes. Per-reference coverage is typically calculated in an ad-hoc manner, with each software package providing its own implementation and specific definition of coverage. Here we present a unified software package CoverM which calculates several coverage statistics for contigs and genomes in an ergonomic and flexible manner. It uses 'Mosdepth arrays' for computational efficiency and avoids unnecessary I/O overhead by calculating coverage statistics from streamed read alignment results. CoverM is free software available at https://github.com/wwood/coverm.

    "abstract": "Live-cell imaging experiments have shown that the distal dynamics between enhancers and promoters are unexpectedly rapid and incompatible with standard polymer models. The discordance between the compact static chromatin organization and dynamics is a conundrum that violates the expected structure-function relationship. We developed a theory to predict chromatin dynamics by accurately determining three-dimensional (3D) structures from static Hi-C contact maps or fixed-cell imaging data. Using the calculated 3D coordinates, the theory accurately forecasts experimentally observed two-point chromatin dynamics. It predicts rapid enhancer-promoter interactions and uncovers a scaling relationship between two-point relaxation time and genomic separation, closely matching recent measurements. The theory predicts that cohesin depletion accelerates single-locus diffusion while significantly slowing relaxation dynamics within topologically associating domains (TADs). Our results demonstrate that chromatin dynamics can be reliably inferred from static structural data, reinforcing the notion that 3D chromatin structure governs dynamic behavior. This general framework offers powerful tools for exploring chromatin dynamics across diverse biological contexts.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in cellular research demonstrate that scRNA-seq characterizes cellular heterogeneity, while spatial transcriptomics reveals the spatial distribution of gene expression. Cell representation is the fundamental issue in the two fields. Here, we propose Topology-encoded Latent Hyperbolic Geometry (TopoLa), a computational framework enhancing cell representations by capturing fine-grained intercellular topological relationships. The framework introduces a new metric, TopoLa distance (TLd), which quantifies the geometric distance between cells within latent hyperbolic space, capturing the network's topological structure more effectively. With this framework, the cell representation can be enhanced considerably by performing convolution on its neighboring cells. Performance evaluation across seven biological tasks, including scRNA-seq data clustering and spatial transcriptomics domain identification, shows that TopoLa significantly improves the performance of several state-of-the-art models. These results underscore the generalizability and robustness of TopoLa, establishing it as a valuable tool for advancing both biological discovery and computational methodologies.",

However, interpreting genome sequences is challenging because of the vast size of the human genome, and because its consequences manifest across a wide range of cells, tissues and scales -- spanning from molecular to whole organism level. Here, we present Phenformer, a multi-scale genetic language model that learns to generate mechanistic hypotheses as to how differences in genome sequence lead to disease-relevant changes in expression across cell types and tissues directly from DNA sequences of up to 88 million base pairs. Using whole genome sequencing data from more than 150 000 individuals, we show that Phenformer generates mechanistic hypotheses about disease-relevant cell and tissue types that match literature better than existing state-of-the-art methods, while using only sequence data. Furthermore, disease risk predictors enriched by Phenformer show improved prediction performance and generalisation to diverse populations. Accurate multi-megabase scale interpretation of whole genomes without additional experimental data enables both a deeper understanding of molecular mechanisms involved in disease and improved disease risk prediction at the level of individuals.",

Traditional methods falter with high-dimensional and high feature-to-sample count ratios, which are critical for classifying cancer samples. This study aims to develop a novel feature selection framework specifically for transcriptome data and propose two ensemble classifiers. For feature selection, we partition the transcriptome dataset vertically based on feature types. Then apply the Boruta feature selection process on each of the partitions, combine the results, and apply Boruta again on the combined result. We repeat the process with different parameters of Boruta and prepare the final feature set. Finally, we constructed two ensemble ML models based on LR, SVM and XGBoost classifiers with max voting and averaging probability approach. We used 10-fold cross-validation to ensure robust and reliable classification performance. With 97.11\\% accuracy and 0.9996 AUC value, our approach performs better compared to existing state-of-the-art methods to classify 33 types of cancers. A set of 12 types of cancer is traditionally challenging to differentiate between each other due to their similarity in tissue of origin. Our method accurately identifies over 90\\% of samples from these 12 types of cancers, which outperforms all known methods presented in existing literature. The gene set enrichment analysis reveals that our framework's selected features have enriched the pathways highly related to cancers. This study develops a feature selection framework to select features highly related to cancer development and leads to identifying different types of cancer samples with higher accuracy.",

Nevertheless, there is currently no clear clinical indication for the use of bevacizumab, highlighting the urgent need for biomarkers to assess the response to bevacizumab. In the present study, based on a novel RNA-seq dataset (n=181) and a previously published microarray-based dataset (n=377), we have identified an expression signature potentially associated with benefit from bevacizumab addition and assumed to reflect cancer stemness acquisition driven by activation of CTCFL. Patients with this signature demonstrated improved overall survival when bevacizumab was added to standard chemotherapy in both novel (HR=0.41(0.23-0.74), adj.p-value=7.70e-03) and previously published cohorts (HR=0.51(0.34-0.75), adj.p-value=3.25e-03), while no significant differences in survival explained by treatment were observed in patients negative for this signature. In addition to the CTCFL signature, we found several other reproducible expression signatures which may also represent biomarker candidates not related to established molecular subtypes of ovarian cancer and require further validation studies based on additional RNA-seq data.",

Our study identified network interactions regulating glioma morphogenesis via the tumor-immune microenvironment, including neurodevelopmental programs, calcium dynamics, iron metabolism, metabolic reprogramming, and feedback loops between MAPK/ERK and WNT signaling. These relationships highlight the emergence of a hybrid spectrum of cellular states navigating a disrupted neuro-differentiation hierarchy. We identified transition genes such as DKK3, NOTCH2, GATAD1, GFAP, and SEZ6L in IDHWT glioblastoma, and H3F3A, ANXA6, HES6/7, SIRT2, FXYD6, PTPRZ1, MEIS1, CXXC5, and NDUFAB1 in K27M subtypes. We also identified MTRNR2L1, GAPDH, IGF2, FKBP variants, and FXYD7 as transition genes that influence cell fate decision-making across both subsystems. Our findings suggest pHGGs are developmentally trapped in states exhibiting maladaptive behaviors, and hybrid cellular identities. In effect, tumor heterogeneity (metastability) and plasticity emerge as stress-response patterns to immune-inflammatory microenvironments and oxidative stress. Furthermore, we show that pHGGs are steered by developmental trajectories from radial glia predominantly favoring neocortical cell fates, in telencephalon and prefrontal cortex (PFC) differentiation. By addressing underlying patterning processes and plasticity networks as therapeutic vulnerabilities, our findings provide precision medicine strategies aimed at modulating glioma cell fates and overcoming therapeutic resistance. We suggest transition therapy toward neuronal-like lineage differentiation as a potential therapy to help stabilize pHGG plasticity and aggressivity.",

In this context, explainable AI (XAI) emerges as a solution that could help to understand disease-associated mechanisms when combined with efficient NN models. However, limited research explores XAI in single-cell data. In this work, we implement a method for identifying disease-related genes and the mechanistic explanation of disease progression based on NN model combined with SHAP. We analyze available Huntington's disease (HD) data to identify both HD-altered genes and mechanisms by adding Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) comparing two methods, differential gene expression analysis (DGE) and NN combined with SHAP approach.

Our method not only improves prediction accuracy but also reveals key age-related CpG sites, detects age-specific changes in aging rates, and identifies pairwise interactions between CpG sites.

    "abstract": "Alpha satellite DNA is large tandem arrays of 150-400 bp units, and its origin remains an evolutionary mystery. In this research, we identified 1,545 alpha-satellite-like (SatL) repeat units in the nuclear genome of jewel wasp Nasonia vitripennis. Among them, thirty-nine copies of SatL were organized in two palindromic arrays in mitochondria, resulting in a 50% increase in the genome size. Strikingly, genomic neighborhood analyses of 1,516 nuclear SatL repeats revealed that they are located in NuMT (nuclear mitochondrial DNA) regions, and SatL phylogeny matched perfectly with mitochondrial genes and NuMT pseudogenes. These results support that SatL arrays originated from ten independent mitochondria insertion events into the nuclear genome within the last 500,000 years, after divergence from its sister species N. giraulti. Dramatic repeat GC-percent elevation (from 33.9% to 50.4%) is a hallmark of rapid SatL sequence evolution in mitochondria due to GC-biased gene conversion facilitated by the palindromic sequence pairing of the two mitochondrial SatL arrays. The nuclear SatL repeat arrays underwent substantial copy number expansion, from 12-15 (SatL1) to over 400 copies (SatL4). The oldest SatL4B array consists of four types of repeat units derived from deletions in the AT-rich region of ancestral repeats, and complex high-order structures have evolved through duplications. We also discovered similar repeat insertions into the nuclear genome of Muscidifurax, suggesting this mechanism can be common in insects. This is the first report of the mitochondrial origin of nuclear satellite sequences, and our findings shed new light on the origin and evolution of satellite DNA.",

We carry out byte-pair encoding (BPE) tokenization on our dataset, tailored for metagenomic sequences, and then pretrain our model. In this paper, we first detail the pretraining dataset, tokenization strategy, and model architecture, highlighting the considerations and design choices that enable the effective modeling of metagenomic data. We then show results of pretraining this model on our metagenomic dataset, providing details about our losses, system metrics, and training stability over the course of pretraining. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of METAGENE-1, which achieves state-of-the-art results on a set of genomic benchmarks and new evaluations focused on human-pathogen detection and genomic sequence embedding, showcasing its potential for public health applications in pandemic monitoring, biosurveillance, and early detection of emerging health threats.",

    "abstract": "Chromatin immunoprecipitation with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) provides insights into both the genomic location occupied by the protein of interest and the difference in DNA occupancy between experimental states. Given that ChIP-seq data is collected experimentally, an important step for determining regions with differential DNA occupancy between states is between-sample normalization. While between-sample normalization is crucial for downstream differential binding analysis, the technical conditions underlying between-sample normalization methods have yet to be examined for ChIP-seq. We identify three important technical conditions underlying ChIP-seq between-sample normalization methods: balanced differential DNA occupancy, equal total DNA occupancy, and equal background binding across states. To illustrate satisfying the selected normalization method's technical conditions for downstream differential binding analysis, we simulate ChIP-seq read count data where different combinations of the technical conditions are violated. We then externally verify our simulation results using experimental data. Based on our findings, we suggest that researchers use their understanding of the ChIP-seq experiment at hand to guide their choice of between-sample normalization method. Alternatively, researchers can use a high-confidence peakset, which is the intersection of the differentially bound peaksets obtained from using different between-sample normalization methods. In our two experimental analyses, roughly half of the called peaks were called as differentially bound for every normalization method. High-confidence peaks are less sensitive to choice of between-sample normalization method and could be a more robust basis for identifying genomic regions with differential DNA occupancy between experimental states when there is uncertainty about which technical conditions are satisfied.",

Traditional approaches, which rely on domain expertise, embedded machine learning models, or heuristic-based iterative optimization, often introduce biases and inefficiencies, potentially obscuring critical biological signals. To address these challenges, we present an iterative gene panel selection strategy that harnesses ensemble knowledge from existing gene selection algorithms to establish preliminary boundaries or prior knowledge, which guide the initial search space. Subsequently, we incorporate reinforcement learning through a reward function shaped by expert behavior, enabling dynamic refinement and targeted selection of gene panels. This integration mitigates biases stemming from initial boundaries while capitalizing on RL's stochastic adaptability.

However, the existing cohorts with limited sample size and coarse infections types are unable to support the exploration of an accurate and generalizable diagnostic model. Here, we curate the largest infection host-response transcriptome data, including 11,247 samples across 89 blood transcriptome datasets from 13 countries and 21 platforms. We build a diagnostic model for pathogen prediction starting from a pan-infection model as foundation (AUC = 0.97) based on the pan-infection dataset. Then, we utilize knowledge distillation to efficiently transfer the insights from this \"teacher\" model to four lightweight pathogen \"student\" models, i.e., staphylococcal infection (AUC = 0.99), streptococcal infection (AUC = 0.94), HIV infection (AUC = 0.93), and RSV infection (AUC = 0.94), as well as a sepsis \"student\" model (AUC = 0.99). The proposed knowledge distillation framework not only facilitates the diagnosis of pathogens using pan-infection data, but also enables an across-disease study from pan-infection to sepsis. Moreover, the framework enables high-degree lightweight design of diagnostic models, which is expected to be adaptively deployed in clinical settings.",

We present a k-mer topology method, the first of its kind, to delineate the shape of the genome space. K-mer topology examines the topological persistence and the evolution of the homotopic shape of the sequences of k nucleotides in species, organisms, and genes using persistent Laplacians, a new multiscale combinatorial approach. We also propose a topological genetic distance between species by their topological invariants and non-harmonic spectra over scales. This new metric defines the topological phylogenetic trees of genomes, facilitating species classification and clustering. K-mer topology substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods on a variety of benchmark datasets, including mammalian mitochondrial genomes, Rhinovirus, SARS-CoV-2 variants, Ebola virus, Hepatitis E virus, Influenza hemagglutinin genes, and whole bacterial genomes. K-mer topology reveals the intrinsic shapes of the genome space and can be directly applied to the rational design of viral vaccines.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable advancements, primarily due to their capabilities in modeling the hidden relationships within text sequences. This innovation presents a unique opportunity in the field of life sciences, where vast collections of single-cell omics data from multiple species provide a foundation for training foundational models. However, the challenge lies in the disparity of data scales across different species, hindering the development of a comprehensive model for interpreting genetic data across diverse organisms. In this study, we propose an innovative hybrid approach that integrates the general knowledge capabilities of LLMs with domain-specific representation models for single-cell omics data interpretation. We begin by focusing on genes as the fundamental unit of representation. Gene representations are initialized using functional descriptions, leveraging the strengths of mature language models such as LLaMA-2. By inputting single-cell gene-level expression data with prompts, we effectively model cellular representations based on the differential expression levels of genes across various species and cell types. In the experiments, we constructed developmental cells from humans and mice, specifically targeting cells that are challenging to annotate. We evaluated our methodology through basic tasks such as cell annotation and visualization analysis. The results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach compared to other methods using LLMs, highlighting significant improvements in accuracy and interoperability. Our hybrid approach enhances the representation of single-cell data and offers a robust framework for future research in cross-species genetic analysis.",

To enhance the efficiency of this process, it is crucial to address several key challenges: (1) the overwhelming volume of literature, (2) the complexity of gene functions, and (3) the automated integration and generation. In response, we propose GeneSUM, a two-stage automated gene summary extractor utilizing a large language model (LLM). Our approach retrieves and eliminates redundancy of target gene literature and then fine-tunes the LLM to refine and streamline the summarization process.

While Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have identified numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) linked to kidney stone risk, translating these findings into effective clinical tools remains a challenge. In this study, we explore the potential of deep learning techniques, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to enhance Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) models for predicting kidney stone susceptibility. Using a curated dataset of kidney stone-associated SNPs from a recent GWAS, we apply CNNs to model non-linear genetic interactions and improve prediction accuracy. Our approach includes SNP selection, genotype filtering, and model training using a dataset of 560 individuals, divided into training and testing subsets. We compare our CNN-based model with traditional machine learning models, including logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machines, demonstrating that the CNN outperforms these models in terms of classification accuracy and ROC-AUC. The proposed model achieved a validation accuracy of 62%, with an ROC-AUC of 0.68, suggesting its potential for improving genetic-based risk prediction for kidney stones. This study contributes to the growing field of genomics-driven precision medicine and highlights the promise of deep learning in enhancing PRS models for complex diseases.",

    "abstract": "DNA data storage is rapidly emerging as a promising solution for long-term data archiving, largely due to its exceptional durability. However, the synthesis of DNA strands remains a significant bottleneck in terms of cost and speed. To address this, new methods have been developed that encode information by concatenating long data-carrying DNA sequences from pre-synthesized DNA subsequences - known as motifs - from a library.   Reading back data from DNA storage relies on basecalling - the process of translating raw nanopore sequencing signals into DNA base sequences using machine learning models. These sequences are then decoded back into binary data. However, current basecalling approaches are not optimized for decoding motif-carrying DNA: they first predict individual bases from the raw signal and only afterward attempt to identify higher-level motifs. This two-step, motif-agnostic process is both imprecise and inefficient.   In this paper we introduce Motif Caller, a machine learning model designed to directly detect entire motifs from raw nanopore signals, bypassing the need for intermediate basecalling. By targeting motifs directly, Motif Caller leverages richer signal features associated with each motif, resulting in significantly improved accuracy. This direct approach also enhances the efficiency of data retrieval in motif-based DNA storage systems.",

In addition, the optimal approach to tokenize DNA remains largely under-explored, and may not be intuitively understood by humans even if discovered. To address these challenges, we introduce MxDNA, a novel framework where the model autonomously learns an effective DNA tokenization strategy through gradient decent. MxDNA employs a sparse Mixture of Convolution Experts coupled with a deformable convolution to model the tokenization process, with the discontinuous, overlapping, and ambiguous nature of meaningful genomic segments explicitly considered. On Nucleotide Transformer Benchmarks and Genomic Benchmarks, MxDNA demonstrates superior performance to existing methods with less pretraining data and time, highlighting its effectiveness. Finally, we show that MxDNA learns unique tokenization strategy distinct to those of previous methods and captures genomic functionalities at a token level during self-supervised pretraining. Our MxDNA aims to provide a new perspective on DNA tokenization, potentially offering broad applications in various domains and yielding profound insights.",

Given the success of Mamba and Mamba-2 in natural language, we designed BarcodeMamba, a performant and efficient foundation model for DNA barcodes in biodiversity analysis. We conducted a comprehensive ablation study on the impacts of self-supervised training and tokenization methods, and compared both versions of Mamba layers in terms of expressiveness and their capacity to identify \"unseen\" species held back from training. Our study shows that BarcodeMamba has better performance than BarcodeBERT even when using only 8.3% as many parameters, and improves accuracy to 99.2% on species-level accuracy in linear probing without fine-tuning for \"seen\" species. In our scaling study, BarcodeMamba with 63.6% of BarcodeBERT's parameters achieved 70.2% genus-level accuracy in 1-nearest neighbor (1-NN) probing for unseen species. The code repository to reproduce our experiments is available at https://github.com/bioscan-ml/BarcodeMamba.",

    "abstract": "Spatial summary statistics based on point process theory are widely used to quantify the spatial organization of cell populations in single-cell spatial proteomics data. Among these, Ripley's $K$ is a popular metric for assessing whether cells are spatially clustered or are randomly dispersed. However, the key assumption of spatial homogeneity is frequently violated in spatial proteomics data, leading to overestimates of cell clustering and colocalization. To address this, we propose a novel $K$-based method, termed \\textit{KAMP} (\\textbf{K} adjustment by \\textbf{A}nalytical \\textbf{M}oments of the \\textbf{P}ermutation distribution), for quantifying the spatial organization of cells in spatial proteomics samples. \\textit{KAMP} leverages background cells in each sample along with a new closed-form representation of the first and second moments of the permutation distribution of Ripley's $K$ to estimate an empirical null model. Our method is robust to inhomogeneity, computationally efficient even in large datasets, and provides approximate $p$-values for testing spatial clustering and colocalization. Methodological developments are motivated by a spatial proteomics study of 103 women with ovarian cancer, where our analysis using \\textit{KAMP} shows a positive association between immune cell clustering and overall patient survival. Notably, we also find evidence that using $K$ without correcting for sample inhomogeneity may bias hazard ratio estimates in downstream analyses. \\textit{KAMP} completes this analysis in just 5 minutes, compared to 538 minutes for the only competing method that adequately addresses inhomogeneity.",

    "abstract": "Multilingual transfer ability, which reflects how well models fine-tuned on one source language can be applied to other languages, has been well studied in multilingual pre-trained models. However, the existence of such capability transfer between natural language and gene sequences/languages remains under explored.This study addresses this gap by drawing inspiration from the sentence-pair classification task used for evaluating sentence similarity in natural language. We constructed two analogous tasks: DNA-pair classification(DNA sequence similarity) and DNA-protein-pair classification(gene coding determination). These tasks were designed to validate the transferability of capabilities from natural language to gene sequences. Even a small-scale pre-trained model like GPT-2-small, which was pre-trained on English, achieved an accuracy of 78% on the DNA-pair classification task after being fine-tuned on English sentence-pair classification data(XTREME PAWS-X). While training a BERT model on multilingual text, the precision reached 89%. On the more complex DNA-protein-pair classification task, however, the model's output was barely distinguishable from random output.Experimental validation has confirmed that the transfer of capabilities from natural language to biological language is unequivocally present. Building on this foundation, we have also investigated the impact of model parameter scale and pre-training on this capability transfer. We provide recommendations for facilitating the transfer of capabilities from natural language to genetic language,as well as new approaches for conducting biological research based on this capability.This study offers an intriguing new perspective on exploring the relationship between natural language and genetic language.",

    "abstract": "Classifying genome sequences based on metadata has been an active area of research in comparative genomics for decades with many important applications across the life sciences. Established methods for classifying genomes can be broadly grouped into sequence alignment-based and alignment-free models. Conventional alignment-based models rely on genome similarity measures calculated based on local sequence alignments or consistent ordering among sequences. However, such methods are computationally expensive when dealing with large ensembles of even moderately sized genomes. In contrast, alignment-free (AF) approaches measure genome similarity based on summary statistics in an unsupervised setting and are efficient enough to analyze large datasets. However, both alignment-based and AF methods typically assume fixed scoring rubrics that lack the flexibility to assign varying importance to different parts of the sequences based on prior knowledge. In this study, we integrate AI and network science approaches to develop a comparative genomic analysis framework that addresses these limitations. Our approach, termed the Genome Misclassification Network Analysis (GMNA), simultaneously leverages misclassified instances, a learned scoring rubric, and label information to classify genomes based on associated metadata and better understand potential drivers of misclassification. We evaluate the utility of the GMNA using Naive Bayes and convolutional neural network models, supplemented by additional experiments with transformer-based models, to construct SARS-CoV-2 sampling location classifiers using over 500,000 viral genome sequences and study the resulting network of misclassifications. We demonstrate the global health potential of the GMNA by leveraging the SARS-CoV-2 genome misclassification networks to investigate the role human mobility played in structuring geographic clustering of SARS-CoV-2.",

Due to DNA degradation and contamination by environmental DNA (eDNA), current research is limited to fossils less than 1 million years old. The study successfully extracted DNA from Lycoptera davidi fossils from the Early Cretaceous period, dating 120 million years ago. Using high-throughput sequencing, 1,258,901 DNA sequences were obtained. We established a rigorous protocol known as the mega screen method. Using this method, we identified 243 original in situ DNA (oriDNA) sequences, likely from the Lycoptera genome. These sequences have an average length of over 100 base pairs and show no signs of deamination. Additionally, 10 transposase coding sequences were discovered, shedding light on a unique self-renewal mechanism in the genome. This study provides valuable DNA data for understanding ancient fish evolution and advances paleontological research.",

    "abstract": "This article critically examines the methodologies applied in ancient DNA (aDNA) research, particularly those developed by Dr. Pääbo's team, which have significantly influenced the field. The focus is on the challenges of distinguishing original in situ DNA (oriDNA) from environmental DNA (eDNA) contamination in fossil samples. Recent analyses indicate that even with rigorous extraction and sequencing protocols, a considerable amount of eDNA remains present, often misinterpreted as oriDNA. This misidentification risks the accuracy of species ascription and evolutionary interpretations derived from fossil analyses. The paper explores fossil preservation's physical and chemical dynamics, which allow eDNA from similar and disparate species to infiltrate bone matrices. We propose enhancements to methodological frameworks, such as broader BLAST database usage and stringent E-value criteria, to improve species-specific aDNA identification. Additionally, the article critiques the reliance on deamination patterns as a definitive marker for aDNA, suggesting a reevaluation of this criterion due to its inconsistency and the potential for misleading sequencing results. Ultimately, our findings advocate for a more cautious and refined approach to aDNA research, ensuring more reliable and verifiable scientific outcomes",

    "abstract": "Recent developments in next generation sequencing technology have led to the creation of extensive, open-source protein databases consisting of hundreds of millions of sequences. To render these sequences applicable in biomedical applications, they must be meticulously annotated by wet lab testing or extracting them from existing literature. Over the last few years, researchers have developed numerous automatic annotation systems, particularly deep learning models based on machine learning and artificial intelligence, to address this issue. In this work, we propose a transformer-based fusion model capable of predicting Gene Ontology (GO) terms from full-scale protein sequences, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy compared to other contemporary machine learning annotation systems. The approach performs particularly well on clustered split datasets, which comprise training and testing samples originating from distinct distributions that are structurally diverse. This demonstrates that the model is able to understand both short and long term dependencies within the enzyme's structure and can precisely identify the motifs associated with the various GO terms. Furthermore, the technique is lightweight and less computationally expensive compared to the benchmark methods, while at the same time not unaffected by sequence length, rendering it appropriate for diverse applications with varying sequence lengths.",

In this study, we introduce DART-Eval, a suite of representative benchmarks specifically focused on regulatory DNA to evaluate model performance across zero-shot, probed, and fine-tuned scenarios against contemporary ab initio models as baselines. Our benchmarks target biologically meaningful downstream tasks such as functional sequence feature discovery, predicting cell-type specific regulatory activity, and counterfactual prediction of the impacts of genetic variants. We find that current DNALMs exhibit inconsistent performance and do not offer compelling gains over alternative baseline models for most tasks, while requiring significantly more computational resources.

Here we focus on how PVGs are a powerful tool for studying genetic variation in viruses, offering insights into the complexities of viral quasispecies, mutation rates, and population dynamics. PVGs originated in human genomics and hold great promise for viral genomics. Previous work has been constrained by small sample sizes and gene-centric methods, PVGs enable a more comprehensive approach to studying viral diversity. Large viral genome collections should be used to make PVGs, which offer significant advantages: we outline accessible tools to achieve this. This spans PVG construction, PVG file formats, PVG manipulation and analysis, PVG visualisation, measuring PVG openness, and mapping reads to PVGs. Additionally, the development of PVG-specific formats for mutation representation and personalised PVGs that reflect specific research questions will further enhance PVG applications. Challenges remain, particularly in managing nested variants, optimising error detection, optimising k-mer/minimizer-based approaches for AT-rich genomes, incorporating long read sequencing data, and scalable visualisation approaches. Nevertheless, PVGs offer a new opportunities for viral population genomics, and a testing ground for tool development prior to application to larger eukaryotic genomes.

    "abstract": "The development of single-cell and spatial transcriptomics has revolutionized our capacity to investigate cellular properties, functions, and interactions in both cellular and spatial contexts. However, the analysis of single-cell and spatial omics data remains challenging. First, single-cell sequencing data are high-dimensional and sparse, often contaminated by noise and uncertainty, obscuring the underlying biological signals. Second, these data often encompass multiple modalities, including gene expression, epigenetic modifications, and spatial locations. Integrating these diverse data modalities is crucial for enhancing prediction accuracy and biological interpretability. Third, while the scale of single-cell sequencing has expanded to millions of cells, high-quality annotated datasets are still limited. Fourth, the complex correlations of biological tissues make it difficult to accurately reconstruct cellular states and spatial contexts. Traditional feature engineering-based analysis methods struggle to deal with the various challenges presented by intricate biological networks. Deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool capable of handling high-dimensional complex data and automatically identifying meaningful patterns, offering significant promise in addressing these challenges. This review systematically analyzes these challenges and discusses related deep learning approaches. Moreover, we have curated 21 datasets from 9 benchmarks, encompassing 58 computational methods, and evaluated their performance on the respective modeling tasks. Finally, we highlight three areas for future development from a technical, dataset, and application perspective. This work will serve as a valuable resource for understanding how deep learning can be effectively utilized in single-cell and spatial transcriptomics analyses, while inspiring novel approaches to address emerging challenges.",

    "abstract": "Timestamp automatic annotation (TAA) is a crucial procedure for analyzing time-series ScRNA-seq data, as they unveil dynamic biological developments and cell regeneration process. However, current TAA methods heavily rely on manual timestamps, often overlooking their reliability. This oversight can significantly degrade the performance of timestamp automatic annotation due to noisy timestamps. Nevertheless, the current approach for addressing this issue tends to select less critical cleaned samples for timestamp calibration. To tackle this challenge, we have developed a novel timestamp calibration model called ScPace for handling noisy labeled time-series ScRNA-seq data. This approach incorporates a latent variable indicator within a base classifier instead of probability sampling to detect noisy samples effectively. To validate our proposed method, we conducted experiments on both simulated and real time-series ScRNA-seq datasets. Cross-validation experiments with different artificial mislabeling rates demonstrate that ScPace outperforms previous approaches. Furthermore, after calibrating the timestamps of the original time-series ScRNA-seq data using our method, we performed supervised pseudotime analysis, revealing that ScPace enhances its performance significantly. These findings suggest that ScPace is an effective tool for timestamp calibration by enabling reclassification and deletion of detected noisy labeled samples while maintaining robustness across diverse ranges of time-series ScRNA-seq datasets.

Disruptions in this spatial organization can result in abnormal chromatin interactions, contributing to the development of various diseases including cancer. Advances in chromosome conformation capture technologies, such as Hi-C, have enabled researchers to study genome architecture at high resolution. However, the efficient visualization and interpretation of these complex datasets remain a major challenge, particularly when integrating genomic annotations and inter-chromosomal interactions.   Results: We present gghic, an R package that extends the ggplot2 framework to enable intuitive and customizable visualization of genomic interaction data. gghic introduces novel layers for generating triangular heatmaps of chromatin interactions and annotating them with features such as chromatin loops, topologically associated domains (TADs), gene/transcript models, and data tracks (e.g., ChIP-seq signals). The package supports data from multiple chromosomes, facilitating the exploration of inter-chromosomal interactions. Built to integrate seamlessly with the R/Bioconductor ecosystem, gghic is compatible with widely used genomic data formats, including HiCExperiment and GInteractions objects. We demonstrate the utility of gghic by replicating a published figure showing a translocation event in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), highlighting its ability to integrate genomic annotations and generate publication-quality figures.

    "title": "Single-Cell Omics Arena: A Benchmark Study for Large Language Models on Cell Type Annotation Using Single-Cell Data",
    "abstract": "Over the past decade, the revolution in single-cell sequencing has enabled the simultaneous molecular profiling of various modalities across thousands of individual cells, allowing scientists to investigate the diverse functions of complex tissues and uncover underlying disease mechanisms. Among all the analytical steps, assigning individual cells to specific types is fundamental for understanding cellular heterogeneity. However, this process is usually labor-intensive and requires extensive expert knowledge. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their ability to efficiently process and synthesize vast corpora of text to automatically extract essential biological knowledge, such as marker genes, potentially promoting more efficient and automated cell type annotations. To thoroughly evaluate the capability of modern instruction-tuned LLMs in automating the cell type identification process, we introduce SOAR, a comprehensive benchmarking study of LLMs for cell type annotation tasks in single-cell genomics. Specifically, we assess the performance of 8 instruction-tuned LLMs across 11 datasets, spanning multiple cell types and species. Our study explores the potential of LLMs to accurately classify and annotate cell types in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, while extending their application to multiomics data through cross-modality translation. Additionally, we evaluate the effectiveness of chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting techniques in generating detailed biological insights during the annotation process. The results demonstrate that LLMs can provide robust interpretations of single-cell data without requiring additional fine-tuning, advancing the automation of cell type annotation in genomics research.",

Their significance is particularly evident in microbiome analysis, where microbial communities are classified at various taxonomic levels along the phylogenetic tree. In light of this trend, the R/Bioconductor community has established a reproducible analytical framework for hierarchical data, which relies on the highly generic and optimised TreeSummarizedExperiment data container. However, using this framework requires basic proficiency in programming.   $\\textbf{Results:}$ To reduce the entry requirements, we developed iSEEtree, an R shiny app which provides a visual interface for the analysis and exploration of TreeSummarizedExperiment objects, thereby expanding the interactive graphics capabilities of related work to hierarchical structures. This way, users can interactively explore several aspects of their data without the need for extensive knowledge of R programming. We describe how iSEEtree enables the exploration of hierarchical multi-table data and demonstrate its functionality with applications to microbiome analysis.   $\\textbf{Availability and Implementation:}$ iSEEtree was implemented in the R programming language and is available on Bioconductor at https://bioconductor.org/packages/iSEEtree under an Artistic 2.0 license.   $\\textbf{Contact:}$ giulio.benedetti@utu.fi or leo.lahti@utu.fi.",

In modern environments, analogous microbial mats can be found in restricted environments such as carbonate tidal flats and terrestrial hot springs. Here, we report metagenomic sequence data from an analog in the hot springs of Waikite Valley, Aotearoa New Zealand, where carbon-rich, slightly-alkaline geothermal waters support diverse phototrophic microbial mats.   The Waikite Valley hot spring in the Taupo Volcanic Zone of Aotearoa New Zealand was sampled in duplicate at 8 points along a temperature gradient transect of the outflow, from ~62 C (near the source) to ~37 C (~100 meters downstream). ~686 Gb of shotgun metagenomic sequence data was generated by Illumina Novaseq. Each sample was assembled using SPAdes, followed by binning of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) by MetaBAT. These data are useful for the genomic analysis of novel phototrophic bacteria, as well as for ecological comparisons between thermophilic communities with varying temperatures but otherwise similar conditions.",

    "abstract": "Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) is a method that captures gene expression profiles aligned with spatial coordinates. The discrete spatial distribution and the super-high dimensional sequencing results make ST data challenging to be modeled effectively. In this paper, we manage to model ST in a continuous and compact manner by the proposed tool, SUICA, empowered by the great approximation capability of Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) that can enhance both the spatial density and the gene expression. Concretely within the proposed SUICA, we incorporate a graph-augmented Autoencoder to effectively model the context information of the unstructured spots and provide informative embeddings that are structure-aware for spatial mapping. We also tackle the extremely skewed distribution in a regression-by-classification fashion and enforce classification-based loss functions for the optimization of SUICA. By extensive experiments of a wide range of common ST platforms under varying degradations, SUICA outperforms both conventional INR variants and SOTA methods regarding numerical fidelity, statistical correlation, and bio-conservation. The prediction by SUICA also showcases amplified gene signatures that enriches the bio-conservation of the raw data and benefits subsequent analysis.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in multimodal pre-training models have significantly advanced computational pathology. However, current approaches predominantly rely on visual-language models, which may impose limitations from a molecular perspective and lead to performance bottlenecks. Here, we introduce a Unified Molecule-enhanced Pathology Image REpresentationn Learning framework (UMPIRE). UMPIRE aims to leverage complementary information from gene expression profiles to guide the multimodal pre-training, enhancing the molecular awareness of pathology image representation learning. We demonstrate that this molecular perspective provides a robust, task-agnostic training signal for learning pathology image embeddings. Due to the scarcity of paired data, approximately 4 million entries of spatial transcriptomics gene expression were collected to train the gene encoder. By leveraging powerful pre-trained encoders, UMPIRE aligns the encoders across over 697K pathology image-gene expression pairs. The performance of UMPIRE is demonstrated across various molecular-related downstream tasks, including gene expression prediction, spot classification, and mutation state prediction in whole slide images. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of multimodal data integration and open new avenues for exploring computational pathology enhanced by molecular perspectives.

Instruction fine-tuning is a key component in building ChatGPT, but existing instructions are primarily based on natural language. Natural language and gene sequences have significant differences in tokenization and encoding. Therefore, constructing a multilingual model that can handle both natural language and gene sequences is crucial for solving this problem.In this paper, we expand the capabilities of the LLaMA large language model to include gene language. This involves expanding the vocabulary using the Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) method, specifically tailored for DNA and protein sequences, and conducting further pre-training on these sequences. We then convert various downstream gene task data into a unified format for instruction fine-tuning and further fine-tune the model on this data.Our study demonstrates that a mixed model of gene and natural language, fine-tuned with instructions, achieves results comparable to the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) in tasks such as gene classification and gene sequence interaction. This provides a promising direction for building a unified large language model for gene tasks.",

    "abstract": "Genomic variants, including copy number variants (CNVs) and genome-wide associa-tion study (GWAS) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), represent structural alterations that influence genomic diversity and disease susceptibility. While coding region variants have been extensively studied, non-coding and regulatory variants present significant challenges due to their potential impacts on gene regulation, which are often obscured by the complexity of the ge-nome. Chromatin interactions, which organize the genome spatially and regulate gene expression through enhancer-promoter contacts, predominantly occur in non-coding regions. Notably, more than 90% of enhancers, crucial for gene regulation, reside in these non-coding regions, underscor-ing their importance in interpreting the regulatory effects of CNVs and GWAS-associated SNPs. In this study, we integrate chromatin interaction data with CNV and GWAS data to uncover the functional implications of non-coding variants. By leveraging this integrated approach, we pro-vide new insights into how structural variants and disease-associated SNPs disrupt regulatory networks, advancing our understanding of genetic complexity. These findings offer potential av-enues for personalized medicine by elucidating disease mechanisms and guiding therapeutic strategies tailored to individual genomic profiles. This research underscores the critical role of chromatin interactions in revealing the regulatory consequences of non-coding variants, bridging the gap between genetic variation and phenotypic outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Spatial transcriptomics (ST) provides high-resolution pathological images and whole-transcriptomic expression profiles at individual spots across whole-slide scales. This setting makes it an ideal data source to develop multimodal foundation models. Although recent studies attempted to fine-tune visual encoders with trainable gene encoders based on spot-level, the absence of a wider slide perspective and spatial intrinsic relationships limits their ability to capture ST-specific insights effectively. Here, we introduce ST-Align, the first foundation model designed for ST that deeply aligns image-gene pairs by incorporating spatial context, effectively bridging pathological imaging with genomic features. We design a novel pretraining framework with a three-target alignment strategy for ST-Align, enabling (1) multi-scale alignment across image-gene pairs, capturing both spot- and niche-level contexts for a comprehensive perspective, and (2) cross-level alignment of multimodal insights, connecting localized cellular characteristics and broader tissue architecture. Additionally, ST-Align employs specialized encoders tailored to distinct ST contexts, followed by an Attention-Based Fusion Network (ABFN) for enhanced multimodal fusion, effectively merging domain-shared knowledge with ST-specific insights from both pathological and genomic data. We pre-trained ST-Align on 1.3 million spot-niche pairs and evaluated its performance through two downstream tasks across six datasets, demonstrating superior zero-shot and few-shot capabilities. ST-Align highlights the potential for reducing the cost of ST and providing valuable insights into the distinction of critical compositions within human tissue.",

    "title": "Group-wise normalization in differential abundance analysis of microbiome samples",
    "abstract": "A key challenge in differential abundance analysis of microbial samples is that the counts for each sample are compositional, resulting in biased comparisons of the absolute abundance across study groups. Normalization-based differential abundance analysis methods rely on external normalization factors that account for the compositionality by standardizing the counts onto a common numerical scale. However, existing normalization methods have struggled at maintaining the false discovery rate in settings where the variance or compositional bias is large. This article proposes a novel framework for normalization that can reduce bias in differential abundance analysis by re-conceptualizing normalization as a group-level task. We present two normalization methods within the group-wise framework: group-wise relative log expression (G-RLE) and fold-truncated sum scaling (FTSS). G-RLE and FTSS achieve higher statistical power for identifying differentially abundant taxa than existing methods in model-based and synthetic data simulation settings, while maintaining the false discovery rate in challenging scenarios where existing methods suffer. The best results are obtained from using FTSS normalization with the differential abundance analysis method MetagenomeSeq. Code for implementing the methods and replicating the analysis can be found at our GitHub page (https://github.com/dclarkboucher/microbiome_groupwise_normalization).",

Recently, single cell sequencing has emerged as a powerful tool to measure the effect of these perturbations at a whole embryo scale. These types of experiments rely on the ability to isolate nuclei from a large number of individually barcoded zebrafish embryos in parallel. Here we report a method for efficiently isolating high-quality nuclei from zebrafish embryos in a 96-well plate format by bead homogenization in a lysis buffer. Through head-to-head sciPlex-RNA-seq experiments, we demonstrate that this method represents a substantial improvement over enzymatic dissociation and that it is compatible with a wide range of developmental stages.",

    "title": "Evidence of epigenetic oncogenesis: a turning point in cancer research",
    "abstract": "In cancer research, the term epigenetics was used in the 1970s in its modern sense encompassing non-genetic events modifying the chromatin state, mainly to oppose the emerging oncogene paradigm. However, starting from the establishment of this prominent concept, the importance of these epigenetic phenomena in cancer rarely led to questioning the causal role of genetic alterations. Only in the last 10 years, the accumulation of problematic data, better experimental technologies, and some ambitious models pushed the idea that epigenetics could be at least as important as genetics in early oncogenesis. Until this year, a direct demonstration of epigenetic oncogenesis was still lacking. Now Parreno, Cavalli and colleagues, using a refined experimental model in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, enforced the initiation of tumours solely by imposing a transient loss of Polycomb repression, leading to a purely epigenetic oncogenesis phenomenon. Despite a few caveats that we discuss, this pioneering work represents a major breakpoint in cancer research that leads us to consider the theoretical and conceptual implications on oncogenesis and to search for links between this artificial experimental model and naturally occurring processes, while revisiting cancer theories that were previously proposed as alternatives to the oncogene-centered paradigm.",

    "abstract": "Diabetes, particularly Type 2 diabetes (T2D), poses a substantial global health burden, compounded by its associated complications such as cardiovascular diseases, kidney failure, and vision impairment. Early detection of T2D is critical for improving healthcare outcomes and optimizing resource allocation. In this study, we address the gap in early T2D detection by leveraging machine learning (ML) techniques on gene expression data obtained from T2D patients. Our primary objective was to enhance the accuracy of early T2D detection through advanced ML methodologies and increase the model's trustworthiness using the explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) technique. Analyzing the biological mechanisms underlying T2D through gene expression datasets represents a novel research frontier, relatively less explored in previous studies. While numerous investigations have focused on utilizing clinical and demographic data for T2D prediction, the integration of molecular insights from gene expression datasets offers a unique and promising avenue for understanding the pathophysiology of the disease. By employing six ML classifiers on data sourced from NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), we observed promising performance across all models. Notably, the XGBoost classifier exhibited the highest accuracy, achieving 97%. Our study addresses a notable gap in early T2D detection methodologies, emphasizing the importance of leveraging gene expression data and advanced ML techniques.",

This is crucial for developing novel and effective combination therapies, but the combinatorial space makes exhaustive experimentation infeasible.

Evaluated on four CRISPR combinatorial perturbation datasets totaling over 350,000 genetic interactions, NAIAD, trained on small datasets, outperforms existing models by up to 40\\% relative to the second-best. NAIAD's recommendation system prioritizes gene pairs with the maximum predicted effects, resulting in the highest marginal gain in each AI-experiment round and accelerating discovery with fewer CRISPR experimental iterations.

    "abstract": "The continually increasing volume of DNA sequence data has resulted in a growing demand for fast implementations of core algorithms. Computation of pairwise alignments between candidate haplotypes and sequencing reads using Pair-HMMs is a key component in DNA variant calling tools such as the GATK HaplotypeCaller but can be highly time consuming due to its quadratic time complexity and the large number of pairs to be aligned. Unfortunately, previous approaches to accelerate this task using the massively parallel processing capabilities of modern GPUs are limited by inefficient memory access schemes. This established the need for significantly faster solutions. We address this need by presenting gpuPairHMM -- a novel GPU-based parallelization scheme for the dynamic-programming based Pair-HMM forward algorithm based on wavefronts and warp-shuffles. It gains efficiency by minimizing both memory accesses and instructions. We show that our approach achieves close-to-peak performance on several generations of modern CUDA-enabled GPUs (Volta, Ampere, Ada, Hopper). It also outperforms prior implementations on GPUs, CPUs, and FPGAs by a factor of at least 8.6, 10.4, and 14.5, respectively. gpuPairHMM is publicly available at https://github.com/asbschmidt/gpuPairHMM.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disease characterized by unpredictable flares. This study aimed to develop a novel proteomics-based risk prediction model specifically for Asian SLE populations to enhance personalized disease management and early intervention. Methods: A longitudinal cohort study was conducted over 48 weeks, including 139 SLE patients monitored every 12 weeks. Patients were classified into flare (n = 53) and non-flare (n = 86) groups. Baseline plasma samples underwent data-independent acquisition (DIA) proteomics analysis, and phenome-wide Mendelian randomization (PheWAS) was performed to evaluate causal relationships between proteins and clinical predictors. Logistic regression (LR) and random forest (RF) models were used to integrate proteomic and clinical data for flare risk prediction. Results: Five proteins (SAA1, B4GALT5, GIT2, NAA15, and RPIA) were significantly associated with SLE Disease Activity Index-2K (SLEDAI-2K) scores and 1-year flare risk, implicating key pathways such as B-cell receptor signaling and platelet degranulation. SAA1 demonstrated causal effects on flare-related clinical markers, including hemoglobin and red blood cell counts. A combined model integrating clinical and proteomic data achieved the highest predictive accuracy (AUC = 0.769), surpassing individual models. SAA1 was highlighted as a priority biomarker for rapid flare discrimination. Conclusion: The integration of proteomic and clinical data significantly improves flare prediction in Asian SLE patients. The identification of key proteins and their causal relationships with flare-related clinical markers provides valuable insights for proactive SLE management and personalized therapeutic approaches.",

    "abstract": "Reproducibility in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) is crucial for ensuring reliable genomic research outcomes. However, limited access to original genomic datasets (mainly due to privacy concerns) prevents researchers from reproducing experiments to validate results. In this paper, we propose a novel method for GWAS reproducibility validation that detects unintentional errors without the need for dataset sharing. Our approach leverages p-values from GWAS outcome reports to estimate contingency tables for each single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and calculates the Hamming distance between the minor allele frequencies (MAFs) derived from these contingency tables and publicly available phenotype-specific MAF data. By comparing the average Hamming distance, we validate results that fall within a trusted threshold as reliable, while flagging those that exceed the threshold for further inspection. This approach not only allows researchers to validate the correctness of GWAS findings of other researchers, but it also provides a self-check step for the researchers before they publish their findings. We evaluate our approach using three real-life SNP datasets from OpenSNP, showing its ability to detect unintentional errors effectively, even when small errors occur, such as 1\\% of SNPs being reported incorrectly. This novel validation technique offers a promising solution to the GWAS reproducibility challenge, balancing the need for rigorous validation with the imperative of protecting sensitive genomic data, thereby enhancing trust and accuracy in genetic research.",

Although they share sequence similarities with messenger RNAs (mRNAs), lncRNAs perform entirely different roles, providing new avenues for biological research. The emergence of next-generation sequencing technologies has greatly advanced the detection and identification of lncRNA transcripts and deep learning-based approaches have been introduced to classify long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). These advanced methods have significantly enhanced the efficiency of identifying lncRNAs. However, many of these methods are devoid of robustness and accuracy due to the extended length of the sequences involved. To tackle this issue, we have introduced a novel pre-trained bidirectional encoder representation called LoRA-BERT. LoRA-BERT is designed to capture the importance of nucleotide-level information during sequence classification, leading to more robust and satisfactory outcomes. In a comprehensive comparison with commonly used sequence prediction tools, we have demonstrated that LoRA-BERT outperforms them in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Our results indicate that, when utilizing the transformer model, LoRA-BERT achieves state-of-the-art performance in predicting both lncRNAs and mRNAs for human and mouse species. Through the utilization of LoRA-BERT, we acquire valuable insights into the traits of lncRNAs and mRNAs, offering the potential to aid in the comprehension and detection of diseases linked to lncRNAs in humans.",

    "abstract": "Genetic screens mediated via CRISPR-Cas9 combined with high-content readouts have emerged as powerful tools for biological discovery. However, computational analyses of these screens come with additional challenges beyond those found with standard scRNA-seq analyses. For example, perturbation-induced variations of interest may be subtle and masked by other dominant source of variation shared with controls, and variable guide efficiency results in some cells not undergoing genetic perturbation despite expressing a guide RNA. While a number of methods have been developed to address the former problem by explicitly disentangling perturbation-induced variations from those shared with controls, less attention has been paid to the latter problem of noisy perturbation labels. To address this issue, here we propose ContrastiveVI+, a generative modeling framework that both disentangles perturbation-induced from non-perturbation-related variations while also inferring whether cells truly underwent genomic edits. Applied to three large-scale Perturb-seq datasets, we find that ContrastiveVI+ better recovers known perturbation-induced variations compared to previous methods while successfully identifying cells that escaped the functional consequences of guide RNA expression.

To overcome these limitations, we propose a hybrid model based on Diffusion model and White-Box transformer that aims to generate synthetic and biologically plausible scRNA-seq data. Diffusion model progressively introduce noise into the data and then recover the original data through a denoising process, a forward and reverse process that is particularly suitable for generating complex data distributions. White-Box transformer is a deep learning architecture that emphasizes mathematical interpretability. By minimizing the encoding rate of the data and maximizing the sparsity of the representation, it not only reduces the computational burden, but also provides clear insight into underlying structure. Our White-Box Diffusion Transformer combines the generative capabilities of Diffusion model with the mathematical interpretability of White-Box transformer. Through experiments using six different single-cell RNA-Seq datasets, we visualize both generated and real data using t-SNE dimensionality reduction technique, as well as quantify similarity between generated and real data using various metrics to demonstrate comparable performance of White-Box Diffusion Transformer and Diffusion Transformer in generating scRNA-seq data alongside significant improvements in training efficiency and resource utilization.

    "abstract": "Single-cell RNA sequencing enables high-resolution analysis of cellular heterogeneity, yet disentangling biological signal from batch effects remains a major challenge. Existing batch-correction algorithms suppress or discard batch-related variation rather than modeling it. We propose scMEDAL, single-cell Mixed Effects Deep Autoencoder Learning, a framework that separately models batch-invariant and batch-specific effects using two complementary subnetworks. The principal innovation, scMEDAL-RE, is a random-effects Bayesian autoencoder that learns batch-specific representations while preserving biologically meaningful information confounded with batch effects signal often lost under standard correction. Complementing it, the fixed-effects subnetwork, scMEDAL-FE, trained via adversarial learning provides a default batch-correction component. Evaluations across diverse conditions (autism, leukemia, cardiovascular), cell types, and technical and biological effects show that scMEDAL-RE produces interpretable, batch-specific embeddings that complement both scMEDAL-FE and established correction methods (scVI, Scanorama, Harmony, SAUCIE), yielding more accurate prediction of disease status, donor group, and tissue. scMEDAL also provides generative visualizations, including counterfactual reconstructions of a cell's expression as if acquired in another batch. The framework allows substitution of the fixed-effects component with other correction methods, while retaining scMEDAL-RE's enhanced predictive power and visualization. Overall, scMEDAL is a versatile, interpretable framework that complements existing correction, providing enhanced insight into cellular heterogeneity and data acquisition.",

    "abstract": "A 3D chaos game is shown to be a useful way for encoding DNA sequences. Since matching subsequences in DNA converge in space in 3D chaos game encoding, a DNA sequence's 3D chaos game representation can be used to compare DNA sequences without prior alignment and without truncating or padding any of the sequences. Two proposed methods inspired by shape-similarity comparison techniques show that this form of encoding can perform as well as alignment-based techniques for building phylogenetic trees. The first method uses the volume overlap of intersecting spheres and the second uses shape signatures by summarizing the coordinates, oriented angles, and oriented distances of the 3D chaos game trajectory. The methods are tested using: (1) the first exon of the beta-globin gene for 11 species, (2) mitochondrial DNA from four groups of primates, and (3) a set of synthetic DNA sequences. Simulations show that the proposed methods produce distances that reflect the number of mutation events; additionally, on average, distances resulting from deletion mutations are comparable to those produced by substitution mutations.",

    "abstract": "The classification of genetic variants, particularly Variants of Uncertain Significance (VUS), poses a significant challenge in clinical genetics and precision medicine. Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as transformative tools in this realm. These models can uncover intricate patterns and predictive insights that traditional methods might miss, thus enhancing the predictive accuracy of genetic variant pathogenicity.   This study investigates the integration of state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPN-MSA, ESM1b, and AlphaMissense, which leverage DNA and protein sequence data alongside structural insights to form a comprehensive analytical framework for variant classification. Our approach evaluates these integrated models using the well-annotated ProteinGym and ClinVar datasets, setting new benchmarks in classification performance. The models were rigorously tested on a set of challenging variants, demonstrating substantial improvements over existing state-of-the-art tools, especially in handling ambiguous and clinically uncertain variants.   The results of this research underline the efficacy of combining multiple modeling approaches to significantly refine the accuracy and reliability of genetic variant classification systems. These findings support the deployment of these advanced computational models in clinical environments, where they can significantly enhance the diagnostic processes for genetic disorders, ultimately pushing the boundaries of personalized medicine by offering more detailed and actionable genetic insights.",

    "abstract": "A path-covering problem on a directed acyclic graph (DAG) requires finding a set of source-to-sink paths that cover all the nodes, all the arcs, or subsets thereof, and additionally they are optimal with respect to some function. In this paper we study safe sequences of nodes or arcs, namely sequences that appear in some path of every path cover of a DAG.   We show that safe sequences admit a simple characterization via cutnodes. Moreover, we establish a connection between maximal safe sequences and leaf-to-root paths in the source- and sink-dominator trees of the DAG, which may be of independent interest in the extensive literature on dominators. With dominator trees, safe sequences admit an O(n)-size representation and a linear-time output-sensitive enumeration algorithm running in time O(m + o), where n and m are the number of nodes and arcs, respectively, and o is the total length of the maximal safe sequences.   We then apply maximal safe sequences to simplify Integer Linear Programs (ILPs) for two path-covering problems, LeastSquares and MinPathError, which are at the core of RNA transcript assembly problems from bioinformatics. On various datasets, maximal safe sequences can be computed in under 0.1 seconds per graph, on average, and ILP solvers whose search space is reduced in this manner exhibit significant speed-ups. For example on graphs with a large width, average speed-ups are in the range 50-250x for MinPathError and in the range 80-350x for LeastSquares. Optimizing ILPs using safe sequences can thus become a fast building block of practical RNA transcript assembly tools, and more generally, of path-covering problems.",

    "abstract": "Following its success for vision and text, the \"foundation model\" (FM) paradigm -- pretraining large models on massive data, then fine-tuning on target tasks -- has rapidly expanded to domains in the sciences, engineering, healthcare, and beyond. Has this achieved what the original FMs accomplished, i.e. the supplanting of traditional supervised learning in their domains? To answer we look at three modalities -- genomics, satellite imaging, and time series -- with multiple recent FMs and compare them to a standard supervised learning workflow: model development, hyperparameter tuning, and training, all using only data from the target task. Across these three specialized domains, we find that it is consistently possible to train simple supervised models -- no more complicated than a lightly modified wide ResNet or UNet -- that match or even outperform the latest foundation models. Our work demonstrates that the benefits of large-scale pretraining have yet to be realized in many specialized areas, reinforces the need to compare new FMs to strong, well-tuned baselines, and introduces two new, easy-to-use, open-source, and automated workflows for doing so.",

    "abstract": "\\textbf{Motivation:} Predicting single-cell perturbation responses requires mapping between two unpaired single-cell data distributions. Optimal transport (OT) theory provides a principled framework for constructing such mappings by minimizing transport cost. Recently, Wasserstein-2 ($W_2$) neural optimal transport solvers (\\textit{e.g.}, CellOT) have been employed for this prediction task. However, $W_2$ OT relies on the general Kantorovich dual formulation, which involves optimizing over two conjugate functions, leading to a complex min-max optimization problem that converges slowly. \\\\ \\textbf{Results:} To address these challenges, we propose a novel solver based on the Wasserstein-1 ($W_1$) dual formulation. Unlike $W_2$, the $W_1$ dual simplifies the optimization to a maximization problem over a single 1-Lipschitz function, thus eliminating the need for time-consuming min-max optimization. While solving the $W_1$ dual only reveals the transport direction and does not directly provide a unique optimal transport map, we incorporate an additional step using adversarial training to determine an appropriate transport step size, effectively recovering the transport map. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed $W_1$ neural optimal transport solver can mimic the $W_2$ OT solvers in finding a unique and ``monotonic\" map on 2D datasets. Moreover, the $W_1$ OT solver achieves performance on par with or surpasses $W_2$ OT solvers on real single-cell perturbation datasets. Furthermore, we show that $W_1$ OT solver achieves $25 \\sim 45\\times$ speedup, scales better on high dimensional transportation task, and can be directly applied on single-cell RNA-seq dataset with highly variable genes. \\\\ \\textbf{Availability and Implementation:} Our implementation and experiments are open-sourced at https://github.com/poseidonchan/w1ot.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluates the concordance between RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and NanoString technologies for gene expression analysis in non-human primates (NHPs) infected with Ebola virus (EBOV). We performed a detailed comparison of both platforms, demonstrating a strong correlation between them, with Spearman coefficients for 56 out of 62 samples ranging from 0.78 to 0.88, with a mean of 0.83 and a median of 0.85. Bland-Altman analysis further confirmed high consistency, with most measurements falling within 95% confidence limits. A machine learning approach, using the Supervised Magnitude-Altitude Scoring (SMAS) method trained on NanoString data, identified OAS1 as a key marker for distinguishing RT-qPCR positive from negative samples. Remarkably, when applied to RNA-Seq data, OAS1 also achieved 100% accuracy in differentiating infected from uninfected samples using logistic regression, demonstrating its robustness across platforms. Further differential expression analysis identified 12 common genes including ISG15, OAS1, IFI44, IFI27, IFIT2, IFIT3, IFI44L, MX1, MX2, OAS2, RSAD2, and OASL which demonstrated the highest levels of statistical significance and biological relevance across both platforms. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis confirmed that these genes are directly involved in key immune and viral infection pathways, reinforcing their importance in EBOV infection. In addition, RNA-Seq uniquely identified genes such as CASP5, USP18, and DDX60, which play key roles in immune regulation and antiviral defense. This finding highlights the broader detection capabilities of RNA-Seq and underscores the complementary strengths of both platforms in providing a comprehensive and accurate assessment of gene expression changes during Ebola virus infection.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) technology is a powerful tool for unraveling the complexity of biological systems. One of essential and fundamental tasks in scRNA-seq data analysis is Cell Type Annotation (CTA). In spite of tremendous efforts in developing machine learning methods for this problem, several challenges remains. They include identifying Out-of-Domain (OOD) cell types, quantifying the uncertainty of unseen cell type annotations, and determining interpretable cell type-specific gene drivers for an OOD case. OOD cell types are often associated with therapeutic responses and disease origins, making them critical for precision medicine and early disease diagnosis. Additionally, scRNA-seq data contains tens thousands of gene expressions. Pinpointing gene drivers underlying CTA can provide deep insight into gene regulatory mechanisms and serve as disease biomarkers. In this study, we develop a new method, eDOC, to address aforementioned challenges. eDOC leverages a transformer architecture with evidential learning to annotate In-Domain (IND) and OOD cell types as well as to highlight genes that contribute both IND cells and OOD cells in a single cell resolution. Rigorous experiments demonstrate that eDOC significantly improves the efficiency and effectiveness of OOD cell type and gene driver identification compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Our findings suggest that eDOC may provide new insights into single-cell biology.",

Previous works demonstrated poor wake detection, without cross-device generalizability and validation in different age range and sleep disorders. We developed a robust deep learning model for to detect sleep-wakefulness from triaxial accelerometry and evaluated its validity across three devices and in a large adult population spanning a wide range of ages with and without sleep disorders. Methods: We collected wrist accelerometry simultaneous to polysomnography (PSG) in 453 adults undergoing clinical sleep testing at a tertiary care sleep laboratory, using three devices. We extracted features in 30-second epochs and trained a 3-class model to detect wake, sleep, and sleep with arousals, which was then collapsed into wake vs. sleep using a decision tree. To enhance wake detection, the model was specifically trained on randomly selected subjects with low sleep efficiency and/or high arousal index from one device recording and then tested on the remaining recordings. Results: The model showed high performance with F1 Score of 0.86, sensitivity (sleep) of 0.87, and specificity (wakefulness) of 0.78, and significant and moderate correlation to PSG in predicting total sleep time (R=0.69) and sleep efficiency (R=0.63). Model performance was robust to the presence of sleep disorders, including sleep apnea and periodic limb movements in sleep, and was consistent across all three models of accelerometer. Conclusions: We present a deep model to detect sleep-wakefulness from actigraphy in adults with relative robustness to the presence of sleep disorders and generalizability across diverse commonly used wrist accelerometers.",

    "abstract": "Tracking cells in time-lapse videos is an essential technique for monitoring cell population dynamics at a single-cell level. Current methods for cell tracking are developed on videos with mostly single, constant signals and do not detect pivotal events such as cell death. Here, we present TransientTrack, a deep learning-based framework for cell tracking in multi-channel microscopy video data with transient fluorescent signals that fluctuate over time following processes such as the circadian rhythm of cells. By identifying key cellular events - mitosis (cell division) and apoptosis (cell death) our method allows us to build complete trajectories, including cell lineage information. TransientTrack is lightweight and performs matching on cell detection embeddings directly, without the need for quantification of tracking-specific cell features. Furthermore, our approach integrates Transformer Networks, multi-stage matching using all detection boxes, and the interpolation of missing tracklets with the Kalman Filter. This unified framework achieves strong performance across diverse conditions, effectively tracking cells and capturing cell division and death. We demonstrate the use of TransientTrack in an analysis of the efficacy of a chemotherapeutic drug at a single-cell level. The proposed framework could further advance quantitative studies of cancer cell dynamics, enabling detailed characterization of treatment response and resistance mechanisms.

We introduce two complementary mechanisms-the pattern switch and the pattern dial-to systematically control Turing pattern formation in gene circuits. The switch toggles pattern onset via a single parameter, while the dial enables transitions between distinct pattern types using weakly nonlinear amplitude equations. Analyzing network size reveals a key trade-off: small networks are easier to control but less robust, while larger networks gain robustness at the cost of tunability-suggesting a sweet spot for both evolvability and designability.

    "title": "Robustness and resilience of dynamical networks in biology and epidemiology",
    "abstract": "Natural systems are remarkably robust and resilient, maintaining essential functions despite variability, uncertainty, and hostile conditions. Understanding these nonlinear, dynamic behaviours is challenging because such systems involve many interacting parameters, yet it is crucial for explaining processes from cellular regulation to disease onset and epidemic spreading. Robustness and resilience describe a system's ability to preserve and recover desired behaviours in the presence of intrinsic and extrinsic fluctuations. This survey reviews how different disciplines define these concepts, examines methods for assessing whether key properties of uncertain, networked dynamical systems are structural (parameter-free) or robust (preserved for parameter variations within an uncertainty bounding set), and discusses integrated structural and probabilistic techniques for biological and epidemiological models. The text introduces formal definitions of resilience for families of systems obtained by adding stochastic perturbations to a nominal deterministic model, enabling a probabilistic characterisation of the ability to remain within or return to a prescribed attractor. These definitions generalise probabilistic robustness and shed new light on classical biological examples. In addition, the survey summarises resilience indicators and data-driven tools for detecting resilience loss and regime shifts, drawing on bifurcation analysis to anticipate qualitative changes in system behaviour. Together, these methodologies support the study and control of complex natural systems, guiding the design of biomolecular feedback architectures, the identification of therapeutic targets, the forecasting and management of epidemics, and the detection of tipping points in ecological and biological networks.",

    "abstract": "High-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) dosing in children remains largely empirical, relying on one-size-fits-all protocols despite rapid developmental changes in head anatomy and tissue properties that strongly modulate how currents reach the developing brain. Using 70 pediatric head models and commonly used cortical targets, our forward simulations find that standard montages produce marked age-dependent reductions in target electric-field intensity and systematic sex differences linked to tissue-volume covariation, underscoring the profound limitations of conventional uniform montages. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a developmentally informed, dual-objective optimization framework designed to generate personalized Pareto fronts summarizing the trade-off between electric-field intensity and focality. From these optimized solutions, we derive two practical dosing prescriptions: a dose-consistency strategy that, for the first time, enforces fixed target intensity across individuals to implicitly mitigate demographic effects, and a target-engagement strategy that maximizes target intensity under safety limits. Both strategies remain robust to large conductivity variations, and we further show that dense HD-tDCS solutions admit sparse equivalents without performance loss under the target-engagement strategy. We also find that tissue conductivity sensitivity is depth-dependent, with Pareto-front distributions for superficial cortical targets most influenced by gray matter, scalp, and bone conductivities, and those for a deep target predominantly shaped by gray and white matter conductivities. Together, these results establish a principled framework for pediatric HD-tDCS planning that explicitly accounts for developmental anatomy and physiological uncertainty, enabling reliable and individualized neuromodulation dosing in pediatric populations.",

    "abstract": "Accurate and reliable forecasting models are critical for guiding public health responses and policy decisions during pandemics such as COVID-19. Retrospective evaluation of model performance is essential for improving epidemic forecasting capabilities. In this study, we used COVID-19 wastewater data from CDC's National Wastewater Surveillance System to generate sequential weekly retrospective forecasts for the United States from March 2022 through September 2024, both at the national level and for four major regions (Northeast, Midwest, South, and West). We produced 133 weekly forecasts using 11 models, including ARIMA, generalized additive models (GAM), simple linear regression (SLR), Prophet, and the n-sub-epidemic framework (top-ranked, weighted-ensemble, and unweighted-ensemble variants). Forecast performance was assessed using mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), weighted interval score (WIS), and 95% prediction interval coverage. The n-sub-epidemic unweighted ensembles outperformed all other models at 3-4-week horizons, particularly at the national level and in the Midwest and West. ARIMA and GAM performed best at 1-2-week horizons in most regions, whereas Prophet and SLR consistently underperformed across regions and horizons. These findings highlight the value of region-specific modeling strategies and demonstrate the utility of the n-sub-epidemic framework for real-time outbreak forecasting using wastewater surveillance data.",

The method improved the baseline for unsupervised labeling of vocal units (i.e. syllables) through manifold learning, by investigating how dimen- sionality reduction on mel-spectrograms affects labeling, and comparing it with unsupervised labels based on acoustic similarity. We then encoded vocalizations as syllabic sequences to analyze the type of syntax, and extracted the Maximal Repetitions (MRs) to evaluate syntactical structures. We found evidence for: i) associative syntax, rather than combinatorial (context classification is unaffected by permutation of sequences, F 1 > 0.9); ii) context-dependent use of syllables (Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, p-value < 0.05); iii) heavy-tail distribution of MRs (truncated power-law, exponent α < 2), indicative of mechanism encoding com- binatorial complexity. Analysis of MRs and syllabic transition networks revealed that mother-pupil interactions were characterized by repetitions, while commu- nication in conflict-contexts exhibited higher complexity (longer MRs and more interconnected vocal sequences) than non-agonistic contexts. We propose that communicative complexity is higher in scenarios of disagreement, reflecting lower compressibility of information.",

Methods: We obtained concurrent PSG and wearable sensor recordings from 384 adults attending a tertiary care sleep laboratory. Respiratory events in the PSG were manually annotated in accordance with AASM guidelines. Wearable sensor and PSG recordings were automatically aligned based on the ECG signal, alignment confirmed by visual inspection, and PSG-derived respiratory event labels were used to train and evaluate a deep sequential neural network based on the Mamba architecture.   Results: In 57 recordings in our test set (mean age 56, mean AHI 10.8, 43.86\\% female) the model-predicted AHI was highly correlated with that derived form the PSG labels (R=0.95, p=8.3e-30, men absolute error 2.83). This performance did not vary with age or sex. At a threshold of AHI$>$5, the model had a sensitivity of 0.96, specificity of 0.87, and kappa of 0.82, and at a threshold of AHI$>$15, the model had a sensitivity of 0.86, specificity of 0.98, and kappa of 0.85. At the level of 30-sec epochs, the model had a sensitivity of 0.93 and specificity of 0.95, with a kappa of 0.68 regarding whether any given epoch contained a respiratory event.   Conclusions: Applied to data from the ANNE One, a Mamba-based deep learning model can accurately predict AHI and identify SDB at clinically relevant thresholds, achieves good epoch- and event-level identification of individual respiratory events, and shows promise at physiological characterization of these events including event type (central vs. other) and event duration.",

    "abstract": "The use of coarse demographic adjustments in clinical equations has been increasingly scrutinized. In particular, adjustments for race have sparked significant debate with several medical professional societies recommending race-neutral equations in recent years. However, current approaches to remove race from clinical equations do not address the underlying causes of observed differences. Here, we present ARC (Approach for identifying pRoxies of demographic Correction), a framework to identify explanatory factors of group-level differences, which may inform the development of more accurate and precise clinical equations. We apply ARC to spirometry tests across two observational cohorts, CDC NHANES and UK Biobank, comprising 159,893 participants. Cross-sectional sociodemographic or exposure measures did not explain differences in reference lung function across race groups beyond those already explained by age, sex, and height. By contrast, sitting height accounted for up to 26% of the remaining differences in lung volumes between healthy Black and White adults. We then demonstrate how pulmonary function test (PFT) reference equations can incorporate these factors in a new set of equations called $ARC_{PFT}$, surpassing the predictive performance of the race-neutral GLI-Global equation recommended by major pulmonary societies. When compared to GLI-Global, inclusion of sitting height and waist circumference in $ARC_{PFT}$ decreased mean absolute error by 13% among Black participants in the UK Biobank and by 24% in NHANES. $ARC_{PFT}$ also had reduced vulnerability to domain shift compared to race-based methods, with mean absolute error 19.3% and 35.6% lower than race-stratified models in out-of-sample Asian and Hispanic populations, respectively. This approach provides a path for understanding the proxies of imprecise demographic adjustments and developing personalized clinical equations.",

    "abstract": "This work presents the development and evaluation of an NLP-enabled probabilistic classifier designed to estimate the probability of technical and regulatory success (pTRS) for clinical trials in the field of neuroscience. While pharmaceutical R&D is plagued by high attrition rates and enormous costs, particularly within neuroscience, where success rates are below 10%, timely identification of promising programs can streamline resource allocation and reduce financial risk. Leveraging data from the ClinicalTrials.gov database and success labels from the recently developed Clinical Trial Outcome dataset, the classifier extracts text-based clinical trial features using statistical NLP techniques. These features were integrated into several non-LLM frameworks (logistic regression, gradient boosting, and random forest) to generate calibrated probability scores. Model performance was assessed on a retrospective dataset of 101,145 completed clinical trials spanning 1976-2024, achieving an overall ROC-AUC of 0.64. An LLM-based predictive model was then built using BioBERT, a domain-specific language representation encoder. The BioBERT-based model achieved an overall ROC-AUC of 0.74 and a Brier Score of 0.185, indicating its predictions had, on average, 40% less squared error than would be observed using industry benchmarks. The BioBERT-based model also made trial outcome predictions that were superior to benchmark values 70% of the time overall. By integrating NLP-driven insights into drug development decision-making, this work aims to enhance strategic planning and optimize investment allocation in neuroscience programs.",

We further demonstrate the applicability and robustness of BISM across various experimental settings with different boundary conditions, ranging from confined tissues of arbitrary shape to monolayers composed of different cell types. Importantly, BISM does not require assumptions on cell rheology. Therefore, it can be applied to complex heterogeneous tissues consisting of different cell types, as long as they can be grown on a flat substrate. Finally, we compare BISM to other common stress measurement techniques using a coherent experimental setup, followed by a discussion on its limitations and further perspectives.",

    "abstract": "In early stage drug discovery, bioactivity prediction of molecules against target proteins plays a crucial role. Trdaitional QSAR models that utilizes molecular descriptor based data often struggles to predict bioactivity of molecules effectively due to its limitation in capturing structural and contextual information embedded within each compound. To address this challenge, we propose Rep3Net, a unified deep learning architecture that not only incorporates descriptor data but also includes spatial and relational information through graph-based represenation of compounds and contextual information through ChemBERTa generated embeddings from SMILES strings. Our model employing multimodal concatenated features produce reliable bioactivity prediction on Poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 1 (PARP-1) dataset. PARP-1 is a crucial agent in DNA damage repair and has become a significant theraputic target in malignancies that depend on it for survival and growth. A comprehensive analysis and comparison with conventional standalone models including GCN, GAT, XGBoost, etc. demonstrates that our architecture achieves the highest predictive performance. In computational screening of compounds in drug discovery, our architecture provides a scalable framework for bioactivity prediction.",

    "abstract": "Foundation models have revolutionized various fields such as natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV). While efforts have been made to transfer the success of the foundation models in general AI domains to biology, existing works focus on directly adopting the existing foundation model architectures from general machine learning domains without a systematic design considering the unique physicochemical and structural properties of each biological data modality. This leads to suboptimal performance, as these repurposed architectures struggle to capture the long-range dependencies, sparse information, and complex underlying ``grammars'' inherent to biological data. To address this gap, we introduce BioArc, a novel framework designed to move beyond intuition-driven architecture design towards principled, automated architecture discovery for biological foundation models. Leveraging Neural Architecture Search (NAS), BioArc systematically explores a vast architecture design space, evaluating architectures across multiple biological modalities while rigorously analyzing the interplay between architecture, tokenization, and training strategies. This large-scale analysis identifies novel, high-performance architectures, allowing us to distill a set of empirical design principles to guide future model development. Furthermore, to make the best of this set of discovered principled architectures, we propose and compare several architecture prediction methods that effectively and efficiently predict optimal architectures for new biological tasks. Overall, our work provides a foundational resource and a principled methodology to guide the creation of the next generation of task-specific and foundation models for biology.",

Unlike conventional classifiers such as ICLabel, which rely on handcrafted features, ICVision directly interprets ICA dashboard visualizations topography, time series, power spectra, and ERP plots, using a multimodal large language model (GPT-4 Vision). This allows the AI to see and explain EEG components the way trained neurologists do, making it the first scientific implementation of AI-agent visual cognition in neurophysiology. ICVision classifies each component into one of six canonical categories (brain, eye, heart, muscle, channel noise, and other noise), returning both a confidence score and a human-like explanation. Evaluated on 3,168 ICA components from 124 EEG datasets, ICVision achieved k = 0.677 agreement with expert consensus, surpassing MNE ICLabel, while also preserving clinically relevant brain signals in ambiguous cases. Over 97% of its outputs were rated as interpretable and actionable by expert reviewers. As a core module of the open-source EEG Autoclean platform, ICVision signals a paradigm shift in scientific AI, where models do not just classify, but see, reason, and communicate. It opens the door to globally scalable, explainable, and reproducible EEG workflows, marking the emergence of AI agents capable of expert-level visual decision-making in brain science and beyond.",

    "abstract": "Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are a major barrier to safe and effective pharmacotherapy and increasingly reflect higher order interactions between drugs, genetic background, and clinical phenotypes. Existing graph based approaches usually predict ADRs as properties of drugs or drug pairs, leaving the causal gene implicit and limiting their value for pharmacogenomic decision making. We introduce HyperADRs, a hierarchical hypergraph framework that predicts ADR risk at the level of drug-gene-ADR triads. Starting from curated pharmacogenomic annotations in PharmGKB and the pharmacogenomics subdatabase of DrugBank, we construct high confidence triplets and integrate them with auxiliary molecular, functional, and disease relations from precision-medicine-oriented knowledge graphs. Drugs, genes, and ADR concepts are embedded with modality appropriate pretrained models (UniMol, ESM2, SapBERT) and propagated through a hypergraph convolutional network. A FiLM based, query conditioned contrastive learning module learns context specific representations so that, given any two entities, the model retrieves the correct third entity against many candidates. To improve robustness and interpretability, we propose a nine category ADR macro system scheme that reduces large heterogeneous \"other\" bins while aligning with organ system reasoning in clinical pharmacology. Across drug-, gene-, and ADR-held-out evaluations on PharmGKB, HyperADRs matches or exceeds strong baselines on ranking based metrics. When trained on PharmGKB and tested on unseen DrugBank triplets, HyperADRs maintains its ranking advantage, indicating that the learned representations capture transferable biological mechanisms and can support mechanistically grounded pharmacogenomic hypothesis generation.",

Yet analyzing their dynamics remains challenging because these processes are high-dimensional and their transient behavior can vary substantially across different initial molecular or population states. Here we introduce a spectral framework for the stochastic Koopman operator that provides a tractable, low-dimensional representation of SRN dynamics over continuous time, together with computable error estimates. By exploiting the compactness of the Koopman operator, we recover dominant spectral modes directly from simulated or experimental data, enabling efficient prediction of moments, event probabilities, and other summary statistics across all initial states. We further derive continuous-time parameter sensitivities and cross-spectral densities, offering new tools for probing noise structure and frequency-domain behavior. We demonstrate the approach on biologically relevant systems, including synthetic intracellular feedback controllers, stochastic oscillators, and inference of initial-state distributions from high-temporal-resolution flow cytometry. Together, these results establish spectral Koopman analysis as a powerful and general framework for studying stochastic dynamical systems across the biological, ecological, and computational sciences.",

    "abstract": "Protein inverse folding, the design of an amino acid sequence based on a target 3D structure, is a fundamental problem of computational protein engineering. Existing methods either generate sequences without leveraging external knowledge or relying on protein language models (PLMs). The former omits the evolutionary information stored in protein databases, while the latter is parameter-inefficient and inflexible to adapt to ever-growing protein data. To overcome the above drawbacks, in this paper we propose a novel method, called retrieval-augmented denoising diffusion (RadDiff), for protein inverse folding. Given the target protein backbone, RadDiff uses a hierarchical search strategy to efficiently retrieve structurally similar proteins from large protein databases. The retrieved structures are then aligned residue-by-residue to the target to construct a position-specific amino acid profile, which serves as an evolutionary-informed prior that conditions the denoising process. A lightweight integration module is further designed to incorporate this prior effectively. Experimental results on the CATH, PDB, and TS50 datasets show that RadDiff consistently outperforms existing methods, improving sequence recovery rate by up to 19%. Experimental results also demonstrate that RadDiff generates highly foldable sequences and scales effectively with database size.",

We developed the Site-based mutation dynamics - Equal Power Sampling (S-EPS) framework, a phylogenetic-free, bias-correcting framework for profiling viral source-sink dynamics. Applying S-EPS to 6.6 million SARS-CoV-2 genomes (March 2020 - June 2024) from 13 regions worldwide, we identified Africa and the Indian subcontinent as the predominant sources of key mutations. Southeast Asia serves as an early transmission hub, while Russia and South America mainly acted as sinks. Key mutations took longer to establish fitness in source regions than externally. Once an amino acid substitution on the receptor-binding domain reached 1% prevalence in major sources, there is an 80% probability it would spread elsewhere, with a 2-month median lead time (IQR: 1-4). Our findings underscore the importance of genetic surveillance, with S-EPS offering enhanced capability for monitoring emerging viral threats.",

However, this generative process offers limited insight into its internal representations and how they contribute to the final protein structure. Concurrently, recent work in mechanistic interpretability has successfully used Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to discover interpretable features within neural networks. We combine these concepts by applying SAE to the internal representations of RFdiffusion to uncover secondary structure-specific features and establish a relationship between them and generated protein structures. Building on these insights, we introduce a novel steering mechanism that enables precise control of secondary structure formation through a tunable hyperparameter, while simultaneously revealing interpretable block and neuron-level representations within RFdiffusion. Our work pioneers a new framework for making RFdiffusion more interpretable, demonstrating how understanding internal features can be directly translated into precise control over the protein design process.",

This work builds upon the study by Jiang, Kolozsvary, and Li (2024), which connects the COVID-19 case counts with testing data collected early in the pandemic. Using the COVID-19 testing data and the wastewater surveillance data during the period when both data were highly reliable, one can train an artificial neural network that learns the nonlinear relation between the COVID-19 daily case count and the wastewater viral RNA concentration.

    "abstract": "Cells achieve size homeostasis by regulating their division timing based on their size, added size, and cell cycle time. Previous research under steady-state conditions demonstrated the robustness of these mechanisms. However, their dynamic responses in fluctuating environments, such as nutrient depletion due to population growth, remain challenging to fully characterize. Currently, advances in single-cell microscopy have revealed various cellular division strategies whose underlying molecular mechanisms are complex and not always available. This study introduces a novel approach to model cell size dynamics using a piecewise deterministic Markov chain framework, where cell division events are modeled as stochastic jumps determined by a division propensity dependent on both current cell size and added size since birth. We propose a three-parameter characterization for the division process: scale (target added size at division), shape (division stochasticity), and division strategy (relevance of cell size, added size, or cell cycle duration). We derive analytical formulas for the probability of division, and with this probability, we develop a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) framework. We implement a systematic investigation of the accuracy of inference as a function of sample size. The model's performance is studied across various scenarios, including those exhibiting dynamical changes in one or more parameters, suggesting its broad applicability for analyzing new experimental data on cell size regulation in dynamic environments.",

    "abstract": "Snarls and superbubbles are fundamental pangenome decompositions capturing variant sites. These bubble-like structures underpin key tasks in computational pangenomics, including structural-variant genotyping, distance indexing, haplotype sampling, and variant annotation. Snarls can be quadratically-many in the size of the graph, and since their introduction in 2018 with the vg toolkit, there has been no work on identifying all snarls in linear time. Moreover, while it is known how to find superbubbles in linear time, this result is a highly specialized solution only achieved after a long series of papers.   We present the first algorithm identifying all snarls in linear time. This is based on a new representation of all snarls, of size linear in the input graph size, and which can be computed in linear time. Our algorithm is based on a unified framework that also provides a new linear-time algorithm for finding superbubbles. An observation behind our results is that all such structures are separated from the rest of the graph by two vertices (except for cases which are trivially computable), i.e. their endpoints are a 2-separator of the underlying undirected graph. Based on this, we employ the well-known SPQR tree decomposition, which encodes all 2-separators, to guide a traversal that finds the bubble-like structures efficiently.   We implemented our algorithms in C++ (available at https://github.com/algbio/BubbleFinder) and evaluated them on various pangenomic datasets. Our algorithms outcompete or they are on the same level of existing methods. For snarls, we are up to two times faster than vg, while identifying all snarls. When computing superbubbles, we are up to 50 times faster than BubbleGun. Our SPQR tree framework provides a unifying perspective on bubble-like structures in pangenomics, together with a template for finding other bubble-like structures efficiently.",

    "abstract": "We present an automated approach for identifying and annotating motifs and domains in protein sequences, using pretrained Protein Language Models (PLMs) and Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs), adapted from interpretability research in computer vision. We treat motifs as conceptual entities and represent them through learned CAVs in PLM embedding space by training simple linear classifiers to distinguish motif-containing from non-motif sequences. To identify motif occurrences, we extract embeddings for overlapping sequence windows and compute their inner products with motif CAVs. This scoring mechanism quantifies how strongly each sequence region expresses the motif concept and naturally detects multiple instances of the same motif within the same protein. Using a dataset of sixty-nine well-characterized motifs with curated positive and negative examples, our method achieves over 85\\% F1 Score for segments strongly expressing the concept and accurately localizes motif positions across diverse protein families. As each motif is encoded by a single vector, motif detection requires only the pretrained PLM and a lightweight dictionary of CAVs, offering a scalable, interpretable, and computationally efficient framework for automated sequence annotation.",

    "abstract": "Medically uncontrolled epileptic seizures affect nearly 15 million people worldwide, resulting in enormous economic and psychological burdens. Treatment of medically refractory epilepsy is essential for patients to achieve remission, improve psychological functioning, and enhance social and vocational outcomes. Here, we show a state-of-the-art method that stabilizes fractional dynamical networks modeled from intracranial EEG data, effectively suppressing seizure activity in 34 out of 35 total spontaneous episodes from patients at the University of Pennsylvania and the Mayo Clinic. We perform a multi-scale analysis and show that the fractal behavior and stability properties of these data distinguish between four epileptic states: interictal, pre-ictal, ictal, and post-ictal. Furthermore, the simulated controlled signals exhibit substantial amplitude reduction ($49\\%$ average). These findings highlight the potential of fractional dynamics to characterize seizure-related brain states and demonstrate its capability to suppress epileptic activity.",

    "abstract": "Inferring who infected whom in an outbreak is essential for characterising transmission dynamics and guiding public health interventions. However, this task is challenging due to limited surveillance data and the complexity of immunological and social interactions. Instead of a single definitive transmission tree, epidemiologists often consider multiple plausible trees forming \\textit{epidemic forests}. Various inference methods and assumptions can yield different epidemic forests, yet no formal test exists to assess whether these differences are statistically significant. We propose such a framework using a chi-square test and permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA). We assessed each method's ability to distinguish simulated epidemic forests generated under different offspring distributions. While both methods achieved perfect specificity for forests with 100+ trees, PERMANOVA consistently outperformed the chi-square test in sensitivity across all epidemic and forest sizes. Implemented in the R package \\textit{mixtree}, we provide the first statistical framework to robustly compare epidemic forests.",

The platform implements automated hyperparameter optimization, feature importance analysis, and a suite of statistical tests including t tests, ANOVA, and Pearson correlation analysis. Our methodology addresses the gap between traditional statistical software, modern machine learning frameworks and biology, by providing a unified interface accessible to researchers without extensive programming experience. The system achieves this through automatic data preprocessing, categorical encoding, and adaptive model configuration based on dataset characteristics. Initial testing protocols are designed to evaluate classification accuracy across diverse chemical datasets with varying feature distributions. This work demonstrates that integrating statistical rigor with machine learning interpretability can accelerate biological discovery workflows while maintaining methodological soundness.

    "abstract": "Hirschsprung Disease is characterized by the absence of ganglion cells in the myenteric plexus. Therefore, their correct identification is crucial for diagnosing Hirschsprung disease. We introduce a three-stage segmentation framework based on a Vision Transformer (ViT-B/16) that mimics the pathologist's diagnostic approach. The framework sequentially segments the muscularis propria, delineates the myenteric plexus, and identifies ganglion cells within anatomically valid regions. 30 whole-slide images of colon tissue were used, each containing expert manual annotations of muscularis, plexus, and ganglion cells at varying levels of certainty. A 5-fold cross-validation scheme was applied to each stage, along with resolution-specific tiling strategies and tailored postprocessing to ensure anatomical consistency. The proposed method achieved a Dice coefficient of 89.9% and a Plexus Inclusion Rate of 100% for muscularis segmentation. Plexus segmentation reached a recall of 94.8%, a precision of 84.2% and a Ganglia Inclusion Rate of 99.7%. For high-certainty ganglion cells, the model achieved 62.1% precision and 89.1% recall, while joint certainty scores yielded 67.0% precision. These results indicate that ViT-based models are effective at leveraging global tissue context and capturing cellular morphology at small scales, even within complex histological tissue structures. This multi-stage methodology has great potential to support digital pathology workflows by reducing inter-observer variability and assisting in the evaluation of Hirschsprung disease. The clinical impact will be evaluated in future work with larger multi-center datasets and additional expert annotations.",

    "abstract": "Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) results from an impact or concussion to the head with the injury being specifically characterized through pathological degradation at various biological length scales. Following injury, various mechanical modeling techniques have been proposed in the literature that seek to quantify neuronal-scale to tissue-scale metrics of brain damage. Broadly, the two categories of degradation encompass physiological deterioration of neurons and upregulation of chemical entities such as neurotransmitters which causes initiation of downstream pathophysiological effects. Despite the many contributing pathways, in this work, we delineate and model a potential glia-initiated injury pathway that leads to secondary injury. The goal of this work is to demonstrate a continuum framework which models the multiphysics of mechano-chemical interactions underlying TBI. Using a coupled PDE (partial differential equation) formulation and FEM (finite element method) discretization, the framework highlights evolution of field variables which spatio-temporally resolve mechanical metrics and chemical species across neuronal clusters. The modeling domain encompasses microglia, neurons and the extracellular matrix. The continuum framework used to model the mechano-chemical interactions assumes a three dimensional viscoelastic network to capture the mechanical response underlying proteins constituting the neuron microstructure and advection-diffusion equations modeling spatio-temporal evolution of chemical species. We use this framework to numerically estimate key concentrations of chemical species produced by the strain field. In this work, we identify key biomarkers within the labyrinth of molecular pathways and build a framework that captures the core mechano-chemical interactions. This framework is an attempt to quantify secondary injury and thus assist in developing targeted TBI treatments.",

    "abstract": "The need for effective biomonitoring in wastewater has become clear due to the impracticality of continuously tracking all chemicals and emerging contaminants in the aquatic exposome. Effect-based biomonitoring provides a cost-effective solution. The ToxMate device, which uses videotracking of locomotor behavior in aquatic invertebrates, has proven efficient for real-time detection of micropollutant surges in effluents. To extend the approach, this proof-of-concept study evaluates the potential to formalize behavioral fingerprints from real-time videotracking data to characterize qualitative variations in effluent contamination. We present the first application of a functional data analysis (FDA) framework in ecotoxicology. Data were obtained by simultaneously tracking three sentinel organisms from distinct taxa (a crustacean, an annelid, and a gastropod) during pulse exposures to four chemicals in the laboratory (two metals, one pharmaceutical, and one insecticide). Individual and multispecies responses were analy-zed to determine whether combining species enhances the resolution of contamination fingerprints through multidimensional FDA. Applying the same data-driven approach to field data from a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) revealed four recurring types of micropollution events. This proof of concept demonstrates the potential of behavioral fingerprints to improve wastewater monitoring and reduce pollutant transfer to the environment.",

    "abstract": "In recent years there has been a paradigm shift from the study of local task-related activation to the organization and functioning of large-scale functional and structural brain networks. However, a long-standing challenge in this large-scale brain network analysis is how to compare network organizations irrespective of their complexity. The maximum spanning tree (MST) has served as a simple, unbiased, standardized representation of complex brain networks and effectively addressed this long-standing challenge. This tree representation, however, has been limited to individual networks. Group-level trees are always constructed from the average network or through a bootstrap procedure. Constructing the group-level tree from the average network introduces bias from individual subjects with outlying connectivities. The bootstrap method can be computationally prohibitive if a good approximation is desired. To address these issues, we propose a novel spectral representation of trees using the spanning tree basis. This spectral representation enables us to compute the average MST and demonstrate that this average tree captures the global properties of all the MSTs in the group and also overlaps with the union of the shortest paths in the functional brain networks.",

The aim of the present study was to develop a fully deep learning model to reduce the intra- and inter-operator reproducibility of sector classification systems for predicting unerupted maxillary canine likelihood of impaction. Methods. Three orthodontists (Os) and three general dental practitioners (GDPs) classified the position of unerupted maxillary canines on 306 radiographs (T0) according to the three different sector classification systems (5-, 4-, and 3-sector classification system). The assessment was repeated after four weeks (T1). Intra- and inter-observer agreement were evaluated with Cohen's K and Fleiss K, and between group differences with a z-test. The same radiographs were tested on different artificial intelligence (AI) models, pre-trained on an extended dataset of 1,222 radiographs. The best-performing model was identified based on its sensitivity and precision. Results. The 3-sector system was found to be the classification method with highest reproducibility, with an agreement (Cohen's K values) between observations (T0 versus T1) for each examiner ranged from 0.80 to 0.92, and an overall agreement of 0.85 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.83-0.87]. The overall inter-observer agreement (Fleiss K) ranged from 0.69 to 0.7. The educational background did not affect either intra- or inter-observer agreement (p>0.05). DenseNet121 proved to be the best-performing model in allocating impacted canines in the three different classes, with an overall accuracy of 76.8%. Conclusion. AI models can be designed to automatically classify the position of unerupted maxillary canines.",

In conclusion, partial parallelism was infrequently observed and inconsistently reported in most biomarker assays for neurodegeneration. Narrow dilution ranges and variable methodologies limit generalizability. Transparent reporting of dilution protocols and adherence to established analytical validation guidelines is needed.

These observations raise a fundamental question: do such correlations simply reflect internal cellular processes, or do they enhance a cell's ability to navigate complex environments? In this work, we explore how temporally correlated noise (modeled using fractional Brownian motion) influences chemotactic search dynamics. Through computational experiments, we show that superdiffusive motion, when combined with gradient-driven migration, enables robust exploration of the chemoattractant landscape. Cells reliably reach the global maximum of the concentration field, even in the presence of spatial noise, secondary cues, or irregular signal geometry. We quantify this behavior by analyzing the distribution of first hitting times under varying degrees of temporal correlation. Notably, our results are consistent across diverse conditions, including flat and curved substrates, and scenarios involving both primary and self-generated chemotactic signals. Beyond biological implications, these findings also offer insight into the design of optimization and sampling algorithms that benefit from structured stochasticity.",

    "abstract": "T cells are central to the adaptive immune response, capable of detecting pathogenic antigens while ignoring healthy tissues with remarkable specificity and sensitivity. Quantitatively understanding how T cell receptors (TCRs) discriminate among antigens requires biophysical models and theoretical analysis of signaling networks. Here, we review current theoretical frameworks of antigen recognition in the context of modern experimental and computational advances. Antigen potency spans a continuum and exhibits nonlinear effects within complex mixtures, challenging discrete classification and simple threshold-based models. This complexity motivates the development of models such as adaptive kinetic proofreading, which integrate both activating and inhibitory signals. Advances in high-throughput technologies now generate large-scale, quantitative datasets, enabling the refinement of such models through statistical and machine learning approaches. This convergence of theory, data, and computation promises deeper insights into immune decision-making and opens new avenues for rational immunotherapy design.",

    "abstract": "Accurately modeling the relationship between perturbations, transcriptional responses, and phenotypic changes is essential for building an AI Virtual Cell (AIVC). However, existing methods typically constrained to modeling direct associations, such as Perturbation $\\rightarrow$ RNA or Perturbation $\\rightarrow$ Morphology, overlook the crucial causal link from RNA to morphology. To bridge this gap, we propose TRIDENT, a cascade generative framework that synthesizes realistic cellular morphology by conditioning on both the perturbation and the corresponding gene expression profile. To train and evaluate this task, we construct MorphoGene, a new dataset pairing L1000 gene expression with Cell Painting images for 98 compounds. TRIDENT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving up to 7-fold improvement with strong generalization to unseen compounds. In a case study on docetaxel, we validate that RNA-guided synthesis accurately produces the corresponding phenotype. An ablation study further confirms that this RNA conditioning is essential for the model's high fidelity. By explicitly modeling transcriptome-phenome mapping, TRIDENT provides a powerful in silico tool and moves us closer to a predictive virtual cell.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) emerges from a complex interplay of molecular, cellular, and network-level disturbances that are not easily captured by traditional reductionist frameworks. Conventional analyses of gene expression often rely on thresholded correlation networks or clustering-based module detection, approaches that may obscure nonlinear structure and higher-order organization. Here, we introduce a comparative topological framework that makes use of topological data analysis (TDA) and the Mapper algorithm to detect discontinuities - localized disruptions in the topology of gene co-expression space between healthy and AD brain tissue. Using gene expression data from 3 brain regions, we mapped how AD reshapes the global topology of gene-gene relationships. Discontinuity hotspots were identified via variability-based node scoring and subjected to Gene Ontology Biological Process enrichment analysis. This work illustrates the potential of TDA to uncover disease-relevant structure in high-dimensional transcriptomic data and motivates broader application of shape-based comparative methods in neurodegeneration research and other areas that benefit from comparative analysis.",

To overcome the challenges of rare CTC detection and reduce reliance on computationally intensive simulations, machine learning models including gradient boosting, k-nearest neighbors, random forest, and multilayer perceptron (MLP) regressors are employed. Trained on a large, numerically validated dataset, these models predict particle trajectories and identify optimal device configurations, enabling high-throughput and cost-effective DLD design. Beyond trajectory prediction, the models aid in isolating critical design variables, offering a systematic, data-driven framework for automated DLD optimization.

Variations in protein interaction landscapes and pathway activities across cell types can reshape how drugs act in combination. However, most existing models overlook this heterogeneity and rely on static or bulk level protein protein interaction networks that ignore cell specific molecular wiring. With the availability of single cell transcriptomic data, it is now possible to reconstruct cell line specific interactomes, offering a new foundation for contextualized drug synergy modeling.   Results: We present SynCell, a contextualized drug synergy framework that integrates drug protein, protein protein, and protein cell line relations within a unified graph architecture. SynCell leverages single cell derived, cell line specific PPI networks to embed the molecular context in which drugs act, and employs graph convolutional learning to model how pharmacological effects propagate through cell specific signaling networks. This formulation treats synergy prediction as a cell line contextualized drug drug interaction problem. Across two large scale benchmarks (NCI ALMANAC and ONeil), SynCell consistently outperforms state of the art baselines including DeepDDS, HypergraphSynergy, and HERMES, especially in predicting synergies involving unseen drugs or novel cell lines. Ablation analyses show that contextualizing PPIs with single cell resolution yields substantial gains in generalization and biological interpretability.",

    "abstract": "Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) is a technology that measures gene expression profiles within tissue sections while retaining spatial context. It reveals localized gene expression patterns and tissue heterogeneity, both of which are essential for understanding disease etiology. However, its high cost has driven efforts to predict spatial gene expression from whole slide images. Despite recent advancements, current methods still face significant limitations, such as under-exploitation of high-level biological context, over-reliance on exemplar retrievals, and inadequate alignment of heterogeneous modalities. To address these challenges, we propose DKAN, a novel Dual-path Knowledge-Augmented contrastive alignment Network that predicts spatially resolved gene expression by integrating histopathological images and gene expression profiles through a biologically informed approach. Specifically, we introduce an effective gene semantic representation module that leverages the external gene database to provide additional biological insights, thereby enhancing gene expression prediction. Further, we adopt a unified, one-stage contrastive learning paradigm, seamlessly combining contrastive learning and supervised learning to eliminate reliance on exemplars, complemented with an adaptive weighting mechanism. Additionally, we propose a dual-path contrastive alignment module that employs gene semantic features as dynamic cross-modal coordinators to enable effective heterogeneous feature integration. Through extensive experiments across three public ST datasets, DKAN demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art models, establishing a new benchmark for spatial gene expression prediction and offering a powerful tool for advancing biological and clinical research.",

    "abstract": "12-lead ECGs with high sampling frequency are the clinical gold standard for arrhythmia detection, but their short-term, spot-check nature often misses intermittent events. Wearable ECGs enable long-term monitoring but suffer from irregular, lower sampling frequencies due to battery constraints, making morphology analysis challenging. We present an end-to-end classification pipeline to address these issues. We train a latent ODE to model continuous ECG waveforms and create robust feature vectors from high-frequency single-channel signals. We construct three latent vectors per waveform via downsampling the initial 360 Hz ECG to 90 Hz and 45 Hz. We then use a gradient boosted tree to classify these vectors and test robustness across frequencies. Performance shows minimal degradation, with macro-averaged AUC-ROC values of 0.984, 0.978, and 0.976 at 360 Hz, 90 Hz, and 45 Hz, respectively, suggesting a way to sidestep the trade-off between signal fidelity and battery life. This enables smaller wearables, promoting long-term monitoring of cardiac health.",

    "abstract": "The move towards personalized treatment and digital twins for cancer therapy requires a complete understanding of the mathematical models upon which these optimized simulation-based strategies are formulated. This study investigates the influence of mathematical model selection on the optimization of chemotherapy and radiotherapy protocols. By examining three chemotherapy models (log-kill, Norton-Simon, and Emax), and three radiotherapy models (linear-quadratic, proliferation saturation index, and continuous death-rate), we identify similarities and significant differences in the optimized protocols. We demonstrate how the assumptions built into the model formulations heavily influence optimal treatment dosing and sequencing, potentially leading to contradictory results. Further, we demonstrate how different model forms influence predictions in the adaptive therapy setting. As treatment decisions increasingly rely on simulation-based strategies, unexamined model assumptions can introduce bias, leading to model-dependent recommendations that may not be generalizable. This study highlights the importance of basing model selection on a full analysis of bias, sensitivity, practical parameter identifiability and/or inferred parameter posteriors, as a part of the uncertainty quantification process, rather than solely relying on information criterion. Understanding how model choice impacts predictions guiding personalized treatment planning with sufficient uncertainty quantification analysis, will lead to more robust and generalizable predictions.",

    "abstract": "Mathematical models support inference and forecasting in ecology and epidemiology, but results depend on the estimation framework. We compare Bayesian and Frequentist approaches across three biological models using four datasets: Lotka-Volterra predator-prey dynamics (Hudson Bay), a generalized logistic model (lung injury and 2022 U.S. mpox), and an SEIUR epidemic model (COVID-19 in Spain). Both approaches use a normal error structure to ensure a fair comparison.   We first assessed structural identifiability to determine which parameters can theoretically be recovered from the data. We then evaluated practical identifiability and forecasting performance using four metrics: mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), 95 percent prediction interval (PI) coverage, and weighted interval score (WIS). For the Lotka-Volterra model with both prey and predator data, we analyzed three scenarios: prey only, predator only, and both.   The Frequentist workflow used QuantDiffForecast (QDF) in MATLAB, which fits ODE models via nonlinear least squares and quantifies uncertainty through parametric bootstrap. The Bayesian workflow used BayesianFitForecast (BFF), which employs Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling via Stan to generate posterior distributions and diagnostics such as the Gelman-Rubin R-hat statistic.   Results show that Frequentist inference performs best when data are rich and fully observed, while Bayesian inference excels when latent-state uncertainty is high and data are sparse, as in the SEIUR COVID-19 model. Structural identifiability clarifies these patterns: full observability benefits both frameworks, while limited observability constrains parameter recovery. This comparison provides guidance for choosing inference frameworks based on data richness, observability, and uncertainty needs.",

    "title": "Data-driven Prediction of Species-Specific Plant Responses to Spectral-Shifting Films from Leaf Phenotypic and Photosynthetic Traits",
    "abstract": "The application of spectral-shifting films in greenhouses to shift green light to red light has shown variable growth responses across crop species. However, the yield enhancement of crops under altered light quality is related to the collective effects of the specific biophysical characteristics of each species. Considering only one attribute of a crop has limitations in understanding the relationship between sunlight quality adjustments and crop growth performance. Therefore, this study aims to comprehensively link multiple plant phenotypic traits and daily light integral considering the physiological responses of crops to their growth outcomes under SF using artificial intelligence. Between 2021 and 2024, various leafy, fruiting, and root crops were grown in greenhouses covered with either PEF or SF, and leaf reflectance, leaf mass per area, chlorophyll content, daily light integral, and light saturation point were measured from the plants cultivated in each condition. 210 data points were collected, but there was insufficient data to train deep learning models, so a variational autoencoder was used for data augmentation. Most crop yields showed an average increase of 22.5% under SF. These data were used to train several models, including logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, XGBoost, and feedforward neural network (FFNN), aiming to binary classify whether there was a significant effect on yield with SF application. The FFNN achieved a high classification accuracy of 91.4% on a test dataset that was not used for training. This study provide insight into the complex interactions between leaf phenotypic and photosynthetic traits, environmental conditions, and solar spectral components by improving the ability to predict solar spectral shift effects using SF.",

    "abstract": "Reconstruction of 3D erythrocyte or red blood cell (RBC) morphology from partial observations, such as microscope images, is essential for understanding the physiology of RBC aging and the pathology of various RBC disorders. In this study, we propose a multi-fidelity neural network (MFNN) approach to fuse high-fidelity cross-sections of an RBC, with a morphologically similar low-fidelity reference 3D RBC shape to recover its full 3D surface. The MFNN predictor combines a convolutional neural network trained on low-fidelity reference RBC data with a feedforward neural network that captures nonlinear morphological correlations, and augments training with surface area and volume constraints for regularization in the low-fidelity branch. This approach is theoretically grounded by a topological homeomorphism between a sphere and 3D RBC surfaces, with training data generated by dissipative particle dynamics simulations of stomatocyte-discocyte-echinocyte transformation. Benchmarking across diverse RBC shapes observed in normal and aged populations, our results show that the MFNN predictor can reconstruct complex RBC morphologies with over 95% coordinate accuracy when provided with at least two orthogonal cross-sections. It is observed that informative oblique cross-sections intersecting spicule tips of echinocytes improve both local and global feature reconstruction, highlighting the value of feature-aware sampling. Our study further evaluates the influence of sampling strategies, shape dissimilarity, and noise, showing enhanced robustness under physically constrained training. Altogether, these results demonstrate the capability of MFNN to reconstruct the 3D shape of normal and aged RBCs from partial cross-sections as observed in conventional microscope images, which could facilitate the quantitative analysis of RBC morphological parameters in normal and disease-related RBC samples.",

This study demonstrates how NCBI datasets can be systematically leveraged to extract and interpret infectious disease patterns across spatial and temporal dimensions. Using Enterobacterales as a case study, we analyzed over 477,000 genomic records and metadata, including collection date, location, host species, and isolation source. We compared trends of Escherichia coli and Salmonella in NCBI data with CDC's National Outbreak Reporting System (NORS). While both datasets showed consistent seasonal peaks and foodborne sources, NCBI data revealed broader host species (e.g., wildlife, environmental reservoirs), greater isolate diversity, and finer spatial-temporal resolution. These insights were enabled by our open-source Python package, EpiNCBI_V1, developed for real-time downloading, filtering, and cleaning of pathogen genomic metadata from NCBI. This work highlights the value of integrating genomic repositories into public health analytics to enhance surveillance, outbreak detection, and cross-species transmission tracking globally.",

    "abstract": "Deep generative models are rapidly advancing structure-based drug design, offering substantial promise for generating small molecule ligands that bind to specific protein targets. However, most current approaches assume a rigid protein binding pocket, neglecting the intrinsic flexibility of proteins and the conformational rearrangements induced by ligand binding, limiting their applicability in practical drug discovery. Here, we propose Apo2Mol, a diffusion-based generative framework for 3D molecule design that explicitly accounts for conformational flexibility in protein binding pockets. To support this, we curate a dataset of over 24,000 experimentally resolved apo-holo structure pairs from the Protein Data Bank, enabling the characterization of protein structure changes associated with ligand binding. Apo2Mol employs a full-atom hierarchical graph-based diffusion model that simultaneously generates 3D ligand molecules and their corresponding holo pocket conformations from input apo states. Empirical studies demonstrate that Apo2Mol can achieve state-of-the-art performance in generating high-affinity ligands and accurately capture realistic protein pocket conformational changes.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how systems evolve over time often requires discovering the differential equations that govern their behavior. Automatically learning these equations from experimental data is challenging when the data are noisy or limited, and existing approaches struggle, in particular, with the estimation of unobserved derivatives. Here, we introduce an integral Bayesian symbolic regression method that learns governing equations directly from raw time-series data, without requiring manual assumptions or error-prone derivative estimation. By sampling the space of symbolic differential equations and evaluating them via numerical integration, our method robustly identifies governing equations even from noisy or scarce data. We show that this approach accurately recovers ground-truth models in synthetic benchmarks, and that it makes quasi-optimal predictions of system dynamics for all noise regimes. Applying this method to bacterial growth experiments across multiple species and substrates, we discover novel growth equations that outperform classical models in accurately capturing all phases of microbial proliferation, including lag, exponential, and saturation. Unlike standard approaches, our method reveals subtle shifts in growth dynamics, such as double ramp-ups or non-canonical transitions, offering a deeper, data-driven understanding of microbial physiology.",

    "abstract": "Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) has become a cornerstone technology in clinical microbiology, enabling rapid and accurate microbial identification. However, the development of data-driven diagnostic models remains limited by the lack of sufficiently large, balanced, and standardized spectral datasets. This study investigates the use of deep generative models to synthesize realistic MALDI-TOF MS spectra, aiming to overcome data scarcity and support the development of robust machine learning tools in microbiology.   We adapt and evaluate three generative models, Variational Autoencoders (MALDIVAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (MALDIGANs), and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (MALDIffusion), for the conditional generation of microbial spectra guided by species labels. Generation is conditioned on species labels, and spectral fidelity and diversity are assessed using diverse metrics.   Our experiments show that synthetic data generated by MALDIVAE, MALDIGAN, and MALDIffusion are statistically and diagnostically comparable to real measurements, enabling classifiers trained exclusively on synthetic samples to reach performance levels similar to those trained on real data. While all models faithfully reproduce the peak structure and variability of MALDI-TOF spectra, MALDIffusion obtains this fidelity at a substantially higher computational cost, and MALDIGAN shows competitive but slightly less stable behaviour. In contrast, MALDIVAE offers the most favorable balance between realism, stability, and efficiency. Furthermore, augmenting minority species with synthetic spectra markedly improves classification accuracy, effectively mitigating class imbalance and domain mismatch without compromising the authenticity of the generated data.",

    "abstract": "Reliable measurement of glenoid bone loss is essential for operative planning in shoulder instability, but current manual and semi-automated methods are time-consuming and often subject to interreader variability. We developed and validated a fully automated deep learning pipeline for measuring glenoid bone loss on three-dimensional computed tomography (CT) scans using a linear-based, en-face view, best-circle method. Shoulder CT images of 91 patients (average age, 40 years; range, 14-89 years; 65 men) were retrospectively collected along with manual labels including glenoid segmentation, landmarks, and bone loss measurements. The multi-stage algorithm has three main stages: (1) segmentation, where we developed a U-Net to automatically segment the glenoid and humerus; (2) anatomical landmark detection, where a second network predicts glenoid rim points; and (3) geometric fitting, where we applied principal component analysis (PCA), projection, and circle fitting to compute the percentage of bone loss. The automated measurements showed strong agreement with consensus readings and exceeded surgeon-to-surgeon consistency (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) 0.84 vs 0.78), including in low- and high-bone-loss subgroups (ICC 0.71 vs 0.63 and 0.83 vs 0.21, respectively; P < 0.001). For classifying patients into low, medium, and high bone-loss categories, the pipeline achieved a recall of 0.714 for low and 0.857 for high severity, with no low cases misclassified as high or vice versa. These results suggest that our method is a time-efficient and clinically reliable tool for preoperative planning in shoulder instability and for screening patients with substantial glenoid bone loss.

All imports and analyses are recorded with parameters, versions, and results, ensuring real-time provenance accessible through integrated dashboards. This dual approach places OMERO at the heart of the bioimaging analysis process: the importer ensures provenance from image acquisition through preprocessing and import into OMERO, while the analyzer records it for downstream processing.

To address these issues, we develop a causal graph neural network (Causal-GNN) method that integrates causal inference with multi-layer graph neural networks (GNNs). The key innovation is the incorporation of causal effect estimation for identifying stable biomarkers, coupled with a GNN-based propensity scoring mechanism that leverages cross-gene regulatory networks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves consistently high predictive accuracy across four distinct datasets and four independent classifiers.

    "abstract": "The genotype-phenotype gap is a persistent barrier to complex trait genetic dissection, worsened by the explosive growth of genomic data (1.5 billion variants identified in the UK Biobank WGS study) alongside persistently scarce and subjective human-defined phenotypes. Digital phenotyping offers a potential solution, yet existing tools fail to balance scalable non-manual phenotype generation and biological interpretability of these quantitative traits. Here we report AIPheno, the first generative AI-driven \"phenotype sequencer\" that bridges this gap. It enables high-throughput, unsupervised extraction of digital phenotypes from imaging data and unlocks their biological meaning via generative network analysis. AIPheno transforms imaging modalities into a rich source of quantitative traits, dramatically enhancing cross-species genetic discovery, including novel loci such as CCBE1 (humans), KITLG-TMTC3 (domestic pigeons), and SOD2-IGF2R (swine). Critically, its generative module decodes AI-derived phenotypes by synthesizing variant-specific images to yield actionable biological insights. For example, it clarifies how the OCA2-HERC2 locus pleiotropically links pigmentation to retinal vascular traits via vascular visibility modulation. Integrating scalable non-manual phenotyping, enhanced genetic discovery power, and generative mechanistic decoding, AIPheno establishes a transformative closed-loop paradigm. This work addresses the longstanding genotype-phenotype imbalance, redefines digital phenotype utility, and accelerates translation of genetic associations into actionable understanding with profound implications for human health and agriculture.",

    "abstract": "Predicting single-cell perturbation outcomes directly advances gene function analysis and facilitates drug candidate selection, making it a key driver of both basic and translational biomedical research. However, a major bottleneck in this task is the unpaired nature of single-cell data, as the same cell cannot be observed both before and after perturbation due to the destructive nature of sequencing. Although some neural generative transport models attempt to tackle unpaired single-cell perturbation data, they either lack explicit conditioning or depend on prior spaces for indirect distribution alignment, limiting precise perturbation modeling. In this work, we approximate Schrödinger Bridge (SB), which defines stochastic dynamic mappings recovering the entropy-regularized optimal transport (OT), to directly align the distributions of control and perturbed single-cell populations across different perturbation conditions. Unlike prior SB approximations that rely on bidirectional modeling to infer optimal source-target sample coupling, we leverage Minibatch-OT based pairing to avoid such bidirectional inference and the associated ill-posedness of defining the reverse process. This pairing directly guides bridge learning, yielding a scalable approximation to the SB. We approximate two SB models, one modeling discrete gene activation states and the other continuous expression distributions. Joint training enables accurate perturbation modeling and captures single-cell heterogeneity. Experiments on public genetic and drug perturbation datasets show that our model effectively captures heterogeneous single-cell responses and achieves state-of-the-art performance.",

Notably, seagrasses commonly maintain a balanced symbiotic relationship characterized by a positive association with cable bacteria (Desulfobulbaceae), nitrogen-cycling bacteria (Hyphomonadaceae), and coral algae (Corallinophycidae) and a negative association with diatoms (Diatomea). Furthermore, seagrass growth conditions influence metabolic pathways by activating nitrogen-related metabolism while attenuating methanogenesis. Our findings highlight the crucial roles of marine plants and their symbiotic systems in ensuring environmental conservation within the context of blue carbon storage across environmental gradients.",

    "title": "MAT-MPNN: A Mobility-Aware Transformer-MPNN Model for Dynamic Spatiotemporal Prediction of HIV Diagnoses in California, Florida, and New England",
    "abstract": "Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) has posed a major global health challenge for decades, and forecasting HIV diagnoses continues to be a critical area of research. However, capturing the complex spatial and temporal dependencies of HIV transmission remains challenging. Conventional Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) models rely on a fixed binary adjacency matrix that only encodes geographic adjacency, which is unable to represent interactions between non-contiguous counties. Our study proposes a deep learning architecture Mobility-Aware Transformer-Message Passing Neural Network (MAT-MPNN) framework to predict county-level HIV diagnosis rates across California, Florida, and the New England region. The model combines temporal features extracted by a Transformer encoder with spatial relationships captured through a Mobility Graph Generator (MGG). The MGG improves conventional adjacency matrices by combining geographic and demographic information. Compared with the best-performing hybrid baseline, the Transformer MPNN model, MAT-MPNN reduced the Mean Squared Prediction Error (MSPE) by 27.9% in Florida, 39.1% in California, and 12.5% in New England, and improved the Predictive Model Choice Criterion (PMCC) by 7.7%, 3.5%, and 3.9%, respectively. MAT-MPNN also achieved better results than the Spatially Varying Auto-Regressive (SVAR) model in Florida and New England, with comparable performance in California. These results demonstrate that applying mobility-aware dynamic spatial structures substantially enhances predictive accuracy and calibration in spatiotemporal epidemiological prediction.",

    "abstract": "This work introduces a novel framework for testing topological variability in weighted networks by combining Hodge decomposition with Wasserstein variance minimization. Traditional approaches that analyze raw edge weights are susceptible to noise driven perturbations, limiting their ability to detect meaningful structural differences between network populations. Network signals are decomposed into various components using combinatorial Hodge theory, then topological disparity is quantified via the 2-Wasserstein distance between persistence diagrams. The test statistic measures variance reduction when comparing within group to between group dispersions in the Wasserstein space. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed method suppresses small random perturbations while maintaining sensitivity to genuine topological differences, particularly when applied to Hodge decomposed flows rather than raw edge weights. The framework is applied to functional brain networks from the Multimodal Treatment of ADHD dataset, comparing cannabis users and non-users",

This study presents a deep learning-based framework for functional group classification of protein sequences derived from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Four architectures were implemented: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), CNN-BiLSTM hybrid, and CNN with Attention. Each model was trained using k-mer integer encoding to capture both local and long-range dependencies. Among these, the CNN achieved the highest validation accuracy of 91.8%, demonstrating the effectiveness of localized motif detection. Explainable AI techniques, including Grad-CAM and Integrated Gradients, were applied to interpret model predictions and identify biologically meaningful sequence motifs. The discovered motifs, enriched in histidine, aspartate, glutamate, and lysine, represent amino acid residues commonly found in catalytic and metal-binding regions of transferase enzymes. These findings highlight that deep learning models can uncover functionally relevant biochemical signatures, bridging the gap between predictive accuracy and biological interpretability in protein sequence analysis.",

    "abstract": "We developed an explainable deep learning framework integrating protein-protein interaction (PPI) network centrality metrics with node embeddings for cancer therapeutic target prioritization. A high-confidence PPI network was constructed from STRING database interactions, computing six centrality metrics: degree, strength, betweenness, closeness, eigenvector centrality, and clustering coefficient. Node2Vec embeddings captured latent network topology. Combined features trained XGBoost and neural network classifiers using DepMap CRISPR essentiality scores as ground truth. Model interpretability was assessed through GradientSHAP analysis quantifying feature contributions. We developed a novel blended scoring approach combining model probability predictions with SHAP attribution magnitudes for enhanced gene prioritization. Our framework achieved state-of-the-art performance with AUROC of 0.930 and AUPRC of 0.656 for identifying the top 10\\% most essential genes. GradientSHAP analysis revealed centrality measures contributed significantly to predictions, with degree centrality showing strongest correlation ($ρ$ = -0.357) with gene essentiality. The blended scoring approach created robust gene prioritization rankings, successfully identifying known essential genes including ribosomal proteins (RPS27A, RPS17, RPS6) and oncogenes (MYC). This study presents a human-based, combinatorial in silico framework successfully integrating network biology with explainable AI for therapeutic target discovery. The framework provides mechanistic transparency through feature attribution analysis while maintaining state-of-the-art predictive performance. Its reproducible design and reliance on human molecular datasets demonstrate a reduction-to-practice example of next-generation, animal-free modeling for cancer therapeutic target discovery and prioritization.",

    "title": "The Probabilistic Foundations of Surveillance Failure: From False Alerts to Structural Bias",
    "abstract": "For decades, forensic statisticians have debated whether searching large DNA databases undermines the evidential value of a match. Modern surveillance faces an exponentially harder problem: screening populations across thousands of attributes using threshold rules rather than exact matching. Intuition suggests that requiring many coincidental matches should make false alerts astronomically unlikely. This intuition fails.   Consider a system that monitors 1,000 attributes, each with a 0.5 percent innocent match rate. Matching 15 pre-specified attributes has probability \\(10^{-35}\\), one in 30 decillion, effectively impossible. But operational systems require no such specificity. They might flag anyone who matches \\emph{any} 15 of the 1,000. In a city of one million innocent people, this produces about 226 false alerts. A seemingly impossible event becomes all but guaranteed. This is not an implementation flaw but a mathematical consequence of high-dimensional screening.   We identify fundamental probabilistic limits on screening reliability. Systems undergo sharp transitions from reliable to unreliable with small increases in data scale, a fragility worsened by data growth and correlations. As data accumulate and correlation collapses effective dimensionality, systems enter regimes where alerts lose evidential value even when individual coincidences remain vanishingly rare. This framework reframes the DNA database controversy as a shift between operational regimes. Unequal surveillance exposures magnify failure, making ``structural bias'' mathematically inevitable. These limits are structural: beyond a critical scale, failure cannot be prevented through threshold adjustment or algorithmic refinement.",

    "abstract": "Timelapse images of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) provide rich information on cell structure and contractile function. However, it is challenging to reproducibly generate tissue samples and conduct scalable experiments with these cells. The two-dimensional cardiac muscle bundle (2DMB) platform helps address these limitations by standardizing tissue geometry, resulting in physiologic, uniaxial contractions of discrete tissues on an elastomeric substrate with stiffness similar to the heart. 2DMBs are highly conducive to sarcomere imaging using fluorescent reporters, but, due to their larger and more physiologic sarcomere displacements and velocities, prior sarcomere-tracking pipelines have been unreliable. Here, we present adaptations to SarcGraph, an open-source Python package for sarcomere detection and tracking, that enable automated analysis of high-frame-rate 2DMB recordings. Key modifications to the pipeline include: 1) switching to a frame-by-frame sarcomere detection approach and automating tissue segmentation with spatial partitioning, 2) performing Gaussian Process Regression for signal denoising, and 3) incorporating an automatic contractile phase detection pipeline. These enhancements enable the extraction of structural organization and functional contractility metrics for both the whole 2DMB tissue and distinct tissue regions, both in a fully automated manner. We complement this software release with a dataset of 130 example movies of baseline and drug-treated samples disseminated through the Harvard Dataverse. By providing open-source tools and datasets, we aim to enable high-throughput analysis of engineered cardiac tissues and advance collective progress within the hiPSC-CM research community.",

Yet, constructing such problems in a reproducible and accessible manner remains challenging. The PEtab format has established itself as a powerful community standard to encode parameter estimation problems, promoting interoperability and reusability.

Here, we present PEtab-GUI, an open-source Python application designed to streamline the creation, editing, and validation of PEtab problems through an intuitive graphical user interface. PEtab-GUI integrates all PEtab components, including SBML models and tabular files, into a single environment with live error-checking and customizable defaults. Interactive visualization and simulation capabilities enable users to inspect the relationship between the model and the data. PEtab-GUI lowers the barrier to entry for specifying standardized parameter estimation problems, making dynamic modeling more accessible, especially in educational and interdisciplinary settings.

By integrating complementary information from multiple data sources, MDL models have demonstrated superior predictive performance across diverse clinical tasks compared to unimodal models. However, the assumption that combining modalities inherently improves performance remains largely unexamined. We hypothesise that multimodal gains depend critically on the predictive quality of individual modalities, and that integrating weak modalities may introduce noise rather than complementary information. We test this hypothesis on a prostate cancer dataset with histopathology, radiology, and clinical data to predict time-to-biochemical recurrence. Our results confirm that combining high-performing modalities yield superior performance compared to unimodal approaches. However, integrating a poor-performing modality with other higher-performing modalities degrades predictive accuracy. These findings demonstrate that multimodal benefit requires selective, performance-guided integration rather than indiscriminate modality combination, with implications for MDL design across computational pathology and medical imaging.",

    "abstract": "Current cancer screening guidelines cover only a few cancer types and rely on narrowly defined criteria such as age or a single risk factor like smoking history, to identify high-risk individuals. Predictive models using electronic health records (EHRs), which capture large-scale longitudinal patient-level health information, may provide a more effective tool for identifying high-risk groups by detecting subtle prediagnostic signals of cancer. Recent advances in large language and foundation models have further expanded this potential, yet evidence remains limited on how useful HER-based models are compared with traditional risk factors currently used in screening guidelines. We systematically evaluated the clinical utility of EHR-based predictive models against traditional risk factors, including gene mutations and family history of cancer, for identifying high-risk individuals across eight major cancers (breast, lung, colorectal, prostate, ovarian, liver, pancreatic, and stomach), using data from the All of Us Research Program, which integrates EHR, genomic, and survey data from over 865,000 participants. Even with a baseline modeling approach, EHR-based models achieved a 3- to 6-fold higher enrichment of true cancer cases among individuals identified as high risk compared with traditional risk factors alone, whether used as a standalone or complementary tool. The EHR foundation model, a state-of-the-art approach trained on comprehensive patient trajectories, further improved predictive performance across 26 cancer types, demonstrating the clinical potential of EHR-based predictive modeling to support more precise and scalable early detection strategies.",

Surrogate signals constructed from Poisson processes, Fractional Gaussian Noise, and Renewal Processes with power-law waiting times are used to validate sensitivity to memory, intermittency, and multifractality. Across all methods, a coherent hierarchy of dynamical regimes is recovered, demonstrating internal methodological consistency. Application to experimental dark-count data and attenuated coherent-laser emission confirm Poisson-like behavior, establishing an essential statistical baseline for UPE studies. The combined results show that this multi-resolution approach reliably separates trivial photon-counting statistics from struc-tured long-range organization, providing a validated methodological foundation for future biological UPE measurements and their interpretation in the context of non-equilibrium statistical physics, information dynamics, and prospective markers of biological coherence.",

    "abstract": "Protein structure is central to biological function, and enabling multimodal protein models requires joint reasoning over sequence, structure, and function. A key barrier is the lack of principled protein structure tokenizers (PSTs): existing approaches fix token size or rely on continuous vector codebooks, limiting interpretability, multi-scale control, and transfer across architectures. We introduce GeoBPE, a geometry-grounded PST that transforms continuous, noisy, multi-scale backbone conformations into discrete ``sentences'' of geometry while enforcing global constraints. Analogous to byte-pair encoding, GeoBPE generates a hierarchical vocabulary of geometric primitives by iteratively (i) clustering Geo-Pair occurrences with k-medoids to yield a resolution-controllable vocabulary; (ii) quantizing each Geo-Pair to its closest medoid prototype; and (iii) reducing drift through differentiable inverse kinematics that optimizes boundary glue angles under an $\\mathrm{SE}(3)$ end-frame loss. GeoBPE offers compression ($>$10x reduction in bits-per-residue at similar distortion rate), data efficiency ($>$10x less training data), and generalization (maintains test/train distortion ratio of $1.0-1.1$). It is architecture-agnostic: (a) its hierarchical vocabulary provides a strong inductive bias for coarsening residue-level embeddings from large PLMs into motif- and protein-level representations, consistently outperforming leading PSTs across $12$ tasks and $24$ test splits; (b) paired with a transformer, GeoBPE supports unconditional backbone generation via language modeling; and (c) tokens align with CATH functional families and support expert-interpretable case studies, offering functional meaning absent in prior PSTs.

    "abstract": "Histopathologists establish cancer grade by assessing histological structures, such as glands in prostate cancer. Yet, digital pathology pipelines often rely on grid-based tiling that ignores tissue architecture. This introduces irrelevant information and limits interpretability. We introduce histology-informed tiling (HIT), which uses semantic segmentation to extract glands from whole slide images (WSIs) as biologically meaningful input patches for multiple-instance learning (MIL) and phenotyping. Trained on 137 samples from the ProMPT cohort, HIT achieved a gland-level Dice score of 0.83 +/- 0.17. By extracting 380,000 glands from 760 WSIs across ICGC-C and TCGA-PRAD cohorts, HIT improved MIL models AUCs by 10% for detecting copy number variation (CNVs) in genes related to epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMT) and MYC, and revealed 15 gland clusters, several of which were associated with cancer relapse, oncogenic mutations, and high Gleason. Therefore, HIT improved the accuracy and interpretability of MIL predictions, while streamlining computations by focussing on biologically meaningful structures during feature extraction.",

    "abstract": "Accurate exploration of protein conformational ensembles is essential for uncovering function but remains hard because molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations suffer from high computational costs and energy-barrier trapping. This paper presents Energy Preference Optimization (EPO), an online refinement algorithm that turns a pretrained protein ensemble generator into an energy-aware sampler without extra MD trajectories. Specifically, EPO leverages stochastic differential equation sampling to explore the conformational landscape and incorporates a novel energy-ranking mechanism based on list-wise preference optimization. Crucially, EPO introduces a practical upper bound to efficiently approximate the intractable probability of long sampling trajectories in continuous-time generative models, making it easily adaptable to existing pretrained generators. On Tetrapeptides, ATLAS, and Fast-Folding benchmarks, EPO successfully generates diverse and physically realistic ensembles, establishing a new state-of-the-art in nine evaluation metrics. These results demonstrate that energy-only preference signals can efficiently steer generative models toward thermodynamically consistent conformational ensembles, providing an alternative to long MD simulations and widening the applicability of learned potentials in structural biology and drug discovery.",

    "abstract": "Codon usage bias has a crucial impact on the translation efficiency and co-translational folding of proteins, necessitating the algorithmic development of codon optimization/harmonization methods, particularly for heterologous recombinant protein expression. Codon harmonization is especially valuable for proteins sensitive to translation rates, because it can potentially replicate native translation speeds, preserving proper folding and maintaining protein activity. This work proposes a Monte Carlo-based codon harmonization algorithm, MOSAIC (Monte Carlo-based Simulated Annealing for Linked Codons), for the harmonization of a set of linked codons, which differs from conventional codon harmonization, by focusing on the codon sets rather than individual ones. Our MOSAIC demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on ribosomal proteins (S18, S15, S10, and L11) as model systems. Among them, the harmonized gene of RP S18 was expressed and compared with the expression of the wild-type gene. The harmonized gene clearly yielded a larger quantity of the protein, from which the amount of the soluble protein was also significant. These results underscore the potential of the linked codon harmonization approach to enhance the expression and functionality of sensitive proteins, setting the stage for more efficient production of recombinant proteins in various biotechnological and pharmaceutical applications.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming various domains, including biomedicine and healthcare, and demonstrate remarkable potential from scientific research to new drug discovery. Graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, as a useful application of LLMs, can improve contextual reasoning through structured entity and relationship identification from long-context knowledge, e.g. biomedical literature. Even though many advantages over naive RAGs, most of graph-based RAGs are computationally intensive, which limits their application to large-scale dataset. To address this issue, we introduce fastbmRAG, an fast graph-based RAG optimized for biomedical literature. Utilizing well organized structure of biomedical papers, fastbmRAG divides the construction of knowledge graph into two stages, first drafting graphs using abstracts; and second, refining them using main texts guided by vector-based entity linking, which minimizes redundancy and computational load. Our evaluations demonstrate that fastbmRAG is over 10x faster than existing graph-RAG tools and achieve superior coverage and accuracy to input knowledge. FastbmRAG provides a fast solution for quickly understanding, summarizing, and answering questions about biomedical literature on a large scale.

    "title": "TomoGraphView: 3D Medical Image Classification with Omnidirectional Slice Representations and Graph Neural Networks",
    "abstract": "The sharp rise in medical tomography examinations has created a demand for automated systems that can reliably extract informative features for downstream tasks such as tumor characterization. Although 3D volumes contain richer information than individual slices, effective 3D classification remains difficult: volumetric data encode complex spatial dependencies, and the scarcity of large-scale 3D datasets has constrained progress toward 3D foundation models. As a result, many recent approaches rely on 2D vision foundation models trained on natural images, repurposing them as feature extractors for medical scans with surprisingly strong performance. Despite their practical success, current methods that apply 2D foundation models to 3D scans via slice-based decomposition remain fundamentally limited. Standard slicing along axial, sagittal, and coronal planes often fails to capture the true spatial extent of a structure when its orientation does not align with these canonical views. More critically, most approaches aggregate slice features independently, ignoring the underlying 3D geometry and losing spatial coherence across slices. To overcome these limitations, we propose TomoGraphView, a novel framework that integrates omnidirectional volume slicing with spherical graph-based feature aggregation. Instead of restricting the model to axial, sagittal, or coronal planes, our method samples both canonical and non-canonical cross-sections generated from uniformly distributed points on a sphere enclosing the volume. We publicly share our accessible code base at http://github.com/compai-lab/2025-MedIA-kiechle and provide a user-friendly library for omnidirectional volume slicing at https://pypi.org/project/OmniSlicer.",

    "abstract": "Medical image segmentation using deep learning (DL) has enabled the development of automated analysis pipelines for large-scale population studies. However, state-of-the-art DL methods are prone to hallucinations, which can result in anatomically implausible segmentations. With manual correction impractical at scale, automated quality control (QC) techniques have to address the challenge. While promising, existing QC methods are organ-specific, limiting their generalizability and usability beyond their original intended task. To overcome this limitation, we propose no-new Quality Control (nnQC), a robust QC framework based on a diffusion-generative paradigm that self-adapts to any input organ dataset. Central to nnQC is a novel Team of Experts (ToE) architecture, where two specialized experts independently encode 3D spatial awareness, represented by the relative spatial position of an axial slice, and anatomical information derived from visual features from the original image. A weighted conditional module dynamically combines the pair of independent embeddings, or opinions to condition the sampling mechanism within a diffusion process, enabling the generation of a spatially aware pseudo-ground truth for predicting QC scores. Within its framework, nnQC integrates fingerprint adaptation to ensure adaptability across organs, datasets, and imaging modalities. We evaluated nnQC on seven organs using twelve publicly available datasets. Our results demonstrate that nnQC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all experiments, including cases where segmentation masks are highly degraded or completely missing, confirming its versatility and effectiveness across different organs.",

Here we extend the Feynman-Kac (FK) steering framework, an inference-time control approach, to diffusion-based protein design. By coupling FK steering with structure generation, the method guides sampling toward desirable structural or energetic features while maintaining the diversity of the underlying diffusion process. To enable simultaneous generation of both sequence and structure properties, rewards are computed on models refined through ProteinMPNN and all-atom relaxation. Applied to binder design, FK steering consistently improves predicted interface energetics across diverse targets with minimal computational overhead. More broadly, this work demonstrates that inference-time FK control generalizes diffusion-based protein design to arbitrary, non-differentiable, and reward-agnostic objectives, providing a unified and model-independent framework for guided molecular generation.",

    "abstract": "Ratios of common biomarkers and blood analytes are well established for early detection and predictive purposes. Early risk stratification in critical care is often limited by the delayed availability of complex severity scores. Complete blood count (CBC) parameters, available within hours of admission, may enable rapid prognostication. We conducted an exhaustive and systematic evaluation of CBC-derived ratios for mortality prediction to identify robust, accessible, and generalizable biomarkers. We generated all feasible two-parameter CBC ratios with unit checks and plausibility filters on more than 90,000 ICU admissions (MIMIC-IV). Discrimination was assessed via cross-validated and external AUC, calibration via isotonic regression, and clinical utility with decision-curve analysis. Retrospective validation was performed on eICU-CRD (n = 156530) participants. The ratio of Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW) to Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration (MCHC), denoted RDW:MCHC, emerged as the top biomarker (AUC = 0.699 discovery; 0.662 validation), outperforming RDW and NLR. It achieved near-universal availability (99.9\\% vs.\\ 35.0\\% for NLR), excellent calibration (Hosmer--Lemeshow $p = 1.0$; $\\mathrm{ECE} < 0.001$), and preserved performance across diagnostic groups, with only modest attenuation in respiratory cases. Expressed as a logistic odds ratio, each one standard deviation increase in RDW:MCHC nearly quadrupled 30-day mortality odds (OR = 3.81, 95\\% CI [3.70, 3.95]). Decision-curve analysis showed positive net benefit at high-risk triage thresholds. A simple, widely available CBC-derived feature (RDW:MCHC) provides consistent, externally validated signal for early mortality risk. While not a substitute for multivariable scores, it offers a pragmatic adjunct for rapid triage when full scoring is impractical.",

Recent advances in artificial intelligence have the potential to support radiologists and help address these challenges. Given its widespread use and clinical importance, chest X-ray classification is well suited to augment radiologists' workflows. However, most existing approaches rely solely on single-view, image-level inputs, ignoring the structured clinical information and multi-image studies available at the time of reporting. In this work, we introduce CaMCheX, a multimodal transformer-based framework that aligns multi-view chest X-ray studies with structured clinical data to better reflect how clinicians make diagnostic decisions. Our architecture employs view-specific ConvNeXt encoders for frontal and lateral chest radiographs, whose features are fused with clinical indications, history, and vital signs using a transformer fusion module. This design enables the model to generate context-aware representations that mirror reasoning in clinical practice. Our results exceed the state of the art for both the original MIMIC-CXR dataset and the more recent CXR-LT benchmarks, highlighting the value of clinically grounded multimodal alignment for advancing chest X-ray classification.",

We introduce a physical quantity that quantifies the irreversibility of stochastic Langevin systems from the observation of individual molecules' displacements. Categorizing these displacements into a few groups based on their initial and final position allows us to measure irreversibility precisely without the need to know the forces and magnitude of the fluctuations acting on the system. Our model-free estimate of irreversibility is related to entropy production by a conditional fluctuation theorem and provides a lower bound to the average entropy production. We validate the method on single-molecule force spectroscopy experiments of proteins subject to force ramps. We show that irreversibility is sensitive to detailed features of the energy landscape underlying the protein folding dynamics and suggest how our methods can be employed to unveil key properties of protein folding processes.",

Progress is further limited by inconsistent annotations across sources and the absence of a prostate-specific benchmark for fair comparison.

To ensure data integrity, we corrected a Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) issue that merged multiple transcript records, introducing ambiguity in clinical significance fields. We then standardized 56 interpretable features across eight clinically relevant tiers, including population frequency, variant type, and clinical context. AlphaMissense pathogenicity scores were incorporated to enhance missense variant classification and reduce VUS uncertainty. Building on this resource, we trained an interpretable TabNet model to classify variant pathogenicity, whose step-wise sparse masks provide per-case rationales consistent with molecular tumor board review practices. On the held-out test set, the model achieved 89.9% accuracy with balanced class metrics, and the VEP correction yields an 6.5% absolute reduction in VUS.",

DeepDR leverages invaluable experience to recommend candidate drugs, which covers more than 15 networks and a comprehensive knowledge graph that includes 5.9 million edges across 107 types of relationships connecting drugs, diseases, proteins/genes, pathways, and expression from six existing databases and a large scientific corpus of 24 million PubMed publications. Additionally, the recommended results include detailed descriptions of the recommended drugs and visualize key patterns with interpretability through a knowledge graph. Conclusion: DeepDR is free and open to all users without the requirement of registration. We believe it can provide an easy-to-use, systematic, highly accurate, and computationally automated platform for both experimental and computational scientists.",

    "abstract": "We introduce HAMscope, a compact, snapshot hyperspectral autofluorescence miniscope that enables real-time, label-free molecular imaging in a wide range of biological systems. By integrating a thin polymer diffuser into a widefield miniscope, HAMscope spectrally encodes each frame and employs a probabilistic deep learning framework to reconstruct 30-channel hyperspectral stacks (452 to 703 nm) or directly infer molecular composition maps from single images. A scalable multi-pass U-Net architecture with transformer-based attention and per-pixel uncertainty estimation enables high spatio-spectral fidelity (mean absolute error ~ 0.0048) at video rates. While initially demonstrated in plant systems, including lignin, chlorophyll, and suberin imaging in intact poplar and cork tissues, the platform is readily adaptable to other applications such as neural activity mapping, metabolic profiling, and histopathology. We show that the system generalizes to out-of-distribution tissue types and supports direct molecular mapping without the need for spectral unmixing. HAMscope establishes a general framework for compact, uncertainty-aware spectral imaging that combines minimal optics with advanced deep learning, offering broad utility for real-time biochemical imaging across neuroscience, environmental monitoring, and biomedicine.",

    "abstract": "For many taxonomic groups, online biodiversity portals used by naturalists and citizen scientists constitute the primary source of distributional information. Over the last decade, site-occupancy models have been advanced as a promising framework to analyse such loosely structured, opportunistically collected datasets. Current approaches often ignore important aspects of the detection process and do not fully capitalise on the information present in these datasets, leaving opportunities for fine-grained spatiotemporal backcasting untouched. We propose a flexible Bayesian spatiotemporal site-occupancy model that aims to mimic the data-generating process that underlies common citizen science datasets sourced from public biodiversity portals, and yields rich biological output. We illustrate the use of the model to a dataset containing over 3M butterfly records in Belgium, collected through the citizen science data portal Observations.be. We show that the proposed approach enables retrospective predictions on the occupancy of species through time and space at high resolution, as well as inference on inter-annual distributional trends, range dynamics, habitat preferences, phenological patterns, detection patterns and observer heterogeneity. The proposed model can be used to increase the value of opportunistically collected data by naturalists and citizen scientists, and can aid the understanding of spatiotemporal dynamics of species for which rigorously collected data are absent or too costly to collect.",

However, industrial deployment is hampered by the lack of scalable architectures to ensure stable coexistence between populations. Existing strategies rely on genetic modifications, which impose metabolic load, or environmental changes, which can reduce production. We present a versatile control architecture to regulate density and composition of a two-strain consortium without genetic engineering or drastic environmental changes. Our bioreactor-based control architecture comprises a mixing chamber where both strains are co-cultured and a reservoir sustaining the slower-growing strain. For both chambers we develop model-based and sim-to-real learning controllers. The control architecture is then validated in vivo on a two-strain Escherichia coli consortium, achieving precise and robust regulation of consortium density and composition, including tracking of time-varying references and recovery from perturbations.",

    "abstract": "Spatial transcriptomics (ST) measures gene expression at a set of spatial locations in a tissue. Communities of nearby cells that express similar genes form \\textit{spatial domains}. Specialized ST clustering algorithms have been developed to identify these spatial domains. These methods often identify spatial domains at a single morphological scale, and interactions across multiple scales are often overlooked. For example, large cellular communities often contain smaller substructures, and heterogeneous frontier regions often lie between homogeneous domains. Topological data analysis (TDA) is an emerging mathematical toolkit that studies the underlying features of data at various geometric scales. It is especially useful for analyzing complex biological datasets with multiscale characteristics. Using TDA, we develop Persistent Homology for Domains at Multiple Scales (PHD-MS) to locate tissue structures that persist across morphological scales. We apply PHD-MS to highlight multiscale spatial domains in several tissue types and ST technologies. We also compare PHD-MS domains against ground-truth domains in expert-annotated tissues, where PHD-MS outperforms traditional clustering approaches. PHD-MS is available as an open-source software package with an interactive graphical user interface for exploring the identified multiscale domains.",

    "abstract": "Despite growing reference libraries and advanced computational tools, progress in the field of metabolomics remains constrained by low rates of annotating measured spectra. The recent developments of large language models (LLMs) have led to strong performance across a wide range of generation and reasoning tasks, spurring increased interest in LLMs' application to domain-specific scientific challenges, such as mass spectra annotation. Here, we present a novel framework, General Intelligence-based Fragmentation (GIF), that guides pretrained LLMs through spectra simulation using structured prompting and reasoning. GIF utilizes tagging, structured inputs/outputs, system prompts, instruction-based prompts, and iterative refinement. Indeed, GIF offers a structured alternative to ad hoc prompting, underscoring the need for systematic guidance of LLMs on complex scientific tasks. Using GIF, we evaluate current generalist LLMs' ability to use reasoning towards fragmentation and to perform intensity prediction after fine-tuning. We benchmark performance on a novel QA dataset, the MassSpecGym QA-sim dataset, that we derive from the MassSpecGym dataset. Through these implementations of GIF, we find that GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini achieve a cosine similarity of 0.36 and 0.35 between the simulated and true spectra, respectively, outperforming other pretrained models including GPT-5, Llama-3.1, and ChemDFM, despite GPT-5's recency and ChemDFM's domain specialization. GIF outperforms several deep learning baselines. Our evaluation of GIF highlights the value of using LLMs not only for spectra simulation but for enabling human-in-the-loop workflows and structured, explainable reasoning in molecular fragmentation.",

    "abstract": "Prompt-driven vision foundation models, such as the Segment Anything Model, have recently demonstrated remarkable adaptability in computer vision. However, their direct application to medical imaging remains challenging due to heterogeneous tissue structures, imaging artefacts, and low-contrast boundaries, particularly in tumours and cancer primaries leading to suboptimal segmentation in ambiguous or overlapping lesion regions. Here, we present Segment Any Tumour 3D (SAT3D), a lightweight volumetric foundation model designed to enable robust and generalisable tumour segmentation across diverse medical imaging modalities. SAT3D integrates a shifted-window vision transformer for hierarchical volumetric representation with an uncertainty-aware training pipeline that explicitly incorporates uncertainty estimates as prompts to guide reliable boundary prediction in low-contrast regions. Adversarial learning further enhances model performance for the ambiguous pathological regions. We benchmark SAT3D against three recent vision foundation models and nnUNet across 11 publicly available datasets, encompassing 3,884 tumour and cancer cases for training and 694 cases for in-distribution evaluation. Trained on 17,075 3D volume-mask pairs across multiple modalities and cancer primaries, SAT3D demonstrates strong generalisation and robustness. To facilitate practical use and clinical translation, we developed a 3D Slicer plugin that enables interactive, prompt-driven segmentation and visualisation using the trained SAT3D model. Extensive experiments highlight its effectiveness in improving segmentation accuracy under challenging and out-of-distribution scenarios, underscoring its potential as a scalable foundation model for medical image analysis.",

    "abstract": "Markerless motion tracking has advanced rapidly in the past 10 years and currently offers powerful opportunities for behavioural, clinical, and biomechanical research. While several specialised toolkits provide high performance for specific tasks, using existing tools still requires substantial technical expertise. There remains a gap in accessible, integrated solutions that deliver sufficient tracking for non-experts across diverse settings.   TrackStudio was developed to address this gap by combining established open-source tools into a single, modular, GUI-based pipeline that works out of the box. It provides automatic 2D and 3D tracking, calibration, preprocessing, feature extraction, and visualisation without requiring any programming skills. We supply a user guide with practical advice for video acquisition, synchronisation, and setup, alongside documentation of common pitfalls and how to avoid them.   To validate the toolkit, we tested its performance across three environments using either low-cost webcams or high-resolution cameras, including challenging conditions for body position, lightning, and space and obstructions. Across 76 participants, average inter-frame correlations exceeded 0.98 and average triangulation errors remained low (<13.6mm for hand tracking), demonstrating stable and consistent tracking. We further show that the same pipeline can be extended beyond hand tracking to other body and face regions. TrackStudio provides a practical, accessible route into markerless tracking for researchers or laypeople who need reliable performance without specialist expertise.",

    "title": "A Diffusion Model to Shrink Proteins While Maintaining Their Function",
    "abstract": "Many proteins useful in modern medicine or bioengineering are challenging to make in the lab, fuse with other proteins in cells, or deliver to tissues in the body, because their sequences are too long. Shortening these sequences typically involves costly, time-consuming experimental campaigns. Ideally, we could instead use modern models of massive databases of sequences from nature to learn how to propose shrunken proteins that resemble sequences found in nature. Unfortunately, these models struggle to efficiently search the combinatorial space of all deletions, and are not trained with inductive biases to learn how to delete. To address this gap, we propose SCISOR, a novel discrete diffusion model that deletes letters from sequences to generate protein samples that resemble those found in nature. To do so, SCISOR trains a de-noiser to reverse a forward noising process that adds random insertions to natural sequences. As a generative model, SCISOR fits evolutionary sequence data competitively with previous large models. In evaluation, SCISOR achieves state-of-the-art predictions of the functional effects of deletions on ProteinGym. Finally, we use the SCISOR de-noiser to shrink long protein sequences, and show that its suggested deletions result in significantly more realistic proteins and more often preserve functional motifs than previous models of evolutionary sequences.",

    "abstract": "The human brain is a complex system defined by multi-way, higher-order interactions invisible to traditional pairwise network models. Although a diverse array of analytical methods has been developed to address this shortcoming, the field remains fragmented, lacking a unifying conceptual framework that integrates and organizes the rapidly expanding methodological landscape of higher-order brain connectivity. This review provides a synthesis of the methodologies for studying higher-order brain connectivity. We propose a fundamental distinction between implicit paradigms, which quantify the statistical strength of group interactions, and explicit paradigms, which construct higher-order structural representations like hypergraphs and topological data analysis. We trace the evolution of each approach, from early Correlation-of-Correlations and information-theoretic concepts of synergy/redundancy, to the edge-centric paradigm and advanced topological methods. Through a critical analysis of conceptual, statistical, and computational challenges, we argue that the future of the field lies not in a single best method, but in a principled integration of these complementary approaches. This manuscript aims to provide a unified map and a critical perspective to guide researchers toward a robust and insightful understanding of the brain's complex, multi-level architecture.",

By using Mahalanobis data whitening prior to the use of dimensionality reduction algorithms, we are able to distill meaningful information from fMRI signals about subjects and the experimental stimuli used to prompt them. Furthermore, we offer an interpretation of Mahalanobis whitening as a two-stage de-individualization of data which is motivated by similarity as captured by the Bures distance, which is connected to quantum mechanics.

This update 3.7.1, mainly focuses on new features related to large-scale emergency responses, like criticality accidents dose estimation and laboratory networks. Material and Methods: Biodose Tools has been developed using the R programming language. The current version (3.7.1) uses the same external dependencies as version 3.6.1 (released November 2022) while integrating three new external packages to support the new functionalities. Results: Version 3.7.1 introduces different new modules: (a) a characteristic limits module that calculates decision thresholds and detection limits following ISO19238:2023 standards, and offers statistical tests to compare rates between suspected exposure cases and control data; (b) an enhanced dose estimation module which supports multiple dose assessments for dicentric and translocation assays for various exposure scenarios (acute, protracted, and highly protracted) as well as whole and partial-body exposures; (c) a criticality accidents module for multiple dose estimations using dicentrics in mixed gamma-neutron exposure scenarios (e.g., nuclear detonations); and (d) an Interlaboratory comparison module that automates the evaluation and comparison of dose estimates across laboratories. Conclusions: Biodose Tools (biodosetools.reneb.bfs.de) continues to evolve in response to the dynamic needs of the biological dosimetry community, contributing to the preparedness and consistency in emergency response and routine applications.",

    "abstract": "In biological cells, DNA replication is carried out by the replisome, a protein complex encompassing multiple DNA polymerases. DNA replication is semi-discontinuous: a DNA polymerase synthesizes one (leading) strand of the DNA continuously, and another polymerase synthesizes the other (lagging) strand discontinuously. Complex dynamics of the lagging-strand polymerase within the replisome result in the formation of short interim fragments, known as Okazaki fragments, and gaps between them. Although the semi-discontinuous replication is ubiquitous, a detailed characterization of it remains elusive. In this work, we develop a framework to investigate the semi-discontinuous replication by incorporating stochastic dynamics of the lagging-strand polymerase. Computing the size distribution of Okazaki fragments and gaps, we uncover the significance of the polymerase dissociation in shaping them. We apply the method to the previous experiment on the T4 bacteriophage replication system and identify the key parameters governing the polymerase dynamics. These results reveal that the collisions of lagging-strand polymerase with pre-synthesised Okazaki fragments primarily trigger its dissociation from the lagging strand.",

    "abstract": "Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) remain a major source of preventable harm, and many clinically important mechanisms are still unknown. Existing models either rely on pharmacologic knowledge graphs (KGs), which fail on unseen drugs, or on electronic health records (EHRs), which are noisy, temporal, and site-dependent. We introduce, to our knowledge, the first system that conditions KG relation scoring on patient-level EHR context and distills that reasoning into an EHR-only model for zero-shot inference. A fusion \"Teacher\" learns mechanism-specific relations for drug pairs represented in both sources, while a distilled \"Student\" generalizes to new or rarely used drugs without KG access at inference. Both operate under a shared ontology (set) of pharmacologic mechanisms (drug relations) to produce interpretable, auditable alerts rather than opaque risk scores. Trained on a multi-institution EHR corpus paired with a curated DrugBank DDI graph, and evaluated using a clinically aligned, decision-focused protocol with leakage-safe negatives that avoid artificially easy pairs, the system maintains precision across multi-institutuion test data, produces mechanism-specific, clinically consistent predictions, reduces false alerts (higher precision) at comparable overall detection performance (F1), and misses fewer true interactions compared to prior methods. Case studies further show zero-shot identification of clinically recognized CYP-mediated and pharmacodynamic mechanisms for drugs absent from the KG, supporting real-world use in clinical decision support and pharmacovigilance.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the growth and form of shapes is one of the most fundamental problems in biology. While many prior works have analyzed the beak shapes of Darwin's finches, other cranial features are relatively less explored. In this work, we develop geometric and statistical methods for analyzing the skull morphology of Darwin's finches and their relatives, focusing on the relationship between their skull dimensions, orbit curvature, and neurocranial geometries. Specifically, by utilizing tools in computational geometry, differential geometry, and numerical optimization, we develop efficient algorithms for quantifying various key geometric features of the skull. We then perform a statistical analysis and discover a strong correlation between skull size and orbit curvature. Based on our findings, we further establish a predictive model that can estimate the orbit curvature using easily obtainable linear skull measurements. Our results show that the predictive model is highly effective and is capable of explaining 85.48\\% of the variance (R-squared) in curvature with an average prediction error of only 6.35\\%. Altogether, our work provides a quantitative foundation for understanding the functional and evolutionary pressures that shape avian skulls, thereby offering a validated framework for future studies in comparative anatomy and evolutionary biology.",

Finally, these multi-modal data are utilized for the DTI task through an output network. The experimental results indicate that LLM$^3$-DTI can proficiently identify validated DTIs, surpassing the performance of the models employed for comparison across diverse scenarios.

    "abstract": "Forces transmitted by bones are routinely studied in human biomechanics, but it is challenging to measure them non-invasively, especially outside of the laboratory setting. We introduce a technique for non-invasive, in vivo measurement of tibial compression force using flexural waves propagating in the tibia. Modeling the tibia as an axially compressed Euler-Bernoulli beam, we show that tibial flexural waves have load-dependent frequency spectra. Specifically, under physiological conditions, peak locations in the acceleration amplitude spectrum shift linearly with the compression force on the tibia, and may be used as proxy force measure. We test the validity of this technique using a proof-of-principle wearable system that generates flexural waves via a skin-mounted mechanical transducer and measures the spectra of these waves using a skin-mounted accelerometer. In agreement with beam theory, data from three participants demonstrate linear relationships between tibial compression force and peak frequency location with Pearson correlation coefficients $r=0.88$--$0.97$ for medial-lateral swaying and $r=0.88$--$0.95$ for walking trials. Our flexural wave-based technique could give rise to a new class of wearable sensors for non-invasive physiological load monitoring and measurement, impacting research in human locomotion, sports medicine, and prosthetic design.",

    "abstract": "Menopause reshapes female physiology, yet its full temporal footprint is obscured by uncertainty in the age of the final menstrual period (FMP). Here we analyse cross-sectional data on 300 million laboratory tests from more than a million women in two population-scale cohorts (Israel-Clalit and US-NHANES). We apply a deconvolution algorithm inspired by astronomical image \"de-blurring\" to align each test to time-from-FMP rather than chronological age. Nearly every assay - spanning endocrine, bone, hepatic, lipid, osmolality, inflammatory and muscular systems - exhibits a jump at FMP that is absent in males and highly concordant between cohorts. Jumps were largest in the sex hormones, followed by bone, toxins, red blood cells, liver, iron, lipids, kidney, and muscle. Changes are mostly detrimental except iron indices and anemia that improve post-menopause, and depression scores that spike only transiently. Hormone-replacement therapy attenuates many of the step-like changes. Sex hormone dysregulation occurs more than 10 years prior to FMP. These findings reveal the step-like dysregulation across physiology caused by loss of sex hormones and establish deconvolution as a general strategy for disentangling age-related transitions in large, noisy datasets.",

    "abstract": "Accurate prediction of protein-ligand binding affinity plays a pivotal role in accelerating the discovery of novel drugs and vaccines, particularly for gastrointestinal (GI) diseases such as gastric ulcers, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis. Traditional computational models often rely on structural information alone and thus fail to capture the genetic determinants that influence disease mechanisms and therapeutic responses. To address this gap, we propose GastroDL-Fusion, a dual-modal deep learning framework that integrates protein-ligand complex data with disease-associated gene sequence information for drug and vaccine development. In our approach, protein-ligand complexes are represented as molecular graphs and modeled using a Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN), while gene sequences are encoded into biologically meaningful embeddings via a pre-trained Transformer (ProtBERT/ESM). These complementary modalities are fused through a multi-layer perceptron to enable robust cross-modal interaction learning. We evaluate the model on benchmark datasets of GI disease-related targets, demonstrating that GastroDL-Fusion significantly improves predictive performance over conventional methods. Specifically, the model achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.12 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.75, outperforming CNN, BiLSTM, GIN, and Transformer-only baselines. These results confirm that incorporating both structural and genetic features yields more accurate predictions of binding affinities, providing a reliable computational tool for accelerating the design of targeted therapies and vaccines in the context of gastrointestinal diseases.",

    "abstract": "Transformer-based deep learning models have shown promise for disease risk prediction using electronic health records(EHRs), but modeling temporal dependencies remains a key challenge due to irregular visit intervals and lack of uniform structure. We propose a Bi-Positional Embedding Transformer Encoder or BiPETE for single-disease prediction, which integrates rotary positional embeddings to encode relative visit timing and sinusoidal embeddings to preserve visit order. Without relying on large-scale pretraining, BiPETE is trained on EHR data from two mental health cohorts-depressive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-to predict the risk of alcohol and substance use disorders (ASUD). BiPETE outperforms baseline models, improving the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) by 34% and 50% in the depression and PTSD cohorts, respectively. An ablation study further confirms the effectiveness of the dual positional encoding strategy. We apply the Integrated Gradients method to interpret model predictions, identifying key clinical features associated with ASUD risk and protection, such as abnormal inflammatory, hematologic, and metabolic markers, as well as specific medications and comorbidities. Overall, these key clinical features identified by the attribution methods contribute to a deeper understanding of the risk assessment process and offer valuable clues for mitigating potential risks. In summary, our study presents a practical and interpretable framework for disease risk prediction using EHR data, which can achieve strong performance.",

    "abstract": "Determining the binding pose of a ligand to a protein, known as molecular docking, is a fundamental task in drug discovery. Generative approaches promise faster, improved, and more diverse pose sampling than physics-based methods, but are often hindered by chemically implausible outputs, poor generalisability, and high computational cost. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel fragmentation scheme, leveraging inductive biases from structural chemistry, to decompose ligands into rigid-body fragments. Building on this decomposition, we present SigmaDock, an SE(3) Riemannian diffusion model that generates poses by learning to reassemble these rigid bodies within the binding pocket. By operating at the level of fragments in SE(3), SigmaDock exploits well-established geometric priors while avoiding overly complex diffusion processes and unstable training dynamics. Experimentally, we show SigmaDock achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching Top-1 success rates (RMSD<2 & PB-valid) above 79.9% on the PoseBusters set, compared to 12.7-30.8% reported by recent deep learning approaches, whilst demonstrating consistent generalisation to unseen proteins. SigmaDock is the first deep learning approach to surpass classical physics-based docking under the PB train-test split, marking a significant leap forward in the reliability and feasibility of deep learning for molecular modelling.",

    "abstract": "The classification of diabetes and prediabetes by static glucose thresholds obscures the pathophysiological dysglycemia heterogeneity, primarily driven by insulin resistance (IR), beta-cell dysfunction, and incretin deficiency. This review demonstrates that continuous glucose monitoring and wearable technologies enable a paradigm shift towards non-invasive, dynamic metabolic phenotyping. We show evidence that machine learning models can leverage high-resolution glucose data from at-home, CGM-enabled oral glucose tolerance tests to accurately predict gold-standard measures of muscle IR and beta-cell function. This personalized characterization extends to real-world nutrition, where an individual's unique postprandial glycemic response (PPGR) to standardized meals, such as the relative glucose spike to potatoes versus grapes, could serve as a biomarker for their metabolic subtype. Moreover, integrating wearable data reveals that habitual diet, sleep, and physical activity patterns, particularly their timing, are uniquely associated with specific metabolic dysfunctions, informing precision lifestyle interventions. The efficacy of dietary mitigators in attenuating PPGR is also shown to be phenotype-dependent. Collectively, this evidence demonstrates that CGM can deconstruct the complexity of early dysglycemia into distinct, actionable subphenotypes. This approach moves beyond simple glycemic control, paving the way for targeted nutritional, behavioral, and pharmacological strategies tailored to an individual's core metabolic defects, thereby paving the way for a new era of precision diabetes prevention.",

    "abstract": "Accurate and efficient registration of whole slide images (WSIs) is essential for high-resolution, nuclei-level analysis in multi-stained tissue slides. We propose a novel coarse-to-fine framework CORE for accurate nuclei-level registration across diverse multimodal whole-slide image (WSI) datasets. The coarse registration stage leverages prompt-based tissue mask extraction to effectively filter out artefacts and non-tissue regions, followed by global alignment using tissue morphology and ac- celerated dense feature matching with a pre-trained feature extractor. From the coarsely aligned slides, nuclei centroids are detected and subjected to fine-grained rigid registration using a custom, shape-aware point-set registration model. Finally, non-rigid alignment at the cellular level is achieved by estimating a non-linear dis- placement field using Coherent Point Drift (CPD). Our approach benefits from automatically generated nuclei that enhance the accuracy of deformable registra- tion and ensure precise nuclei-level correspondence across modalities. The pro- posed model is evaluated on three publicly available WSI registration datasets, and two private datasets. We show that CORE outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in terms of generalisability, precision, and robustness in bright-field and immunofluorescence microscopy WSIs",

    "title": "SILVI: Simple Interface for Labeling Video Interactions",
    "abstract": "Computer vision methods are increasingly used for the automated analysis of large volumes of video data collected through camera traps, drones, or direct observations of animals in the wild. While recent advances have focused primarily on detecting individual actions, much less work has addressed the detection and annotation of interactions -- a crucial aspect for understanding social and individualized animal behavior. Existing open-source annotation tools support either behavioral labeling without localization of individuals, or localization without the capacity to capture interactions. To bridge this gap, we present SILVI, an open-source labeling software that integrates both functionalities. SILVI enables researchers to annotate behaviors and interactions directly within video data, generating structured outputs suitable for training and validating computer vision models. By linking behavioral ecology with computer vision, SILVI facilitates the development of automated approaches for fine-grained behavioral analyses. Although developed primarily in the context of animal behavior, SILVI could be useful more broadly to annotate human interactions in other videos that require extracting dynamic scene graphs. The software, along with documentation and download instructions, is available at: https://gitlab.gwdg.de/kanbertay/interaction-labelling-app.",

    "abstract": "Medical image labels are often organized by taxonomies (e.g., organ - tissue - subtype), yet standard self-supervised learning (SSL) ignores this structure. We present a hierarchy-preserving contrastive framework that makes the label tree a first-class training signal and an evaluation target. Our approach introduces two plug-in objectives: Hierarchy-Weighted Contrastive (HWC), which scales positive/negative pair strengths by shared ancestors to promote within-parent coherence, and Level-Aware Margin (LAM), a prototype margin that separates ancestor groups across levels. The formulation is geometry-agnostic and applies to Euclidean and hyperbolic embeddings without architectural changes. Across several benchmarks, including breast histopathology, the proposed objectives consistently improve representation quality over strong SSL baselines while better respecting the taxonomy. We evaluate with metrics tailored to hierarchy faithfulness: HF1 (hierarchical F1), H-Acc (tree-distance-weighted accuracy), and parent-distance violation rate. We also report top-1 accuracy for completeness. Ablations show that HWC and LAM are effective even without curvature, and combining them yields the most taxonomy-aligned representations. Taken together, these results provide a simple, general recipe for learning medical image representations that respect the label tree and advance both performance and interpretability in hierarchy-rich domains.",

    "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is intrinsically heterogeneous, and typical clinical outcome measures like the Glasgow Coma Scale complicate this diversity. The large variability in severity and patient outcomes render it difficult to link structural damage to functional deficits. The Federal Interagency Traumatic Brain Injury Research (FITBIR) repository contains large-scale multi-site magnetic resonance imaging data of varying resolutions and acquisition parameters (25 shared studies with 7,693 sessions that have age, sex and TBI status defined - 5,811 TBI and 1,882 controls). To reveal shared pathways of injury of TBI through imaging, we analyzed T1-weighted images from these sessions by first harmonizing to a local dataset and segmenting 132 regions of interest (ROIs) in the brain. After running quality assurance, calculating the volumes of the ROIs, and removing outliers, we calculated the z-scores of volumes for all participants relative to the mean and standard deviation of the controls. We regressed out sex, age, and total brain volume with a multivariate linear regression, and we found significant differences in 37 ROIs between subjects with TBI and controls (p < 0.05 with independent t-tests with false discovery rate correction). We found that differences originated in 1) the brainstem, occipital pole and structures posterior to the orbit, 2) subcortical gray matter and insular cortex, and 3) cerebral and cerebellar white matter using independent component analysis and clustering the component loadings of those with TBI.",

    "abstract": "Ovarian cancer remains one of the most lethal gynecological malignancies, largely due to late diagnosis and extensive heterogeneity across subtypes. Current diagnostic methods are limited in their ability to reveal underlying genomic variations essential for precision oncology. This study introduces a novel hybrid deep learning pipeline that integrates quantitative nuclear morphometry with deep convolutional image features to perform ovarian cancer subtype classification and gene mutation inference directly from Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) histopathological images. Using $\\sim45,000$ image patches sourced from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and public datasets, a fusion model combining a ResNet-50 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) encoder and a Vision Transformer (ViT) was developed. This model successfully captured both local morphological texture and global tissue context. The pipeline achieved a robust overall subtype classification accuracy of $84.2\\%$ (Macro AUC of $0.87 \\pm 0.03$). Crucially, the model demonstrated the capacity for gene mutation inference with moderate-to-high accuracy: $AUC_{TP53} = 0.82 \\pm 0.02$, $AUC_{BRCA1} = 0.76 \\pm 0.04$, and $AUC_{ARID1A} = 0.73 \\pm 0.05$. Feature importance analysis established direct quantitative links, revealing that nuclear solidity and eccentricity were the dominant predictors for TP53 mutation. These findings validate that quantifiable histological phenotypes encode measurable genomic signals, paving the way for cost-effective, precision histopathology in ovarian cancer triage and diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Computational antibody design holds immense promise for therapeutic discovery, yet existing generative models are fundamentally limited by two core challenges: (i) a lack of dynamical consistency, which yields physically implausible structures, and (ii) poor generalization due to data scarcity and structural bias. We introduce FP-AbDiff, the first antibody generator to enforce Fokker-Planck Equation (FPE) physics along the entire generative trajectory. Our method minimizes a novel FPE residual loss over the mixed manifold of CDR geometries (R^3 x SO(3)), compelling locally-learned denoising scores to assemble into a globally coherent probability flow. This physics-informed regularizer is synergistically integrated with deep biological priors within a state-of-the-art SE(3)-equivariant diffusion framework. Rigorous evaluation on the RAbD benchmark confirms that FP-AbDiff establishes a new state-of-the-art. In de novo CDR-H3 design, it achieves a mean Root Mean Square Deviation of 0.99 Å when superposing on the variable region, a 25% improvement over the previous state-of-the-art model, AbX, and the highest reported Contact Amino Acid Recovery of 39.91%. This superiority is underscored in the more challenging six-CDR co-design task, where our model delivers consistently superior geometric precision, cutting the average full-chain Root Mean Square Deviation by ~15%, and crucially, achieves the highest full-chain Amino Acid Recovery on the functionally dominant CDR-H3 loop (45.67%). By aligning generative dynamics with physical laws, FP-AbDiff enhances robustness and generalizability, establishing a principled approach for physically faithful and functionally viable antibody design.",

    "abstract": "Fingerprint analysis and fingerprint identification have been the most widely used tools for human identification. To this day, various models have been proposed to explain how fingerprints are formed, ranging from the fibroblast model, which focuses on cell-collagen interactions, to the buckling of thin layers model, both yielding significant results. In this work, we present a reaction-diffusion model of Schnakenberg type, featuring an anisotropic diffusion matrix that follows the ridge orientations supplied by other traditional fingerprint-generation models, and notably yet allows minutiae -- i.e. characteristic microstructures embedded in fingerprints -- to emerge. The statistical analysis of the minutiae distribution in a randomly generated fingerprint collection is consistent with observations in real fingerprints. The model can numerically generate fingerprint-like patterns corresponding to the four basic classifications -- arches, ulnar loops, radial loops, and whorls -- as well as a variety of derived forms. The generated patterns emerge on a convex domain that mimics the geometry of a fingertip, exhibiting the diverse types of minutiae typically analyzed in fingerprint identification and showing strong agreement with those observed in human fingerprints. This model also provides insight into how levels of certainty in human identification can be achieved when based on minutiae positions. All the algorithms are implemented in an open source software named GenCHSin.",

    "abstract": "EEG-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) frequently face spatial specificity limitations in detecting single-trial P300 potentials, a neurophysiological hallmark leveraged for both BCI control and neurodegenerative disease diagnostics. We present a novel framework combining eLORETA source localization with cross-subject functional connectivity to identify stable regions of interest (ROIs) across sessions. Analyzing 62-channel EEG data from 31 subjects (63 sessions, 2,520 trials), we demonstrate that phase-lagged connectivity metrics can reliably isolate task-relevant hubs in deeper cortical-subcortical structures like the insula and parietal regions - critical for Alzheimer's disease biomarkers. By integrating spatially stable ROIs with dynamic temporal agreement, our hybrid classification systematically outperforms whole-brain approaches in different frequency bands (up to 5.4% depending on the connectivity method and the spectral range) while maintaining millisecond-level temporal precision.   To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to establish cross-subject ROI consensus through source-space connectivity, bypassing scalp EEG's depth constraints to probe Alzheimer's-relevant networks. The framework's robustness to noise and compatibility with portable systems offer significant potential for global deployment in early neurodegenerative disease detection. Future integration of individualized anatomical data or adaptive parameter optimization could refine this tool for clinical deployment, enhancing the current max accuracy of 81.57% in the 1-15 Hz range.",

In this work, we used data on monoculture growth capabilities, interactions with other species, and phylogeny to predict a negative or positive effect of interactions. More precisely, we used one of the largest available pairwise interaction datasets to train our models, comprising over 7,500 interactions be- tween 20 species from two taxonomic groups co-cultured under 40 distinct carbon conditions, with a primary focus on the work of Nestor et al.[28 ]. In this work, we propose Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as a powerful classifier to predict the direction of the effect. We construct edge-graphs of pairwise microbial interactions in order to leverage shared information across individual co-culture experiments, and use GNNs to predict modes of interaction. Our model can not only predict binary interactions (positive/negative) but also classify more complex interaction types such as mutualism, competition, and parasitism. Our initial results were encouraging, achieving an F1-score of 80.44%. This significantly outperforms comparable methods in the literature, including conventional Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) models, which reported an F1-score of 72.76%.",

Focusing on the hippocampus, we construct a principal surface that captures the spatial distribution and morphological changes of tau pathology. By projecting voxels onto this surface, we quantify tau coverage, intensity, and thickness through bidirectional projection distances and interpolated standardized uptake value ratios (SUVR). This low-dimensional embedding preserves spatial specificity while mitigating multiple comparison issues. Covariate effects are analyzed using a two-stage regression model with inverse probability weighting to adjust for signal sparsity and selection bias. Using the SuStaIn model, we identify subtypes and stages of AD, revealing distinct tau dynamics: the limbic-predominant subtype shows age-related nonlinear accumulation in coverage and thickness, whereas the posterior subtype exhibits uniform SUVR increases across disease progression. Model-based predictions show that hippocampal tau deposition follows a structured spatial trajectory expanding bidirectionally with increasing thickness, while subtype differences highlight posterior hippocampal involvement consistent with whole-brain patterns. Finally, directional signal patterns on the principal surface reveal contamination from the choroid plexus, demonstrating the broader applicability of the proposed framework across modalities including amyloid PET.",

Standard correction methods reweight posterior probabilities to adjust prior bias, yet their benefit is inconsistent. We developed a reliability framework identifying when prior correction helps or harms performance in pathological cell image analysis. Methods: We analyzed 303 colorectal cancer specimens with CD103/CD8 immunostaining, yielding 185,432 annotated cell images across 16 cell types. ResNet models were trained under varying bias ratios (1.1-20$\\times$). Feature separability was quantified using cosine similarity-based likelihood quality scores, reflecting intra- versus inter-class distinctions in learned feature spaces. Multiple linear regression, ANOVA, and generalized additive models (GAMs) evaluated associations among feature separability, prior bias, sample adequacy, and F1 performance. Results: Feature separability dominated performance ($β= 1.650$, $p < 0.001$), showing 412-fold stronger impact than prior bias ($β= 0.004$, $p = 0.018$). GAM analysis showed strong predictive power ($R^2 = 0.876$) with mostly linear trends. A quality threshold of 0.294 effectively identified cases requiring correction (AUC = 0.610). Cell types scoring $>0.5$ were robust without correction, whereas those $<0.3$ consistently required adjustment. Conclusion: Feature extraction quality, not bias magnitude, governs correction benefit. The proposed framework provides quantitative guidance for selective correction, enabling efficient deployment and reliable diagnostic AI.",

However, manual identification of capture phases is time-intensive, often requiring several days for expert reviewers to annotate the data due to the need for domain-specific interpretation of complex signal patterns. To address this, a lightweight one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN) was developed and trained to detect capture phases in down-sampled signal windows. Evaluated against CNN-LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) hybrids, histogram-based classifiers, and other CNN variants using run-level data splits, our best model, CaptureNet-Deep, achieved an F1 score of 0.94 and precision of 93.39% on held-out test data. The model supports low-latency inference and is integrated into a dashboard for Oxford Nanopore experiments, reducing the total analysis time from several days to under thirty minutes. These results show that efficient, real-time capture detection is possible using simple, interpretable architectures and suggest a broader role for lightweight ML models in sequencing workflows.",

    "abstract": "The key to successful drug design lies in the correct comprehension of protein-ligand interactions. Within the current knowledge paragm, these interactions can be described from both thermodynamic and kinetic perspectives. In recent years, many deep learning models have emerged for predicting the thermodynamic properties of protein-ligand interactions. However, there is currently no mature model for predicting kinetic properties, primarily due to lack of kinetic data. To tackle this problem, we have developed a graph neural network model called STELLAR-koff (Structure-based TransfEr Learning for Ligand Activity Regression) to predict protein-ligand dissociation rate constant. Unlike traditional protein-ligand property prediction models, which typically use a single complex conformation as input, STELLAR-koff employs transfer learning to transform multiple ligand conformations within the protein into a protein ligand interaction landscape, and uses this landscape as the primary input for the model. In addition, we expanded the PDBbind koff dataset from 680 to 1,197 entries and employed the augmented dataset for model training and testing. When tested through five-fold cross-validation, STELLAR-koff achieved Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.729 surpassing or being on pair with most of the published prediction methods. Tested on external set, STELLAR-koff demonstrated strong predictive performance on unseen protein, achieving a Pearson of 0.838 on the focal adhesion kinase in particular. Experimental validation on cyclin-dependent kinase also demonstrated the effectiveness of STELLAR-koff in real drug discovering scenarios. We believe this study provides an effective tool for predicting protein-ligand dissociation rate constant and offers new insight for the future development of this field.",

We introduce NicheFlow, a flow-based generative model that infers the temporal trajectory of cellular microenvironments across sequential spatial slides.

The challenge lies in accessing data in spatiotemporal scales across orders of magnitude, which is necessary for reliably extracting a power-law scaling. Differential dynamic microscopy has been shown to be a powerful method that allows one to acquire statistics of cell motion across scales, which is a potentially versatile method for detecting Lévy walks in biological systems. In this article, we extend the differential dynamic microscopy method to self-propelled Lévy particles, whose run-time distribution has a algebraic tail. We validate our protocol using synthetic imaging data and show that a reliable detection of active Lévy particles requires accessing length scales of one order of magnitude larger than its persistence length. Applying the protocol to experimental data of E. coli and E. gracilis, we find that E. coli does not exhibit a signature of Lévy walks, while E. gracilis is better described as active Lévy particles.",

In particular, the ability to learn mathematical models from data would benefit systems biology, where the complex nature of these systems often makes a bottom up approach to modeling unfeasible. In recent years, sparse estimation techniques have gained prominence in system identification, primarily using parametric paradigms to efficiently capture system dynamics with minimal model complexity. In particular, the Sindy algorithm has successfully used sparsity to estimate nonlinear systems by extracting from a library of functions only a few key terms needed to capture the dynamics of these systems. However, parametric models often fall short in accurately representing certain nonlinearities inherent in complex systems. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel framework that integrates sparse parametric estimation with nonparametric techniques. It captures nonlinearities that Sindy cannot describe without requiring a priori information about their functional form. That is, without expanding the library of functions to include the one that is trying to be discovered. We illustrate our approach on several examples related to estimation of complex biological phenomena.",

Tumor-immune interactions play a crucial role in cancer biology, influencing tumor progression and the effectiveness of immunotherapy and targeted treatments.

Mathematical models that incorporate tumor-immune interactions offer valuable insights into these processes, providing a framework for analyzing immune escape, treatment response, and resistance mechanisms. In this review, we provide an overview of mathematical models that describe tumor-immune dynamics, highlighting their applications in understanding tumor growth, evaluating treatment strategies, and predicting immune responses. We also discuss the strengths and limitations of current modeling approaches and propose future directions for the development of more comprehensive and predictive models of tumor-immune interactions.

We investigate this using the model system, Euprymna scolopes, the Hawaiian Bobtail Squid, and its bioluminescent symbiont, Vibrio fischeri, which enables the squid to camouflage itself through counter-illumination. Successful colonisation of the squid by V. fischeri must occur hours after hatching and is mediated by fluid flow due to respiration within the squid mantle cavity. To study this process, we develop a mathematical model using the Method of Regularised Stokeslets to simulate the flow and resulting bacterial trajectories within the squid. We explore how thermal stress, mediated by physiological changes in respiration, ciliary dynamics, and internal geometry, affects this early colonisation by analysing the time bacteria spend in regions crucial to the establishment of symbiosis in these simulations. A variance-based sensitivity analysis of physiologically relevant parameters on these metrics demonstrates that changes in the breath cycle significantly impact and reduce the time bacteria spend in the critical zone within the squid, hindering colonisation.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have emerged as a leading framework in generative modeling, poised to transform the traditionally slow and costly process of drug discovery. This review provides a systematic comparison of their application in designing two principal therapeutic modalities: small molecules and therapeutic peptides. We dissect how the unified framework of iterative denoising is adapted to the distinct molecular representations, chemical spaces, and design objectives of each modality. For small molecules, these models excel at structure-based design, generating novel, pocket-fitting ligands with desired physicochemical properties, yet face the critical hurdle of ensuring chemical synthesizability. Conversely, for therapeutic peptides, the focus shifts to generating functional sequences and designing de novo structures, where the primary challenges are achieving biological stability against proteolysis, ensuring proper folding, and minimizing immunogenicity. Despite these distinct challenges, both domains face shared hurdles: the scarcity of high-quality experimental data, the reliance on inaccurate scoring functions for validation, and the crucial need for experimental validation. We conclude that the full potential of diffusion models will be unlocked by bridging these modality-specific gaps and integrating them into automated, closed-loop Design-Build-Test-Learn (DBTL) platforms, thereby shifting the paradigm from mere chemical exploration to the on-demand engineering of novel~therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "In control problems and basic scientific modeling, it is important to compare observations with dynamical simulations. For example, comparing two neural systems can shed light on the nature of emergent computations in the brain and deep neural networks. Recently, Ostrow et al. (2023) introduced Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA), a method to measure the similarity of two systems based on their recurrent dynamics rather than geometry or topology. However, DSA does not consider how inputs affect the dynamics, meaning that two similar systems, if driven differently, may be classified as different. Because real-world dynamical systems are rarely autonomous, it is important to account for the effects of input drive. To this end, we introduce a novel metric for comparing both intrinsic (recurrent) and input-driven dynamics, called InputDSA (iDSA). InputDSA extends the DSA framework by estimating and comparing both input and intrinsic dynamic operators using a variant of Dynamic Mode Decomposition with control (DMDc) based on subspace identification. We demonstrate that InputDSA can successfully compare partially observed, input-driven systems from noisy data. We show that when the true inputs are unknown, surrogate inputs can be substituted without a major deterioration in similarity estimates. We apply InputDSA on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) trained with Deep Reinforcement Learning, identifying that high-performing networks are dynamically similar to one another, while low-performing networks are more diverse. Lastly, we apply InputDSA to neural data recorded from rats performing a cognitive task, demonstrating that it identifies a transition from input-driven evidence accumulation to intrinsically-driven decision-making. Our work demonstrates that InputDSA is a robust and efficient method for comparing intrinsic dynamics and the effect of external input on dynamical systems.",

    "abstract": "Collective behaviors in cellular systems are regulated not only by biochemical signalling pathways but also by intercellular mechanical forces, whose quantification in contractile monolayers remains poorly understood. Here, by integrating traction force microscopy and numerical simulations, we reconstruct the stress distribution in C2C12 myoblast monolayers to reveal the roles of local mechanical forces in determining the collective cellular structures. We find that contractile monolayers exhibit positive maximum and negative minimum principal stresses, reflecting the intrinsic anisotropy of active tension. Distinct stress patterns emerge around topological defects, coinciding with singularities in cell alignment, density, and morphology, indicating a strong coupling between mechanical forces and structural organization. Moreover, tensile stresses are preferentially transmitted along the cell elongation axis and compressive stresses transversely, demonstrating that local stress guides cell arrangement. This mechanical guidance appears to be universal among contractile systems, as observed also in bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells. Together, our work establishes a quantitative framework for characterizing mechanical anisotropy in active cellular monolayers and reveals a general principle of force-structure coupling, providing a physical basis for understanding how mechanics governs myogenesis, morphogenesis, and collective organization in contractile cellular systems.",

    "abstract": "Traditional non-biological storage media, such as hard drives, face limitations in both storage density and lifespan due to the rapid growth of data in the big data era. Mirror-image peptides composed of D-amino acids have emerged as a promising biological storage medium due to their high storage density, structural stability, and long lifespan. The sequencing of mirror-image peptides relies on \\textit{de-novo} technology. However, its accuracy is limited by the scarcity of tandem mass spectrometry datasets and the challenges that current algorithms encounter when processing these peptides directly. This study is the first to propose improving sequencing accuracy indirectly by optimizing the design of mirror-image peptide sequences. In this work, we introduce DBond, a deep neural network based model that integrates sequence features, precursor ion properties, and mass spectrometry environmental factors for the prediction of mirror-image peptide bond cleavage. In this process, sequences with a high peptide bond cleavage ratio, which are easy to sequence, are selected. The main contributions of this study are as follows. First, we constructed MiPD513, a tandem mass spectrometry dataset containing 513 mirror-image peptides. Second, we developed the peptide bond cleavage labeling algorithm (PBCLA), which generated approximately 12.5 million labeled data based on MiPD513. Third, we proposed a dual prediction strategy that combines multi-label and single-label classification. On an independent test set, the single-label classification strategy outperformed other methods in both single and multiple peptide bond cleavage prediction tasks, offering a strong foundation for sequence optimization.",

    "abstract": "Diabetic retinopathy (DR), a microvascular complication of diabetes and a leading cause of preventable blindness, is projected to affect more than 130 million individuals worldwide by 2030. Early identification is essential to reduce irreversible vision loss, yet current diagnostic workflows rely on methods such as fundus photography and expert review, which remain costly and resource-intensive. This, combined with DR's asymptomatic nature, results in its underdiagnosis rate of approximately 25 percent. Although convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated strong performance in medical imaging tasks, limited interpretability and the absence of uncertainty quantification restrict clinical reliability. Therefore, in this study, a deep ensemble learning framework integrated with uncertainty estimation is introduced to improve robustness, transparency, and scalability in DR detection. The ensemble incorporates seven CNN architectures-ResNet-50, DenseNet-121, MobileNetV3 (Small and Large), and EfficientNet (B0, B2, B3)- whose outputs are fused through an accuracy-weighted majority voting strategy. A probability-weighted entropy metric quantifies prediction uncertainty, enabling low-confidence samples to be excluded or flagged for additional review. Training and validation on 35,000 EyePACS retinal fundus images produced an unfiltered accuracy of 93.70 percent (F1 = 0.9376). Uncertainty-filtering later was conducted to remove unconfident samples, resulting in maximum-accuracy of 99.44 percent (F1 = 0.9932). The framework shows that uncertainty-aware, accuracy-weighted ensembling improves reliability without hindering performance. With confidence-calibrated outputs and a tunable accuracy-coverage trade-off, it offers a generalizable paradigm for deploying trustworthy AI diagnostics in high-risk care.",

    "abstract": "Mapping habitat quality, based on factors like host availability and environmental suitability, is a common approach to determining which locations are important for the spread of a species. Mapping habitat connectivity takes geographic analyses a step further, evaluating the potential roles of locations in biological invasions, pandemics, or species conservation. Locations with high habitat quality may play a minor role in species spread if they are geographically isolated. Yet, a location with lower habitat quality may play a major role in a species' spread if it acts as a bridge between regions that would otherwise be physically fragmented.   Here we introduce the geohabnet R package, which evaluates the potential importance of locations for the spread of species through habitat landscapes. geohabnet incorporates key factors such as dispersal probabilities and habitat availability in a network framework, for better understanding habitat connectivity for host-dependent species, such as pathogens, arthropod pests, or pollinators.   geohabnet uses publicly available or user-provided datasets, six network centrality metrics, and a user-selected geographic scale. We provide examples using geohabnet for surveillance prioritization of emerging plant pests in Africa and the Americas. These examples illustrate how users can apply geohabnet for their species of interest and generate maps of the estimated importance of geographic locations for species spread.   geohabnet provides a quick, open-source, and reproducible baseline to quantify a species' habitat connectivity across a wide range of geographic scales and evaluates potential scenarios for the expansion of a species through habitat landscapes. geohabnet supports biosecurity programs, invasion science, and conservation biology when prioritizing management efforts for transboundary pathogens, pests, or endangered species.",

    "title": "AI-derived layer-specific OCT biomarkers for classification of geographic atrophy",
    "abstract": "Geographic atrophy (GA) is a key biomarker of dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) traditionally identified through color fundus photography. Hyper-transmission defects (hyperTDs), a feature highly correlated with GA, have recently gained prominence in optical coherence tomography (OCT) research. OCT offers cross-sectional imaging of the retina, leading to the development of the terms complete retinal pigment epithelium and outer retinal atrophy (cRORA) to describe specific patterns of structural degeneration. Within the definitions of cRORA three critical lesions are implicated: inner nuclear layer and outer plexiform layer (INL-OPL) subsidence, ellipsoid zone and retinal pigment epithelium (EZ-RPE) disruption, and hyperTDs. To enable the automated quantification of retinal atrophy progression, we propose an AI-based model that segments INL-OPL subsidence, EZ-RPE disruption, and hyperTDs. Additionally, we developed an algorithm that leverages these segmentation results to distinguish cRORA from hyperTDs in the absence of GA. We evaluated our approach on a comprehensive dataset of eyes with AMD and healthy eyes, achieving mean voxel-level F1-scores of 0.76/0.13 (mean/standard deviation) for INL-OPL subsidence, 0.64/0.15 for EZ-RPE disruption, and 0.69/0.04 for hyperTDs. For distinguishing cRORA from hyperTDs, we achieved an average pixel-level F1-score of 0.80/0.12 for segment cRORA from hyperTDs. This method demonstrates significant advances in the quantitative analysis of retinal atrophy, offering a promising tool for improved AMD diagnosis and disease progression monitoring.",

Here, we investigate whether global patterns of gray-matter microstructure can be captured through neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) and whether such patterns are predictive of cognitive performance. Our findings demonstrate that PCA-based global indicators of gray-matter microstructure provide complementary markers of structure-function relationships, extending beyond region-specific analyses. Our results suggest that general microstructure factors may serve as robust, interpretable biomarkers for studying cognition and cortical organization at the population level. Using diffusion MRI and behavioral data from the Human Connectome Project Young Adult study, we derived region-averaged NODDI parameters and applied principal component analysis (PCA) to construct general gray-matter microstructure factors. We found that the factor derived from isotropic volume fraction explained substantial inter-individual variability and was significantly correlated with specific cognitive scores collected from the NIH Toolbox. In particular, the isotropic volume fraction factor was linked to reading and vocabulary performance and to cognitive fluidity.",

    "abstract": "Accurately predicting the three-dimensional structures of protein-ligand complexes remains a fundamental challenge in computational drug discovery that limits the pace and success of therapeutic design. Deep learning methods have recently shown strong potential as structural prediction tools, achieving promising accuracy across diverse biomolecular systems. However, their performance and utility are constrained by scarce experimental data, inefficient architectures, physically invalid poses, and the limited ability to exploit auxiliary information available at inference. To address these issues, we introduce Pearl (Placing Every Atom in the Right Location), a foundation model for protein-ligand cofolding at scale. Pearl addresses these challenges with three key innovations: (1) training recipes that include large-scale synthetic data to overcome data scarcity; (2) architectures that incorporate an SO(3)-equivariant diffusion module to inherently respect 3D rotational symmetries, improving generalization and sample efficiency, and (3) controllable inference, including a generalized multi-chain templating system supporting both protein and non-polymeric components as well as dual unconditional/conditional modes. Pearl establishes a new state-of-the-art performance in protein-ligand cofolding. On the key metric of generating accurate (RMSD < 2 Å) and physically valid poses, Pearl surpasses AlphaFold 3 and other open source baselines on the public Runs N' Poses and PoseBusters benchmarks, delivering 14.5% and 14.2% improvements, respectively, over the next best model. In the pocket-conditional cofolding regime, Pearl delivers $3.6\\times$ improvement on a proprietary set of challenging, real-world drug targets at the more rigorous RMSD < 1 Å threshold. Finally, we demonstrate that model performance correlates directly with synthetic dataset size used in training.",

By minimizing error across large datasets, most systems deliver strong aggregate accuracy yet falter at the margins: patients with rare variants, multimorbidity, or underrepresented demographics. This average patient fallacy erodes both equity and trust. We propose a different design: a multi-agent ecosystem for N-of-1 decision support. In this environment, agents clustered by organ systems, patient populations, and analytic modalities draw on a shared library of models and evidence synthesis tools. Their results converge in a coordination layer that weighs reliability, uncertainty, and data density before presenting the clinician with a decision-support packet: risk estimates bounded by confidence ranges, outlier flags, and linked evidence. Validation shifts from population averages to individual reliability, measured by error in low-density regions, calibration in the small, and risk--coverage trade-offs. Anticipated challenges include computational demands, automation bias, and regulatory fit, addressed through caching strategies, consensus checks, and adaptive trial frameworks. By moving from monolithic models to orchestrated intelligence, this approach seeks to align medical AI with the first principle of medicine: care that is transparent, equitable, and centered on the individual.",

    "abstract": "Proteins are traditionally optimized through the costly construction and measurement of many mutants. Active Learning-assisted Directed Evolution (ALDE) alleviates that cost by predicting the best improvements and iteratively testing mutants to inform predictions. However, existing ALDE methods face a critical limitation: selecting the highest-predicted mutants in each round yields homogeneous training data insufficient for accurate prediction models in subsequent rounds. Here we present FolDE, an ALDE method designed to maximize end-of-campaign success. In simulations across 20 protein targets, FolDE discovers 23% more top 10% mutants than the best baseline ALDE method (p=0.005) and is 55% more likely to find top 1% mutants. FolDE achieves this primarily through naturalness-based warm-starting, which augments limited activity measurements with protein language model outputs to improve activity prediction. We also introduce a constant-liar batch selector, which improves batch diversity; this is important in multi-mutation campaigns but had limited effect in our benchmarks. The complete workflow is freely available as open-source software, making efficient protein optimization accessible to any laboratory.",

    "title": "CT-Less Attenuation Correction Using Multiview Ensemble Conditional Diffusion Model on High-Resolution Uncorrected PET Images",
    "abstract": "Accurate quantification in positron emission tomography (PET) is essential for accurate diagnostic results and effective treatment tracking. A major issue encountered in PET imaging is attenuation. Attenuation refers to the diminution of photon detected as they traverse biological tissues before reaching detectors. When such corrections are absent or inadequate, this signal degradation can introduce inaccurate quantification, making it difficult to differentiate benign from malignant conditions, and can potentially lead to misdiagnosis. Typically, this correction is done with co-computed Computed Tomography (CT) imaging to obtain structural data for calculating photon attenuation across the body. However, this methodology subjects patients to extra ionizing radiation exposure, suffers from potential spatial misregistration between PET/CT imaging sequences, and demands costly equipment infrastructure. Emerging advances in neural network architectures present an alternative approach via synthetic CT image synthesis. Our investigation reveals that Conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) can generate high quality CT images from non attenuation corrected PET images in order to correct attenuation. By utilizing all three orthogonal views from non-attenuation-corrected PET images, the DDPM approach combined with ensemble voting generates higher quality pseudo-CT images with reduced artifacts and improved slice-to-slice consistency. Results from a study of 159 head scans acquired with the Siemens Biograph Vision PET/CT scanner demonstrate both qualitative and quantitative improvements in pseudo-CT generation. The method achieved a mean absolute error of 32 $\\pm$ 10.4 HU on the CT images and an average error of (1.48 $\\pm$ 0.68)\\% across all regions of interest when comparing PET images reconstructed using the attenuation map of the generated pseudo-CT versus the true CT.",

Yet there are open directions to incorporate structural information, not only to enhance prediction but also to offer insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms. This chapter provides an overview of these approaches and describes two ML frameworks that integrate structural data (via graph representations) with neural networks to predict properties of antibodies: ANTIPASTI predicts binding affinity (a global property) whereas INFUSSE predicts residue flexibility (a local property). We survey the principles underpinning these models; the ways in which they encode structural knowledge; and the strategies that can be used to extract biologically relevant statistical signals that can help discover and disentangle molecular determinants of the properties of interest.",

    "abstract": "Non-invasive colorectal cancer (CRC) screening represents a key opportunity to improve colonoscopy participation rates and reduce CRC mortality. This study explores the potential of the gut-liver axis for predicting colorectal neoplasia through liver-derived radiomic features extracted from routine CT images as a novel opportunistic screening approach. In this retrospective study, we analyzed data from 1,997 patients who underwent colonoscopy and abdominal CT. Patients either had no colorectal neoplasia (n=1,189) or colorectal neoplasia (n_total=808; adenomas n=423, CRC n=385). Radiomics features were extracted from 3D liver segmentations using the Radiomics Processing ToolKit (RPTK), which performed feature extraction, filtering, and classification. The dataset was split into training (n=1,397) and test (n=600) cohorts. Five machine learning models were trained with 5-fold cross-validation on the 20 most informative features, and the best model ensemble was selected based on the validation AUROC. The best radiomics-based XGBoost model achieved a test AUROC of 0.810, clearly outperforming the best clinical-only model (test AUROC: 0.457). Subclassification between colorectal cancer and adenoma showed lower accuracy (test AUROC: 0.674). Our findings establish proof-of-concept that liver-derived radiomics from routine abdominal CT can predict colorectal neoplasia. Beyond offering a pragmatic, widely accessible adjunct to CRC screening, this approach highlights the gut-liver axis as a novel biomarker source for opportunistic screening and sparks new mechanistic hypotheses for future translational research.",

    "abstract": "Accurate protein function prediction requires integrating heterogeneous intrinsic signals (e.g., sequence and structure) with noisy extrinsic contexts (e.g., protein-protein interactions and GO term annotations). However, two key challenges hinder effective fusion: (i) cross-modal distributional mismatch among embeddings produced by pre-trained intrinsic encoders, and (ii) noisy relational graphs of extrinsic data that degrade GNN-based information aggregation. We propose Diffused and Aligned Multi-modal Protein Embedding (DAMPE), a unified framework that addresses these through two core mechanisms. First, we propose Optimal Transport (OT)-based representation alignment that establishes correspondence between intrinsic embedding spaces of different modalities, effectively mitigating cross-modal heterogeneity. Second, we develop a Conditional Graph Generation (CGG)-based information fusion method, where a condition encoder fuses the aligned intrinsic embeddings to provide informative cues for graph reconstruction. Meanwhile, our theoretical analysis implies that the CGG objective drives this condition encoder to absorb graph-aware knowledge into its produced protein representations. Empirically, DAMPE outperforms or matches state-of-the-art methods such as DPFunc on standard GO benchmarks, achieving AUPR gains of 0.002-0.013 pp and Fmax gains 0.004-0.007 pp. Ablation studies further show that OT-based alignment contributes 0.043-0.064 pp AUPR, while CGG-based fusion adds 0.005-0.111 pp Fmax. Overall, DAMPE offers a scalable and theoretically grounded approach for robust multi-modal protein representation learning, substantially enhancing protein function prediction.",

    "abstract": "Prenatal maternal stress (PS) is a risk factor for adverse offspring neurodevelopment. Heart rate variability (HRV) complexity provides a non-invasive marker of maternal autonomic regulation and may be influenced by mind--body interventions such as Yoga. In this quasi-randomized controlled trial, 28 chronically stressed pregnant women were followed from the second trimester until birth: 14 participated in weekly Hatha Yoga with electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings, and 14 received standard obstetric care with monthly ECGs. Group allocation was based on availability, with participants unaware of their assignment at enrollment. HRV complexity was assessed first with Sample Entropy and Entropy Rate and then expanded to 94 HRV metrics spanning temporal, frequency, nonlinear, and information-theoretical domains. All metrics were covariate-adjusted (maternal age, BMI, gestational age), standardized, and analyzed using timepoint-specific principal component analysis (PCA). From this, a unified HRV index was derived. Analyses revealed that HRV metric relationships changed dynamically across pregnancy, with PCA loadings shifting from frequency toward complexity measures in late gestation. The mixed effects model identified a significant time x group interaction effect (p = 0.041). These findings suggest a restructuring of HRV signal-analytical domains with advancing pregnancy attributable to Yoga and highlight the utility of advanced HRV analysis frameworks for future, larger trials.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how creativity is represented in the brain's intrinsic functional architecture remains a central challenge in cognitive neuroscience. While resting-state fMRI studies have revealed large-scale network correlates of creative potential, electroencephalography (EEG) offers a temporally precise and scalable approach to capture the fast oscillatory dynamics that underlie spontaneous neural organization. In this study, we used a data-driven network approach to examine whether resting-state EEG connectivity patterns differentiate individuals according to their creative abilities. Creativity was evaluated by: The Inventory of Creative Activities and Achievements (ICAA), The Divergent Association Task (DAT), The Matchstick Arithmetic Puzzles Task (MAPT) and Self-rating (SR) of creative ability in 30 healthy young adults. Graph-theoretical analyses were applied to functional connectivity matrices and clustered based on graph similarity. Two distinct participant clusters emerged, differing systematically across multiple dimensions of creativity. Cluster 1, characterized by consistently higher performance across multiple creativity variables (ICAA, DAT, MAPT and SR), showed broad alpha-band hypoconnectivity, relatively preserved left frontal connectivity and greater network modularity. Cluster 0, associated with lower creativity scores, exhibited stronger overall connectivity strength, reduced modularity and higher local clustering. These findings suggest that resting-state EEG connectivity patterns can index stable cognitive traits such as creativity. More broadly, they point to an intrinsic neural signature of adaptive brain function marked by efficient yet flexible network organization that may support creative and adaptive cognition.",

    "abstract": "Background: Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD) affects ~33% of U.S. adults and is the most common chronic liver disease. Although often asymptomatic, progression can lead to cirrhosis. Early detection is important, as lifestyle interventions can prevent disease progression. We developed a fair, rigorous, and reproducible MASLD prediction model and compared it to prior methods using a large electronic health record database.   Methods: We evaluated LASSO logistic regression, random forest, XGBoost, and a neural network for MASLD prediction using clinical feature subsets, including the top 10 SHAP-ranked features. To reduce disparities in true positive rates across racial and ethnic subgroups, we applied an equal opportunity postprocessing method.   Results: This study included 59,492 patients in the training data, 24,198 in the validating data, and 25,188 in the testing data. The LASSO logistic regression model with the top 10 features was selected for its interpretability and comparable performance. Before fairness adjustment, the model achieved AUROC of 0.84, accuracy of 78%, sensitivity of 72%, specificity of 79%, and F1-score of 0.617. After equal opportunity postprocessing, accuracy modestly increased to 81% and specificity to 94%, while sensitivity decreased to 41% and F1-score to 0.515, reflecting the fairness trade-off.   Conclusions: We developed the MASER prediction model (MASLD Static EHR Risk Prediction), a LASSO logistic regression model which achieved competitive performance for MASLD prediction (AUROC 0.836, accuracy 77.6%), comparable to previously reported ensemble and tree-based models. Overall, this approach demonstrates that interpretable models can achieve a balance of predictive performance and fairness in diverse patient populations.",

    "abstract": "Chromatin sensitive partial wave spectroscopic (csPWS) microscopy enables label free detection of nanoscale chromatin packing alterations that occur before visible cellular transformation. However, manual nuclear segmentation limits population scale analysis needed for biomarker discovery in early cancer detection. The lack of annotated csPWS imaging data prevents direct use of standard deep learning methods. We present CFU Net, a hierarchical segmentation architecture trained with a three stage curriculum on synthetic multimodal data. CFU Net achieves near perfect performance on held out synthetic test data that represent diverse spectroscopic imaging conditions without manual annotations (Dice 0.9879, IoU 0.9895). Our approach uses physics based rendering that incorporates empirically supported chromatin packing statistics, Mie scattering models, and modality specific noise, combined with a curriculum that progresses from adversarial RGB pretraining to spectroscopic fine tuning and histology validation. CFU Net integrates five architectural elements (ConvNeXt backbone, Feature Pyramid Network, UNet plus plus dense connections, dual attention, and deep supervision) that together improve Dice over a baseline UNet by 8.3 percent. We demonstrate deployment ready INT8 quantization with 74.9 percent compression and 0.15 second inference, giving a 240 times throughput gain over manual analysis. Applied to more than ten thousand automatically segmented nuclei from synthetic test data, the pipeline extracts chromatin biomarkers that distinguish normal from pre cancerous tissue with large effect sizes (Cohens d between 1.31 and 2.98), reaching 94 percent classification accuracy. This work provides a general framework for synthetic to real transfer learning in specialized microscopy and open resources for community validation on clinical specimens.",

Existing approaches for interpreting the resulting three-dimensional volumes are computationally expensive and have difficulty interpreting density associated with small proteins/complexes. To explore alternate approaches for identifying proteins in cryo-ET data we pursued a Graph Network and topologically invariant approach. Here, we report on a fast algorithm that distinguishes volumes containing protein density from noise by searching for nuances of evolutionarily conversed motifs and the geometrical characteristics of protein structure. GRIP-Tomo 2.0 is a machine-learning pipeline that extracts interpretable topological features of protein structures within noisy experimental backgrounds. Compared to version 1.0, the new pipeline includes three upgrades that significantly improve performance including synthetic tomogram generation simulating realistic noise, graph-based persistent feature extraction as protein fingerprints, and high-performance computing acceleration. GRIP-Tomo 2.0 achieves over 90% accuracy in distinguishing proteins from noise for synthetic datasets and over 80% accuracy for real datasets, which represents a foundational step toward advancing cryo-ET workflows and empowering automated detection of both small and large proteins for visual proteomics.",

In this study, we introduce commutative algebra prediction (CAP), which couples persistent Stanley-Reisner theory with advanced sequence embedding for predicting protein-nucleic acid binding affinities. CAP encodes proteins through transformer-learned embeddings that retain long-range evolutionary context and represents DNA and RNA with $\\textit{k}$-mer algebra embeddings derived from persistent facet ideals, which capture fine-scale nucleotide geometry. We demonstrate that CAP surpasses the SVSBI protein-nucleic acid benchmark and, in a further test, maintains reasonable performance on newly curated protein-RNA and protein-nucleic acid datasets. Leveraging only primary sequences, CAP generalizes to any protein-nucleic acid pair with minimal preprocessing, enabling genome-scale analyses without 3D structural data and promising faster virtual screening for drug discovery and protein engineering.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell technologies generate high-dimensional point clouds of cells, enabling detailed characterization of complex patient states and treatment responses. Yet each patient is represented by an irregular point cloud rather than a simple vector, making it difficult to directly quantify and compare biological differences between individuals. Nonlinear methods such as kernels and neural networks achieve predictive accuracy but act as black boxes, offering little biological interpretability.   To address these limitations, we adapt the Linear Optimal Transport (LOT) framework to this setting, embedding irregular point clouds into a fixed-dimensional Euclidean space while preserving distributional structure. This embedding provides a principled linear representation that preserves optimal transport geometry while enabling downstream analysis. It also forms a registration between any two patients, enabling direct comparison of their cellular distributions. Within this space, LOT enables: (i) \\textbf{accurate and interpretable classification} of COVID-19 patient states, where classifier weights map back to specific markers and spatial regions driving predictions; and (ii) \\textbf{synthetic data generation} for patient-derived organoids, exploiting the linearity of the LOT embedding. LOT barycenters yield averaged cellular profiles representing combined conditions or samples, supporting drug interaction testing.   Together, these results establish LOT as a unified framework that bridges predictive performance, interpretability, and generative modeling. By transforming heterogeneous point clouds into structured embeddings directly traceable to the original data, LOT opens new opportunities for understanding immune variation and treatment effects in high-dimensional biological systems.",

Most methods operate on a single graph, typically the minimal free energy (MFE) structure, for low-energy ensembles (conformations) representative of structures at thermodynamic equilibrium. We introduce a thermodynamically parameterized exponential-family random graph (ERGM) embedding that models molecules as Boltzmann-weighted ensembles of interaction graphs. We evaluate this embedding on SELEX datasets, where experimental biases (e.g., PCR amplification or sequencing noise) can obscure true aptamer-ligand affinity, producing anomalous candidates whose observed abundance diverges from their actual binding strength. We show that the proposed embedding enables robust community detection and subgraph-level explanations for aptamer ligand affinity, even in the presence of biased observations. This approach may be used to identify low-abundance aptamer candidates for further experimental evaluation.",

This study evaluates the performance of two foundation models, UNI and Virchow2, as feature extractors for classifying WSIs into three diagnostic categories: melanocytic, basaloid, and squamous lesions. Patch-level embeddings were aggregated into slide-level features using a mean-aggregation strategy and subsequently used to train multiple machine learning classifiers, including logistic regression, gradient-boosted trees, and random forest models. Performance was assessed using precision, recall, true positive rate, false positive rate, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) on the test set. Results demonstrate that patch-level features extracted using Virchow2 outperformed those extracted via UNI across most slide-level classifiers, with logistic regression achieving the highest accuracy (90%) for Virchow2, though the difference was not statistically significant. The study also explored data augmentation techniques and image normalization to enhance model robustness and generalizability. The mean-aggregation approach provided reliable slide-level feature representations. All experimental results and metrics were tracked and visualized using WandB.ai, facilitating reproducibility and interpretability. This research highlights the potential of foundation models for automated WSI classification, providing a scalable and effective approach for dermatopathological diagnosis while paving the way for future advancements in slide-level representation learning.",

    "abstract": "Kinetic modeling enables \\textit{in vivo} quantification of tracer uptake and glucose metabolism in [${}^{18}$F]Fluorodeoxyglucose ([${}^{18}$F]FDG) dynamic positron emission tomography (dPET) imaging of mice. However, kinetic modeling requires the accurate determination of the arterial input function (AIF) during imaging, which is time-consuming and invasive. Recent studies have shown the efficacy of using deep learning to directly predict the input function, surpassing established methods such as the image-derived input function (IDIF). In this work, we trained a physics-informed deep learning-based input function prediction model (PIDLIF) to estimate the AIF directly from the PET images, incorporating a kinetic modeling loss during training. The proposed method uses a two-tissue compartment model over two regions, the myocardium and brain of the mice, and is trained on a dataset of 70 [${}^{18}$F]FDG dPET images of mice accompanied by the measured AIF during imaging. The proposed method had comparable performance to the network without a physics-informed loss, and when sudden movement causing blurring in the images was simulated, the PIDLIF model maintained high performance in severe cases of image degradation. The proposed physics-informed method exhibits an improved robustness that is promoted by physically constraining the problem, enforcing consistency for out-of-distribution samples. In conclusion, the PIDLIF model offers insight into the effects of leveraging physiological distribution mechanics in mice to guide a deep learning-based AIF prediction network in images with severe degradation as a result of blurring due to movement during imaging.",

    "abstract": "While recent sound event detection (SED) systems can identify baleen whale calls in marine audio, challenges related to false positive and minority-class detection persist. We propose the boundary proposal network (BPN), which extends an existing lightweight SED system. The BPN is inspired by work in image object detection and aims to reduce the number of false positive detections. It achieves this by using intermediate latent representations computed within the backbone classification model to gate the final output. When added to an existing SED system, the BPN achieves a 16.8 % absolute increase in precision, as well as 21.3 % and 9.4 % improvements in the F1-score for minority-class d-calls and bp-calls, respectively. We further consider two approaches to the selection of post-processing hyperparameters: a forward-search and a backward-search. By separately optimising event-level and frame-level hyperparameters, these two approaches lead to considerable performance improvements over parameters selected using empirical methods. The complete WhaleVAD-BPN system achieves a cross-validated development F1-score of 0.475, which is a 9.8 % absolute improvement over the baseline.",

    "title": "Predicting Protein-Nucleic Acid Flexibility Using Persistent Sheaf Laplacians",
    "abstract": "Understanding the flexibility of protein-nucleic acid complexes, often characterized by atomic B-factors, is essential for elucidating their structure, dynamics, and functions, such as reactivity and allosteric pathways. Traditional models such as Gaussian Network Models (GNM) and Elastic Network Models (ENM) often fall short in capturing multiscale interactions, especially in large or complex biomolecular systems. In this work, we apply the Persistent Sheaf Laplacian (PSL) framework for the B-factor prediction of protein-nucleic acid complexes. The PSL model integrates multiscale analysis, algebraic topology, combinatoric Laplacians, and sheaf theory for data representation. It reveals topological invariants in its harmonic spectra and captures the homotopic shape evolution of data with its non-harmonic spectra. Its localization enables accurate B-factor predictions. We benchmark our method on three diverse datasets, including protein-RNA and nucleic-acid-only structures, and demonstrate that PSL consistently outperforms existing models such as GNM and multiscale FRI (mFRI), achieving up to a 21% improvement in Pearson correlation coefficient for B-factor prediction. These results highlight the robustness and adaptability of PSL in modeling complex biomolecular interactions and suggest its potential utility in broader applications such as mutation impact analysis and drug design.",

    "abstract": "Accurate measures of musculoskeletal forces are critical for clinicians, biomechanists, and engineers, yet direct measurement is highly invasive and current estimation methods remain limited in accuracy. Here, we demonstrate the application of ultra-wideband radar to non-invasively estimate musculoskeletal forces by measuring changes in the electromagnetic properties of contracting muscles, in muscles with different structural properties, during various static and dynamic conditions, and in the presence of fatigue. First, we show that ultra-wideband radar scans of muscle can reliably track isometric force in a unipennate knee extensor (vastus lateralis) and a bipennate ankle dorsiflexor (tibialis anterior). Next, we integrate radar signals within machine-learning and linear models to estimate musculoskeletal forces during fatiguing isometric, and dynamic knee extension contractions, with exceptional accuracy (test R2>0.984; errors<3.3%). Finally, we identify frequency-dependent effects of musculoskeletal forces on ultra-wideband radar signals, that are independent of physiological and structural features known to influence muscle force. Together, these findings establish ultra-wideband radar as a powerful, non-invasive approach for quantifying in vivo musculoskeletal forces, with transformative potential for wearable assistive technologies, biomechanics, and rehabilitation.",

Recent deep learning advances for SDMs have been shown to perform well on complex and heterogeneous datasets, but their effectiveness remains limited by spatial biases in the data. In this paper, we revisit deep SDMs from a Bayesian perspective and introduce BATIS, a novel and practical framework wherein prior predictions are updated iteratively using limited observational data. Models must appropriately capture both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty to effectively combine fine-grained local insights with broader ecological patterns. We benchmark an extensive set of uncertainty quantification approaches on a novel dataset including citizen science observations from the eBird platform. Our empirical study shows how Bayesian deep learning approaches can greatly improve the reliability of SDMs in data-scarce locations, which can contribute to ecological understanding and conservation efforts.",

We find that SD-VAE reconstructions preserve phenotypic signals with minimal loss, supporting its use in microscopy workflows. To benchmark reconstruction quality, we compare pixel-level, embedding-based, latent-space, and retrieval-based metrics for a biologically informed evaluation. We show that general-purpose feature extractors like InceptionV3 match or surpass publicly available bespoke models in retrieval tasks, simplifying future pipelines.

DRP descriptors consistently outperformed omics data across key performance metrics, with variable performance across different drugs. Using complementary explainability approaches, we confirmed known MAPK-inhibitor sensitivity signatures, and identified novel potential biomarker candidates for MEK1/2 and BTK/MNK inhibitors. Lastly, to demonstrate the utility of this approach in distinguishing phenotypes, we applied our models to the breast cancer line MCF7 versus the non-tumorigenic MCF10A, and successfully identified compounds that selectively inhibit MCF7 while sparing the non-tumorigenic MCF10A.

To address these challenges, we introduce Omics-GAN, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based framework designed to generate high-quality synthetic multi-omics profiles while preserving biological relationships. We evaluated Omics-GAN on three omics types (mRNA, miRNA, and DNA methylation) using the ROSMAP cohort for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and TCGA datasets for colon and liver cancer. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier with repeated 5-fold cross-validation demonstrated that synthetic datasets consistently improved prediction accuracy compared to original omics profiles. The AUC of SVM for mRNA improved from 0.72 to 0.74 in AD, and from 0.68 to 0.72 in liver cancer. Synthetic miRNA enhanced classification in colon cancer from 0.59 to 0.69, while synthetic methylation data improved performance in liver cancer from 0.64 to 0.71. Boxplot analyses confirmed that synthetic data preserved statistical distributions while reducing noise and outliers. Feature selection identified significant genes overlapping with original datasets and revealed additional candidates validated by GO and KEGG enrichment analyses. Finally, molecular docking highlighted potential drug repurposing candidates, including Nilotinib for AD, Atovaquone for liver cancer, and Tecovirimat for colon cancer. Omics-GAN enhances disease prediction, preserves biological fidelity, and accelerates biomarker and drug discovery, offering a scalable strategy for precision medicine applications.",

Cell interactions are encoded in a dual signaling graph capable of handling signaling cascades. The dual graph architecture of our neural networks reflects the architecture of the underlying biological tissues, substantially reducing the amount of data needed for training, compared to convolutional or fully-connected neural networks. Taking epithelial tissue experiments as a case study, we show that our model not only captures stochastic cell motion but also predicts the evolution of cell states in their division cycle.

    "abstract": "A fundamental challenge in protein design is the trade-off between generating structural diversity while preserving motif biological function. Current state-of-the-art methods, such as partial diffusion in RFdiffusion, often fail to resolve this trade-off: small perturbations yield motifs nearly identical to the native structure, whereas larger perturbations violate the geometric constraints necessary for biological function. We introduce Protein Generation with Embedding Learning (PGEL), a general framework that learns high-dimensional embeddings encoding sequence and structural features of a target motif in the representation space of a diffusion model's frozen denoiser, and then enhances motif diversity by introducing controlled perturbations in the embedding space. PGEL is thus able to loosen geometric constraints while satisfying typical design metrics, leading to more diverse yet viable structures. We demonstrate PGEL on three representative cases: a monomer, a protein-protein interface, and a cancer-related transcription factor complex. In all cases, PGEL achieves greater structural diversity, better designability, and improved self-consistency, as compared to partial diffusion. Our results establish PGEL as a general strategy for embedding-driven protein generation allowing for systematic, viable diversification of functional motifs.",

    "abstract": "Feature selection is a combinatorial optimization problem that is NP-hard. Conventional approaches often employ heuristic or greedy strategies, which are prone to premature convergence and may fail to capture subtle yet informative features. This limitation becomes especially critical in high-dimensional datasets, where complex and interdependent feature relationships prevail. We introduce the HeFS (Helper-Enhanced Feature Selection) framework to refine feature subsets produced by existing algorithms. HeFS systematically searches the residual feature space to identify a Helper Set - features that complement the original subset and improve classification performance. The approach employs a biased initialization scheme and a ratio-guided mutation mechanism within a genetic algorithm, coupled with Pareto-based multi-objective optimization to jointly maximize predictive accuracy and feature complementarity. Experiments on 18 benchmark datasets demonstrate that HeFS consistently identifies overlooked yet informative features and achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods, including in challenging domains such as gastric cancer classification, drug toxicity prediction, and computer science applications.

    "abstract": "Quantification of protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) fluorescence in human brain tumours has the potential to significantly improve patient outcomes in neuro-oncology, but represents a formidable imaging challenge. Protoporphyrin is a biological molecule which interacts with the tissue micro-environment to form two photochemical states in glioma. Each exhibits markedly different quantum efficiencies, with distinct but overlapping emission spectra that also overlap with tissue autofluorescence. Fluorescence emission is known to be distorted by the intrinsic optical properties of tissue, coupled with marked intra-tumoural heterogeneity as a hallmark of glioma tumours. Existing quantitative fluorescence systems are developed and validated using simplified phantoms that do not simultaneously mimic the complex interactions between fluorophores and tissue optical properties or micro-environment. Consequently, existing systems risk introducing systematic errors into PpIX quantification when used in tissue. In this work, we introduce a novel pipeline for quantification of PpIX in glioma, which robustly differentiates both emission states from background autofluorescence without reliance on a priori spectral information, and accounts for variations in their quantum efficiency. Unmixed PpIX emission forms are then corrected for wavelength-dependent optical distortions and weighted for accurate quantification. Significantly, this pipeline is developed and validated using novel tissue-mimicking phantoms replicating the optical properties of glioma tissues and photochemical variability of PpIX fluorescence in glioma. Our workflow achieves strong correlation with ground-truth PpIX concentrations (R2 = 0.918+-0.002), demonstrating its potential for robust, quantitative PpIX fluorescence imaging in clinical settings.",

This study develops and evaluates machine learning models that integrate both structured clinical data and unstructured textual information, specifically discharge summaries and radiology reports, from the MIMIC-IV database. We used LASSO and XGBoost for feature selection, followed by a multivariate logistic regression trained on the top features identified by both models. Incorporating textual features using TF-IDF and BERT embeddings significantly improved predictive performance. The final logistic regression model, which combined structured and textual input, achieved an AUC of 0.918, compared to 0.753 when using structured data alone, a relative improvement 22%. The analysis of the decision curve demonstrated a superior standardized net benefit in a wide range of threshold probabilities (0.2-0.8), confirming the clinical utility of the model. These results underscore the added prognostic value of unstructured clinical notes and support their integration into interpretable feature-driven risk prediction models for ICU patients.",

    "abstract": "The dynamics of tumor-immune interactions within a complex tumor microenvironment are typically modeled using a system of ordinary differential equations or partial differential equations. These models introduce some unknown parameters that need to be estimated accurately and efficiently from the limited and noisy experimental data. Moreover, due to the intricate biological complexity and limitations in experimental measurements, tumor-immune dynamics are not fully understood, and therefore, only partial knowledge of the underlying physics may be available, resulting in unknown or missing terms within the system of equations. In this study, we develop a cancer biology-informed neural network model(CBINN) to infer the unknown parameters in the system of equations as well as to discover the missing physics from sparse and noisy measurements. We test the performance of the CBINN model on three distinct nonlinear compartmental tumor-immune models and evaluate its robustness across multiple synthetic noise levels. By harnessing these highly nonlinear dynamics, our CBINN framework effectively estimates the unknown model parameters and uncovers the underlying physical laws or mathematical structures that govern these biological systems, even from scattered and noisy measurements. The models chosen here represent the dynamic patterns commonly observed in compartmental models of tumor-immune interactions, thereby validating the generalizability and efficacy of our methodology.",

Recently, the Mamba architecture has demonstrated exceptional performance in both natural language processing and computer vision, often outperforming Transformer-based models in their domains. In this study, we introduce PUMBA (Protein-protein interface evaluation with Vision Mamba), which improves PIsToN by replacing its Vision Transformer backbone with Vision Mamba. This change allows us to leverage Mamba's efficient long-range sequence modeling for sequences of image patches. As a result, the model's ability to capture both global and local patterns in protein-protein interface features is significantly improved. Evaluation on several widely-used, large-scale public datasets demonstrates that PUMBA consistently outperforms its original Transformer-based predecessor, PIsToN.",

    "abstract": "Modeling dynamical systems and unraveling their underlying causal relationships is central to many domains in the natural sciences. Various physical systems, such as those arising in cell biology, are inherently high-dimensional and stochastic in nature, and admit only partial, noisy state measurements. This poses a significant challenge for addressing the problems of modeling the underlying dynamics and inferring the network structure of these systems. Existing methods are typically tailored either for structure learning or modeling dynamics at the population level, but are limited in their ability to address both problems together. In this work, we address both problems simultaneously: we present StructureFlow, a novel and principled simulation-free approach for jointly learning the structure and stochastic population dynamics of physical systems. We showcase the utility of StructureFlow for the tasks of structure learning from interventions and dynamical (trajectory) inference of conditional population dynamics. We empirically evaluate our approach on high-dimensional synthetic systems, a set of biologically plausible simulated systems, and an experimental single-cell dataset. We show that StructureFlow can learn the structure of underlying systems while simultaneously modeling their conditional population dynamics -- a key step toward the mechanistic understanding of systems behavior.",

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk stratification remains a major challenge due to its multifactorial nature and limited availability of high-quality labeled datasets. While genomic and electrophysiological data such as SNP variants and ECG phenotypes are increasingly accessible, effectively integrating these modalities in low-label settings is non-trivial. This challenge arises from the scarcity of well-annotated multimodal datasets and the high dimensionality of biological signals, which limit the effectiveness of conventional supervised models. To address this, we present a few-label multimodal framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to combine genetic and electrophysiological information for cardiovascular risk stratification. Our approach incorporates a pseudo-label refinement strategy to adaptively distill high-confidence labels from weakly supervised predictions, enabling robust model fine-tuning with only a small set of ground-truth annotations. To enhance the interpretability, we frame the task as a Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning problem, prompting the model to produce clinically relevant rationales alongside predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that the integration of multimodal inputs, few-label supervision, and CoT reasoning improves robustness and generalizability across diverse patient profiles. Experimental results using multimodal SNP variants and ECG-derived features demonstrated comparable performance to models trained on the full dataset, underscoring the promise of LLM-based few-label multimodal modeling for advancing personalized cardiovascular care.",

    "abstract": "Current spinal pain management procedures, such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and epidural steroid injection (ESI), rely on fluoroscopy for needle placement which exposes patients and physicians to ionizing radiation. In this paper, we investigate a radiation-free surgical navigation system for spinal pain management procedures that combines magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with fiducial ArUco marker-based augmented reality (AR). High-resolution MRI scans of a lumbar spinal phantom were obtained and assembled as a surface mesh. Laplacian smoothing algorithms were then applied to smoothen the surface and improve the model fidelity. A commercially available stereo camera (ZED2) was used to track single or dual fiducial ArUco markers on the patient to determine the patient's real-time pose. Custom AR software was applied to overlay the MRI image onto the patient, allowing the physician to see not only the outer surface of the patient but also the complete anatomy of the patient below the surface. Needle-insertion trials on a 3D-printed 3-vertebra phantom showed that dual-ArUco marker tracking increased the accuracy of needle insertions and reduced the average needle misplacement distance compared to single-ArUco marker procedures. The average needle misplacement is comparable to the average deviation of 2 mm for conventional epidural techniques using fluoroscopy. Our radiation-free system demonstrates promise to serve as an alternative to fluoroscopy by improving image-guided spinal navigation.",

Here, we are motivated by understanding the dynamics of RNA in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) is an experimental technique that is widely used to investigate the dynamics of molecular movement within cells by observing the recovery of fluorescence intensity in a photobleached region over time. To advance the understanding of RNA dynamics, we develop a reaction-diffusion-advection partial differential equation (PDE) model integrating both transport and diffusion mechanisms. We propose a pipeline for identifiability analysis to assess the model's ability to uniquely determine parameter values from observed FRAP data. Based on profile likelihood analysis and reparametrization, we examine the relationship between non- identifiable parameters, which improves the robustness of parameter estimation. We find out that the identifiability of the four parameters of interest is not exactly the same in different regions of the cell. Specifically, transport velocity and diffusion coefficient are identifiable in all regions of the cell, while some combinations of binding rate and unbinding rate are found to be identifiable near the nucleus.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in protein structure prediction, such as AlphaFold, have demonstrated the power of deep neural architectures like the Evoformer for capturing complex spatial and evolutionary constraints on protein conformation. However, the depth of the Evoformer, comprising 48 stacked blocks, introduces high computational costs and rigid layerwise discretization. Inspired by Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs), we propose a continuous-depth formulation of the Evoformer, replacing its 48 discrete blocks with a Neural ODE parameterization that preserves its core attention-based operations. This continuous-time Evoformer achieves constant memory cost (in depth) via the adjoint method, while allowing a principled trade-off between runtime and accuracy through adaptive ODE solvers. Benchmarking on protein structure prediction tasks, we find that the Neural ODE-based Evoformer produces structurally plausible predictions and reliably captures certain secondary structure elements, such as alpha-helices, though it does not fully replicate the accuracy of the original architecture. However, our model achieves this performance using dramatically fewer resources, just 17.5 hours of training on a single GPU, highlighting the promise of continuous-depth models as a lightweight and interpretable alternative for biomolecular modeling. This work opens new directions for efficient and adaptive protein structure prediction frameworks.",

Rather than find a deterministic optima like other recent methods, we propose a matrix variate Bayesian NMF method with nonnegativity and sparsity priors, in which the variables are maintained in their matrix form to derive a more efficient matrix normal posterior. BASIN employs a Gibbs sampler to approximate the posterior distribution of cell type proportions and other parameters, offering a distribution of possible solutions, enhancing robustness and providing inherent uncertainty quantification. The performance of BASIN is evaluated on different spatial transcriptomics datasets and outperforms other deconvolution methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency. The results also show the effect of the incorporated priors and reflect a truncated matrix normal distribution as we expect.",

    "abstract": "Emergency departments worldwide face rising patient volumes, workforce shortages, and variability in triage decisions that threaten the delivery of timely and accurate care. Current triage methods rely primarily on vital signs, routine laboratory values, and clinicians' judgment, which, while effective, often miss emerging biological signals that could improve risk prediction for infection typing or antibiotic administration in acute conditions. To address this challenge, we introduce TriAgent, a large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent framework that couples automated biomarker discovery with deep research for literature-grounded validation and novelty assessment. TriAgent employs a supervisor research agent to generate research topics and delegate targeted queries to specialized sub-agents for evidence retrieval from various data sources. Findings are synthesized to classify biomarkers as either grounded in existing knowledge or flagged as novel candidates, offering transparent justification and highlighting unexplored pathways in acute care risk stratification. Unlike prior frameworks limited to existing routine clinical biomarkers, TriAgent aims to deliver an end-to-end framework from data analysis to literature grounding to improve transparency, explainability and expand the frontier of potentially actionable clinical biomarkers. Given a user's clinical query and quantitative triage data, TriAgent achieved a topic adherence F1 score of 55.7 +/- 5.0%, surpassing the CoT-ReAct agent by over 10%, and a faithfulness score of 0.42 +/- 0.39, exceeding all baselines by more than 50%. Across experiments, TriAgent consistently outperformed state-of-the-art LLM-based agentic frameworks in biomarker justification and literature-grounded novelty assessment.

    "abstract": "Identifying the effects of mechanical ventilation strategies and protocols in critical care requires analyzing data from heterogeneous patient-ventilator systems within the context of the clinical decision-making environment. This research develops a framework to help understand the consequences of mechanical ventilation (MV) and adjunct care decisions on patient outcome from observations of critical care patients receiving MV. Developing an understanding of and improving critical care respiratory management requires the analysis of existing secondary-use clinical data to generate hypotheses about advantageous variations and adaptations of current care. This work introduces a perspective of the joint patient-ventilator-care systems (so-called J6) to develop a scalable method for analyzing data and trajectories of these complex systems. To that end, breath behaviors are analyzed using evolutionary game theory (EGT), which generates the necessary quantitative precursors for deeper analysis through probabilistic and stochastic machinery such as reinforcement learning. This result is one step along the pathway toward MV optimization and personalization. The EGT-based process is analytically validated on synthetic data to reveal potential caveats before proceeding to real-world ICU data applications that expose complexities of the data-generating process J6. The discussion includes potential developments toward a state transition model for the simulating effects of MV decision using empirical and game-theoretic elements.",

    "title": "Viral population dynamics at the cellular level, considering the replication cycle",
    "abstract": "Viruses are microscopic infectious agents that require a host cell for replication. Viral replication occurs in several stages, and the completion time for each stage varies due to differences in the cellular environment. Thus, the time to complete each stage in viral replication is a random variable. However, no analytic expression exists for the viral population at the cellular level when the completion time for each process constituting viral replication is a random variable. This paper presents a simplified model of viral replication, treating each stage as a renewal process with independently and identically distributed completion times. Using the proposed model, we derive an analytical formula for viral populations at the cellular level, based on viewing viral replication as a birth-death process. The mean viral count is expressed via probability density functions representing the completion time for each step in the replication process. This work validates the results with stochastic simulations. This study provides a new quantitative framework for understanding viral infection dynamics.",

    "abstract": "In neuroscience, methods from information geometry (IG) have been successfully applied in the modelling of binary vectors from spike train data, using the orthogonal decomposition of the Kullback-Leibler divergence and mutual information to isolate different orders of interaction between neurons. While spike train data is well-approximated with a binary model, here we apply these IG methods to data from electroencephalography (EEG), a continuous signal requiring appropriate discretization strategies. We developed and compared three different binarization methods and used them to identify third-order interactions in an experiment involving imagined motor movements. The statistical significance of these interactions was assessed using phase-randomized surrogate data that eliminated higher-order dependencies while preserving the spectral characteristics of the original signals. We validated our approach by implementing known second- and third-order dependencies in a forward model and quantified information attenuation at different steps of the analysis. This revealed that the greatest loss in information occurred when going from the idealized binary case to enforcing these dependencies using oscillatory signals. When applied to the real EEG dataset, our analysis detected statistically significant third-order interactions during the task condition despite the relatively sparse data (45 trials per condition). This work demonstrates that IG methods can successfully extract genuine higher-order dependencies from continuous neural recordings when paired with appropriate binarization schemes.",

    "abstract": "Quantitative analysis of multidimensional biological images is useful for understanding complex cellular phenotypes and accelerating advances in biomedical research. As modern microscopy generates ever-larger 2D and 3D datasets, existing computational approaches are increasingly limited by their scalability, efficiency, and integration with modern scientific computing workflows. Existing bioimage analysis tools often lack application programmable interfaces (APIs), do not support graphics processing unit (GPU) acceleration, lack broad 3D image processing capabilities, and/or have poor interoperability for compute-heavy workflows. Here, we introduce cubic, an open-source Python library that addresses these challenges by augmenting widely used SciPy and scikit-image APIs with GPU-accelerated alternatives from CuPy and RAPIDS cuCIM. cubic's API is device-agnostic and dispatches operations to GPU when data reside on the device and otherwise executes on CPU, seamlessly accelerating a broad range of image processing routines. This approach enables GPU acceleration of existing bioimage analysis workflows, from preprocessing to segmentation and feature extraction for 2D and 3D data. We evaluate cubic both by benchmarking individual operations and by reproducing existing deconvolution and segmentation pipelines, achieving substantial speedups while maintaining algorithmic fidelity. These advances establish a robust foundation for scalable, reproducible bioimage analysis that integrates with the broader Python scientific computing ecosystem, including other GPU-accelerated methods, enabling both interactive exploration and automated high-throughput analysis workflows. cubic is openly available at https://github$.$com/alxndrkalinin/cubic",

    "abstract": "Dengue remains one of Brazil's major epidemiological challenges, marked by strong intra-urban inequalities and the influence of climatic and socio-environmental factors. This study analyzed confirmed dengue cases in Recife from 2015 to 2024 using a Bayesian hierarchical spatio-temporal model implemented in R-INLA, combining a BYM2 spatial structure with an RW1 temporal component. Covariates included population density, household size, income, drainage channels, lagged precipitation, and mean temperature. Population density and household size had positive effects on dengue risk, while income and channel presence were protective. Lagged precipitation increased risk, and higher temperatures showed an inverse association, suggesting thermal thresholds for vector activity. The model achieved good fit (DIC=65817; WAIC=64506) and stable convergence, with moderate residual spatial autocorrelation (phi=0.06) and a smooth temporal trend between 2016 and 2019. Spatio-temporal estimates revealed persistent high-risk clusters in northern and western Recife, overlapping with areas of higher density and social vulnerability. Beyond reproducing historical patterns, the Bayesian model supports probabilistic forecasting and early warning systems. Compared with classical models (GLM, SAR, GWR, GTWR), INLA explicitly integrates uncertainty and spatial-temporal dependence, offering credible interval inference for decision-making in urban health management.",

    "abstract": "We develop and validate a novel spherical radiomics framework for predicting key molecular biomarkers using multiparametric MRI. Conventional Cartesian radiomics extract tumor features on orthogonal grids, which do not fully capture the tumor's radial growth patterns and can be insensitive to evolving molecular signatures. In this study, we analyzed GBM radiomic features on concentric 2D shells, which were then mapped onto 2D planes for radiomics analysis. Radiomic features were extracted using PyRadiomics from four different regions in GBM. Feature selection was performed using ANOVA F-statistics. Classification was conducted with multiple machine-learning models. Model interpretability was evaluated through SHAP analysis, clustering analysis, feature significance profiling, and comparison between radiomic patterns and underlying biological processes. Spherical radiomics consistently outperformed conventional 2D and 3D Cartesian radiomics across all prediction tasks. The best framework reached an AUC of 0.85 for MGMT, 0.80 for EGFR, 0.80 for PTEN, and 0.83 for survival prediction. GLCM-derived features were identified as the most informative predictors. Radial transition analysis using the Mann-Whitney U-test demonstrates that transition slopes between T1-weighted contrast-enhancing and T2/FLAIR hyperintense lesion regions, as well as between T2 intense lesion and a 2 cm peritumoral expansion region, are significantly associated with biomarker status. Furthermore, the observed radiomic changes along the radial direction closely reflected known biological characteristics. Radiomic features extracted on the spherical surfaces at varying radial distances to the GBM tumor centroid are better correlated with important tumor molecular markers and patient survival than the conventional Cartesian analysis.",

Current tools, while powerful, often lack comprehensive frameworks for modular model composition, hierarchical system building, and time-dependent input handling, particularly within the Python ecosystem.

SUND provides a unified framework for defining, combining, and simulating multi-level time-dynamic systems. The toolbox enables users to define models with interconnectable inputs and outputs, facilitating the construction of complex systems from simpler, reusable components. It supports time-dependent functions and piecewise constant inputs, enabling intuitive simulation of various experimental conditions such as multiple dosing schemes. We demonstrate the toolbox's capabilities through simulation of a multi-level human glucose-insulin system model, showcasing its flexibility in handling multiple temporal scales, and levels of biological detail.

While MIQE guidelines define the minimal information required for publication, they do not specify structured digital storage formats compatible with long-term reanalysis. This work presents qLOOK (qPCR-LOg-boOK), a tool for standardized digital storage and reproducible analysis of qPCR experiments. Results: qLOOK is a modular R-based system that extracts data from Thermo Fisher/ABI .EDS files, formats it into a structured table (qLOOK_Data.xlsx), performs normalization and statistical analysis, and generates a log file (qLOOK_Summary.txt) recording reference genes, calibrators, and analytical parameters. All required R libraries are automatically installed and loaded, allowing researchers without coding experience to use the scripts. By preserving the qLOOK_Data table and the qLOOK_Summary log, users can reproduce or extend analyses without reprocessing raw files. While currently limited to .EDS files, the modular design allows adaptation to additional qPCR formats in the future. Besides providing an easy and transparent approach to analyze qPCR experiments, qLOOK also provides a minimal, standardized, and transparent solution for digital documentation, enhancing reproducibility, supporting long-term data stewardship, and facilitating integration into electronic laboratory notebooks or publication supplementary material.",

This is the first example of a label-free and bead-free assay that quantifies protein agglutinates by direct detection using Total Holographic Characterization. A proof-of-concept assay for human serum immunoglobulins is demonstrated using Jacalin, the galactose-specific plant lectin, to induce selective agglutination.   By analyzing the size, refractive index, and number of particles in an assay sample, we obtain a reproducible and quantitative measurement of galactosylated immunoglobulins in a given sample. The assay is calibrated for a physiologically relevant reference interval of IgA concentrations in a 10x diluted emulated biological sample from low (80 mg/dL, 5 μM) to high (320 mg/dL, 20 μM) levels. The assay clearly distinguishes samples containing IgA from samples containing IgG.   More broadly, this study introduces a platform for creating lectin-mediated Holographic Agglutination Assays to monitor levels of immunoglobulins in biological samples. The ability to quantify immunoglobulin levels efficiently in clinical samples is likely to be valuable for diagnostics and will provide a basis for assaying other proteins that can be induced to agglutinate.",

Methods: We jointly optimize flip angles, T2 preparation durations, and sequence gaps for T1 recovery using a self-supervised MLP trained to minimize a Cramer-Rao bound-based loss function, with explicit constraints on total scan time. The optimization targets white matter, gray matter, and myelin water tissues, and its performance was validated through simulation, phantom, and in vivo experiments. Results: Building on our previously proposed MWF-QALAS method for simultaneous MWF, T1, and T2 mapping, the optimized sequence reduces the number of readouts from six to five and achieves a scan time nearly one minute shorter, while also yielding higher T1 and T2 accuracy and improved MWF maps. This sequence enables simultaneous multiparametric quantification, including MWF, at 1 mm isotropic resolution within 3 minutes and 30 seconds. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that optimizing sequence parameters using a self-supervised MLP network improved T1, T2 and MWF estimation accuracy, while reducing scan time.",

    "abstract": "Modeling cellular responses to genetic and chemical perturbations remains a central challenge in single-cell biology. Existing data-driven framework have advanced perturbation prediction through variational autoencoders, chemically conditioned autoencoders, and large-scale transformer pretraining. However, these models are prone to local optima in the nonconvex Waddington landscape of cell fate decisions, where poor initialization can trap trajectories in spurious lineages or implausible differentiation outcomes. While executable gene regulatory networks complement these approaches, automated design frameworks incorporate biological priors through multi-agent optimization. Yet, an approach that is completely data-driven with well-designed initialization to escape local optima and converge to a proper lineage remains elusive. In this work, we introduce a multistage reinforcement learning algorithm tailored for single-cell perturbation modeling. We first compute an explicit natural gradient update using Fisher-vector products and a conjugate gradient solver, scaled by a KL trust-region constraint to provide a safe, curvature-aware the first step for the policy. Starting with these preconditioned parameters, we then apply a second phase of proximal policy optimization (PPO) with clipped surrogates, exploiting minibatch efficiency to refine the policy. We demonstrate that this initialization substantially improves generalization on Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and Single-cell ATAC sequencing (scATAC-seq) pertubation analysis.",

The current state-of-the-art methods exploit probabilistic models of sequence evolution along phylogenetic trees, by searching for the tree maximizing the likelihood of observed sequences, or by estimating the posterior of the tree given the sequences in a Bayesian framework. Both approaches typically require to compute likelihoods, which is only feasible under simplifying assumptions such as independence of the evolution at the different positions of the sequence, and even then remains a costly operation. Here we present Phyloformer 2, the first likelihood-free inference method for posterior distributions over phylogenies. Phyloformer 2 exploits a novel encoding for pairs of sequences that makes it more scalable than previous approaches, and a parameterized probability distribution factorized over a succession of subtree merges. The resulting network provides accurate estimates of the posterior distribution, and outperforms both state-of-the-art maximum likelihood methods and a previous likelihood-free method for point estimation.

    "abstract": "mRNA design and optimization are important in synthetic biology and therapeutic development, but remain understudied in machine learning. Systematic optimization of mRNAs is hindered by the scarce and imbalanced data as well as complex sequence-function relationships. We present RNAGenScape, a property-guided manifold Langevin dynamics framework that iteratively updates mRNA sequences within a learned latent manifold. RNAGenScape combines an organized autoencoder, which structures the latent space by target properties for efficient and biologically plausible exploration, with a manifold projector that contracts each step of update back to the manifold. RNAGenScape supports property-guided optimization and smooth interpolation between sequences, while remaining robust under scarce and undersampled data, and ensuring that intermediate products are close to the viable mRNA manifold. Across three real mRNA datasets, RNAGenScape improves the target properties with high success rates and efficiency, outperforming various generative or optimization methods developed for proteins or non-biological data. By providing continuous, data-aligned trajectories that reveal how edits influence function, RNAGenScape establishes a scalable paradigm for controllable mRNA design and latent space exploration in mRNA sequence modeling.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian tissue architecture is central to biological function, and its disruption is a hallmark of disease. Medical imaging techniques can generate large point cloud datasets that capture changes in the cellular composition of such tissues with disease progression. However, regions of interest (ROIs) are usually defined by quadrat-based methods that ignore intrinsic structure and risk fragmenting meaningful features. Here, we introduce TopROI, a topology-informed, network-based method for partitioning point clouds into ROIs that preserves both local geometry and higher-order architecture. TopROI integrates geometry-informed networks with persistent homology, combining cell neighbourhoods and multiscale cycles to guide community detection. Applied to synthetic point clouds that mimic glandular structure, TopROI outperforms quadrat-based and purely geometric partitions by maintaining biologically plausible ROI geometry and better preserving ground-truth structures. Applied to cellular point clouds obtained from human colorectal cancer biopsies, TopROI generates ROIs that preserve crypt-like structures and enable persistent homology analysis of individual regions. This study reveals a continuum of architectural changes from healthy mucosa to carcinoma, reflecting progressive disorganisation in tissue structure. TopROI thus provides a principled and flexible framework for defining biologically meaningful ROIs in large point clouds, enabling more accurate quantification of tissue organization and new insights into structural changes associated with disease progression.",

    "abstract": "Neurodegeneration, characterized by the progressive loss of neuronal structure or function, is commonly assessed in clinical practice through reductions in cortical thickness or brain volume, as visualized by structural MRI. While informative, these conventional approaches lack the statistical sophistication required to fully capture the spatially correlated and heterogeneous nature of neurodegeneration, which manifests both in healthy aging and in neurological disorders. To address these limitations, brain age gap has emerged as a promising data-driven biomarker of brain health. The brain age gap prediction (BAGP) models estimate the difference between a person's predicted brain age from neuroimaging data and their chronological age. The resulting brain age gap serves as a compact biomarker of brain health, with recent studies demonstrating its predictive utility for disease progression and severity. However, practical adoption of BAGP models is hindered by their methodological obscurities and limited generalizability across diverse clinical populations. This tutorial article provides an overview of BAGP and introduces a principled framework for this application based on recent advancements in graph signal processing (GSP). In particular, we focus on graph neural networks (GNNs) and introduce the coVariance neural network (VNN), which leverages the anatomical covariance matrices derived from structural MRI. VNNs offer strong theoretical grounding and operational interpretability, enabling robust estimation of brain age gap predictions. By integrating perspectives from GSP, machine learning, and network neuroscience, this work clarifies the path forward for reliable and interpretable BAGP models and outlines future research directions in personalized medicine.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer is the most diagnosed cancer in women, with HER2 status critically guiding treatment decisions. Noninvasive prediction of HER2 status from dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) could streamline diagnostics and reduce reliance on biopsy. However, preprocessing high-dynamic-range DCE-MRI into standardized 8-bit RGB format for pretrained neural networks is nontrivial, and normalization strategy significantly affects model performance. We benchmarked intensity normalization strategies using a Triple-Head Dual-Attention ResNet that processes RGB-fused temporal sequences from three DCE phases. Trained on a multicenter cohort (n=1,149) from the I-SPY trials and externally validated on BreastDCEDL_AMBL (n=43 lesions), our model outperformed transformer-based architectures, achieving 0.75 accuracy and 0.74 AUC on I-SPY test data. N4 bias field correction slightly degraded performance. Without fine-tuning, external validation yielded 0.66 AUC, demonstrating cross-institutional generalizability. These findings highlight the effectiveness of dual-attention mechanisms in capturing transferable spatiotemporal features for HER2 stratification, advancing reproducible deep learning biomarkers in breast cancer imaging.",

The general chemical knowledge extracted from self-supervised training has the potential to improve predictions for critical drug discovery endpoints, including on-target potency and ADMET properties. Multi-task learning has previously been successfully leveraged to improve predictive models. Here, we show that enabling multitasking in finetuning of chemical pretrained graph neural network models such as Kinetic GROVER Multi-Task (KERMT), an enhanced version of the GROVER model, and Knowledge-guided Pre-training of Graph Transformer (KGPT) significantly improves performance over non-pretrained graph neural network models. Surprisingly, we find that the performance improvement from finetuning KERMT in a multitask manner is most significant at larger data sizes. Additionally, we publish two multitask ADMET data splits to enable more accurate benchmarking of multitask deep learning methods for drug property prediction. Finally, we provide an accelerated implementation of the KERMT model on GitHub, unlocking large-scale pretraining, finetuning, and inference in industrial drug discovery workflows.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling is central to a wide variety of healthy and diseased tissue processes. Unfortunately, predicting ECM remodeling under various chemical and mechanical conditions has proven to be excessively challenging, due in part to its complex regulation by intracellular and extracellular molecular reaction networks that are spatially and temporally dynamic. We introduce ECMSim, which is a highly interactive, real-time, and web application designed to simulate heterogeneous matrix remodeling. The current model simulates cardiac scar tissue with configurable input conditions using a large-scale model of the cardiac fibroblast signaling network. Cardiac fibrosis is a major component of many forms of heart failure. ECMSim simulates over 1.3 million equations simultaneously in real time that include more than 125 species and more than 200 edges in each cell in a 100*100 spatial array (10,000 cells), which accounts for inputs, receptors, intracellular signaling cascades, ECM production, and feedback loops, as well as molecular diffusion. The algorithm is represented by a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that are coupled with ECM molecular diffusion. The equations are solved on demand using compiled C++ and the WebAssembly standard. The platform includes brush-style cell selection to target a subset of cells with adjustable input molecule concentrations, parameter sliders to adjust parameters on demand, and multiple coupled real-time visualizations of network dynamics at multiple scales. Implementing ECMSim in standard web technologies enables a fully functional application that combines real-time simulation, visual interaction, and model editing. The software enables the investigation of pathological or experimental conditions, hypothetical scenarios, matrix remodeling, or the testing of the effects of an experimental drug(s) with a target receptor.",

Its analysis relies on mathematical deconvolution, but noise or motion artifacts in a clinical environment can disrupt this process, leading to incorrect estimate of perfusion parameters. Although deep learning approaches have shown promising results, their calibration typically rely on third-party deconvolution algorithms to generate reference outputs and are bound to reproduce their limitations.   To adress this problem, we propose a physics-informed autoencoder that leverages an analytical model to decode the perfusion parameters and guide the learning of the encoding network. This autoencoder is trained in a self-supervised fashion without any third-party software and its performance is evaluated on a database with glioma patients. Our method shows reliable results for glioma grading in accordance with other well-known deconvolution algorithms despite a lower computation time. It also achieved competitive performance even in the presence of high noise which is critical in a medical environment.",

    "abstract": "Lightweight inference is critical for biomolecular structure prediction and downstream tasks, enabling efficient real-world deployment and inference-time scaling for large-scale applications. While AF3 and its variants (e.g., Protenix, Chai-1) have advanced structure prediction results, they suffer from critical limitations: high inference latency and cubic time complexity with respect to token count, both of which restrict scalability for large biomolecular complexes. To address the core challenge of balancing model efficiency and prediction accuracy, we introduce three key innovations: (1) compressing non-scalable operations to mitigate cubic time complexity, (2) removing redundant blocks across modules to reduce unnecessary overhead, and (3) adopting a few-step sampler for the atom diffusion module to accelerate inference. Building on these design principles, we develop Protenix-Mini+, a highly lightweight and scalable variant of the Protenix model. Within an acceptable range of performance degradation, it substantially improves computational efficiency. For example, in the case of low-homology single-chain proteins, Protenix-Mini+ experiences an intra-protein LDDT drop of approximately 3% relative to the full Protenix model -- an acceptable performance trade-off given its substantially 90%+ improved computational efficiency.",

Emerging evidence points to the MYB proto-oncogene as a critical factor in promoting tumor progression, therapeutic resistance, and disease relapse. Notably, differential expression patterns have been observed, with markedly elevated MYB levels in tumor tissues from Black men relative to their White counterparts potentially offering insight into documented racial disparities in clinical outcomes. This study investigates the association between MYB expression and key oncogenic features, including androgen receptor (AR) signaling, disease progression, and the risk of biochemical recurrence. Employing a multimodal approach that integrates histopathological examination, quantitative digital imaging, and analyses of public transcriptomic datasets, our findings suggest that MYB overexpression is strongly linked to adverse prognosis. These results underscore MYB's potential as a prognostic biomarker and as a candidate for the development of individualized therapeutic strategies.",

In this work, we introduce a Python-based framework aimed at streamlining the development, assessment, and documentation of individualized seizure forecasting algorithms.   The framework automates data labeling, cross-validation splitting, forecast post-processing, performance evaluation, and reporting. It supports various forecasting horizons and includes a model card that documents implementation details, training and evaluation settings, and performance metrics. Three different models were implemented as a proof-of-concept. The models leveraged features extracted from time series data and seizure periodicity. Model performance was assessed using time series cross-validation and key deterministic and probabilistic metrics.   Implementation of the three models was successful, demonstrating the flexibility of the framework. The results also emphasize the importance of careful model interpretation due to variations in probability scaling, calibration, and subject-specific differences. Although formal usability metrics were not recorded, empirical observations suggest reduced development time and methodological consistency, minimizing unintentional variations that could affect the comparability of different approaches.   As a proof-of-concept, this validation is inherently limited, relying on a single-user experiment without statistical analyses or replication across independent datasets. At this stage, our objective is to make the framework publicly available to foster community engagement, facilitate experimentation, and gather feedback. In the long term, we aim to contribute to the establishment of a consensus on a standardized methodology for the development and validation of seizure forecasting algorithms in people with epilepsy.",

    "abstract": "Conflicting clinical trial results on omega-3 highly unsaturated fatty acids (n-3 HUFA) have prompted uncertainty about their cardioprotective effects. While the VITAL trial found no overall cardiovascular benefit from n-3 HUFA supplementation, its substantial African American (AfAm) enrollment provided a unique opportunity to explore racial differences in response to n-3 HUFA supplementation. The current observational study aimed to simulate randomized clinical trial (RCT) conditions by matching 3,766 AfAm and 15,553 non-Hispanic White (NHW) individuals from the VITAL trial utilizing propensity score matching to address the limitations related to differences in confounding variables between the two groups. Within matched groups (3,766 AfAm and 3,766 NHW), n-3 HUFA supplementation's impact on myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality was assessed. A weighted decision tree analysis revealed belonging to the n-3 supplementation group as the most significant predictor of MI among AfAm but not NHW. Further logistic regression using the LASSO method and bootstrap estimation of standard errors indicated n-3 supplementation significantly lowered MI risk in AfAm (OR 0.17, 95% CI [0.048, 0.60]), with no such effect in NHW. This study underscores the critical need for future RCT to explore racial disparities in MI risk associated with n-3 HUFA supplementation and highlights potential causal differences between supplementation health outcomes in AfAm versus NHW populations.",

    "abstract": "Electrode density optimization in electroencephalography (EEG)-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) requires balancing practical usability against signal fidelity, particularly for source localization. Reducing electrodes enhances portability but its effects on neural source reconstruction quality and source connectivity - treated as proxies to BCI performance - remain understudied. We address this gap through systematic evaluation of 62-, 32-, and 16-channel configurations using a fixed, fully automated processing pipeline applied to the well-characterized P300 potential. This approach's rationale is to minimize variability and bias inherent to EEG analysis by leveraging the P300's stimulus-locked reproducibility and pipeline standardization. Analyzing 63 sessions (31 subjects) from the Eye-BCI dataset with rigorous artifact correction and channel validation, we demonstrate: (1) Progressive degradation in source reconstruction quality with sparser configurations, including obscured deep neural generators and spatiotemporal distortions; (2) A novel sqrt(Re) scaling law linking electrode reduction ratio (Re) to localization accuracy - a previously unquantified relationship to the best of our knowledge; (3) While reduced configurations preserve basic P300 topography and may suffice for communicative BCIs, higher-density channels are essential for reliable deep source reconstruction. Overall, this study establishes a first step towards quantitative benchmarks for electrode selection, with critical implications for clinical BCIs requiring anatomical precision in applications like neurodegenerative disease monitoring, where compromised spatial resolution could mask pathological signatures. Most importantly, the sqrt(Re) scaling law may provide the first principled method to determine the minimal electrode density required based on acceptable error margins or expected effect sizes.",

However, their performance is limited by signal fidelity issues, among which the choice of re-referencing strategy is a pervasive but often overlooked preprocessing bias. Addressing controversies about its necessity and optimal choice, we adopted a quantified approach to evaluate four strategies - no re-referencing, Common Average Reference (CAR), small Laplacian, and large Laplacian - using 62-channels EEG (31 subjects, 2,520 trials). To our knowledge, this is the first study systematically quantifying their impact on single-trial P300 classification accuracy. Our controlled pipeline isolated re-referencing effects for source-space reconstruction (eLORETA with Phase Lag Index) and anatomically constrained classification. The large Laplacian resolves distributed P3b networks while maintaining P3a specificity, achieving the best P300 peak classification accuracy (81.57% hybrid method; 75.97% majority regions of interest). Performance follows a consistent and statistically significant hierarchy: large Laplacian > CAR > no re-reference > small Laplacian, providing a foundation for unified methodological evaluation.",

    "abstract": "Proteins are essential biological macromolecules that execute life functions. Local motifs within protein structures, such as active sites, are the most critical components for linking structure to function and are key to understanding protein evolution and enabling protein engineering. Existing computational methods struggle to identify and compare these local structures, which leaves a significant gap in understanding protein structures and harnessing their functions. This study presents PLASMA, the first deep learning framework for efficient and interpretable residue-level protein substructure alignment. We reformulate the problem as a regularized optimal transport task and leverage differentiable Sinkhorn iterations. For a pair of input protein structures, PLASMA outputs a clear alignment matrix with an interpretable overall similarity score. Through extensive quantitative evaluations and three biological case studies, we demonstrate that PLASMA achieves accurate, lightweight, and interpretable residue-level alignment. Additionally, we introduce PLASMA-PF, a training-free variant that provides a practical alternative when training data are unavailable. Our method addresses a critical gap in protein structure analysis tools and offers new opportunities for functional annotation, evolutionary studies, and structure-based drug design. Reproducibility is ensured via our official implementation at https://github.com/ZW471/PLASMA-Protein-Local-Alignment.git.",

    "abstract": "Designing protein sequences that fold into a target three-dimensional structure, known as the inverse folding problem, is central to protein engineering but remains challenging due to the vast sequence space and the importance of local structural constraints. Existing deep learning approaches achieve strong recovery rates, yet they lack explicit mechanisms to reuse fine-grained structure-sequence patterns that are conserved across natural proteins. We present PRISM, a multimodal retrieval-augmented generation framework for inverse folding that retrieves fine-grained representations of potential motifs from known proteins and integrates them with a hybrid self-cross attention decoder. PRISM is formulated as a latent-variable probabilistic model and implemented with an efficient approximation, combining theoretical grounding with practical scalability. Across five benchmarks (CATH-4.2, TS50, TS500, CAMEO 2022, and the PDB date split), PRISM establishes new state of the art in both perplexity and amino acid recovery, while also improving foldability metrics (RMSD, TM-score, pLDDT), demonstrating that fine-grained multimodal retrieval is a powerful and efficient paradigm for protein sequence design.",

    "abstract": "Synthetic molecular communication (MC) in the cardiovascular system (CVS) is a key enabler for many envisioned medical applications in the human body, such as targeted drug delivery, early cancer detection, and continuous health monitoring. The design of MC systems for such applications requires suitable models for the signaling molecule propagation through complex vessel networks (VNs). Existing theoretical models offer limited analytical tractability and lack closed-form solutions, making the analysis of large-scale VNs either infeasible or not insightful. To overcome these limitations, in this paper, we propose a novel closed-form physical model, termed MIGHT, for advection-diffusion-driven transport of signaling molecules through complex VNs. The model represents the received molecule flux as a weighted sum of inverse Gaussian (IG) distributions, parameterized by physical properties of the network. The proposed model is validated by comparison with an existing convolution-based model and finite-element simulations. Further, we show that the model can be applied for the reduction of large VNs to simplified representations preserving the essential transport dynamics and for estimating representative VN based on received signals from unknown VNs.",

In this study, we introduce K-DREAM (Knowledge-Driven Embedding-Augmented Model), a novel framework that leverages knowledge graphs to augment diffusion-based generative models for drug discovery. By embedding structured information from large-scale knowledge graphs, K-DREAM directs molecular generation toward candidates with higher biological relevance and therapeutic suitability. This integration ensures that the generated molecules are aligned with specific therapeutic targets, moving beyond traditional heuristic-driven approaches. In targeted drug design tasks, K-DREAM generates drug candidates with improved binding affinities and predicted efficacy, surpassing current state-of-the-art generative models. It also demonstrates flexibility by producing molecules designed for multiple targets, enabling applications to complex disease mechanisms. These results highlight the utility of knowledge-enhanced generative models in rational drug design and their relevance to practical therapeutic development.",

    "abstract": "Multi-view pose estimation is essential for quantifying animal behavior in scientific research, yet current methods struggle to achieve accurate tracking with limited labeled data and suffer from poor uncertainty estimates. We address these challenges with a comprehensive framework combining novel training and post-processing techniques, and a model distillation procedure that leverages the strengths of these techniques to produce a more efficient and effective pose estimator. Our multi-view transformer (MVT) utilizes pretrained backbones and enables simultaneous processing of information across all views, while a novel patch masking scheme learns robust cross-view correspondences without camera calibration. For calibrated setups, we incorporate geometric consistency through 3D augmentation and a triangulation loss. We extend the existing Ensemble Kalman Smoother (EKS) post-processor to the nonlinear case and enhance uncertainty quantification via a variance inflation technique. Finally, to leverage the scaling properties of the MVT, we design a distillation procedure that exploits improved EKS predictions and uncertainty estimates to generate high-quality pseudo-labels, thereby reducing dependence on manual labels. Our framework components consistently outperform existing methods across three diverse animal species (flies, mice, chickadees), with each component contributing complementary benefits. The result is a practical, uncertainty-aware system for reliable pose estimation that enables downstream behavioral analyses under real-world data constraints.",

Nevertheless, a major challenge in drug discovery AI remains: Drug pharmacokinetic (PK) and Drug-Target Interaction (DTI) datasets collected in different studies often exhibit limited overlap, creating data overlap sparsity. Thus, data curation becomes difficult, negatively impacting downstream research investigations in high-throughput screening, polypharmacy, and drug combination. We propose xImagand-DKI, a novel SMILES/Protein-to-Pharmacokinetic/DTI (SP2PKDTI) diffusion model capable of generating an array of PK and DTI target properties conditioned on SMILES and protein inputs that exhibit data overlap sparsity. We infuse additional molecular and genomic domain knowledge from the Gene Ontology (GO) and molecular fingerprints to further improve our model performance. We show that xImagand-DKI-generated synthetic PK data closely resemble real data univariate and bivariate distributions, and can adequately fill in gaps among PK and DTI datasets. As such, xImagand-DKI is a promising solution for data overlap sparsity and may improve performance for downstream drug discovery research tasks.

However, in literature there seems to be no consensus on the optimal eye alignment for such experiments. Typically, experiments are performed by presenting stimuli nasally or temporally, but the angle under which the few-photon pulses are presented varies between 7 deg and 23 deg. Here we combine a $3$-dimensional eye model with retinal rod density measurements from literature in a ray tracing simulation to study the optimal eye alignment conditions and necessary alignment precision. We find that stimuli, directed at the eye's nodal point, may be best presented under an inferior angle of 13.1 deg with respect to the visual axis. Defining a target area on the retina with a radius of 0.5 mm around the optimum location, we find the horizontal and vertical angular precision should be better than 0.85 deg given a horizontal and vertical translational precision of 1 mm and a depth translational precision of 5 mm.",

    "abstract": "Untargeted metabolomics using LC-MS/MS offers the potential to comprehensively profile the chemical diversity of biological samples. However, the process is fundamentally limited by the \"identification bottleneck,\" where only a small fraction of detected features can be annotated using existing spectral libraries, leaving the majority of data uncharacterized and unused. In addition, the inherently low reproducibility of LC-MS/MS instruments introduces alignment errors between runs, making feature alignment across large datasets both error-prone and challenging. To overcome these constraints, we developed a deep learning method that eliminates the requirement for metabolite identification and reduces the influence of alignment inaccuracies. Here, we propose MS2toImg, a method that converts raw LC-MS/MS data into a two-dimensional images representing the global fragmentation pattern of each sample. These images are then used as direct input for a convolutional neural network (CNN), enabling end-to-end prediction of biological activity without explicit feature engineering or alignment. Our approach was validated using wild soybean samples and multiple bioactivity assays (e.g., DPPH, elastase inhibition). The MS2toImg-CNN model outperformed conventional machine learning baselines (e.g., Random Forest, PCA), demonstrating robust classification accuracy across diverse tasks. By transforming raw spectral data into images, our framework is inherently less sensitive to alignment errors caused by low instrument reproducibility, as it leverages the overall fragmentation landscape rather than relying on precise feature matching. This identification-free, image-based approach enables more robust and scalable bioactivity prediction from untargeted metabolomics data, offering a new paradigm for high-throughput functional screening in complex biological systems.",

Phenological records from monitoring programs are typically collected at irregular intervals, so true transition dates are interval-censored, and many site-years are right-censored. We develop a reproducible workflow that treats phenology as a time-to-event outcome: Status \\& Intensity observations from the USA-NPN are converted to interval bounds, linked to NASA POWER daily weather, and analyzed with parametric accelerated failure time (AFT) models (Weibull and log-logistic). To avoid outcome-dependent bias from aggregating weather up to the event date, antecedent conditions are summarized in fixed pre-season windows and standardized; quality-control filters ensure adequate within-window data coverage. Applied to flowering and ripening of \\textit{V.~vinifera}, the framework yields interpretable time-ratio effects and publication-ready tables and figures. Warmer pre-season conditions are associated with earlier ripening, whereas flowering responses are modest and uncertain in these data; precipitation plays, at most, a secondary role. The approach demonstrates how interval-censored survival models with exogenous weather windows can extract robust climate signals from citizen-science phenology while preserving observation uncertainty, and it generalizes readily to other species and networks.",

    "title": "Quantification of protein homodimer affinity using native mass spectrometry",
    "abstract": "Biological processes rely on finely tuned homo- and heteromeric interactions between (biomacro)molecules. The strength of an interaction, typically given by the dissociation constant (KD), plays a crucial role in basic research and must be monitored throughout the development of drugs and agrochemicals. An ideal method for KD determination is applicable to various analytes with a large range of affinities, tolerates complex matrix compositions, does not require labeling, and simultaneously provides information on the structural integrity of the binding partners. Native mass spectrometry meets these criteria but typically struggles with homooligomeric complexes due to overlapping mass signals. To overcome this, we resolve monomer/dimer contributions to overlapping MS-peaks by separately analyzing the charge state distribution of each oligomeric species via sample dilution and covalent crosslinking. Following this approach, we show that quantitative Laser-Induced Liquid Bead Ion Desorption mass spectrometry (qLILBID-MS) accurately captures the affinities of Bovine Serum Albumin and chemically induced dimers of Tryparedoxin, an oxidoreductase from human pathogenic Trypanosoma brucei parasites, with various molecular glues and homodimer affinities. Conveniently, qLILBID-MS requires a fraction of sample used by other methods such as isothermal titration calorimetry and yields previously inaccessible protein homodimer KDs in the high micromolar range, which allowed us to monitor the gradual decrease in homodimer affinity via mutation of crucial dimer interface contacts. Overall, qLILBID-MS is a sensitive, robust, fast, scalable, and cost-effective alternative to quantify protein/protein interactions that can accelerate contemporary drug discovery workflows, e.g. the efficient screening for proximity inducing molecules like proteolysis targeting chimera and molecular glues.",

    "abstract": "Predicting species distributions using occupancy models accounting for imperfect detection is now commonplace in ecology. Recently, modelling spatial and temporal autocorrelation was proposed to alleviate the lack of replication in occupancy data, which often prevents model identifiability. However, how such models perform in highly heterogeneous datasets where missing or single-visit data dominates remains an open question. Motivated by an heterogeneous fine-scale butterfly occupancy dataset, we evaluate the performance of a multi-season occupancy model with spatial and temporal random effects to a skewed (Poisson) distribution of the number of surveys per site, overlap of covariates between occupancy and detection submodels, and spatiotemporal clustering of observations. Results showed that the model is robust to heterogeneous data and covariate overlap. However, when spatiotemporal gaps were added, site occupancy was biased towards the average occupancy, itself overestimated. Random effects did not correct the influence of gaps, due to identifiability issues of variance and autocorrelation parameters. Occupancy analysis of two butterfly species further confirmed these results. Overall, multi-season occupancy models with autocorrelation are robust to heterogeneous data and covariate overlap, but still present identifiability issues and are challenged by severe data gaps, which compromise predictions even in data-rich areas.",

    "title": "PRESCRIBE: Predicting Single-Cell Responses with Bayesian Estimation",
    "abstract": "In single-cell perturbation prediction, a central task is to forecast the effects of perturbing a gene unseen in the training data. The efficacy of such predictions depends on two factors: (1) the similarity of the target gene to those covered in the training data, which informs model (epistemic) uncertainty, and (2) the quality of the corresponding training data, which reflects data (aleatoric) uncertainty. Both factors are critical for determining the reliability of a prediction, particularly as gene perturbation is an inherently stochastic biochemical process. In this paper, we propose PRESCRIBE (PREdicting Single-Cell Response wIth Bayesian Estimation), a multivariate deep evidential regression framework designed to measure both sources of uncertainty jointly. Our analysis demonstrates that PRESCRIBE effectively estimates a confidence score for each prediction, which strongly correlates with its empirical accuracy. This capability enables the filtering of untrustworthy results, and in our experiments, it achieves steady accuracy improvements of over 3% compared to comparable baselines.",

    "abstract": "The forces generated by action potentials in muscle cells shuttle blood, food and waste products throughout the luminal structures of the body. Although non-invasive electrophysiological techniques exist, most mechanosensors cannot access luminal structures non-invasively. Here we introduce non-toxic ingestible mechanosensors to enable the quantitative study of luminal forces and apply them to study feeding in living Caenorhabditis elegans roundworms. These optical 'microgauges' comprise NaY0.8Yb0.18Er0.02F4@NaYF4 upconverting nanoparticles embedded in polystyrene microspheres. Combining optical microscopy and atomic force microscopy to study microgauges in vitro, we show that force evokes a linear and hysteresis-free change in the ratio of emitted red to green light. With fluorescence imaging and non-invasive electrophysiology, we show that adult C. elegans generate bite forces during feeding on the order of 10 micronewtons and that the temporal pattern of force generation is aligned with muscle activity in the feeding organ. Moreover, the bite force we measure corresponds to Hertzian contact stresses in the pressure range used to lyse the bacterial food of the worm. Microgauges have the potential to enable quantitative studies that investigate how neuromuscular stresses are affected by aging, genetic mutations and drug treatments in this organ and other luminal organs.",

    "abstract": "Predicting the fitness impact of mutations is central to protein engineering but constrained by limited assays relative to the size of sequence space. Protein language models (pLMs) trained with masked language modeling (MLM) exhibit strong zero-shot fitness prediction; we provide a unifying view by interpreting natural evolution as implicit reward maximization and MLM as inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), in which extant sequences act as expert demonstrations and pLM log-odds serve as fitness estimates. Building on this perspective, we introduce EvoIF, a lightweight model that integrates two complementary sources of evolutionary signal: (i) within-family profiles from retrieved homologs and (ii) cross-family structural-evolutionary constraints distilled from inverse folding logits. EvoIF fuses sequence-structure representations with these profiles via a compact transition block, yielding calibrated probabilities for log-odds scoring. On ProteinGym (217 mutational assays; >2.5M mutants), EvoIF and its MSA-enabled variant achieve state-of-the-art or competitive performance while using only 0.15% of the training data and fewer parameters than recent large models. Ablations confirm that within-family and cross-family profiles are complementary, improving robustness across function types, MSA depths, taxa, and mutation depths.

    "abstract": "Protein structure prediction has advanced significantly with the introduction of AlphaFold3, a diffusion-based model capable of predicting complex biomolecular interactions across proteins, nucleic acids, small molecules, and ions. While AlphaFold3 demonstrates high accuracy in folded proteins, its performance on intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), which comprise 30 to 40 percent of the human proteome and play critical roles in transcription, signaling, and disease, remains less explored. This study evaluated AlphaFold3's predictions of IDPs with a focus on intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) using 72 proteins curated from the DisProt database. Predictions were generated across multiple random seeds and ensemble outputs, and residue-level pLDDT scores were compared with experimental disorder annotations. Our analysis reveals that 32 percent of residues are misaligned with DisProt, with percent representing hallucinations where AlphaFold3 incorrectly predicts order in disordered regions or vice versa. Additionally, 10 percent of residues exhibited context-driven misalignment, suggesting that AlphaFold3 implicitly incorporates stable structural assumptions. Importantly, 18 percent of residues associated with biological processes showed hallucinations, raising concerns about downstream implications in drug discovery and disease research. These findings highlight the limitations of AlphaFold3 in modeling IDRs, the need for refined hallucination metrics beyond the pLDDT, and the importance of integrating experimental disorder data to improve prediction reliability.",

Valve leaflet strain is a promising metric for evaluating the mechanics underlying the initiation and progression of valvular pathology. However, robust and generalizable methods for noninvasively quantifying valvular strain from clinically acquired patient images remain limited. In this work, we present a novel feature-tracking framework for quantifying leaflet strain in atrioventricular valves using 3D echocardiographic images of pediatric and adult patients. Our method demonstrated superior accuracy in the assessment of anatomical deformation and strain of heart valves compared to other point-based approaches, as verified against a finite element benchmark. Further, our approach can robustly track inter-phase deformation of valves across highly variable morphologies without parameter tuning. Our analysis revealed that a median and interquartile range of the 1st principal strain greater than 0.5 is associated with leaflet billow (prolapse). Further investigation of the biomechanical signatures of heart valve disease has the potential to enhance prognostic assessment and longitudinal evaluation of valvular disease.",

    "abstract": "Protein sequence alignment is a cornerstone of bioinformatics, traditionally approached using dynamic programming (DP) algorithms that find an optimal sequential path. This paper introduces UniOTalign, a novel framework that recasts alignment from a fundamentally different perspective: global matching via Optimal Transport (OT). Instead of finding a path, UniOTalign computes an optimal flow or transport plan between two proteins, which are represented as distributions of residues in a high-dimensional feature space. We leverage pre-trained Protein Language Models (PLMs) to generate rich, context-aware embeddings for each residue. The core of our method is the Fused Unbalanced Gromov-Wasserstein (FUGW) distance, which finds a correspondence that simultaneously minimizes feature dissimilarity and preserves the internal geometric structure of the sequences. This approach naturally handles sequences of different lengths and is particularly powerful for aligning proteins with nonsequential similarities, such as domain shuffling or circular permutations, which are challenging for traditional DP methods. UniOTalign therefore offers a new, mathematically principled, global matching paradigm for protein alignment, moving beyond the limitations of path-finding algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Early recurrence (ER) prediction after curative-intent resection remains a critical challenge in the clinical management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Although contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) with full multi-phase acquisition is recommended in clinical guidelines and routinely performed in many tertiary centers, complete phase coverage is not consistently available across all institutions. In practice, single-phase portal venous (PV) scans are often used alone, particularly in settings with limited imaging resources, variations in acquisition protocols, or patient-related factors such as contrast intolerance or motion artifacts. This variability results in a mismatch between idealized model assumptions and the practical constraints of real-world deployment, underscoring the need for methods that can effectively leverage limited multi-phase data. To address this challenge, we propose a Dual-Branch Prototype-guided (DuoProto) framework that enhances ER prediction from single-phase CT by leveraging limited multi-phase data during training. DuoProto employs a dual-branch architecture: the main branch processes single-phase images, while the auxiliary branch utilizes available multi-phase scans to guide representation learning via cross-domain prototype alignment. Structured prototype representations serve as class anchors to improve feature discrimination, and a ranking-based supervision mechanism incorporates clinically relevant recurrence risk factors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DuoProto outperforms existing methods, particularly under class imbalance and missing-phase conditions. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the dual-branch, prototype-guided design. Our framework aligns with current clinical application needs and provides a general solution for recurrence risk prediction in HCC, supporting more informed decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Wuchereria bancrofti, the parasitic roundworm responsible for lymphatic filariasis, permanently disables over 36 million people and places 657 million at risk across 39 countries. A major bottleneck for drug discovery is the lack of functional annotation for more than 90 percent of the W. bancrofti dark proteome, leaving many potential targets unidentified. In this work, we present a novel computational pipeline that converts W. bancrofti's unannotated amino acid sequence data into precise four-level Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers and drug candidates. We utilized a DEtection TRansformer to estimate the probability of enzymatic function, fine-tuned a hierarchical nearest neighbor EC predictor on 4,476 labeled parasite proteins, and applied rejection sampling to retain only four-level EC classifications at 100 percent confidence. This pipeline assigned precise EC numbers to 14,772 previously uncharacterized proteins and discovered 543 EC classes not previously known in W. bancrofti. A qualitative triage emphasizing parasite-specific targets, chemical tractability, biochemical importance, and biological plausibility prioritized six enzymes across five separate strategies: anti-Wolbachia cell-wall inhibition, proteolysis blockade, transmission disruption, purinergic immune interference, and cGMP-signaling destabilization. We curated a 43-compound library from ChEMBL and BindingDB and co-folded across multiple protein conformers with Boltz-2. All six targets exhibited at least moderately strong predicted binding affinities below 1 micromolar, with moenomycin analogs against peptidoglycan glycosyltransferase and NTPase inhibitors showing promising nanomolar hits and well-defined binding pockets. While experimental validation remains essential, our results provide the first large-scale functional map of the W. bancrofti dark proteome and accelerate early-stage drug development for the species.",

    "abstract": "Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) is emerging as a potentially transformative paradigm for modeling complex biomedical systems by integrating parameterized physical laws with data-driven methods. Here, we review three main classes of PIML frameworks: physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), and neural operators (NOs), highlighting their growing role in biomedical science and engineering. We begin with PINNs, which embed governing equations into deep learning models and have been successfully applied to biosolid and biofluid mechanics, mechanobiology, and medical imaging among other areas. We then review NODEs, which offer continuous-time modeling, especially suited to dynamic physiological systems, pharmacokinetics, and cell signaling. Finally, we discuss deep NOs as powerful tools for learning mappings between function spaces, enabling efficient simulations across multiscale and spatially heterogeneous biological domains. Throughout, we emphasize applications where physical interpretability, data scarcity, or system complexity make conventional black-box learning insufficient. We conclude by identifying open challenges and future directions for advancing PIML in biomedical science and engineering, including issues of uncertainty quantification, generalization, and integration of PIML and large language models.",

Previous studies in the physics literature have addressed these questions using heuristic methods. Here, we utilize rigorous mathematical arguments to derive the results from the physics literature.

    "title": "Reducing Latency and Noise in PPG-Based SpO2 Measurements: A Kalman Filtering Approach Towards Acute Hypoxia Detection",
    "abstract": "Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a common tool for monitoring cardiopulmonary health. Relying on absorption or reflectance of light by hemoglobin in the blood, the measured PPG waveform can be analyzed per heart beat using physiological assumptions to extract metrics ranging from heart rate to specific blood oxygenation (SpO2). This has led to the widespread use of PPG for bedside clinical monitoring to wearable consumer health monitoring. However, PPG is notoriously noisy and the measured absorption or reflectance of light is sensitive to factors such as body movement and contact with the skin. To reduce the noise in the PPG-derived SpO2, we developed combined traditional methods of estimating SpO2 from the PPG waveform with a new method to extract changes in SpO2 from the PPG waveform in a Kalman filter, and demonstrated its ability to better estimate SpO2 in humans undergoing controlled hypoxia (down to 14% atmospheric oxygen). The Kalman filter reduced variability in SpO2 to 4.30%SpO2 compared to the beat-to-beat SpO2 variability of 12.59%SpO2. This mirrored current methods of window-averaging the beat-to-beat SpO2, with a 30s window-average reducing SpO2 variability to 4.73%. However, current window-average methods also introduce delays, with 10s and 30s window-averaging introducing delays of 5s and 14s respectively compared to the beat-to-beat SpO2. The Kalman filter reduced this delay to within 3s of the beat-to-beat SpO2, highlighting its ability to reduce noise while maintaining SpO2 dynamics. This capability is particularly useful in reliably detecting clinically meaningful, but transient, hypoxic states, such as those observed during apnea.",

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is highly heterogeneous, with five-year survival rates dropping from $\\sim$90% in localized disease to $\\sim$15% with distant metastases. Disease progression is shaped not only by tumor-intrinsic alterations but also by the reorganization of the tumor microenvironment (TME). Metabolic, compositional, and spatial changes contribute to this progression, but considered individually they lack context and often fail as therapeutic targets. Understanding their coordination could reveal processes to alter the disease course. Here, we combined multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI) with machine learning to profile metabolic, functional and spatial states of 522 colorectal lesions with single-cell resolution. We observed recurrent stage-specific remodeling marked by a lymphoid-to-myeloid shift, stromal-cancer cooperation, and malignant metabolic shifts. Spatial organization of epithelial, stromal, and immune compartments provided stronger stratification of disease stage than tumor-intrinsic changes or bulk immune infiltration alone. To systematically model these coordinated changes, we condensed multimodal features into 10 latent factors of TME organization. These factors tracked disease progression, were conserved across cohorts, and revealed frequent multicellular metabolic niches and distinct, non-exclusive TME trajectories. Our framework MuVIcell exposes the elements that together drive CRC progression by grouping co-occurring changes across cell types and feature classes into coordinated multicellular programs. This creates a rational basis to therapeutically target TME reorganization. Importantly, the framework is scalable and flexible, offering a resource for studying multicellular organization in other solid tumors.",

    "title": "Bridging Clinical Narratives and ACR Appropriateness Guidelines: A Multi-Agent RAG System for Medical Imaging Decisions",
    "abstract": "The selection of appropriate medical imaging procedures is a critical and complex clinical decision, guided by extensive evidence-based standards such as the ACR Appropriateness Criteria (ACR-AC). However, the underutilization of these guidelines, stemming from the difficulty of mapping unstructured patient narratives to structured criteria, contributes to suboptimal patient outcomes and increased healthcare costs. To bridge this gap, we introduce a multi-agent cognitive architecture that automates the translation of free-text clinical scenarios into specific, guideline-adherent imaging recommendations. Our system leverages a novel, domain-adapted dense retrieval model, ColBERT, fine-tuned on a synthetically generated dataset of 8,840 clinical scenario-recommendation pairs to achieve highly accurate information retrieval from the ACR-AC knowledge base. This retriever identifies candidate guidelines with a 93.9% top-10 recall, which are then processed by a sequence of LLM-based agents for selection and evidence-based synthesis. We evaluate our architecture using GPT-4.1 and MedGemma agents, demonstrating a state-of-the-art exact match accuracy of 81%, meaning that in 81% of test cases the predicted procedure set was identical to the guideline's reference set, and an F1-score of 0.879. This represents a 67-percentage-point absolute improvement in accuracy over a strong standalone GPT-4.1 baseline, underscoring the contribution that our architecture makes to a frontier model. These results were obtained on a challenging test set with substantial lexical divergence from the source guidelines. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/demo-iclr-B567/",

    "abstract": "Medical imaging has revolutionized diagnosis, yet unnecessary procedures are rising, exposing patients to radiation and stress, limiting equitable access, and straining healthcare systems. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria, developed through extensive multidisciplinary review, provide evidence-based guidance but remain underutilized. Leveraging advances in LLM reasoning, we introduce a Reasoning Agent trained with Reinforcement Learning (RL), specifically Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), to replicate expert clinical reasoning from the ACR Criteria. We present a novel RL approach for structured medical reasoning, systematically comparing reasoning-focused reward functions and evidence integration strategies. Our lightweight 8B model, MedReason-Embed, improves macro F1 by 18% over baseline, shows stronger reasoning alignment, and outperforms both larger and alternatively trained models, showing that reasoning-based supervision enables efficient, trustworthy clinical AI. Building on this, we design a modular end-to-end agentic architecture that automates imaging referrals: mapping diagnoses to ICD codes, retrieving PubMed evidence, and recommending optimal procedures. Crucially, the ability to generalize beyond static ACR guidelines not only enables clinicians to handle out-of-distribution cases, but also supports scaling the guideline development process itself, potentially reducing the significant effort required to create and update them. This work shows the potential of reasoning-focused RL within agentic architectures to deliver transparent, scalable, and reliable clinical decision support.

    "abstract": "Correlated motions of proteins underpin many physiological mechanisms, such as substrate binding, signal transduction, enzymatic activity and allostery. These motions arise from low frequency collective movements of biomolecules and have mostly been studied using molecular dynamics simulations. Here, we present the effects of two different empirical energy force fields used for molecular dynamics simulations on correlated motions -- the non-polarizable CHARMM 36m additive force field and the polarizable Drude-2019 force field. The study was conducted on two proteins, ubiquitin - a small protein with a well-described dynamic - and the nuclear receptor protein PPAR___. The ligand binding domain of PPAR___ was of particular interest since its function is to regulate transcription through ligand and coregulator protein binding. It has been previously shown that a dynamical network of correlated motions ensures the transmission of information related to PPAR___ ligand binding. We present the results of classical MD simulations where we analyze the results in terms of residue fluctuations, residue correlation maps, community network analysis and hydrophobic cluster analysis. We find that RMS fluctuations tend to be greater and correlated motions are less intense with Drude-2019 force field than with the non-polarizable all atom additive force field. Analysis of large hydrophobic clusters in the respective proteins show a greater loss of native contacts in the simulations using the Drude-2019 force field than in the simulations using the all atom force additive force field. Our results provide the first quantification of the impact of using a polarizable force field in computational studies that focus on correlated motions.",

Discrete approximations, such as the cell vertex model, can accommodate these geometric features, but techniques for analysis of such models are underdeveloped. Here, we express differential operators defined on a network representing a monolayer of confluent cells in the framework of discrete exterior calculus, considering scalar fields defined over cell vertices and centres and vector fields defined over cell edges. We achieve this by defining Hodge stars, wedge products and musical isomorphisms that are appropriate for a disordered monolayer for which cell edges and links between cell centres are not orthogonal, as is generic for epithelia. We use this framework to evaluate the harmonic vector field arising in an ablated monolayer, demonstrating an approximate 1/\\textit{r} scaling of the upper bound of the field's amplitude, where \\textit{r} is the distance from the ablation. Using a vertex model that incorporates osmotic effects, we then calculate the mechanical response of a monolayer in a jammed state to ablation. Perturbation displacements exhibit long-range coherence, monopolar and quadrupolar features, and an approximate 1/\\textit{r} near-hole upper-bound scaling, implicating the harmonic field. The upper bounds on perturbation stress amplitudes scale approximately like 1/\\textit{r}$^2$, a feature relevant to long-range mechanical signalling.",

Denoising-based methods include diffusion and flow-matching methods that learn mappings from a simple base distribution to the molecular conformer distribution. However, these approaches often suffer from error accumulation during sampling, especially in the low SNR steps, which are hard to train. To address these challenges, we propose a flow-matching refiner for the MCG task. The proposed method initializes sampling from mixed-quality outputs produced by upstream denoising models and reschedules the noise scale to bypass the low-SNR phase, thereby improving sample quality. On the GEOM-QM9 and GEOM-Drugs benchmark datasets, the generator-refiner pipeline improves quality with fewer total denoising steps while preserving diversity.",

    "abstract": "Optical microscopy is one of the most widely used techniques in research studies for life sciences and biomedicine. These applications require reliable experimental pipelines to extract valuable knowledge from the measured samples and must be supported by image quality assessment (IQA) to ensure correct processing and analysis of the image data. IQA methods are implemented with variable complexity. However, while most quality metrics have a straightforward implementation, they might be time consuming and computationally expensive when evaluating a large dataset. In addition, quality metrics are often designed for well-defined image features and may be unstable for images out of the ideal domain. To overcome these limitations, recent works have proposed deep learning-based IQA methods, which can provide superior performance, increased generalizability and fast prediction. Our method, named $\\mathrmμ$DeepIQA, is inspired by previous studies and applies a deep convolutional neural network designed for IQA on natural images to optical microscopy measurements. We retrained the same architecture to predict individual quality metrics and global quality scores for optical microscopy data. The resulting models provide fast and stable predictions of image quality by generalizing quality estimation even outside the ideal range of standard methods. In addition, $\\mathrmμ$DeepIQA provides patch-wise prediction of image quality and can be used to visualize spatially varying quality in a single image. Our study demonstrates that optical microscopy-based studies can benefit from the generalizability of deep learning models due to their stable performance in the presence of outliers, the ability to assess small image patches, and rapid predictions.",

    "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful technique for enriching Large Language Models (LLMs) with external knowledge, allowing for factually grounded responses, a critical requirement in high-stakes domains such as healthcare. However, the efficacy of RAG systems is fundamentally restricted by the performance of their retrieval module, since irrelevant or semantically misaligned documents directly compromise the accuracy of the final generated response. General-purpose dense retrievers can struggle with the nuanced language of specialised domains, while the high accuracy of in-domain models is often achieved at prohibitive computational costs. In this work, we aim to address this trade-off by developing and evaluating a two-stage retrieval architecture that combines a lightweight ModernBERT bidirectional encoder for efficient initial candidate retrieval with a ColBERTv2 late-interaction model for fine-grained re-ranking. We conduct comprehensive evaluations of our retriever module performance and RAG system performance in the biomedical context, fine-tuning the IR module using 10k question-passage pairs from PubMedQA. Our analysis of the retriever module confirmed the positive impact of the ColBERT re-ranker, which improved Recall@3 by up to 4.2 percentage points compared to its retrieve-only counterpart. When integrated into the biomedical RAG, our IR module leads to a state-of-the-art average accuracy of 0.4448 on the five tasks of the MIRAGE question-answering benchmark, outperforming strong baselines such as MedCPT (0.4436). Our ablation studies reveal that this performance is critically dependent on a joint fine-tuning process that aligns the retriever and re-ranker; otherwise, the re-ranker might degrade the performance.",

While recent advances in machine learning have improved prediction of TCR-pMHC binding, the most effective approaches are black-box transformer models that cannot provide a rationale for predictions. Post-hoc explanation methods can provide insight with respect to the input but do not explicitly model biochemical mechanisms (e.g. known binding regions), as in TCR-pMHC binding. ``Explain-by-design'' models (i.e., with architectural components that can be examined directly after training) have been explored in other domains, but have not been used for TCR-pMHC binding. We propose explainable model layers (TCR-EML) that can be incorporated into protein-language model backbones for TCR-pMHC modeling. Our approach uses prototype layers for amino acid residue contacts drawn from known TCR-pMHC binding mechanisms, enabling high-quality explanations for predicted TCR-pMHC binding.

    "abstract": "Arterial aneurysm (Fig.1) is a bulb-shape local expansion of human arteries, the rupture of which is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in US. Therefore, the prediction of arterial aneurysm rupture is of great significance for aneurysm management and treatment selection. The prediction of aneurysm rupture depends on the analysis of the time series of aneurysm growth history. However, due to the long time scale of aneurysm growth, the time series of aneurysm growth is not always accessible. We here proposed a method to reconstruct the aneurysm growth time series directly from patient parameters. The prediction is based on data pairs of [patient parameters, patient aneurysm growth time history]. To obtain the mapping from patient parameters to patient aneurysm growth time history, we first apply autoencoder to obtain a compact representation of the time series for each patient. Then a mapping is learned from patient parameters to the corresponding compact representation of time series via a five-layer neural network. Moving average and convolutional output layer are implemented to explicitly taking account the time dependency of the time series.   Apart from that, we also propose to use prior knowledge about the mechanism of aneurysm growth to improve the time series reconstruction results. The prior physics-based knowledge is incorporated as constraints for the optimization problem associated with autoencoder. The model can handle both algebraic and differential constraints. Our results show that including physical model information about the data will not significantly improve the time series reconstruction results if the training data is error-free. However, in the case of training data with noise and bias error, incorporating physical model constraints can significantly improve the predicted time series.",

    "abstract": "High-resolution imaging provides dense trajectories of migrating cells, flocking animals, and synthetic active particles, from which interaction laws can be determined with a wide variety of methods. Yet, distinguishing whether front-back or lateral biases seen in such data reflect intrinsic anisotropy in the interaction kernel or emergent correlations that are nevertheless produced by isotropic pairwise interaction forces remains an open challenge. We resolve this ambiguity by deriving a linear partial differential equation that connects measurable two-point velocity correlations to an unknown, distance- and angle-dependent interaction kernel. Turing-like instabilities can occur which allows for dipolar or quadrupolar patterns to arise even when agents interact according to an underlying attraction-repulsion law that is angle-independent. We then show that incorporating a weak velocity-alignment force can interfere with anisotropic pattern formation by suppressing dipolar patterns. We validate these predictions with agent-based simulations and provide design guidance for experiments that seek to discriminate intrinsic anisotropy from emergent effects.",

    "abstract": "The development of multicellular organisms entails a deep connection between time-dependent biochemical processes taking place at the subcellular level, and the resulting macroscopic phenotypes that arise in populations of up to trillions of cells. A statistical mechanics of developmental processes would help to understand how microscopic genotypes map onto macroscopic phenotypes, a general goal across biology. Here we follow this approach, hypothesizing that development should be understood as a thermodynamic transition between non-equilibrium states. We test this hypothesis in the context of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, a model organism used widely in genetics and developmental biology for over a century. Applying a variety of information-theoretic measures to public transcriptomics datasets of whole fly embryos during development, we show that the global temporal dynamics of gene expression can be understood as a process that probabilistically guides embryonic dynamics across macroscopic phenotypic stages. In particular, we demonstrate signatures of irreversibility in the information complexity of transcriptomic dynamics, as measured mainly by the permutation entropy of indexed ensembles (PI entropy). Our results show that the dynamics of PI entropy correlate strongly with developmental stages. Overall, this is a test case in applying information complexity analysis to relate the statistical mechanics of biomarkers to macroscopic developmental dynamics.",

    "title": "Scale dependence in hidden Markov models for animal movement",
    "abstract": "Hidden Markov models (HMMs) have been used increasingly to understand how movement patterns of animals arise from behavioural states. An animal is assumed to transition between behavioural states through time, as described by transition probabilities. Within each state, the movement typically follows a discrete-time random walk, where steps between successive observed locations are described in terms of step lengths (related to speed) and turning angles (related to tortuosity). HMMs are discrete-time models, and most of their outputs strongly depend on the temporal resolution of data. We compile known theoretical results about scale dependence in Markov chains and correlated random walks, which are the most common components of HMMs for animal movement. We also illustrate this phenomenon using simulations covering a wide range of biological scenarios. The scale dependence affects not only all model parameters, i.e., the transition probabilities and the movement parameters within each behavioural state, but also the overall classification of movement patterns into states. This highlights the importance of carefully considering the time resolution when drawing conclusions from the results of analysis. In addition, scale dependence generally precludes the analysis of tracking data collected at irregular time intervals, and the comparison (or combination) of data sets with different sampling rates. HMMs remain a valuable tool to answer questions about animal movement and behaviour, as long as these limitations are well understood.",

    "abstract": "Designing mRNA sequences is a major challenge in developing next-generation therapeutics, since it involves exploring a vast space of possible nucleotide combinations while optimizing sequence properties like stability, translation efficiency, and protein expression. While Generative Flow Networks are promising for this task, their training is hindered by sparse, long-horizon rewards and multi-objective trade-offs. We propose Curriculum-Augmented GFlowNets (CAGFN), which integrate curriculum learning with multi-objective GFlowNets to generate de novo mRNA sequences. CAGFN integrates a length-based curriculum that progressively adapts the maximum sequence length guiding exploration from easier to harder subproblems. We also provide a new mRNA design environment for GFlowNets which, given a target protein sequence and a combination of biological objectives, allows for the training of models that generate plausible mRNA candidates. This provides a biologically motivated setting for applying and advancing GFlowNets in therapeutic sequence design. On different mRNA design tasks, CAGFN improves Pareto performance and biological plausibility, while maintaining diversity. Moreover, CAGFN reaches higher-quality solutions faster than a GFlowNet trained with random sequence sampling (no curriculum), and enables generalization to out-of-distribution sequences.",

    "title": "Heterogeneous immune recovery after viral response through a dynamical model of feedback-driven persistence and clearance",
    "abstract": "Viral infections trigger complex immune responses with heterogeneous outcomes shaped by nonlinear feedbacks. An ordinary differential equation model is developed to investigate immune response dynamics during viral infection, incorporating six modules: viral load, innate immunity, cellular immunity, humoral immunity, immune suppression, and IL-6 levels. Bifurcation analysis reveals that under continuous viral exposure, when viral clearance rate and intrinsic viral death rate satisfy specific conditions, the system exhibits up to five stable equilibria. This indicates that different health and disease states may coexist depending on initial conditions, while severe inflammation mainly arises from strong activation of cellular immunity, highlighting the complexity of immune responses. Simulations of finite-time viral exposure demonstrate multi-timescale recovery characteristics: viral load and IL-6 levels decline rapidly, whereas humoral immune activation and immunosuppression show delayed and sustained patterns. Furthermore, analysis of infectious period and disease duration also indicates that during transition from early acute response to chronic disease, viral replication rate plays a critical role, while immune response intensity is sensitive to both viral clearance and immune self-activation. Subsystem analysis identifies the three-component subsystem of viral load, innate immunity, and cellular immunity as core drivers of bistability and oscillations, while humoral immunity, immune suppression, and IL-6 primarily modulate response amplitude and timing. This work establishes a theoretical framework for analyzing immune response and chronic risks through feedback dynamical modelling, providing insights for intervention strategies.",

In this study, we conducted acute experiments on four pigs in which epineural cuff electrodes with multiple contacts were placed around upper limb nerves. A subset of electrical stimulation configurations -- previously identified via computational study -- was applied, and the resulting evoked electromyographic (EMG) responses were recorded from target muscles. Muscle recruitment curves were extracted and analysed offline to quantify activation patterns. Following the electrophysiological experiments, the stimulated nerves were harvested and processed for histological analysis to visualize fascicular organization and distribution. This work presents preliminary results from the combined analysis of muscle activation profiles and fascicle anatomy in one animal. Our findings aim to inform the design of stimulation strategies by linking electrode configuration to selective muscle recruitment, ultimately contributing to more effective neuromodulation and neuroprosthetic applications.",

To understand how this is achieved, we systematically compare three different feature-fusion designs and fine-tuning recipes. Our results reveal that both the fusion method and the tuning strategy strongly affect final accuracy, indicating that the fine-tuning process is not trivial. We hope this work offers practical guidance for injecting structure into pretrained protein language models and motivates further research on better fusion mechanisms and fine-tuning protocols.",

    "abstract": "Low vision involves a range of visual impairments that significantly impact daily activities, particularly navigation in urban environments. Individuals with low vision often develop adaptive strategies to compensate for visual deficits, relying on head movements to bring objects into their remaining functional field of vision. Research suggests that they focus on road surface markings and building edges to aid in wayfinding and collision avoidance. However, urban navigation presents additional challenges, as obstacles, moving hazards, and tripping dangers may enter their visual loss field, increasing the risk of injury. Traditional eye movement studies are typically conducted in controlled laboratory settings with fixed head positions, limiting the understanding of head-eye coordination in real-world environments. To bridge this gap, we designed a naturalistic, \"free-head\" experiment using eye-tracking technology to examine head and eye movement patterns during urban navigation. Participants with low vision were compared to a control cohort without visual impairment to test the hypothesis that eye and head movements become decoupled in visually impaired individuals. Findings indicate that individuals with peripheral field loss exhibit significant eye-head decoupling, while those with acuity loss demonstrate more synchronized movements. Results for individuals with central field loss were inconclusive but revealed distinct movement patterns. These insights provide valuable direction for rehabilitation strategies, assistive-mobility technologies, and urban design improvements. By expanding research on eye-head coordination, this study contributes to the development of interventions that enhance safety, mobility, and independence for individuals with low vision in complex urban environments.",

    "abstract": "Blood transfusion remains a cornerstone of modern medicine, saving countless lives daily. Yet the quality of transfused blood varies dramatically among donors-a critical factor often overlooked in clinical practice. Rapid, benchtop, and cost-effective methods for evaluating stored red blood cells (RBCs) at the site of transfusion are lacking, with concerns persisting about the association between metabolic signatures of stored RBC quality and transfusion outcomes. Recent studies utilizing metabolomics approaches to evaluate stored erythrocytes find that donor biology (e.g., genetics, age, lifestyle factors) underlies the heterogeneity associated with blood storage and transfusion. The appreciation of donor-intrinsic factors provides opportunities for precision transfusion medicine approaches for the evaluation of storage quality and prediction of transfusion efficacy. Here we propose a new platform, the Surface Acoustic Wave Hemolysis Assay (SAW-HA), for on-site evaluation of stored RBCs utilizing SAW Hemolysis Temperature (SAWHT) as a marker for RBC quality. We report SAWHT as a mechanism-dependent reproducible methodology for evaluating stored human RBCs up to 42 days. Our results define unique signatures for SAW hemolysis and metabolic profiles in RBCs from two of the six donors in which high body mass index (BMI) and RBC triglycerides associated with increased susceptibility to hemolysis. Metabolic age of the stored RBCs - a recently appreciated predictor of post-transfusion efficacy-reveal that RBCs from the two low SAWHT units were characterized by disrupted redox control, deficient tryptophan metabolism, and high BMI. Together, these findings indicate the potential of the SAW-HA as a point-of-care analysis for transfusion medicine.",

An open question is how to select the best models for the ensemble without access to ground truth labels. In this study, we investigate an uncertainty-guided strategy for model selection. We demonstrate on an siRNA knockdown efficacy task that a TabPFN model using straightforward sequence-based features can surpass specialized state-of-the-art predictors. We also show that the model's predicted inter-quantile range (IQR), a measure of its uncertainty, has a negative correlation with true prediction error. We developed the OligoICP method, which selects and averages an ensemble of models with the lowest mean IQR for siRNA efficacy prediction, achieving superior performance compared to naive ensembling or using a single model trained on all available data. This finding highlights model uncertainty as a powerful, label-free heuristic for optimizing biomolecule efficacy predictions.",

We develop a stochastic model in which T cell-APCs interact via a sequence of recognition steps, represented as a multistage Markov chain. T cells are successfully activated only if the terminal state associated with a cognate APC is reached. We compute the probability of successful activation in the presence of interfering non-cognate APCs, T cell degradation, and lymph node exit, and analyze the mean first-passage time to activation. We also incorporate a kinetic proofreading mechanism that enables state resetting, and show how this enhances specificity toward cognate APCs.",

    "abstract": "Image denoising is a fundamental problem in computer vision and medical imaging. However, real-world images are often degraded by structured noise with strong anisotropic correlations that existing methods struggle to remove. Most data-driven approaches rely on large datasets with high-quality labels and still suffer from limited generalizability, whereas existing zero-shot methods avoid this limitation but remain effective only for independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) noise. To address this gap, we propose Median2Median (M2M), a zero-shot denoising framework designed for structured noise. M2M introduces a novel sampling strategy that generates pseudo-independent sub-image pairs from a single noisy input. This strategy leverages directional interpolation and generalized median filtering to adaptively exclude values distorted by structured artifacts. To further enlarge the effective sampling space and eliminate systematic bias, a randomized assignment strategy is employed, ensuring that the sampled sub-image pairs are suitable for Noise2Noise training. In our realistic simulation studies, M2M performs on par with state-of-the-art zero-shot methods under i.i.d. noise, while consistently outperforming them under correlated noise. These findings establish M2M as an efficient, data-free solution for structured noise suppression and mark the first step toward effective zero-shot denoising beyond the strict i.i.d. assumption.",

    "abstract": "Objective: To develop an explainable multimodal large language model (MM-LLM) that (1) screens optic nerve head (ONH) OCT circle scans for quality and (2) generates structured clinical reports that include glaucoma diagnosis and sector-wise retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thinning assessments. Design: Retrospective cohort study of 1,310 subjects contributing 43,849 Spectralis ONH OCT circle scans (1,331 glaucomatous and 867 healthy eyes) from the DIGS and ADAGES cohorts. Methods: A MM-LLM (Llama 3.2 Vision-Instruct model) was fine-tuned to generate clinical descriptions of OCT imaging data. Training data included paired OCT images and automatically generated, structured clinical reports that described global and sectoral RNFL thinning. Poor-quality scans were labeled as unusable and paired with a fixed refusal statement. The model was evaluated on a held-out test set for three tasks: quality assessment, glaucoma detection, and RNFL thinning classification across seven anatomical sectors. Evaluation metrics included accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and F1-score. Model description quality was also evaluated using standard text evaluation metrics. Results: The model achieved 0.90 accuracy and 0.98 specificity for quality triage. For glaucoma detection, accuracy was 0.86 (sensitivity 0.91, specificity 0.73, F1-score 0.91). RNFL thinning prediction accuracy ranged from 0.83 to 0.94, with highest performance in global and temporal sectors. Text generation scores showed strong alignment with reference reports (BLEU: 0.82; ROUGE-1: 0.94; ROUGE-2: 0.87; ROUGE-L: 0.92; BERTScore-F1: 0.99). Conclusions: The fine-tuned MM-LLM generated accurate clinical descriptions based on OCT imaging. The model achieved high accuracy in identifying image quality issues and detecting glaucoma. The model also provided sectoral descriptions of RNFL thinning to help support clinical OCT evaluation.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and biomedical foundation models (BioFMs) have achieved strong results in biological text reasoning, molecular modeling, and single-cell analysis, yet they remain siloed in disjoint embedding spaces, limiting cross-modal reasoning. We present BIOVERSE (Biomedical Vector Embedding Realignment for Semantic Engagement), a two-stage approach that adapts pretrained BioFMs as modality encoders and aligns them with LLMs through lightweight, modality-specific projection layers. The approach first aligns each modality to a shared LLM space through independently trained projections, allowing them to interoperate naturally, and then applies standard instruction tuning with multi-modal data to bring them together for downstream reasoning. By unifying raw biomedical data with knowledge embedded in LLMs, the approach enables zero-shot annotation, cross-modal question answering, and interactive, explainable dialogue. Across tasks spanning cell-type annotation, molecular description, and protein function reasoning, compact BIOVERSE configurations surpass larger LLM baselines while enabling richer, generative outputs than existing BioFMs, establishing a foundation for principled multi-modal biomedical reasoning.",

This paper proposes the Adaptive Federated Few-Shot Rare-Disease Diagnosis (AFFR) framework, which integrates three pillars: (i) few-shot federated optimization with meta-learning to generalize from limited patient samples, (ii) energy-aware client scheduling to mitigate device dropouts and ensure balanced participation, and (iii) secure aggregation with calibrated differential privacy to safeguard sensitive model updates. Unlike prior work that addresses these aspects in isolation, AFFR unifies them into a modular pipeline deployable on real-world clinical networks. Experimental evaluation on simulated rare-disease detection datasets demonstrates up to 10% improvement in accuracy compared with baseline FL, while reducing client dropouts by over 50% without degrading convergence. Furthermore, privacy-utility trade-offs remain within clinically acceptable bounds. These findings highlight AFFR as a practical pathway for equitable and trustworthy federated diagnosis of rare conditions.",

To capture biologically meaningful patterns consistent with known cellular morphologies, MorphGen is trained with an alignment loss to match its representations to the phenotypic embeddings of OpenPhenom, a state-of-the-art biological foundation model. Unlike prior approaches that compress multichannel stains into RGB images -- thus sacrificing organelle-specific detail -- MorphGen generates the complete set of fluorescent channels jointly, preserving per-organelle structures and enabling a fine-grained morphological analysis that is essential for biological interpretation. We demonstrate biological consistency with real images via CellProfiler features, and MorphGen attains an FID score over 35% lower than the prior state-of-the-art MorphoDiff, which only generates RGB images for a single cell type.

This yields closed- form survival and hazard functions and captures time-varying risk without assuming proportional- hazards. We compare DeepFHT with Cox regression using synthetic and real-world datasets. The method achieves predictive accuracy on par with the state-of-the-art approach, while maintaining a physics- based interpretable parameterization that elucidates the relation between input features and risk.

While our prior work has evaluated early-generation AI cell foundation models in this domain, the effectiveness of recent cell foundation models remains unclear. In this study, we benchmark advanced AI cell foundation models (2025), including CellViT++ variants and Cellpose-SAM, against three widely used cell foundation models developed prior to 2024, using a diverse large-scale set of kidney image patches within a human-in-the-loop rating framework. We further performed fusion-based ensemble evaluation and model agreement analysis to assess the segmentation capabilities of the different models. Our results show that CellViT++ [Virchow] yields the highest standalone performance with 40.3% of predictions rated as \"Good\" on a curated set of 2,091 challenging samples, outperforming all prior models. In addition, our fused model achieves 62.2% \"Good\" predictions and only 0.4% \"Bad\", substantially reducing segmentation errors. Notably, the fusion model (2025) successfully resolved the majority of challenging cases that remained unaddressed in our previous study. These findings demonstrate the potential of AI cell foundation model development in renal pathology and provide a curated dataset of challenging samples to support future kidney-specific model refinement.",

    "abstract": "Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) aims to extract non-contact physiological signals from facial videos and has shown great potential. However, existing rPPG approaches struggle to bridge the gap between source and target domains. Recent test-time adaptation (TTA) solutions typically optimize rPPG model for the incoming test videos using self-training loss under an unrealistic assumption that the target domain remains stationary. However, time-varying factors like weather and lighting in dynamic environments often cause continual domain shifts. The erroneous gradients accumulation from these shifts may corrupt the model's key parameters for physiological information, leading to catastrophic forgetting. Therefore, We propose a physiology-related parameters freezing strategy to retain such knowledge. It isolates physiology-related and domain-related parameters by assessing the model's uncertainty to current domain and freezes the physiology-related parameters during adaptation to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Moreover, the dynamic domain shifts with various non-physiological characteristics may lead to conflicting optimization objectives during TTA, which is manifested as the over-adapted model losing its adaptability to future domains. To fix over-adaptation, we propose a preemptive gradient modification strategy. It preemptively adapts to future domains and uses the acquired gradients to modify current adaptation, thereby preserving the model's adaptability. In summary, we propose a stable continual test-time adaptation (CTTA) framework for rPPG measurement, called \\textbf{PhysRAP}, which \\textbf{R}emembers the past, \\textbf{A}dapts to the present, and \\textbf{P}reempts the future. Extensive experiments show its state-of-the-art performance, especially in domain shifts. The code is available at https://github.com/xjtucsy/PhysRAP.",

    "abstract": "MacroB12 interference presents a significant challenge in the diagnosis of Vitamin B12 status, potentially masking true deficiency. To establish robust predictors and quantify the utility of pre-polyethylene glycol (PEG) B12 levels, we conducted a retrospective analysis of 875 individuals with hypercobalaminaemia (greater than 1000 pg/mL), using multiple imputation to handle missing data. Multivariable regression modelling revealed that MacroB12 positivity (less than 30% PEG recovery) was independently associated with a profile suggestive of autoimmunity, including older age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.03 per year, P<0.001) and a Rheumatologic/Autoimmune diagnosis (aOR 2.96, P=0.01). We also identified a counterintuitive haematological signature, with higher haemoglobin (aOR 1.14, P=0.02) and Mean Corpuscular Volume (aOR 1.04, P=0.01) predicting MacroB12. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis of pre-PEG B12 concentration yielded only moderate discriminatory power (Area Under the Curve [AUC] = 0.744, 95% CI 0.707-0.782). The optimal threshold of 1584.0 pg/mL (sensitivity 71.3%, specificity 69.7%) serves to stratify clinical suspicion, but its performance confirms that it cannot replace definitive confirmatory testing. Our findings define a clinical and laboratory phenotype for suspected MacroB12 but highlight that confirmatory PEG precipitation remains essential for accurate diagnosis, particularly in older patients and those with autoimmune disease.",

    "abstract": "Assessing the practical identifiability of epidemic models is essential for determining whether parameters can be meaningfully estimated from observed data. Monte Carlo (MC) methods provide an accessible and intuitive framework; however, their standard implementation - perturbing deterministic trajectories with independent Gaussian noise - rests on assumptions poorly suited to epidemic processes, which are inherently stochastic, temporally correlated, and highly variable, especially in small populations or under slow transmission. In this study, we investigate the structure of stochastic variability in the classic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model across a range of epidemiological regimes, and assess whether it can be represented within the independent Gaussian noise framework. We show that continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) trajectories consistently exhibit super-Poissonian variability and strong temporal dependence. Through coverage analysis, we further demonstrate that independent Gaussian noise systematically underestimates the variability of the underlying stochastic process, leading to overly optimistic conclusions about parameter identifiability. In addition, we propose a hybrid simulation approach that introduces time- and amplitude-dependent variability into deterministic ODE trajectories, preserving computational efficiency while capturing key features of epidemic stochasticity. Our findings highlight the limitations of the standard MC algorithm and provide a pathway for incorporating more realistic noise structures into epidemic inference.",

In this study, we introduce a unified framework based on multiscale commutative algebra to capture intrinsic physical and chemical interactions for the first time. Leveraging Persistent Stanley-Reisner Theory, we extract multiscale algebraic invariants to build a Commutative Algebra neural Network (CANet). Integrated with transformer features and auxiliary physical features, we apply CANet to tackle three key domains for the first time: disease-associated mutations, mutation-induced protein stability changes, and solubility changes upon mutations. Across six benchmark tasks, CANet and its gradient boosting tree counterpart, CATree, consistently attain state-of-the-art performance, achieving up to 7.5% improvement in predictive accuracy. Our approach offers multiscale, mechanistic, interpretable,and generalizable models for predicting disease-mutation associations.",

On synthetic data containing jump, drift, diffusion, and noise anomalies, the framework accurately identifies diverse deviations. Applied to infant gut microbiome trajectories, it delineates the magnitude and persistence of antibiotic-induced disruptions: revealing prolonged anomalies after second antibiotic courses, extended duration treatments, and exposures during the second year of life. We further demonstrate the predictive capabilities of the inferred anomaly scores in accurately predicting antibiotic events and outperforming diversity-based baselines.

    "title": "Behavioural Classification in C. elegans: a Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Locomotion",
    "abstract": "The 1mm roundworm C. elegans is a model organism used in many sub-areas of biology to investigate different types of biological processes. In order to complement the n-vivo analysis with computer-based investigations, several methods have been proposed to simulate the worm behaviour. These methods extract discrete behavioural units from the flow of the worm movements using different types of tracking techniques. Nevertheless, these techniques require a clear view of the entire worm body, which is not always achievable. For example, this happens in high density worm conditions, which are particularly informative to understand the influence of the social context on the single worm behaviour. In this paper, we illustrate and evaluate a method to extract behavioural units from recordings of C. elegans movements which do not necessarily require a clear view of the entire worm body. Moreover, the behavioural units are defined by an unsupervised automatic pipeline which frees the process from predefined assumptions that inevitably bias the behavioural analysis. The behavioural units resulting from the automatic method are interpreted by comparing them with hand-designed behavioural units. The effectiveness of the automatic method is evaluated by measuring the extent to which the movement of a simulated worm, with an agent-based model, matches the movement of a natural worm. Our results indicate that spatio-temporal locomotory patterns emerge even from single point worm tracking. Moreover, we show that such patterns represent a fundamental aspect of the behavioural classification process.",

    "abstract": "Recovering unbiased properties from biased or perturbed simulations is a central challenge in rare-event sampling. Classical Girsanov Reweighting (GR) offers a principled solution by yielding exact pathwise probability ratios between perturbed and reference processes. However, the variance of GR weights grows rapidly with time, rendering it impractical for long-horizon reweighting. We introduce Marginal Girsanov Reweighting (MGR), which mitigates variance explosion by marginalizing over intermediate paths, producing stable and scalable weights for long-timescale dynamics. Experiments demonstrate that MGR (i) accurately recovers kinetic properties from umbrella-sampling trajectories in molecular dynamics, and (ii) enables efficient Bayesian parameter inference for stochastic differential equations with temporally sparse observations.",

    "abstract": "Molecular foundation models are rapidly advancing scientific discovery, but their unreliability on out-of-distribution (OOD) samples severely limits their application in high-stakes domains such as drug discovery and protein design. A critical failure mode is chemical hallucination, where models make high-confidence yet entirely incorrect predictions for unknown molecules. To address this challenge, we introduce Molecular Preference-Aligned Instance Ranking (Mole-PAIR), a simple, plug-and-play module that can be flexibly integrated with existing foundation models to improve their reliability on OOD data through cost-effective post-training. Specifically, our method formulates the OOD detection problem as a preference optimization over the estimated OOD affinity between in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples, achieving this goal through a pairwise learning objective. We show that this objective essentially optimizes AUROC, which measures how consistently ID and OOD samples are ranked by the model. Extensive experiments across five real-world molecular datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the OOD detection capabilities of existing molecular foundation models, achieving up to 45.8%, 43.9%, and 24.3% improvements in AUROC under distribution shifts of size, scaffold, and assay, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning has markedly advanced de novo peptide sequencing (DNS) for mass spectrometry-based proteomics. DNS tools offer a reliable way to identify peptides without relying on reference databases, extending proteomic analysis and unlocking applications into less-charted regions of the proteome. However, they still face a key limitation. DNS tools lack principled methods for estimating false discovery rates (FDR) and instead rely on model-specific confidence scores that are often miscalibrated. This limits trust in results, hinders cross-model comparisons and reduces validation success. Here we present Winnow, a model-agnostic framework for estimating FDR from calibrated DNS outputs. Winnow maps raw model scores to calibrated confidences using a neural network trained on peptide-spectrum match (PSM)-derived features. From these calibrated scores, Winnow computes PSM-specific error metrics and an experiment-wide FDR estimate using a novel decoy-free FDR estimator. It supports both zero-shot and dataset-specific calibration, enabling flexible application via direct inference, fine-tuning, or training a custom model. We demonstrate that, when applied to InstaNovo predictions, Winnow's calibrator improves recall at fixed FDR thresholds, and its FDR estimator tracks true error rates when benchmarked against reference proteomes and database search. Winnow ensures accurate FDR control across datasets, helping unlock the full potential of DNS.",

    "abstract": "Bayesian optimization is a natural candidate for the engineering of antibody therapeutic properties, which is often iterative and expensive. However, finding the optimal choice of surrogate model for optimization over the highly structured antibody space is difficult, and may differ depending on the property being optimized. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, no prior works have attempted to incorporate structural information into antibody Bayesian optimization. In this work, we explore different approaches to incorporating structural information into Bayesian optimization, and compare them to a variety of sequence-only approaches on two different antibody properties, binding affinity and stability. In addition, we propose the use of a protein language model-based ``soft constraint,'' which helps guide the optimization to promising regions of the space. We find that certain types of structural information improve data efficiency in early optimization rounds for stability, but have equivalent peak performance. Moreover, when incorporating the protein language model soft constraint we find that the data efficiency gap is diminished for affinity and eliminated for stability, resulting in sequence-only methods that match the performance of structure-based methods, raising questions about the necessity of structure in Bayesian optimization for antibodies.",

    "abstract": "Identifying DNA- (DBPs) and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) is crucial for the understanding of cell function, molecular interactions as well as regulatory functions. Owing to their high similarity, most of the existing approaches face challenges in differentiating between DBPs and RBPs leading to high cross-prediction errors. Moreover, identifying proteins which bind to both DNA and RNA (DRBPs) is also quite a challenging task. In this regard, we propose a novel framework viz. LAMP-PRo which is based on pre-trained protein language model (PLM), attention mechanisms and multi-label learning to mitigate these issues. First, pre-trained PLM such ESM-2 is used for embedding the protein sequences followed by convolutional neural network (CNN). Subsequently multi-head self-attention mechanism is applied for the contextual information while label-aware attention is used to compute class-specific representations by attending to the sequence in a way that is tailored to each label (DBP, RBP and non-NABP) in a multi-label setup. We have also included a novel cross-label attention mechanism to explicitly capture dependencies between DNA- and RNA-binding proteins, enabling more accurate prediction of DRBP. Finally, a linear layer followed by a sigmoid function are used for the final prediction. Extensive experiments are carried out to compare LAMP-PRo with the existing methods wherein the proposed model shows consistent competent performance. Furthermore, we also provide visualization to showcase model interpretability, highlighting which parts of the sequence are most relevant for a predicted label. The original datasets are available at http://bliulab.net/iDRBP\\_MMC and the codes are available at https://github.com/NimishaGhosh/LAMP-PRo.",

These systems can comprise billions of agents, requiring the computing resources of multiple servers to simulate. Unfortunately, the state-of-the-art platform, BioDynaMo, does not scale out across servers due to its shared-memory-based implementation.   To overcome this key limitation, we introduce TeraAgent, a distributed agent-based simulation engine. A critical challenge in distributed execution is the exchange of agent information across servers, which we identify as a major performance bottleneck. We propose two solutions: 1) a tailored serialization mechanism that allows agents to be accessed and mutated directly from the receive buffer, and 2) leveraging the iterative nature of agent-based simulations to reduce data transfer with delta encoding.   Built on our solutions, TeraAgent enables extreme-scale simulations with half a trillion agents (an 84x improvement), reduces time-to-result with additional compute nodes, improves interoperability with third-party tools, and provides users with more hardware flexibility.",

By leveraging Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to dynamically determine similarity thresholds and machine learning models to prioritize clusters, our approach achieves substantial reductions in computational cost without sacrificing accuracy.

    "abstract": "$\\textit{Salmonella}$ expresses bacterial microcompartments (MCPs) upon 1,2-propanediol exposure. MCPs are nanoscale protein-bound shells that encase enzymes for the cofactor-dependent 1,2-propanediol metabolism. They are hypothesized to limit exposure to the toxic intermediate, propionaldehyde, decrease cofactor involvement in competing reactions, and enhance flux. We construct a mass-action mathematical model of purified MCPs and calibrate parameters to measured metabolite concentrations. We constrain mass-action kinetic parameters to previously estimated Michaelis-Menten parameters. We identified two distinct fits with different dynamics in the pathway product, propionate, but similar goodness of fit. Across fits, we inferred that the MCP 1,2-propanediol and propionaldehyde permeability should be greater than $10^{-6}$ and $10^{-8}$ m/s, respectively. Our results identify parameter ranges consistent with prevailing theories that MCPs impose preferential diffusion to 1,2-propanediol over propionaldehyde, and sequester toxic propionaldehyde away from the cell cytosol. The bimodality of the posterior distribution arises from bimodality in the estimated coenzyme-A (CoA) permeability and inhibition rates. The MCP permeability to CoA was inferred to be either less than $10^{-8.8}$ m/s or greater than $10^{-7.3}$ m/s. In a high CoA permeability environment with low rates of CoA inhibition, enzymes produced metabolites by recycling (NAD+)/(NADH). In a low CoA permeability environment with high rates of CoA inhibition, enzymes required external NAD+/H to produce metabolites. Dynamics are consistent with prevailing hypotheses about MCP function to sequester toxic propionaldehyde, and additional collection of data points between 6 and 24 hours or characterization of enzyme inhibition rates could further reduce uncertainty and provide better permeability estimates.",

    "abstract": "We present a novel dual-head deep learning architecture for protein-protein interaction modeling that enables simultaneous prediction of binding affinity ($ΔG$) and mutation-induced affinity changes ($ΔΔG$) using only protein sequence information. Our approach offers a significant advancement over existing methods by employing specialized prediction heads that operate on a shared representation network, allowing direct and optimized prediction of both values. To ensure robust generalization, we integrated complementary datasets from SKEMPI v2 and PDBbind with a rigorous protein domain-based splitting strategy that prevents information leakage between training and validation sets. Our architecture combines transformer-based encoders with a novel cross-attention mechanism that processes paired protein sequences directly, without requiring any structural information. The network embeds input sequences using ESM3 representations, then employs a learnable sliced window embedding layer to manage variable-length sequences efficiently. A multi-layer transformer encoder with bidirectional self-attention captures intra-protein patterns, while cross-attention layers enable explicit modeling of interactions between protein pairs. This shared representation network feeds into separate $ΔG$ and $ΔΔG$ prediction heads, allowing task-specific optimization while leveraging common features. The model achieves $ΔΔG$ validation of Pearson correlation at 0.485, while maintaining strong $ΔG$ predictions (Pearson: 0.638). While existing approaches require protein structure data and binding interface information, our model eliminates these constraints. This provides a critical advantage for the numerous proteins with unknown structures or those challenging to crystallize, such as viral and intrinsically disordered proteins.",

    "abstract": "Electronic health records (EHRs) provide a powerful basis for predicting the onset of health outcomes. Yet EHRs primarily capture in-clinic events and miss aspects of daily behavior and lifestyle containing rich health information. Consumer wearables, by contrast, continuously measure activity, heart rate, and sleep, and more, offering complementary signals that can fill this gap. Despite this potential, there has been little systematic evaluation of the benefit that wearable data can bring to health outcome prediction on top of EHRs. In this study, we present an extensible framework for multimodal health outcome prediction that integrates EHR and wearable data streams. Using data from the All of Us Program, we systematically compared the combination of different encoding methods on EHR and wearable data, including the traditional feature engineering approach, as well as foundation model embeddings. Across ten clinical outcomes, wearable integration consistently improved model performance relative to EHR-only baselines, e.g., average delta AUROC +5.8% for major depressive disorder, +10.7% for hypertension, and +12.2% for diabetes. On average across all ten outcomes, fusing EHRs with wearable features shows 8.9% improvement in AUROC. To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale evaluation of wearable-EHR fusion, underscoring the utility of wearable-derived signals in complementing EHRs and enabling more holistic, personalized health outcome predictions. Meanwhile, our analysis elucidates future directions for optimizing foundation models for wearable data and its integration with EHR data.",

    "abstract": "Proteomics data is essential to pathogenic understanding of a disease phenotype. In cancer, analysis of molecular signatures enables precision medicine through the identification of biological processes that drive individualized tumor progression, therapeutic resistance, and clinical heterogeneity. Recent advances in multimodal large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capacity to integrate and reason across heterogeneous data modalities. However, performing multi-modal language modeling for molecular understanding of patient-specific proteomics remains a significant challenge due to two barriers: (1) the lack of instruction-tuning datasets that enable clinical interpretation from proteomics data, and (2) the absence of language modeling architectures designed to capture the rich heterogeneity of molecular data. In this work, we introduce CPTAC-PROTSTRUCT, the first instruction tuning dataset for molecular understanding of oncology, comprising over 400k open-ended examples derived from individualized proteomic profiles curated from the largest national proteomics cancer study (CPTAC). Additionally, we propose KRONOS (Knowledge Representation of patient Omics Networks in Oncology via Structured tuning), a novel graph-LLM framework that leverages molecular interaction topology with proteomics to learn patient-specific graph representations for enhanced clinical reasoning. We show that KRONOS achieves competitive performance across benchmark clinical tasks, including molecular classification, temporal trajectory modeling, and tumor stage prediction from proteomics data. Ultimately, this approach empowers LLMs to understand patient-level pathogenesis, advancing precision medicine through more accurate diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment stratification.",

It is classification-independent, incorporates abundance information, and has a tunable sensitivity to rare/abundant types. Using rich COVID-19 sequence data as a paradigm, we develop methods for applying the VS to time-resolved sequence data. We show how the VS allows for characterization of the overall diversity of circulating viruses and for discernment of emerging variants prior to formal identification.

    "abstract": "We develop a physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework for parameter estimation in fractional-order SEIRD epidemic models. By embedding the Caputo fractional derivative into the network residuals via the L1 discretization scheme, our method simultaneously reconstructs epidemic trajectories and infers both epidemiological parameters and the fractional memory order $α$. The fractional formulation extends classical integer-order models by capturing long-range memory effects in disease progression, incubation, and recovery. Our framework learns the fractional memory order $α$ as a trainable parameter while simultaneously estimating the epidemiological rates $(β, σ, γ, μ)$. A composite loss combining data misfit, physics residuals, and initial conditions, with constraints on positivity and population conservation, ensures both accuracy and biological consistency. Tests on synthetic Mpox data confirm reliable recovery of $α$ and parameters under noise, while applications to COVID-19 show that optimal $α\\in (0, 1]$ captures memory effects and improves predictive performance over the classical SEIRD model. This work establishes PINNs as a robust tool for learning memory effects in epidemic dynamics, with implications for forecasting, control strategies, and the analysis of non-Markovian epidemic processes.",

Current state-of-the-art models enforce roto-translational symmetries through equivariant neural network architectures, a hard-wired inductive bias that can often lead to reduced flexibility, computational efficiency, and scalability. In this work, we introduce TransIP: Transformer-based Inter-Atomic Potentials, a novel training paradigm for interatomic potentials achieving symmetry compliance without explicit architectural constraints. Our approach guides a generic non-equivariant Transformer-based model to learn SO(3)-equivariance by optimizing its representations in the embedding space. Trained on the recent Open Molecules (OMol25) collection, a large and diverse molecular dataset built specifically for MLIPs and covering different types of molecules (including small organics, biomolecular fragments, and electrolyte-like species), TransIP effectively learns symmetry in its latent space, providing low equivariance error. Further, compared to a data augmentation baseline, TransIP achieves 40% to 60% improvement in performance across varying OMol25 dataset sizes. More broadly, our work shows that learned equivariance can be a powerful and efficient alternative to augmentation-based MLIP models.",

    "abstract": "Advances in computational pathology increasingly rely on extracting meaningful representations from Whole Slide Images (WSIs) to support various clinical and biological tasks. In this study, we propose a generalizable deep learning framework that integrates the Mamba architecture with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for enhanced WSI analysis. Our method is designed to capture both local spatial relationships and long-range contextual dependencies, offering a flexible architecture for digital pathology analysis. Mamba modules excels in capturing long-range global dependencies, while GNNs emphasize fine-grained short-range spatial interactions. To effectively combine these complementary signals, we introduce an adaptive fusion strategy that uses an entropy-based confidence weighting mechanism. This approach dynamically balances contributions from both branches by assigning higher weight to the branch with more confident (lower-entropy) predictions, depending on the contextual importance of local versus global information for different downstream tasks. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on a representative task: predicting gene fusion and mutation status from WSIs. Our framework, SlideMamba, achieves an area under the precision recall curve (PRAUC) of 0.751 \\pm 0.05, outperforming MIL (0.491 \\pm 0.042), Trans-MIL (0.39 \\pm 0.017), Mamba-only (0.664 \\pm 0.063), GNN-only (0.748 \\pm 0.091), and a prior similar work GAT-Mamba (0.703 \\pm 0.075). SlideMamba also achieves competitive results across ROC AUC (0.738 \\pm 0.055), sensitivity (0.662 \\pm 0.083), and specificity (0.725 \\pm 0.094). These results highlight the strength of the integrated architecture, enhanced by the proposed entropy-based adaptive fusion strategy, and suggest promising potential for application of spatially-resolved predictive modeling tasks in computational pathology.",

    "abstract": "Ensemble forecasts have become a cornerstone of large-scale disease response, underpinning decision making at agencies such as the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Their growing use reflects the goal of combining multiple models to improve accuracy and stability versus using a single model. However, recent experience shows these benefits are not guaranteed. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the CDC's multi-model forecasting ensemble outperformed the best single model by only 1%, and CDC flu forecasting ensembles have often ranked below multiple individual models.   This raises a key question: why are ensembles underperforming? We posit that a central reason is that both model developers and ensemble builders typically focus on stand-alone accuracy. Models are fit to minimize their own forecasting error, and ensembles are often weighted according to those same scores. However, most epidemic forecasts are built from a small set of approaches and trained on the same surveillance data, leading to highly correlated errors. This redundancy limits the benefit of ensembling and may explain why large ensembles sometimes deliver only marginal gains.   To realize the potential of ensembles, both modelers and ensemblers should prioritize models that contribute complementary information rather than replicating existing approaches. Ensembles built with this principle in mind move beyond size for its own sake toward true diversity, producing forecasts that are more robust and more valuable for epidemic preparedness and response.",

    "abstract": "Understanding disease dynamics is crucial for managing wildlife populations and assessing spillover risk to domestic animals and humans, but infection data on free-ranging animals are difficult to obtain. Because pathogen and parasite infections can alter host movement, infection status may be inferred from animal trajectories. We present a hidden Markov model (HMM) framework that links observed movement behaviors to unobserved infection states, consistent with epidemiological compartmental models (e.g., susceptible, infected, recovered, dead). Using movement data from 84 reintroduced scimitar-horned oryx (Oryx dammah), 38 confirmed dead in the field and 6 sampled for disease testing, we demonstrate how HMMs can incorporate epidemiological structure through (1) constrained transition probabilities (e.g., to preclude or allow recovery), (2) covariate effects on transmission, and (3) hierarchically structured HMMs (HHMMs) for multi-scale transitions. Comparing veterinary diagnostic reports with model outputs, we found that HMMs with epidemiological constraints successfully identified infection-associated reductions in movement, whereas unconstrained models failed to capture disease progression. Simulations further showed that constrained HMMs accurately classified susceptible, infected, and recovered states. By illustrating flexible formulations and a workflow for model selection, we provide a transferable approach for detecting infection from movement data. This framework can enhance wildlife disease surveillance, guide population management, and improve understanding of disease dynamics.",

Multi-step retrosynthetic planning remains computationally challenging due to exponential search spaces and inference costs. While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate chemical reasoning capabilities, their application to synthesis planning faces constraints on efficiency and cost. To address these challenges, we introduce AOT*, a framework that transforms retrosynthetic planning by integrating LLM-generated chemical synthesis pathways with systematic AND-OR tree search. To this end, AOT* atomically maps the generated complete synthesis routes onto AND-OR tree components, with a mathematically sound design of reward assignment strategy and retrieval-based context engineering, thus enabling LLMs to efficiently navigate in the chemical space. Experimental evaluation on multiple synthesis benchmarks demonstrates that AOT* achieves SOTA performance with significantly improved search efficiency. AOT* exhibits competitive solve rates using 3-5$\\times$ fewer iterations than existing LLM-based approaches, with the efficiency advantage becoming more pronounced on complex molecular targets.",

    "abstract": "Infectious diseases continue to pose a serious threat to public health, underscoring the urgent need for effective computational approaches to screen novel anti-infective agents. Oligopeptides have emerged as promising candidates in antimicrobial research due to their structural simplicity, high bioavailability, and low susceptibility to resistance. Despite their potential, computational models specifically designed to predict associations between oligopeptides and infectious diseases remain scarce. This study introduces a prompt-guided graph-based contrastive learning framework (PGCLODA) to uncover potential associations. A tripartite graph is constructed with oligopeptides, microbes, and diseases as nodes, incorporating both structural and semantic information. To preserve critical regions during contrastive learning, a prompt-guided graph augmentation strategy is employed to generate meaningful paired views. A dual encoder architecture, integrating Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and Transformer, is used to jointly capture local and global features. The fused embeddings are subsequently input into a multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier for final prediction. Experimental results on a benchmark dataset indicate that PGCLODA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in AUROC, AUPRC, and accuracy. Ablation and hyperparameter studies confirm the contribution of each module. Case studies further validate the generalization ability of PGCLODA and its potential to uncover novel, biologically relevant associations. These findings offer valuable insights for mechanism-driven discovery and oligopeptide-based drug development. The source code of PGCLODA is available online at https://github.com/jjnlcode/PGCLODA.",

    "abstract": "Estimating, understanding, and communicating uncertainty is fundamental to statistical epidemiology, where model-based estimates regularly inform real-world decisions. However, sources of uncertainty are rarely formalised, and existing classifications are often defined inconsistently. This lack of structure hampers interpretation, model comparison, and targeted data collection. Connecting ideas from machine learning, information theory, experimental design, and health economics, we present a first-principles decision-theoretic framework that defines uncertainty as the expected loss incurred by making an estimate based on incomplete information, arguing that this is a highly useful and practically relevant definition for epidemiology. We show how reasoning about future data leads to a notion of expected uncertainty reduction, which induces formal definitions of reducible and irreducible uncertainty. We demonstrate our approach using a case study of SARS-CoV-2 wastewater surveillance in Aotearoa New Zealand, estimating the uncertainty reduction if wastewater surveillance were expanded to the full population. We then connect our framework to relevant literature from adjacent fields, showing how it unifies and extends many of these ideas and how it allows these ideas to be applied to a wider range of models. Altogether, our framework provides a foundation for more reliable, consistent, and policy-relevant uncertainty quantification in infectious disease epidemiology.",

    "abstract": "Efficient design of genomic perturbation experiments is crucial for accelerating drug discovery and therapeutic target identification, yet exhaustive perturbation of the human genome remains infeasible due to the vast search space of potential genetic interactions and experimental constraints. Bayesian optimization (BO) has emerged as a powerful framework for selecting informative interventions, but existing approaches often fail to exploit domain-specific biological prior knowledge. We propose Biology-Informed Bayesian Optimization (BioBO), a method that integrates Bayesian optimization with multimodal gene embeddings and enrichment analysis, a widely used tool for gene prioritization in biology, to enhance surrogate modeling and acquisition strategies. BioBO combines biologically grounded priors with acquisition functions in a principled framework, which biases the search toward promising genes while maintaining the ability to explore uncertain regions. Through experiments on established public benchmarks and datasets, we demonstrate that BioBO improves labeling efficiency by 25-40%, and consistently outperforms conventional BO by identifying top-performing perturbations more effectively. Moreover, by incorporating enrichment analysis, BioBO yields pathway-level explanations for selected perturbations, offering mechanistic interpretability that links designs to biologically coherent regulatory circuits.",

    "abstract": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has shown remarkable success in hematological malignancies, yet patient responses remain highly variable and the roles of CD4 and CD8 subsets are not fully understood. We present an extended mathematical framework of CAR-T cell dynamics that explicitly models CD4 helper and CD8 cytotoxic lineages and their interactions with tumor antigen burden. Building on the Kirouac et al. (2023) model of antigen-regulated memory, effector, and exhaustion transitions, our system of differential equations incorporates cytokine-mediated modulation of CD8 proliferation, cytotoxicity, and memory regeneration by CD4 T cells. Sensitivity analyses identify effector proliferation burst size, antigen turnover, and CD8 expansion rates as dominant determinants of treatment outcome. Virtual patient simulations reproduce clinical findings that a 1:1 CD4:CD8 ratio enhances CAR-T expansion and tumor clearance relative to CD8-only products. Finally, we integrate a feed-forward neural network trained on noisy virtual patient data to improve predictive robustness, and apply SHAP analysis to interpret the network predictions and compare them with mechanistic sensitivity analyses. This work highlights the synergistic roles of CD4 and CD8 CAR-T cells and provides a quantitative foundation for optimizing treatments and patient stratification.",

    "abstract": "Peripheral blood smears remain a cornerstone in the diagnosis of hematological neoplasms, offering rapid and valuable insights that inform subsequent diagnostic steps. However, since neoplastic transformations typically arise in the bone marrow, they may not manifest as detectable aberrations in peripheral blood, presenting a diagnostic challenge. In this paper, we introduce cAItomorph, an explainable transformer-based AI model, trained to classify hematological malignancies based on peripheral blood cytomorphology. Our data comprises peripheral blood single-cell images from 6115 patients with diagnoses confirmed by cytomorphology, cytogenetics, molecular genetics, and immunophenotyping from bone marrow samples, and 495 healthy controls, eight coarse classes. cAItomorph leverages the DinoBloom hematology foundation model and aggregates image encodings via a transformer-based architecture into a single vector. It achieves an overall accuracy of 0.72 in eight disease classification, with F1 scores of 0.76 for acute leukemia, 0.80 for myeloproliferative neoplasms and 0.94 for healthy cases. The overall accuracy increases to 0.87 in top-2 predictions. cAItomorph achieves high sensitivity for acute leukemia cases in external test sets. By analyzing attention heads, we demonstrate clinically relevant cell-level attentions in both internal and external test sets. Moreover, our model's calibrated prediction probabilities reduce the false discovery rate from 13.5% to 8.7% without missing any acute leukemia cases, thereby decreasing the number of unnecessary bone marrow aspirations based on peripheral blood smears. This study highlights the potential of AI-assisted diagnostics in hematological malignancies, illustrating how models trained on real-world data could enhance diagnostic accuracy and reduce invasive procedures.",

AI models trained on this dataset outperform existing tools when predicting the known pathogenicity of mutations.

    "abstract": "The ongoing opioid crisis highlights the urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies that can be rapidly deployed. This study presents a novel approach to identify potential repurposable drugs for the treatment of opioid addiction, aiming to bridge the gap between transcriptomic data analysis and drug discovery. Speciffcally, we perform a meta-analysis of seven transcriptomic datasets related to opioid addiction by differential gene expression (DGE) analysis, and propose a novel multiscale topological differentiation to identify key genes from a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network derived from DEGs. This method uses persistent Laplacians to accurately single out important nodes within the PPI network through a multiscale manner to ensure high reliability. Subsequent functional validation by pathway enrichment and rigorous data curation yield 1,865 high-conffdence targets implicated in opioid addiction, which are cross-referenced with DrugBank to compile a repurposing candidate list. To evaluate drug-target interactions, we construct predictive models utilizing two natural language processing-derived molecular embeddings and a conventional molecular ffngerprint. Based on these models, we prioritize compounds with favorable binding afffnity proffles, and select candidates that are further assessed through molecular docking simulations to elucidate their receptor-level interactions. Additionally, pharmacokinetic and toxicological evaluations are performed via ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity) proffling, providing a multidimensional assessment of druggability and safety. This study offers a generalizable approach for drug repurposing in other complex diseases beyond opioid addiction.

We systematically evaluate parameter probability distributions in cell migration models using Bayesian calibration across four complementary strategies: parametric and surrogate models, each with and without explicit model discrepancy. This approach enables joint analysis of parameter uncertainty, predictive performance, and interpretability. Applied to a real data experiment of glioblastoma progression in microfluidic devices, surrogate models achieve higher computational efficiency and predictive accuracy, whereas parametric models yield more reliable parameter estimates due to their mechanistic grounding. Incorporating model discrepancy exposes structural limitations, clarifying where model refinement is necessary. Together, these comparisons offer practical guidance for calibrating and improving computational models of complex biological systems.",

This work presents a two-stage deep clustering method for classifying blood cells from high-dimensional signal data.

The second stage further classifies RBC subtypes, pure RBCs, reticulocytes, and clumped RBCs, through a variational deep embedding (VaDE) approach. Due to the lack of detailed cell-level labels, soft classification probabilities are generated from sample-level data to approximate the true distributions. The aim is to contribute to the development of low-cost, automated blood analysis systems suitable for veterinary and biomedical use. Initial results indicate this method shows promise in effectively distinguishing different blood cell populations, even with limited supervision.",

We introduce in this manuscript a mathematically rigorous framework that combines data-driven noise interval evaluation with advanced SNR visualization to address these limitations. Analysis of the publicly available Eye-BCI multimodal dataset demonstrates the method's ability to recover canonical P300 characteristics across frequency bands (delta: 0.5-4 Hz, theta: 4-7.5 Hz, broadband: 1-15 Hz), with precise spatiotemporal localization of both P3a (frontocentral) and P3b (parietal) subcomponents. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically assess the impact of noise interval selection on EEG signal quality. Cross-session correlations for four different choices of noise intervals spanning from early to late pre-stimulus phases also indicate that alertness and task engagement states modulate noise interval sensitivity, suggesting broader applications for adaptive BCI systems. While validated in healthy participants, our results represent a first step towards providing clinicians with an interpretable tool for detecting neurophysiological abnormalities and provides quantifiable metrics for system optimization.",

Nonetheless, given the success of generative models across different but related problems, it is natural to question whether these architectural designs are a necessary condition to build performant models. In this paper, we introduce SimpleFold, the first flow-matching based protein folding model that solely uses general purpose transformer blocks. Protein folding models typically employ computationally expensive modules involving triangular updates, explicit pair representations or multiple training objectives curated for this specific domain. Instead, SimpleFold employs standard transformer blocks with adaptive layers and is trained via a generative flow-matching objective with an additional structural term. We scale SimpleFold to 3B parameters and train it on approximately 9M distilled protein structures together with experimental PDB data. On standard folding benchmarks, SimpleFold-3B achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines, in addition SimpleFold demonstrates strong performance in ensemble prediction which is typically difficult for models trained via deterministic reconstruction objectives. Due to its general-purpose architecture, SimpleFold shows efficiency in deployment and inference on consumer-level hardware. SimpleFold challenges the reliance on complex domain-specific architectures designs in protein folding, opening up an alternative design space for future progress.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we introduce a sensitivity analysis methodology for stochastic systems in chemistry, where dynamics are often governed by random processes. Our approach is based on gradient estimation via finite differences, averaging simulation outcomes, and analyzing variability under intrinsic noise. We characterize gradient uncertainty as an angular range within which all plausible gradient directions are expected to lie. This uncertainty measure adaptively guides the number of simulations performed for each nominal-perturbation pair of points in order to minimize unnecessary computations while maintaining robustness.   Systematically exploring a range of parameter values across the parameter space, rather than focusing on a single value, allows us to identify not only sensitive parameters but also regions of parameter space associated with different levels of sensitivity. These results are visualized through vector field plots to offer an intuitive representation of local sensitivity across parameter space. Additionally, global sensitivity coefficients are computed to capture overall trends.   Flexibility regarding the choice of output observable measures is another key feature of our method: while traditional sensitivity analyses often focus on species concentrations, our framework allows for the definition of a large range of problem-specific observables. This makes it broadly applicable in diverse chemical and biochemical scenarios. We demonstrate our approach on two systems: classical Michaelis-Menten kinetics and a rule-based model of the formose reaction, using the cheminformatics software MØD for Gillespie-based stochastic simulations.",

    "abstract": "Locomotor behavioural responses are increasingly recognized as sensitive and ecologically relevant indicators for assessing aquatic organism exposure to contaminants. They often occur at concentrations lower than those causing physiological damage, yet their consequences for organisms' fitness and population dynamics remain unclear. Moreover, it is still uncertain how these behavioural endpoints align with traditional toxicological apical endpoints used to assess species sensitivities in risk assessment. This study evaluates the correlation between thresholds triggering locomotor reactions with LC50 values across 19 freshwater and 12 marine invertebrate species exposed to the insecticide imidacloprid and the metal copper. Behavioural responses were measured via videotracking during pulse exposure assays, while 96h acute tests provided species-specific LC50 values for copper. Results reveal strong discrepancies: some highly sensitive species showed no locomotor changes, whereas others tolerant to lethality displayed strong movement responses. For instance, freshwater annelids and gastropods responded markedly to imidacloprid, while marine shrimps exhibited hyperactivity under low copper levels. These findings indicate that relying solely on lethality-based data may underestimate the fraction of species affected by contamination. Integrating behavioural endpoints into population risk assessment frameworks is therefore crucial to better protect aquatic biodiversity.",

Virtual cells, or digital cellular twins, have emerged as a critical paradigm to meet this challenge by creating integrative computational models of cellular processes. This review synthesizes the evolution and current state of the virtual cell, from foundational mechanistic frameworks like the Virtual Cell that employ deterministic and stochastic simulations to the recent transformative impact of artificial intelligence and foundation models. We examine the core technological pillars required to build these models, including the integration of various data types, such as single-cell and spatial omics, the spectrum of modeling approaches, and the bioengineering principles that connect simulation to application. We further discuss key applications, frameworks for model benchmarking and validation, and the significant hurdles that remain, including computational scalability, parameter inference, and ethical considerations, which provides a roadmap for development of predictive virtual cells that promise to revolutionize biomedical research and clinical practice.",

In this study, we propose a graph-based neural inference model that simultaneously predicts neural activity and infers latent connectivity by modeling neurons as interacting nodes in a graph. The architecture features two distinct modules: one for learning structural connectivity and another for predicting future spiking activity via a graph neural network (GNN). Our model accommodates unobserved neurons through auxiliary nodes, allowing for inference in partially observed circuits. We evaluate this approach using synthetic data generated from ring attractor network models and real spike recordings from head direction cells in mice. Across a wide range of conditions, including varying recurrent connectivity, external inputs, and incomplete observations, our model reliably resolves spurious correlations and recovers accurate weight profiles. When applied to real data, the inferred connectivity aligns with theoretical predictions of continuous attractor models. These results highlight the potential of GNN-based models to infer latent neural circuitry through self-supervised structure learning, while leveraging the spike prediction task to flexibly link connectivity and dynamics across both simulated and biological neural systems.",

    "abstract": "Networks constitute fundamental organizational structures across biological systems, although conventional graph-theoretic analyses capture exclusively pairwise interactions, thereby omitting the intricate higher-order relationships that characterize network complexity. This work proposes a unified framework for heat kernel smoothing on simplicial complexes, extending classical signal processing methodologies from vertices and edges to cycles and higher-dimensional structures. Through Hodge Laplacian, a discrete heat kernel on a finite simplicial complex $\\mathcal{K}$ is constructed to smooth signals on $k$-simplices via the boundary operator $\\partial_k$. Computationally efficient sparse algorithms for constructing boundary operators are developed to implement linear diffusion processes on $k$-simplices. The methodology generalizes heat kernel smoothing to $k$-simplices, utilizing boundary structure to localize topological features while maintaining homological invariance. Simulation studies demonstrate qualitative signal enhancement across vertex and edge domains following diffusion processes. Application to parcellated human brain functional connectivity networks reveals that simplex-space smoothing attenuates spurious connections while amplifying coherent anatomical architectures, establishing practical significance for computational neuroscience applications.",

    "abstract": "Positional encoding is essential for supplementing transformer with positional information of tokens. Existing positional encoding methods demand predefined token/feature order, rendering them unsuitable for real-world data with non-sequential yet causally-related features. To address this limitation, we propose CAPE, a novel method that identifies underlying causal structure over non-sequential features as a weighted directed acyclic graph (DAG) using generalized structural equation modeling. The DAG is then embedded in hyperbolic space where its geometric structure is well-preserved using a hyperboloid model-based approach that effectively captures two important causal graph properties (causal strength & causal specificity). This step yields causality-aware positional encodings for the features, which are converted into their rotary form for integrating with transformer's self-attention mechanism. Theoretical analysis reveals that CAPE-generated rotary positional encodings possess three valuable properties for enhanced self-attention, including causal distance-induced attenuation, causal generality-induced attenuation, and robustness to positional disturbances. We evaluate CAPE over both synthetic and real-word datasets, empirically demonstrating its theoretical properties and effectiveness in enhancing transformer for data with non-sequential features.

    "abstract": "Antibiotics are a vital class of drugs closely associated with the prevention and treatment of bacterial infections. Accurate prediction of molecular antimicrobial activity remains a key challenge in the pursuit of novel antibiotic candidates. However, laboratory-based antimicrobial compounds identification is costly, time-consuming, and prone to rediscovering known antibiotics, highlighting the urgent need for efficient and accurate computational models. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) have significantly enhanced the ability to explore chemical space and identify potential antimicrobial compounds. In this study, we particularly emphasize deep learning models and employ five chemistry language models tailored for chemical data to encode small molecules. Our model incorporates a unique capsule network architecture and introduces innovations in loss function selection and feature processing modules, demonstrating superior performance in predicting inhibitory activities against Escherichia coli and Acinetobacter baumannii. We conducted a series of ablation studies to elucidate the contributions of network design and input features. Case studies validated the usability and effectiveness of our model.To facilitate accessibility, we developed an intuitive web portal to disseminate this novel tool. Our results indicate that the proposed approach offers improved predictive accuracy and enhanced interpretability, underscoring the potential of interpretable artificial intelligence methods in accelerating antibiotic discovery and addressing the urgent challenge of antimicrobial resistance.",

    "abstract": "Integration and analysis of multi-omics data provide valuable insights for cancer subtype classification. However, such data are inherently heterogeneous, high-dimensional, and exhibit complex intra- and inter-modality dependencies. Recent advances in graph neural networks (GNNs) offer powerful tools for modeling such structure. Yet, most existing methods rely on prior knowledge or predefined similarity networks to construct graphs, which are often undirected or unweighted, failing to capture the directionality and strength of biological interactions. Interpretability at both the modality and feature levels also remains limited. To address these challenges, we propose TF-DWGNet, a novel Graph Neural Network framework that combines tree-based Directed Weighted graph construction with Tensor Fusion for multiclass cancer subtype classification. TF-DWGNet introduces two key innovations: a supervised tree-based approach for constructing directed, weighted graphs tailored to each omics modality, and a tensor fusion mechanism that captures unimodal, bimodal, and trimodal interactions using low-rank decomposition for efficiency. TF-DWGNet enables modality-specific representation learning, joint embedding fusion, and interpretable subtype prediction. Experiments on real-world cancer datasets show that TF-DWGNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple metrics and statistical tests. Moreover, it provides biologically meaningful insights by ranking influential features and modalities. These results highlight TF-DWGNet's potential for effective and interpretable multi-omics integration in cancer research.",

    "abstract": "Neuroimaging provides rich measurements of brain structure and neural activity, but turning these data into mechanistic insight remains difficult. Statistical models quantify associations without much considerations for how they arise, whereas bio-realistic models directly embody candidate mechanisms but remain hard to deploy rigorously without specialized training. We present a framework that recasts modeling choices as testable mechanistic hypotheses and supplies a simple protocol for rejecting inappropriate model specifications, such as under-/over-parameterization or invalid simplifying assumptions, based on predefined criteria before any parameter inference. The key idea is expected model behavior under feature generalization constraints: instead of judging a model solely by how well it fits a specific target feature of interest Y at an optimal parameter set, we evaluate the model's expected Y output when the model is constrained to reproduce a broader, or distinct, feature Z over the entire parameter space. We then assess whether a mirror statistical model, derived from the model's expected Y outputs, to the empirical statistical model using standard statistics. In synthetic experiments with known ground truth (Wilson Cowan dynamics), the framework correctly rejects mis-specified hypotheses, penalizes unnecessary degrees of freedom, and preserves valid specifications. This provides a practical, hypothesis-first route to using mechanistic models for neuroimaging without requiring expert-level methodology.",

Variability stems from biological differences, PCR amplification bias, limited sequencing depth, and low capture efficiency, making it challenging to adapt computational pipelines to heterogeneous datasets or evolving technologies. As a result, most studies still rely on principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, valued for its interpretability and robustness. Here, we improve upon PCA with a Random Matrix Theory (RMT)-based approach that guides the inference of sparse principal components using existing sparse PCA algorithms. We first introduce a novel biwhitening method, inspired by the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm, that simultaneously stabilizes variance across genes and cells. This enables the use of an RMT-based criterion to automatically select the sparsity level, rendering sparse PCA nearly parameter-free. Our mathematically grounded approach retains the interpretability of PCA while enabling robust, hands-off inference of sparse principal components. Across seven single-cell RNA-seq technologies and four sparse PCA algorithms, we show that this method systematically improves the reconstruction of the principal subspace and consistently outperforms PCA-, autoencoder-, and diffusion-based methods in cell-type classification tasks.",

RS and LULC-based SDMs were built using distribution data for eleven bird, amphibian, and mammal species in Île-de-France. Predictor variables were derived from Sentinel-2 RS data and LULC classifications, with the latter incorporating Euclidean distance to habitat types. Ensemble SDMs were built using nine algorithms and evaluated with the Continuous Boyce Index (CBI) and a calibrated AUC. Habitat suitability scores and their binary transformations were assessed using niche overlap indices (Schoener, Warren, and Spearman rank correlation coefficient). Both RS and LULC approaches exhibited similar predictive accuracy overall. After binarisation however, the resulting niche maps diverged significantly. While LULC-based models exhibited spatial constraints (habitat suitability decreased as distance from recorded occurrences increased), RS-based models, which used continuous data, were not affected by geographic bias or distance effects. These results underscore the need to account for spatial biases in LULC-based SDMs. The DHI may offer a more spatially neutral alternative, making it a promising predictor for modelling species niches at regional scales.",

    "abstract": "Many critical healthcare decisions are challenged by the inability to measure key underlying parameters. Glaucoma, a leading cause of irreversible blindness driven by elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), provides a stark example. The primary determinant of IOP, a tissue property called trabecular meshwork permeability, cannot be measured in vivo, forcing clinicians to depend on indirect surrogates. This clinical challenge is compounded by a broader computational one: developing predictive models for such ill-posed inverse problems is hindered by a lack of ground-truth data and prohibitive cost of large-scale, high-fidelity simulations. We address both challenges with an end-to-end framework to noninvasively estimate unmeasurable variables from sparse, routine data. Our approach combines a multi-stage artificial intelligence architecture to functionally separate the problem; a novel data generation strategy we term PCDS that obviates the need for hundreds of thousands of costly simulations, reducing the effective computational time from years to hours; and a Bayesian engine to quantify predictive uncertainty. Our framework deconstructs a single IOP measurement into its fundamental components from routine inputs only, yielding estimates for the unmeasurable tissue permeability and a patient's outflow facility. Our noninvasively estimated outflow facility achieved excellent agreement with state-of-the-art tonography with precision comparable to direct physical instruments. Furthermore, the newly derived permeability biomarker demonstrates high accuracy in stratifying clinical cohorts by disease risk, highlighting its diagnostic potential. More broadly, our framework establishes a generalizable blueprint for solving similar inverse problems in other data-scarce, computationally-intensive domains.",

    "abstract": "UK woodlands, forests, and urban treescapes are under threat from invasive species, exacerbated by climate change, trade, and transport. Invasive tree pests debilitate their host and disrupt forest ecosystems, thus it is imperative to quantitatively model and predict their spread. Addressing this, we model the spread of an invasive pest using a spatiotemporal reaction-diffusion equation, representing the spatial distribution as a population density field. We solve this intractable equation numerically and, from the solution, we determine first arrival times of the pest at locations in the field. The adopted model permits us to obtain the expansion rate of pest spread directly from the model parameters, which we infer in the Bayesian paradigm, using a Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme. We apply our framework to the ongoing spread of oak processionary moth in the UK, an outbreak which continues to grow despite management efforts. We demonstrate that our approach effectively captures the spread of the pest and that this has occurred at a non-constant expansion rate. The proposed framework is a powerful tool for quantitatively modelling the spread of an invasive tree pest and could underpin future prediction and management approaches.",

    "abstract": "Biological sequence design (DNA, RNA, or peptides) with desired functional properties has applications in discovering novel nanomaterials, biosensors, antimicrobial drugs, and beyond. One common challenge is the ability to optimize complex high-dimensional properties such as target emission spectra of DNA-mediated fluorescent nanoparticles, photo and chemical stability, and antimicrobial activity of peptides across target microbes. Existing models rely on simple binary labels (e.g., binding/non-binding) rather than high-dimensional complex properties. To address this gap, we propose a geometry-preserving variational autoencoder framework, called PrIVAE, which learns latent sequence embeddings that respect the geometry of their property space. Specifically, we model the property space as a high-dimensional manifold that can be locally approximated by a nearest neighbor graph, given an appropriately defined distance measure. We employ the property graph to guide the sequence latent representations using (1) graph neural network encoder layers and (2) an isometric regularizer. PrIVAE learns a property-organized latent space that enables rational design of new sequences with desired properties by employing the trained decoder. We evaluate the utility of our framework for two generative tasks: (1) design of DNA sequences that template fluorescent metal nanoclusters and (2) design of antimicrobial peptides. The trained models retain high reconstruction accuracy while organizing the latent space according to properties. Beyond in silico experiments, we also employ sampled sequences for wet lab design of DNA nanoclusters, resulting in up to 16.1-fold enrichment of rare-property nanoclusters compared to their abundance in training data, demonstrating the practical utility of our framework.",

Our approach integrates neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), graph neural networks (GNNs), and neural processes into a unified model that captures uncertainty, temporal continuity, and anatomical structure. We represent dynamic systems as spatiotemporal multiplex graphs and model their latent trajectories using a GNN-parameterized vector field. Given the sparse context observations at node and edge levels, the model infers a distribution over latent initial states and control variables, enabling both interpolation and extrapolation of trajectories. We validate the method on three synthetic dynamical systems (coupled pendulum, Lorenz attractor, and Kuramoto oscillators) and two real-world cardiac imaging datasets - ACDC (N=150) and UK Biobank (N=526) - demonstrating accurate reconstruction, extrapolation, and disease classification capabilities. The model accurately reconstructs trajectories and extrapolates future cardiac cycles from a single observed cycle. It achieves state-of-the-art results on the ACDC classification task (up to 99% accuracy), and detects atrial fibrillation in UK Biobank subjects with competitive performance (up to 67% accuracy). This work introduces a flexible approach for analyzing cardiac motion and offers a foundation for graph-based learning in structured biomedical spatiotemporal time-series data.",

    "abstract": "Despite significant medical advancements, cancer remains the second leading cause of death, with over 600,000 deaths per year in the US. One emerging field, pathway analysis, is promising but still relies on manually derived wet lab data, which is time-consuming to acquire. This work proposes an efficient, effective end-to-end framework for Artificial Intelligence (AI) based pathway analysis that predicts both cancer severity and mutation progression, thus recommending possible treatments. The proposed technique involves a novel combination of time-series machine learning models and pathway analysis. First, mutation sequences were isolated from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Database. Then, a novel preprocessing algorithm was used to filter key mutations by mutation frequency. This data was fed into a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that predicted cancer severity. Then, the model probabilistically used the RNN predictions, information from the preprocessing algorithm, and multiple drug-target databases to predict future mutations and recommend possible treatments. This framework achieved robust results and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves (a key statistical metric) with accuracies greater than 60%, similar to existing cancer diagnostics. In addition, preprocessing played an instrumental role in isolating important mutations, demonstrating that each cancer stage studied may contain on the order of a few-hundred key driver mutations, consistent with current research. Heatmaps based on predicted gene frequency were also generated, highlighting key mutations in each cancer. Overall, this work is the first to propose an efficient, cost-effective end-to-end framework for projecting cancer progression and providing possible treatments without relying on expensive, time-consuming wet lab work.",

    "abstract": "Fontan palliation for univentricular congenital heart disease progresses to hemodynamic failure with complex flow patterns poorly characterized by conventional 2D imaging. Current assessment relies on fluoroscopic angiography, providing limited 3D geometric information essential for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis and surgical planning.   A multi-step AI pipeline was developed utilizing Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash (2.5B parameters) for systematic, iterative processing of fluoroscopic angiograms through transformer-based neural architecture. The pipeline encompasses medical image preprocessing, vascular segmentation, contrast enhancement, artifact removal, and virtual hemodynamic flow visualization within 2D projections. Final views were processed through Tencent's Hunyuan3D-2mini (384M parameters) for stereolithography file generation.   The pipeline successfully generated geometrically optimized 2D projections from single-view angiograms after 16 processing steps using a custom web interface. Initial iterations contained hallucinated vascular features requiring iterative refinement to achieve anatomically faithful representations. Final projections demonstrated accurate preservation of complex Fontan geometry with enhanced contrast suitable for 3D conversion. AI-generated virtual flow visualization identified stagnation zones in central connections and flow patterns in branch arteries. Complete processing required under 15 minutes with second-level API response times.   This approach demonstrates clinical feasibility of generating CFD-suitable geometries from routine angiographic data, enabling 3D generation and rapid virtual flow visualization for cursory insights prior to full CFD simulation. While requiring refinement cycles for accuracy, this establishes foundation for democratizing advanced geometric and hemodynamic analysis using readily available imaging data.",

Instead of conventional multi-expert modules, MICE employs multiple functionally diverse experts to comprehensively capture both cross-cancer and cancer-specific insights. Leveraging data from 11,799 patients across 30 cancer types, we enhanced MICE's generalizability by coupling contrastive and supervised learning. MICE outperformed both unimodal and state-of-the-art multi-expert-based multimodal models, demonstrating substantial improvements in C-index ranging from 3.8% to 11.2% on internal cohorts and 5.8% to 8.8% on independent cohorts, respectively. Moreover, it exhibited remarkable data efficiency across diverse clinical scenarios. With its enhanced generalizability and data efficiency, MICE establishes an effective and scalable foundation for pan-cancer prognosis prediction, holding strong potential to personalize tailored therapies and improve treatment outcomes.",

Based on the structural identification of different intermediates, enabled by the contrast in electron microscopy provided by the metal nanoparticles that play the cargo role, we find that multiple cargo encapsulation occurs by self-assembly via a specific ``assembly line'' pathway that is different from previously described \\emph{in vitro} assembly mechanisms of virus-like particles (VLP).

    "abstract": "The macroscopic (population-level) dynamics of chemotactic cell movement -- arising from underlying microscopic (individual-based) models -- are often described by parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs) governing the spatio-temporal evolution of cell concentrations. In certain cases, these macroscopic PDEs can be analytically derived from microscopic models, thereby elucidating the dependence of PDE coefficients on the parameters of the underlying individual-based dynamics. However, such analytical derivations are not always feasible, particularly for more complex or nonlinear microscopic models. In these instances, neural networks offer a promising alternative for estimating the coefficients of macroscopic PDEs directly from data generated by microscopic simulations. In this work, three microscopic models of chemotaxis are investigated. The macroscopic chemotaxis sensitivity is estimated using neural networks, thereby bridging the gap between individual-level behaviours and population-level descriptions. The results are compared with macroscopic PDEs, which can be derived for each model in certain parameter regimes.",

Conventional radiation therapy, which employs uniform treatment margins, fails to account for patient-specific anatomical and biological factors that critically influence tumor cell migration. To address this limitation, numerous computational models of glioblastoma growth have been developed, enabling generation of tumor cell distribution maps extending beyond radiographically visible regions and thus informing more precise treatment strategies. However, despite encouraging preliminary findings, the clinical adoption of these growth models remains limited. To bridge this translational gap and accelerate both model development and clinical validation, we introduce PREDICT-GBM, a comprehensive integrated pipeline and dataset for modeling and evaluation. This platform enables systematic benchmarking of state-of-the-art tumor growth models using an expert-curated clinical dataset comprising 255 subjects with complete tumor segmentations and tissue characterization maps. Our analysis demonstrates that personalized radiation treatment plans derived from tumor growth predictions achieved superior recurrence coverage compared to conventional uniform margin approaches for two of the evaluated models.

The inherent challenges of bright-field images -- their noisiness, low contrast, and dynamic morphology -- coupled with a lack of GPU resources and complex software interfaces, hinder the desired research output. This article presents a novel microscopy image analysis framework designed for low-budget labs equipped with a standard CPU desktop. The Python-based program enables cytometric analysis of live, unstained cells in culture through an advanced computer vision and machine learning pipeline. Crucially, the framework operates on label-free data, requiring no manually annotated training data or training phase. It is accessible via a user-friendly, cross-platform GUI that requires no programming skills, while also providing a scripting interface for programmatic control and integration by developers. The end-to-end workflow performs semantic and instance segmentation, feature extraction, analysis, evaluation, and automated report generation. Its modular architecture supports easy maintenance and flexible integration while supporting both single-image and batch processing. Validated on several unstained cell types from the public dataset of livecells, the framework demonstrates superior accuracy and reproducibility compared to contemporary tools like Cellpose and StarDist. Its competitive segmentation speed on a CPU-based platform highlights its significant potential for basic research and clinical applications -- particularly in cell transplantation for personalised medicine and muscle regeneration therapies.

    "abstract": "Moving animal groups consist of many distinct individuals but can operate and function as one unit when performing different tasks. Effectively evading unexpected predator attacks is one primary task for many moving groups. The current explanation for predator evasion responses in moving animal groups require the individuals in the groups interact via (velocity) alignment. However, experiments have shown that some animals do not use alignment. This suggests that another explanation for the predator evasion capacity in at least these species is needed. Here we establish that effective collective predator evasion does not require alignment, it can be induced via attraction and repulsion alone. We also show that speed differences between individuals that have directly observed the predator and those that have not influence evasion success and the speed of the collective evasion process, but are not required to induce the phenomenon. Our work here adds collective predator evasion to a number of phenomena previously thought to require alignment interactions that have recently been shown to emerge from attraction and repulsion alone. Based on our findings we suggest experiments and make predictions that may lead to a deeper understanding of not only collective predator evasion, but also collective motion in general.",

While such patterns often exhibit remarkable robustness, variation and irregularity exist at multiple scales and can carry important information about the underlying agent interactions driving collective dynamics. Many methods for quantifying biological patterns focus on large-scale, characteristic features (such as stripe width or spot number), but questions remain on how to characterize messy patterns. In the case of cellular patterns that emerge during development or regeneration, understanding where patterns are most susceptible to variability may help shed light on cell behavior and the tissue environment. Motivated by these challenges, we introduce methods based on topological data analysis to classify and quantify messy patterns arising from agent-based interactions, by extracting meaningful biological interpretations from persistence barcode summaries. To compute persistent homology, our methods rely on a sweeping-plane filtration which, in comparison to the Vietoris--Rips filtration, is more rarely applied to biological systems. We demonstrate how results from the sweeping-plane filtration can be interpreted to quantify stripe patterns (with and without interruptions) by analyzing in silico zebrafish skin patterns, and we generate new quantitative predictions about which pattern features may be most robust or variable. Our work provides an automated framework for quantifying features and irregularities in spot and stripe patterns and highlights how different approaches to persistent homology can provide complementary insight into biological systems.",

    "title": "Virtual staining for 3D X-ray histology of bone implants",
    "abstract": "Three-dimensional X-ray histology techniques offer a non-invasive alternative to conventional 2D histology, enabling volumetric imaging of biological tissues without the need for physical sectioning or chemical staining. However, the inherent greyscale image contrast of X-ray tomography limits its biochemical specificity compared to traditional histological stains. Within digital pathology, deep learning-based virtual staining has demonstrated utility in simulating stained appearances from label-free optical images. In this study, we extend virtual staining to the X-ray domain by applying cross-modality image translation to generate artificially stained slices from synchrotron-radiation-based micro-CT scans. Using over 50 co-registered image pairs of micro-CT and toluidine blue-stained histology from bone-implant samples, we trained a modified CycleGAN network tailored for limited paired data. Whole slide histology images were downsampled to match the voxel size of the CT data, with on-the-fly data augmentation for patch-based training. The model incorporates pixelwise supervision and greyscale consistency terms, producing histologically realistic colour outputs while preserving high-resolution structural detail. Our method outperformed Pix2Pix and standard CycleGAN baselines across SSIM, PSNR, and LPIPS metrics. Once trained, the model can be applied to full CT volumes to generate virtually stained 3D datasets, enhancing interpretability without additional sample preparation. While features such as new bone formation were able to be reproduced, some variability in the depiction of implant degradation layers highlights the need for further training data and refinement. This work introduces virtual staining to 3D X-ray imaging and offers a scalable route for chemically informative, label-free tissue characterisation in biomedical research.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale single-cell and Perturb-seq investigations routinely involve clustering cells and subsequently annotating each cluster with Gene-Ontology (GO) terms to elucidate the underlying biological programs. However, both stages, resolution selection and functional annotation, are inherently subjective, relying on heuristics and expert curation. We present HYPOGENEAGENT, a large language model (LLM)-driven framework, transforming cluster annotation into a quantitatively optimizable task. Initially, an LLM functioning as a gene-set analyst analyzes the content of each gene program or perturbation module and generates a ranked list of GO-based hypotheses, accompanied by calibrated confidence scores. Subsequently, we embed every predicted description with a sentence-embedding model, compute pair-wise cosine similarities, and let the agent referee panel score (i) the internal consistency of the predictions, high average similarity within the same cluster, termed intra-cluster agreement (ii) their external distinctiveness, low similarity between clusters, termed inter-cluster separation. These two quantities are combined to produce an agent-derived resolution score, which is maximized when clusters exhibit simultaneous coherence and mutual exclusivity. When applied to a public K562 CRISPRi Perturb-seq dataset as a preliminary test, our Resolution Score selects clustering granularities that exhibit alignment with known pathway compared to classical metrics such silhouette score, modularity score for gene functional enrichment summary. These findings establish LLM agents as objective adjudicators of cluster resolution and functional annotation, thereby paving the way for fully automated, context-aware interpretation pipelines in single-cell multi-omics studies.",

    "abstract": "Background: Investigational New Drug (IND) application preparation is time-intensive and expertise-dependent, slowing early clinical development. Objective: To evaluate whether a large language model (LLM) platform (AutoIND) can reduce first-draft composition time while maintaining document quality in regulatory submissions. Methods: Drafting times for IND nonclinical written summaries (eCTD modules 2.6.2, 2.6.4, 2.6.6) generated by AutoIND were directly recorded. For comparison, manual drafting times for IND summaries previously cleared by the U.S. FDA were estimated from the experience of regulatory writers ($\\geq$6 years) and used as industry-standard benchmarks. Quality was assessed by a blinded regulatory writing assessor using seven pre-specified categories: correctness, completeness, conciseness, consistency, clarity, redundancy, and emphasis. Each sub-criterion was scored 0-3 and normalized to a percentage. A critical regulatory error was defined as any misrepresentation or omission likely to alter regulatory interpretation (e.g., incorrect NOAEL, omission of mandatory GLP dose-formulation analysis). Results: AutoIND reduced initial drafting time by $\\sim$97% (from $\\sim$100 h to 3.7 h for 18,870 pages/61 reports in IND-1; and to 2.6 h for 11,425 pages/58 reports in IND-2). Quality scores were 69.6\\% and 77.9\\% for IND-1 and IND-2. No critical regulatory errors were detected, but deficiencies in emphasis, conciseness, and clarity were noted. Conclusions: AutoIND can dramatically accelerate IND drafting, but expert regulatory writers remain essential to mature outputs to submission-ready quality. Systematic deficiencies identified provide a roadmap for targeted model improvements.",

Recent studies have demonstrated a strong association between gut microbiota and Parkinson's disease, suggesting that microbial composition may serve as a promising biomarker. Although deep learning models based ongut microbiota show potential for early prediction, most approaches rely on single classifiers and often overlook inter-strain correlations or temporal dynamics. Therefore, there is an urgent need for more robust feature extraction methods tailored to microbiome data. Methods: We proposed BDPM (A Machine Learning-Based Feature Extractor for Parkinson's Disease Classification via Gut Microbiota Analysis). First, we collected gut microbiota profiles from 39 Parkinson's patients and their healthy spouses to identify differentially abundant taxa. Second, we developed an innovative feature selection framework named RFRE (Random Forest combined with Recursive Feature Elimination), integrating ecological knowledge to enhance biological interpretability. Finally, we designed a hybrid classification model to capture temporal and spatial patterns in microbiome data.",

    "abstract": "Quantitative proteomics plays a central role in uncovering regulatory mechanisms, identifying disease biomarkers, and guiding the development of precision therapies. These insights are often obtained through complex Bayesian models, whose inference procedures are computationally intensive, especially when applied at scale to biological datasets. This limits the accessibility of advanced modelling techniques needed to fully exploit proteomics data. Although Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods offer a parallelisable alternative to traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo, their high-performance implementations often rely on specialised hardware, increasing both financial and energy costs. We address these challenges by introducing an opportunistic computing framework for SMC samplers, tailored to the demands of large-scale proteomics inference. Our approach leverages idle compute resources at the University of Liverpool via HTCondor, enabling scalable Bayesian inference without dedicated high-performance computing infrastructure. Central to this framework is a novel Coordinator-Manager-Follower architecture that reduces synchronisation overhead and supports robust operation in heterogeneous, unreliable environments. We evaluate the framework on a realistic proteomics model and show that opportunistic SMC delivers accurate inference with weak scaling, increasing samples generated under a fixed time budget as more resources join. To support adoption, we release CondorSMC, an open-source package for deploying SMC samplers in opportunistic computing environments.",

Understanding tumor-immune dynamics in rare melanomas is critical for the development of new therapies and for improving response rates to current cancer therapies. Progress has been hindered by the lack of clinical data and the need for better preclinical models of rare melanomas. Canine melanoma provides a valuable comparative oncology model for rare types of human melanomas. We analyzed RNA sequencing data from canine melanoma patients and combined this with literature information to create a novel mechanistic mathematical model of melanoma-immune dynamics. Sensitivity analysis of the mathematical model indicated influential pathways in the dynamics, providing support for potential new therapeutic targets and future combinations of therapies.

In this paper, we propose a flexible and modular machine learning-based approach for predicting the efficacy of an untested pharmaceutical for treating a disease. We train a machine learning model using sets of pharmaceutical-pathway weight impact scores and patient data, which can include patient characteristics and observed clinical outcomes. The resulting model then analyses weighted impact scores of an untested pharmaceutical across human biological molecule-protein pathways to generate a predicted efficacy value. We demonstrate how the method works on a real-world dataset with patient treatments and outcomes, with two different weight impact score algorithms We include methods for evaluating the generalisation performance on unseen treatments, and to characterise conditions under which the approach can be expected to be most predictive. We discuss specific ways in which our approach can be iterated on, making it an initial framework to support future work on predicting the effect of untested drugs, leveraging RWD clinical data and drug embeddings.",

    "abstract": "Motile nanosized particles, or \"nanobots\", promise more effective and less toxic targeted drug delivery because of their unique scale and precision. We consider the case in which the cancer is \"diffuse\", dispersed such that there are multiple distinct cancer sites. We investigate the problem of a swarm of nanobots locating these sites and treating them by dropping drug payloads at the sites. To improve the success of the treatment, the drug payloads must be allocated between sites according to their \"demands\"; this requires extra nanobot coordination. We present a mathematical model of the behavior of the nanobot agents and of their colloidal environment. This includes a movement model for agents based upon experimental findings from actual nanoparticles in which bots noisily ascend and descend chemical gradients. We present three algorithms: The first algorithm, called KM, is the most representative of reality, with agents simply following naturally existing chemical signals that surround each cancer site. The second algorithm, KMA, includes an additional chemical payload which amplifies the existing natural signals. The third algorithm, KMAR, includes another additional chemical payload which counteracts the other signals, instead inducing negative chemotaxis in agents such that they are repelled from sites that are already sufficiently treated. We present simulation results for all algorithms across different types of cancer arrangements. For KM, we show that the treatment is generally successful unless the natural chemical signals are weak, in which case the treatment progresses too slowly. For KMA, we demonstrate a significant improvement in treatment speed but a drop in eventual success, except for concentrated cancer patterns. For KMAR, our results show great performance across all types of cancer patterns, demonstrating robustness and adaptability.",

    "abstract": "Sequence matching algorithms such as BLAST and FASTA have been widely used in searching for evolutionary origin and biological functions of newly discovered nucleic acid and protein sequences. As parts of these search tools, alignment scores and E values are useful indicators of the quality of search results from querying a database of annotated sequences, whereby a high alignment score (and inversely a low E value) reflects significant similarity between the query and the subject (target) sequences. For cross-comparison of results from sufficiently different queries however, the interpretation of alignment score as a similarity measure and E value a dissimilarity measure becomes somewhat nuanced, and prompts herein a judicious distinction of different types of similarity. We show that an adjustment of E value to account for self-matching of query and subject sequences corrects for certain ostensibly anomalous similarity comparisons, resulting in canonical dissimilarity and similarity measures that would be more appropriate for database applications, such as all-on-all sequence alignment or selection of diverse subsets. In actual practice, the canonicalization of E value dissimilarity improves clustering and the diversity of subset selection. While both E value and the canonical E value share positivity and symmetry, two of the four axiomatic properties of a metric space, the canonical E value is also reflexive and meets the condition of triangle inequality, thus itself an appropriate distance function for a metric space of protein sequences.",

Such systems often involve nonlinear feedbacks, delays, and interactions across scales. Classical modeling derives explicit governing equations, often systems of differential equations, by combining mechanistic assumptions, experimental observations, and known physical laws. The growing complexity of biological processes has, however, motivated complementary data-driven methods that aim to infer model structure directly from measurements, often without specifying equations a priori. In this review, we survey approaches for model discovery in biological dynamical systems, focusing on three methodological families: regression-based methods, network-based architectures, and decomposition techniques. We compare their ability to address three core goals: forecasting future states, identifying interactions, and characterizing system states. Representative methods are applied to a common benchmark, the Oregonator model, a minimal nonlinear oscillator that captures shared design principles of chemical and biological systems. By highlighting strengths, limitations, and interpretability, we aim to guide researchers in selecting tools for analyzing complex, nonlinear, and high-dimensional dynamics in the life sciences.",

The effectiveness of tree search is demonstrated across a wide range of benchmarks. In bioinformatics, it discovered 40 novel methods for single-cell data analysis that outperformed the top human-developed methods on a public leaderboard. In epidemiology, it generated 14 models that outperformed the CDC ensemble and all other individual models for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations. Our method also produced state-of-the-art software for geospatial analysis, neural activity prediction in zebrafish, time series forecasting and numerical solution of integrals.

    "title": "Towards scalable organ level 3D plant segmentation: Bridging the data algorithm computing gap",
    "abstract": "The precise characterization of plant morphology provides valuable insights into plant environment interactions and genetic evolution. A key technology for extracting this information is 3D segmentation, which delineates individual plant organs from complex point clouds. Despite significant progress in general 3D computer vision domains, the adoption of 3D segmentation for plant phenotyping remains limited by three major challenges: i) the scarcity of large-scale annotated datasets, ii) technical difficulties in adapting advanced deep neural networks to plant point clouds, and iii) the lack of standardized benchmarks and evaluation protocols tailored to plant science. This review systematically addresses these barriers by: i) providing an overview of existing 3D plant datasets in the context of general 3D segmentation domains, ii) systematically summarizing deep learning-based methods for point cloud semantic and instance segmentation, iii) introducing Plant Segmentation Studio (PSS), an open-source framework for reproducible benchmarking, and iv) conducting extensive quantitative experiments to evaluate representative networks and sim-to-real learning strategies. Our findings highlight the efficacy of sparse convolutional backbones and transformer-based instance segmentation, while also emphasizing the complementary role of modeling-based and augmentation-based synthetic data generation for sim-to-real learning in reducing annotation demands. In general, this study bridges the gap between algorithmic advances and practical deployment, providing immediate tools for researchers and a roadmap for developing data-efficient and generalizable deep learning solutions in 3D plant phenotyping.

    "title": "Computational predictions of nutrient precipitation for intensified cell 1 culture media via amino acid solution thermodynamics",
    "abstract": "The majority of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) on the market are produced using Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells cultured at scale in chemically defined cell culture medium. Because of the high costs associated with mammalian cell cultures, obtaining high cell densities to produce high product titers is desired. These bioprocesses require high concentrations of nutrients in the basal media and periodically adding concentrated feed media to sustain cell growth and therapeutic protein productivity. Unfortunately, the desired or optimal nutrient concentrations of the feed media are often solubility limited due to precipitation of chemical complexes that form in the solution. Experimentally screening the various cell culture media configurations which contain 50 to 100 compounds can be expensive and laborious. This article lays the foundation for utilizing computational tools to understand precipitation of nutrients in cell culture media by studying the pairwise interactions between amino acids in thermodynamic models. Activity coefficient data for one amino acid in water and amino acid solubility data of two amino acids in water have been used to determine a single set of UNIFAC group interaction parameters to predict the thermodynamic behavior of the multi-component systems found in mammalian cell culture media. The data collected in this study is, to our knowledge, the largest set of ternary system amino acid solubility data reported to date. These amino acid precipitation predictions have been verified with experimentally measured ternary and quaternary amino acid solutions. Thus, we demonstrate the utility of our model as a digital twin to identify optimal cell culture media compositions by replacing empirical approaches for nutrient precipitation with computational predictions based on thermodynamics of individual media components in complex mixtures.",

    "abstract": "Accurate epidemic forecasting is critical for effective public health interventions. This study compares Bayesian and Frequentist estimation frameworks within deterministic compartmental epidemic models, focusing on nonlinear least squares optimization versus Bayesian inference using MCMC sampling via Stan. We compare forecasting performance under shared modeling structure and error assumptions for specific implementations of both approaches.   We assess performance on simulated datasets (with R0 values of 2 and 1.5) and historical datasets including the 1918 influenza pandemic, 1896-97 Bombay plague, and COVID-19 pandemic. Evaluation metrics include Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Squared Error, Weighted Interval Score, and 95% prediction interval coverage.   Forecasting performance depends on epidemic phase and dataset characteristics, with no method consistently outperforming across all contexts. Frequentist methods perform well at peak and post-peak phases but are less accurate pre-peak. Bayesian methods, particularly with uniform priors, offer better early-epidemic accuracy and stronger uncertainty quantification, especially valuable when data are sparse or noisy. Frequentist methods often yield more accurate point forecasts with lower error metrics, though their interval estimates may be less robust.   We examine how prior choice influences Bayesian forecasts and how extending forecasting horizons affects convergence. These findings offer practical guidance for choosing estimation strategies tailored to epidemic phase and data quality, supporting more effective public health interventions.",

However, training BNNs remains challenging due to the lack of target data. To address this, we propose leveraging Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specifications to define training objectives for BNNs. We build on the quantitative semantics of STL, enabling gradient-based optimization of the BNN weights, and introduce a learning algorithm that enables BNNs to perform regression and control tasks in biological systems. Specifically, we investigate two regression problems in which we train BNNs to act as reporters of dysregulated states, and a feedback control problem in which we train the BNN in closed-loop with a chronic disease model, learning to reduce inflammation while avoiding adverse responses to external infections. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that STL-based learning can solve the investigated regression and control tasks efficiently.",

    "abstract": "The advent of advanced crystallographic techniques has shifted structural biology from static, single-conformer models toward probing protein dynamics. Extracting cooperative motions from temporally and spatially averaged electron density maps requires both high-resolution data and refinement algorithms capable of handling conformational heterogeneity. However, current refinement protocols often fail due to the tangling phenomenon, in which conformational states become improperly intertwined during optimization. Here, we present an automated refinement methodology based on iterative projections within the divide-and-concur framework. This approach enables seamless integration of geometric constraints with experimental density constraints derived from observed scattering amplitudes. By allowing each atom to satisfy density constraints independently, we show that this framework effectively circumvents tangling artifacts and achieves robust refinement performance, even for models initialized with R-factors as high as 12%. Just as iterative projections revolutionized phase retrieval in crystallography, we demonstrate that they can also address the optimization challenges in multi-conformational refinement. This work establishes a computational foundation for advancing crystallographic methodologies to resolve conformational heterogeneity and ultimately capture protein dynamics at atomic resolution.",

    "abstract": "Background: Many advanced cancer patients experience progression under immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) size profiles offer a promising noninvasive multi-cancer approach to monitor and predict immunotherapy response. Methods: In the SChISM (Size CfDNA Immunotherapy Signature Monitoring) study (NCT05083494), pre-treatment plasmatic cfDNA size profiles from 126 ICI-treated advanced carcinomas were quantified using the BIABooster device. Fragmentomederived variables (concentration, peaks' position, and fragment size ranges) at baseline were analyzed for associations with early progression (EP, progression at first imaging) and progression-free survival (PFS), using logistic and Cox regression models. Bootstrap analysis validated robustness. Additional analyses were performed in homogeneous subpopulations: first-line lung cancer patients (n = 60) and head-andneck patients treated with Nivolumab (n = 25). Results: Higher cfDNA concentration and high quantities of short fragments (111-240 base pairs (bp)) were associated with poor response, unlike long fragments (> 300 bp). The proportion of fragments longer than 1650 bp demonstrated highest discriminatory power (AUC = 0.73, C-index = 0.69). It was significantly associated with non-EP (odds ratio = 0.39 [95% CI: 0.25-0.62]) and longer PFS (hazard ratio: 0.54 [95% CI: 0.42-0.68]). These associations remained significant when adjusted for confounders (age, sex, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, tumor type, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio) and across both subpopulations. Bootstrap analysis confirmed robustness with mean accuracy of 70.1 $\\pm$ 4.17% and positive predictive value of 55.6 $\\pm$ 7.37%, in test sets. Conclusion: cfDNA size profiles significantly predicted ICI response and anticipate relapse, outperforming the routinely used marker programmed death-ligand 1 immunohistochemistry and reflecting enhanced immune system activation.

    "abstract": "High-throughput 3D quantitative phase imaging (QPI) in flow cytometry enables label-free, volumetric characterization of individual cells by reconstructing their refractive index (RI) distributions from multiple viewing angles during flow through microfluidic channels. However, current imaging methods assume that cells undergo uniform, single-axis rotation, which require their poses to be known at each frame. This assumption restricts applicability to near-spherical cells and prevents accurate imaging of irregularly shaped cells with complex rotations. As a result, only a subset of the cellular population can be analyzed, limiting the ability of flow-based assays to perform robust statistical analysis. We introduce OmniFHT, a pose-free 3D RI reconstruction framework that leverages the Fourier diffraction theorem and implicit neural representations (INRs) for high-throughput flow cytometry tomographic imaging. By jointly optimizing each cell's unknown rotational trajectory and volumetric structure under weak scattering assumptions, OmniFHT supports arbitrary cell geometries and multi-axis rotations. Its continuous representation also allows accurate reconstruction from sparsely sampled projections and restricted angular coverage, producing high-fidelity results with as few as 10 views or only 120 degrees of angular range. OmniFHT enables, for the first time, in situ, high-throughput tomographic imaging of entire flowing cell populations, providing a scalable and unbiased solution for label-free morphometric analysis in flow cytometry platforms.",

The app provides real-time output updates in response to input modifications and allows users to visualize and download simulated plots and data tables. The computational accuracy of TumorPred is validated against results from the Simcyp Simulator (Certara Inc.).

Despite the remarkable success of this approach, it remains unclear how to use such finely tuned models to study complex biological systems composed of numerous heterogeneous, interacting components. One possible strategy for taming this biological complexity is to embrace the idea that many biological behaviors we observe are ``typical'' and can be modeled using random systems that respect biologically-motivated constraints. Here, we review recent works showing how this approach can be used to make close connection with experiments in biological systems ranging from neuroscience to ecology and evolution and beyond. Collectively, these works suggest that the ``random-with-constraints'' paradigm represents a promising new modeling strategy for capturing experimentally observed dynamical and statistical features in high-dimensional biological data and provides a powerful minimal modeling philosophy for biology.",

Existing deep learning approaches for protein-ligand interpretability often rely on 3D structural input or use distance-based contact labels, limiting both their applicability and biological relevance. We introduce LINKER, the first sequence-based model to predict residue-functional group interactions in terms of biologically defined interaction types, using only protein sequences and the ligand SMILES as input. LINKER is trained with structure-supervised attention, where interaction labels are derived from 3D protein-ligand complexes via functional group-based motif extraction. By abstracting ligand structures into functional groups, the model focuses on chemically meaningful substructures while predicting interaction types rather than mere spatial proximity. Crucially, LINKER requires only sequence-level input at inference time, enabling large-scale application in settings where structural data is unavailable. Experiments on the LP-PDBBind benchmark demonstrate that structure-informed supervision over functional group abstractions yields interaction predictions closely aligned with ground-truth biochemical annotations.",

    "abstract": "Density Functional Theory (DFT) is a widely used computational method for estimating the energy and behavior of molecules. Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) are models trained to approximate DFT-level energies and forces at dramatically lower computational cost. Many modern MLIPs rely on a scalar regression formulation; given information about a molecule, they predict a single energy value and corresponding forces while minimizing absolute error with DFT's calculations. In this work, we explore a multi-class classification formulation that predicts a categorical distribution over energy/force values, providing richer supervision through multiple targets. Most importantly, this approach offers a principled way to quantify model uncertainty.   In particular, our method predicts a histogram of the energy/force distribution, converts scalar targets into histograms, and trains the model using cross-entropy loss. Our results demonstrate that this categorical formulation can achieve absolute error performance comparable to regression baselines. Furthermore, this representation enables the quantification of epistemic uncertainty through the entropy of the predicted distribution, offering a measure of model confidence absent in scalar regression approaches.",

    "abstract": "Cellular signaling networks represent complex information processing systems that have been modeled via traditional mathematical or statistical approaches. However, these methods often struggle to capture context-dependent signaling, pathway cross-talk, and temporal dynamics across multiple biological scales. Here, we introduce hierarchical molecular language models (HMLMs), a novel architecture that proposes a molecular network-specific large language model (LLM) to use in intracellular communication as a specialized molecular language, which includes molecules as tokens, protein interactions, post-translational modifications, and regulatory events modeled as semantic relationships within an adapted transformer architecture. HMLMs employ graph-structured attention mechanisms to accommodate signaling network topology while integrating information across the molecular, pathway, and cellular scales through hierarchical attention patterns. We demonstrate HMLM superiority using a cardiac fibroblast signaling network comprising over 100 molecular species across functional modules connected by regulatory edges. HMLM achieved a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.058 for temporal signaling predictions, representing 30% improvement over graph neural networks (GNNs: 0.083) and 52% improvement over ordinary differential equation models (ODEs: 0.121), with particular advantages under sparse temporal sampling conditions where HMLM maintained MSE = 0.041 with only 4 time-points. The HMLMs offer a foundation for AI-driven biology and medicine with predictable scaling characteristics suitable for interactive applications. By bridging molecular mechanisms with cellular phenotypes through AI-driven molecular language representation, HMLMs provide a powerful paradigm for systems biology that advances precision medicine applications and therapeutic discovery in the era of AI.",

    "abstract": "This paper analyses of a stochastic model of a chemical reaction network with three types of chemical species ${\\cal R}$, ${\\cal M}$ and ${\\cal U}$ that interact to transform a flow of external resources, the chemical species ${\\cal Q}$, to produce a product, the chemical species ${\\cal P}_r$. A regulation mechanism involving the sequestration of the chemical species ${\\cal R}$ when the flow of resources is too low is investigated. The original motivation of the study is of analyzing the qualitative properties of a key regulation mechanism of gene expression in biological cells, the {\\em stringent response}.   A scaling analysis of a Markov process in $\\N^5$ representing the state of the chemical reaction network is achieved. It is shown that, depending on the parameters of the model, there are, quite surprisingly, three possible asymptotic regimes. To each of them corresponds a stochastic averaging principle with a fast process expressed in terms of a network of $M/M/\\infty$ queues. One of these regimes, the optimal sequestration regime, does not seem to have been identified up to now. Under this regime, the input flow of resources is low but the state of the network is still acceptable in terms of unused macro-molecules, showing the remarkable efficiency of this regulation mechanism. The technical proofs of the main convergence results rely on a combination of coupling arguments, technical estimates of the solutions of SDEs, of sample paths of fast processes in particular, and the stability properties of some dynamical systems in $\\R^2$.",

While existing methods can reconstruct cellular trajectories or infer static gene regulatory networks (GRNs), they often fail to quantify time-resolved regulatory effects within specific temporal windows. Here, we present Time-varying Network Driver Estimation (TNDE), a computational framework quantifying dynamic gene driver effects from single-cell snapshot data under a linear Markov assumption. TNDE leverages a shared graph attention encoder to preserve the local topological structure of the data. Furthermore, by incorporating partial optimal transport, TNDE accounts for unmatched cells arising from proliferation or apoptosis, thereby enabling trajectory alignment in non-equilibrium processes. Benchmarking on simulated datasets demonstrates that TNDE outperforms existing baseline methods across diverse complex regulatory scenarios. Applied to mouse erythropoiesis data, TNDE identifies stage-specific driver genes, the functional relevance of which is corroborated by biological validation. TNDE offers an effective quantitative tool for dissecting dynamic regulatory mechanisms underlying complex biological processes.",

The same algorithmic approach can also be used to determine autocatalytic cores only. As a showcase application, we provide a complete analysis of autocatalysis in the core metabolism of E. coli and enumerate irreducible autocatalytic subsystems of limited size in full-fledged metabolic networks of E. coli, human erythrocytes, and Methanosarcina barkeri (Archea).

In particular, one-wing chaos is reported in quadratic DSs with only one quadratic monomial, while two-wing and hidden chaos in quadratic DSs with only two quadratic monomials. However, none of the reported DSs can be realized with chemical reactions. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we investigate chaos in chemical dynamical systems (CDSs) - a subset of polynomial DSs that can model the dynamics of mass-action chemical reaction networks. To this end, we develop a fundamental theory for mapping polynomial DSs into CDSs of the same dimension and with a reduced number of non-linear terms. Applying this theory, we show that, under suitable robustness assumptions, quadratic CDSs, and cubic CDSs with only one cubic, can display a rich set of chaotic solutions already in three dimensions. Furthermore, we construct some relatively simple three-dimensional examples, including a quadratic CDS with one-wing chaos and three quadratics, a cubic CDS with two-wing chaos and one cubic, and a quadratic CDS with hidden chaos and five quadratics.",

Mapping protein features into hyperbolic space led to much higher accuracy than previous methods in predicting host-pathogen interactions. From tens of millions of possible protein pairs, our model identified thousands of high-confidence interactions, including many involving human G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). We validated dozens of these predicted complexes using AlphaFold 3 structural modeling, supporting the accuracy of our predictions.

In contrast, building on recent theoretical advances, we introduce here \\textsc{BiRNe} (BIfurcations in Reaction NEtworks) Python module, which relies on a symbolic approach designed to detect bifurcations in larger reaction networks (up to 10-20 species, depending on the network's connectivity) equipped with parameter-rich kinetics.

When evaluating the inferred network, assessing the networks based on their intervention effects is particularly important for downstream probabilistic reasoning and the identification of potential drug targets. In the context of gene regulatory network inference, biological databases are often used as reference sources. These databases typically describe relationships in a qualitative rather than quantitative manner. However, few evaluation metrics have been developed that take this qualitative nature into account. To address this, we developed a metric, the sign-augmented Structural Intervention Distance (sSID), and a weighted sSID that incorporates the net effects of the intervention. Through simulations and analyses of real transcriptomic datasets, we found that our proposed metrics could identify a different algorithm as optimal compared to conventional metrics, and the network selected by sSID had a superior performance in the classification task of clinical covariates using transcriptomic data. This suggests that sSID can distinguish networks that are structurally correct but functionally incorrect, highlighting its potential as a more biologically meaningful and practical evaluation metric.",

Such a sweeping claim that one-fourth of the human kinome directly targets the CTD represents a profound revision of canonical transcriptional biology. However, the evidence presented relies primarily on in vitro kinase assays using short CTD peptides, sparse in-cell validation, and mechanistically incomplete models of nuclear trafficking, chromatin targeting, structural compatibility, and catalytic specificity. In this extended critique, we demonstrate that the conclusions of this study are not supported by current biochemical, structural, cell biological, or genomic data. We outline severe shortcomings in assay design, lack of quantitative kinetics, incompatibilities with known Pol II structural constraints, unsupported assumptions about nuclear localization, inappropriate extension to \"direct-at-gene\" mechanisms, absence of global transcriptional effects, failure to align with the essential role of canonical CDKs, and missing transparency in dataset reporting. We conclude that the central claims of the study are premature and contradicted by decades of established transcriptional research.

We study how multistationarity in the sequential n-site phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle is affected when only some species are open, meaning allowed to exchange with the environment (so-called semi-open networks). Working under mass action kinetics, we obtain two complementary structural results for every $n\\geq 2$. First, opening any nonempty subset of the substrate species preserves the network's capacity for nondegenerate multistationarity. Second, opening the enzyme species (both kinase and phosphatase), possibly together with any subset of substrates, always destroys multistationarity. The latter result is proved by a general reduction framework combining the detection of absolute concentration robustness (ACR) with projection onto the remaining species; when the projection is monostationary, the full semi-open system is monostationary. We also illustrate the general method on multi-layer cascade variants and discuss biological implications: opening enzymes acts as a robust switch that converts a potentially multistationary phosphorylation module into a monostationary one, while substrate exchange preserves switching capacity and thus the ability to couple cycles to downstream processes.",

    "abstract": "We examine a biomolecular machine involving a driven, observable process coupled to a hidden process in a kinetically cooperative manner. A stochastic thermodynamics framework is employed to analyze a fluctuation theorem for the first-passage time of the observable process under nonequilibrium steady-state conditions. Based on a generic kinetic model, we demonstrate that, along first-passage trajectories, entropy production remains constant when the changes in stochastic entropy and free energy of the machine are balanced, which corresponds to zero net hidden flux through the initial state manifold. Under this condition, which we define quite generally, this first-passage time fluctuation theorem can be established, with its violation serving as an experimentally detectable signature of hidden detailed balance breaking (which we subsequently characterize). In addition, using an enzymatic model, we show that the violation of our first-passage time fluctuation theorem can be thought of as a consequence of the breakdown of local detailed balance in the steps linking coarse-grained states that correspond to the initial and intermediate state manifolds. In the absence of hidden current, the fluctuation theorem is restored, and a mesoscopic local detailed balance condition can be established, which has implications for the thermodynamic analysis of driven, coarse-grained systems. This work sheds significant light on the unique connections between stochastic thermodynamic quantities and kinetic measurements in complex cooperative networks.",

    "abstract": "Stochastic reaction networks with mass-action kinetics provide a useful framework for understanding processes -- biochemical and otherwise -- in homogeneous environments. However, cellular reactions are often compartmentalized, either at the cell level or within cells, and hence non-homogeneous. A general framework for compartmentalized chemistry with dynamic compartments was proposed in (Duso and Zechner, PNAS, 2020), and the special case where the compartment dynamics do not depend on their contents was studied mathematically in (Anderson and Howells, Bull. Math. Biol., 2023). In the present paper, we investigate the case in which the rate of fragmentation of a compartment depends on the abundance of some designated species inside that compartment. The main focus of this work is on providing general conditions for (positive) recurrence and non-explosivity of the models. In particular, we demonstrate that the explosivity characterization from (Anderson and Howells, Bull. Math. Biol., 2023) fails in this setting and provide new sufficient conditions for non-explosivity and positive recurrence, under the assumption that the underlying CRN admits a linear Lyapunov function. These results extend the theoretical foundation for modeling content-mediated compartment dynamics, with implications for systems such as cell division and intracellular transport.",

    "abstract": "In molecular property prediction, the most valuable compounds (e.g., high potency) often occupy sparse regions of the target space. Standard Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) commonly optimize for the average error, underperforming on these uncommon but critical cases, with existing oversampling methods often distorting molecular topology. In this paper, we introduce SPECTRA, a Spectral Target-Aware graph augmentation framework that generates realistic molecular graphs in the spectral domain. SPECTRA (i) reconstructs multi-attribute molecular graphs from SMILES; (ii) aligns molecule pairs via (Fused) Gromov-Wasserstein couplings to obtain node correspondences; (iii) interpolates Laplacian eigenvalues, eigenvectors and node features in a stable share-basis; and (iv) reconstructs edges to synthesize physically plausible intermediates with interpolated targets. A rarity-aware budgeting scheme, derived from a kernel density estimation of labels, concentrates augmentation where data are scarce. Coupled with a spectral GNN using edge-aware Chebyshev convolutions, SPECTRA densifies underrepresented regions without degrading global accuracy. On benchmarks, SPECTRA consistently improves error in relevant target ranges while maintaining competitive overall MAE, and yields interpretable synthetic molecules whose structure reflects the underlying spectral geometry. Our results demonstrate that spectral, geometry-aware augmentation is an effective and efficient strategy for imbalanced molecular property regression.",

    "title": "A Gene Ranking Framework Enhances the Design Efficiency of Genome-Scale Constraint-Based Metabolic Networks",
    "abstract": "The design of genome-scale constraint-based metabolic networks has steadily advanced, with an increasing number of successful cases achieving growth-coupled production, in which the biosynthesis of key metabolites is linked to cell growth. However, a major cause of design failures is the inability to find solutions within realistic time limits. Therefore, it is essential to develop methods that achieve a high success rate within the specified computation time. In this study, we propose a framework for ranking the importance of individual genes to accelerate the solution of the original mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problems in the design of constraint-based models. In the proposed method, after pre-assigning values to highly important genes, the MILPs are solved in parallel as a series of mutually exclusive subproblems. It is found that our framework was able to recover most of the successful cases identified by the original approach and achieved a 37% to 186% increase in success rate compared to the original method within the same time limits. Analysis of the MILP solution process revealed that the proposed method reduced the sizes of subproblems and decreased the number of nodes in the branch-and-bound tree. This framework for ranking gene importance can be directly applicable to a range of MILP-based algorithms for the design of constraint-based metabolic networks. The developed scripts are available on https://github.com/MetNetComp/Gene-Ranked-RatGene.",

We show that for fundamental gene regulation network, the bio-controller derived from LQR theory precisely recapitulate natural network motifs, such as auto-regulation and incoherent feedforward loops. This emulation arises from a fundamental principle: the LQR cost function mathematically encodes environmental survival demands, which subsequently drives the selection of both network topology and biochemical parameters. Our work thus establishes a theoretical basis for interpreting biological circuit design, directly linking evolutionary pressures to observable regulatory structures.",

    "title": "Biological Regulatory Network Inference through Circular Causal Structure Learning",
    "abstract": "Biological networks are pivotal in deciphering the complexity and functionality of biological systems. Causal inference, which focuses on determining the directionality and strength of interactions between variables rather than merely relying on correlations, is considered a logical approach for inferring biological networks. Existing methods for causal structure inference typically assume that causal relationships between variables can be represented by directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). However, this assumption is at odds with the reality of widespread feedback loops in biological systems, making these methods unsuitable for direct use in biological network inference. In this study, we propose a new framework named SCALD (Structural CAusal model for Loop Diagram), which employs a nonlinear structure equation model and a stable feedback loop conditional constraint through continuous optimization to infer causal regulatory relationships under feedback loops. We observe that SCALD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in inferring both transcriptional regulatory networks and signaling transduction networks. SCALD has irreplaceable advantages in identifying feedback regulation. Through transcription factor (TF) perturbation data analysis, we further validate the accuracy and sensitivity of SCALD. Additionally, SCALD facilitates the discovery of previously unknown regulatory relationships, which we have subsequently confirmed through ChIP-seq data analysis. Furthermore, by utilizing SCALD, we infer the key driver genes that facilitate the transformation from colon inflammation to cancer by examining the dynamic changes within regulatory networks during the process.",

    "abstract": "Simplified stochastic models are widely used in the study of frequency-resolved noise propagation in biochemical reaction networks, a common measure being the coherence between random fluctuations in molecule number trajectories. Such models have also found widespread application in the quantification of how information is transmitted in reaction networks via the mutual information (MI) rate. A common assumption is that, under timescale separation, estimates for the coherence and MI rate obtained from simplified (reduced) models closely approximate those in the underlying full models. Here, we challenge that assumption by showing that, while reduced models can faithfully reproduce low-order statistics of molecular counts, they frequently incur substantial discrepancies in the coherence spectrum, especially at intermediate and high frequencies. These errors, in turn, lead to significant inaccuracies in the resulting estimates for the MI rates. We show that the observed discrepancies are due to the interplay between the structure of the underlying reaction networks, the specific model reduction method that is applied, and the asymptotic limits relating the full and the reduced models. We illustrate our results in canonical models of enzyme catalysis and gene expression, highlighting practical implications for quantifying information flow in cells.",

    "abstract": "This article serves to concisely review the link between gradient flow systems on hypergraphs and information geometry which has been established within the last five years. Gradient flow systems describe a wealth of physical phenomena and provide powerful analytical technquies which are based on the variational energy-dissipation principle. Modern nonequilbrium physics has complemented this classical principle with thermodynamic uncertaintly relations, speed limits, entropy production rate decompositions, and many more. In this article, we formulate these modern principles within the framework of perturbed gradient flow systems on hypergraphs. In particular, we discuss the geometry induced by the Bregman divergence, the physical implications of dual foliations, as well as the corresponding infinitesimal Riemannian geometry for gradient flow systems. Through the geometrical perspective, we are naturally led to new concepts such as moduli spaces for perturbed gradient flow systems and thermodynamical area which is crucial for understanding speed limits. We hope to encourage the readers working in either of the two fields to further expand on and foster the interaction between the two fields.",

    "abstract": "Canalization is a key organizing principle in complex systems, particularly in gene regulatory networks. It describes how certain input variables exert dominant control over a function's output, thereby imposing hierarchical structure and conferring robustness to perturbations. Degeneracy, in contrast, captures redundancy among input variables and reflects the complete dominance of some variables by others. Both properties influence the stability and dynamics of discrete dynamical systems, yet their combinatorial underpinnings remain incompletely understood. Here, we derive recursive formulas for counting Boolean functions with prescribed numbers of essential variables and given canalizing properties. In particular, we determine the number of non-degenerate canalizing Boolean functions -- that is, functions for which all variables are essential and at least one variable is canalizing. Our approach extends earlier enumeration results on canalizing and nested canalizing functions. It provides a rigorous foundation for quantifying how frequently canalization occurs among random Boolean functions and for assessing its pronounced over-representation in biological network models, where it contributes to both robustness and to the emergence of distinct regulatory roles.",

    "abstract": "Multimodal molecular representation learning, which jointly models molecular graphs and their textual descriptions, enhances predictive accuracy and interpretability by enabling more robust and reliable predictions of drug toxicity, bioactivity, and physicochemical properties through the integration of structural and semantic information. However, existing multimodal methods suffer from two key limitations: (1) they typically perform cross-modal interaction only at the final encoder layer, thus overlooking hierarchical semantic dependencies; (2) they lack a unified prototype space for robust alignment between modalities. To address these limitations, we propose ProtoMol, a prototype-guided multimodal framework that enables fine-grained integration and consistent semantic alignment between molecular graphs and textual descriptions. ProtoMol incorporates dual-branch hierarchical encoders, utilizing Graph Neural Networks to process structured molecular graphs and Transformers to encode unstructured texts, resulting in comprehensive layer-wise representations. Then, ProtoMol introduces a layer-wise bidirectional cross-modal attention mechanism that progressively aligns semantic features across layers. Furthermore, a shared prototype space with learnable, class-specific anchors is constructed to guide both modalities toward coherent and discriminative representations. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that ProtoMol consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across a variety of molecular property prediction tasks.",

    "abstract": "Dynamical systems in the life sciences are often composed of complex mixtures of overlapping behavioral regimes. Cellular subpopulations may shift from cycling to equilibrium dynamics or branch towards different developmental fates. The transitions between these regimes can appear noisy and irregular, posing a serious challenge to traditional, flow-based modeling techniques which assume locally smooth dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose MODE (Mixture Of Dynamical Experts), a graphical modeling framework whose neural gating mechanism decomposes complex dynamics into sparse, interpretable components, enabling both the unsupervised discovery of behavioral regimes and accurate long-term forecasting across regime transitions. Crucially, because agents in our framework can jump to different governing laws, MODE is especially tailored to the aforementioned noisy transitions. We evaluate our method on a battery of synthetic and real datasets from computational biology. First, we systematically benchmark MODE on an unsupervised classification task using synthetic dynamical snapshot data, including in noisy, few-sample settings. Next, we show how MODE succeeds on challenging forecasting tasks which simulate key cycling and branching processes in cell biology. Finally, we deploy our method on human, single-cell RNA sequencing data and show that it can not only distinguish proliferation from differentiation dynamics but also predict when cells will commit to their ultimate fate, a key outstanding challenge in computational biology.",

    "abstract": "Due to the ever-rising global incidence rate of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and the lack of effective clinical treatment drugs, elucidating the detailed pathogenesis, seeking novel targets, and developing promising drugs are the top priority for IBD treatment. Here, we demonstrate that the levels of microRNA (miR)-103a were significantly downregulated in the inflamed mucosa of ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, along with elevated inflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta/TNF-alpha) and reduced tight junction protein (Occludin/ZO-1) levels, as compared with healthy control objects. Consistently, miR-103a deficient intestinal epithelial cells Caco-2 showed serious inflammatory responses and increased permeability, and DSS induced more severe colitis in miR-103a-/- mice than wild-type ones. Mechanistic studies unraveled that c-FOS suppressed miR-103a transcription via binding to its promoter, then miR-103a-targeted NF-kappaB activation contributes to inflammatory responses and barrier disruption by targeting TAB2 and TAK1. Notably, the traditional Chinese medicine Cornus officinalis (CO) and its core active ingredient loganin potently mitigated inflammation and barrier disruption in UC by specifically blocking the EGFR/RAS/ERK/c-FOS signaling axis, these effects mainly attributed to modulated miR-103a levels as the therapeutic activities of them were almost completely shielded in miR-103a KO mice. Taken together, this work reveals that loganin relieves EGFR/c-FOS axis-suppressed epithelial miR-103a expression, thereby inhibiting NF-kappaB pathway activation, suppressing inflammatory responses, and preserving tight junction integrity in UC. Thus, our data enrich mechanistic insights and promising targets for UC treatment.",

The mathematical study of these dynamical systems is challenging due to the possibility of multistability, oscillations, and chaotic dynamics. One important tool for this study is the concept of reaction systems, which are dynamical systems generated by reaction networks for some choices of parameter values. Among these, disguised toric systems are remarkably stable: they have a unique attracting fixed point, and cannot give rise to oscillations or chaotic dynamics. The computation of the set of parameter values for which a network gives rise to disguised toric systems (i.e., the disguised toric locus of the network) is an important but difficult task. We introduce new ideas based on network fluxes for studying the disguised toric locus. We prove that the disguised toric locus of any network $G$ is a contractible manifold with boundary, and introduce an associated graph $G^{\\max}$ that characterizes its interior. These theoretical tools allow us, for the first time, to compute the full disguised toric locus for many networks of interest.",

However, this integration is challenging due to inconsistencies between data and knowledge bases, such as noise, misannotation, and incompleteness.

We utilize Persistent Sheaf Laplacians (PSL) to facilitate a Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) analysis of AD targets inferred from differential gene expression (DEG), and then use machine learning models to predict repurpose-able DrugBank compounds for molecular targeting. We screen the efficacy of different DrugBank small compounds and further examine their central nervous system (CNS)-relevant ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity), resulting in a list of lead candidates for AD treatment.

    "abstract": "Control of transcription presides over a vast array of biological processes including through gene regulatory circuits that exhibit multistability. Two- and three-gene network motifs are often found to be critical parts of the repertoire of metabolic and developmental pathways. Theoretical models of these circuits, however, typically vary parameters such as dissociation constants, transcription rates, and degradation rates without specifying precisely how these parameters are controlled biologically. In this paper, we examine the role of effector molecules, which can alter the concentrations of the active transcription factors that control regulation, and are ubiquitous to regulatory processes across biological settings. We specifically consider allosteric regulation in the context of extending the standard bistable switch to three-gene networks, and explore the rich multistable dynamics exhibited in these architectures as a function of effector concentrations. We then study how the conditions required for tristability and more complex dynamics, and the bifurcations in dynamic phase space upon tuning effector concentrations, evolve under various interpretations of regulatory circuit mechanics, the underlying activity of inducers, and perturbations thereof. Notably, the biological mechanism by which we model effector control over dual-function proteins transforms not only the phenotypic trend of dynamic tuning but also the set of available dynamic regimes. In this way, we determine key parameters and regulatory features that drive phenotypic decisions, and offer an experimentally tunable structure for encoding inducible multistable behavior arising from both single and dual-function allosteric transcription factors.",

While deep learning has advanced this task, most models fuse ligand and protein representations via simple concatenation and lack explicit geometric regularization, resulting in poor generalization across chemical space and time. We introduce FIRM-DTI, a lightweight framework that conditions molecular embeddings on protein embeddings through a feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM) layer and enforces metric structure with a triplet loss. An RBF regression head operating on embedding distances yields smooth, interpretable affinity predictions. Despite its modest size, FIRM-DTI achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Therapeutics Data Commons DTI-DG benchmark, as demonstrated by an extensive ablation study and out-of-domain evaluation. Our results underscore the value of conditioning and metric learning for robust drug-target affinity prediction.",

    "title": "Biochemical Network Motifs Under Periodic Forcing: A Selective Catalogue of Transfer Functions and Frequency Response Properties",
    "abstract": "Understanding the function of network motifs in an attempt to gain insight into how their combinations create larger reaction networks that drive cellular functions, has been a longstanding pursuit of systems biology. One specific objective within this pursuit is understanding how individual motifs respond to pulsatile and oscillatory signals. This is especially relevant because biochemical networks are often activated by signals that, in nature, occur in the form of pulses and oscillations. A powerful analytical tool for studying such dynamics is the transfer function: a compact frequency-domain description of input-output dynamics. In this work, we derive transfer functions for a set of commonly studied network motifs and characterise their responses to pulsatile and oscillatory inputs. The novelty of this review does not lie in the introduction of new mathematical theorems or biological discoveries, but in bridging well-established frequency domain formalisms from control theory with the analysis of biochemical networks under periodic forcing. In doing so, our contributions are threefold: 1. A systematic derivation and compilation of transfer functions for common network motifs: consolidating results scattered across the literature and establishing a consistent formalism for motif-level transfer functions. 2. Contextualisation of these transfer functions within biological models: extending abstract transfer functions to concrete biological settings so that the results are readily applicable without extensive mathematical labour. 3. Resolution of ambiguity between biological and control-theoretic treatments of feedback: clarifying how feedback loops should be understood within the transfer function formalism and reconciling differences between biology literature and control-oriented literature. This is done by formalising the notion of an intrinsic transfer function.",

    "abstract": "The ability to detect whether a species (or dimension) is zero in Chemical Reaction Networks (CRN), Vector Addition Systems, or Petri Nets is known to increase the power of these models -- making them capable of universal computation. While this ability may appear in many forms, such as extending the models to allow transitions to be inhibited, prioritized, or synchronized, we present an extension that directly performs this zero checking. We introduce a new void genesis CRN variant with a simple design that merely increments the count of a specific species when any other species' count goes to zero. As with previous extensions, we show that the model is Turing Universal. We then analyze several other studied CRN variants and show that they are all equivalent through a polynomial simulation with the void genesis model, which does not merely follow from Turing-universality. Thus, inhibitor species, reactions that occur at different rates, being allowed to run reactions in parallel, or even being allowed to continually add more volume to the CRN, does not add additional simulation power beyond simply detecting if a species count becomes zero.",

We present a new algorithm for the exact simulation of chemical reaction networks that is capable of sampling multiple reactions at a time via a first-order approximation similarly to the tau-leaping methods.

However, their function in modulating the physiology of pathogens requires further investigation. This review focuses on RNA-binding proteins displaying CAT (Co-AntiTerminator) or ANTAR (AmiR and NasR Transcription Antitermination Regulators) domains reported in model bacteria. In particular, their structures, mechanism of action, and target genes will be described. The involvement of the antitermination mechanisms in bacterial pathogenicity is also discussed.

The software package COBRApy for Constraint-Based Modelling currently offers only an out-of-the-box dFBA implementation for the simulation of the batch growth of a single species over an interval divided in $n$ time steps.

To understand how gene regulatory networks process information during cell state transitions, we study stochastic dynamics derived from a Boolean network model via its representation on the parameter space of Gaussian distributions, equipped with the Fisher information metric. This reformulation reveals that the trajectories of optimal information transfer are gradient flows of the Kullback-Leibler divergence. We demonstrate that the most efficient dynamics require isotropic decay rates across all nodes and that the noise intensity quantitatively determines the potential differentiation between the initial and final states. Furthermore, we show that paths minimizing biological cost correspond to metric geodesics that require noise suppression, leading to biologically irrelevant deterministic dynamics. Our approach frames noise and decay rates as fundamental control parameters for cellular differentiation, providing a geometric principle for the analysis and design of synthetic networks.",

This study introduces a quantum-inspired framework leveraging tensor networks (TNs) to optimally map expression data into a lower dimensional representation preserving biological locality. Using Quantum Mutual Information (QMI), a nonparametric measure natural for tensor networks, we quantify gene dependencies and establish statistical significance via permutation testing. This constructs robust interaction networks where the edges reflect biologically meaningful relationships that are resilient to random chance. The approach effectively distinguishes true regulatory patterns from experimental noise and biological stochasticity. To test the proposed method, we recover a gene regulatory network consisted of six pathway genes from single-cell RNA sequencing data comprising over $28.000$ lymphoblastoid cells. Furthermore, we unveil several triadic regulatory mechanisms. By merging quantum physics inspired techniques with computational biology, our method provides novel insights into gene regulation, with applications in disease mechanisms and precision medicine.",

    "abstract": "Competitive inhibitors can, paradoxically, stimulate an enzymatic reaction at low to moderate doses. Competitive inhibition of an enzyme occurs when an inhibitor binds to the enzyme's binding site and blocks the enzyme's target molecule from binding. We recently proposed a detailed but straightforward mass action model for competitive inhibition of phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1) by Terazosin (TZ). The full PGK1 model has two substrates and two products which can be bound and released in either order, known as a random bi-bi mechanism. This model, with no further modification, predicts an increased reaction rate at low or moderate TZ doses, suggesting that stimulation is an intrinsic feature of competitive inhibition in enzymes with two products. This mechanism can aid in the development of novel therapies, particularly since enzyme activators are more rare and difficult to design than inhibitors. Here we propose a three-timescale reduction of that detailed model and show that the resulting rate equation retains three essential attributes of competitive inhibitor stimulation. These attributes are the biphasic dose response, the dependence on the relative rates of product dissociation from the binary and ternary complexes, and the parameter region where stimulation is possible. The resulting rate equation is a rational function which is a Monod function of each substrate, but quadratic in the denominator as a function of inhibitor dose.",

    "abstract": "In previous works, we introduced the notion of dominant vertices. This is a set of nodes in the underlying network whose evolution determines the whole network's dynamics after a transient time. In this paper, we focus on the case of Boolean networks. We define a reduced graph on the dominant vertices and an induced automata network on this graph, which we prove is asymptotically equivalent to the original Boolean dynamics. Asymptotic conjugacy ensures that the systems, restricted to their respective attractors, are dynamically equivalent. For a significant class of networks, the induced automata network is indeed a reduction of the original system. In these cases, the reduction, which is obtained from the structure of dominant vertices, supplies a more tractable system with the same structure of attractors as the original one. Furthermore, the structure of the induced system allows us to establish bounds on the number and period of the attractors, as well as on the reduction of the basin's sizes and transient lengths. We illustrate this reduction by considering a class of networks, which we call clover networks, whose dominant set is a singleton. To get insight into the structure of the basins of attraction of Boolean networks with a single dominant vertex, we complement this work with a numerical exploration of the behavior of a parametrized ensemble of systems of this kind.",

We find that genes associated with each hallmark of aging form a connected subgraph, or hallmark module, a discovery enabling us to measure the proximity of 6,442 clinically approved or experimental compounds to each hallmark. We then introduce a transcription-based metric, $pAGE$, which evaluates whether the drug-induced expression shifts reinforce or counteract known age-related expression changes. By integrating network proximity and $pAGE$, we identify multiple drug repurposing candidate that not only target specific hallmarks but act to reverse their aging-associated transcriptional changes. Our findings are interpretable, revealing for each drug the molecular mechanisms through which it modulates the hallmark, offering an experimentally falsifiable framework to leverage genomic discoveries to accelerate drug repurposing for longevity.",

Most biological networks exhibit a high degree of canalization, a property of the Boolean update rules that stabilizes network dynamics. Despite its importance, existing software packages provide hardly any support for generating Boolean networks with defined canalization properties.   We present BoolForge, a Python toolbox for the analysis and random generation of Boolean functions and networks, with a particular focus on canalization. BoolForge allows users to (i) generate random Boolean functions with specified canalizing depth, layer structure, or other structural constraints; (ii) construct random Boolean networks with tunable topological and functional properties; and (iii) compute structural and dynamical features including network attractors, robustness, and modularity. BoolForge enables researchers to rapidly prototype biological Boolean network models, explore the relationship between structure and dynamics, and generate ensembles of networks for statistical analysis. It is lightweight, adaptable, and fully compatible with existing Boolean network analysis tools.   BoolForge is implemented in Python (version3.8+), with no platform-specific dependencies.

    "abstract": "Biological pathways map gene-gene interactions that govern all human processes. Despite their importance, most ML models treat genes as unstructured tokens, discarding known pathway structure. The latest pathway-informed models capture pathway-pathway interactions, but still treat each pathway as a \"bag of genes\" via MLPs, discarding its topology and gene-gene interactions. We propose a Graph Attention Network (GAT) framework that models pathways at the gene level. We show that GATs generalize much better than MLPs, achieving an 81% reduction in MSE when predicting pathway dynamics under unseen treatment conditions. We further validate the correctness of our biological prior by encoding drug mechanisms via edge interventions, boosting model robustness. Finally, we show that our GAT model is able to correctly rediscover all five gene-gene interactions in the canonical TP53-MDM2-MDM4 feedback loop from raw time-series mRNA data, demonstrating potential to generate novel biological hypotheses directly from experimental data.",

    "abstract": "Microbiomes are a vital part of the human body, engaging in tasks like food digestion and immune defense. Their structure and function must be understood in order to promote host health and facilitate swift recovery during disease. Due to the difficulties in experimentally studying these systems in situ, more research is being conducted in the field of mathematical modeling. Visualizing spatiotemporal data is challenging, and current tools that simulate microbial communities' spatial and temporal development often only provide limited functionalities, often requiring expert knowledge to generate useful results. To overcome these limitations, we provide a user-friendly tool to interactively explore spatiotemporal simulation data, called MicroLabVR, which transfers spatial data into virtual reality (VR) while following guidelines to enhance user experience (UX). With MicroLabVR, users can import CSV datasets containing population growth, substance concentration development, and metabolic flux distribution data. The implemented visualization methods allow users to evaluate the dataset in a VR environment interactively. MicroLabVR aims to improve data analysis for the user by allowing the exploration of microbiome data in their spatial context.",

    "title": "Mutual Information Rate -- Linear Noise Approximation and Exact Computation",
    "abstract": "Efficient information processing is crucial for both living organisms and engineered systems. The mutual information rate, a core concept of information theory, quantifies the amount of information shared between the trajectories of input and output signals, and enables the quantification of information flow in dynamic systems. A common approach for estimating the mutual information rate is the Gaussian approximation which assumes that the input and output trajectories follow Gaussian statistics. However, this method is limited to linear systems, and its accuracy in nonlinear or discrete systems remains unclear. In this work, we assess the accuracy of the Gaussian approximation for non-Gaussian systems by leveraging Path Weight Sampling (PWS), a recent technique for exactly computing the mutual information rate. In two case studies, we examine the limitations of the Gaussian approximation. First, we focus on discrete linear systems and demonstrate that, even when the system's statistics are nearly Gaussian, the Gaussian approximation fails to accurately estimate the mutual information rate. Second, we explore a continuous diffusive system with a nonlinear transfer function, revealing significant deviations between the Gaussian approximation and the exact mutual information rate as nonlinearity increases. Our results provide a quantitative evaluation of the Gaussian approximation's performance across different stochastic models and highlight when more computationally intensive methods, such as PWS, are necessary.",

    "abstract": "Determining mechanistic models of gene regulation, especially underlying phenotypic variation, is a central goal of both mathematical biology and modern evolutionary biology. However, several challenges, involving both common characteristics of experimental data and the model development process, remain that limit the discovery of general principles. Even the highest-quality experimental data come with challenges. There are always sources of noise, a limit to how often we can measure the system in time, and it is impossible to measure all the relevant states that participate in the full underlying complexity. Additionally, there are usually sources of uncertainty in the underlying biological mechanisms, which give rise to multiple competing model structures. We walk through a case study involving inference of a regulatory network structure involved in a developmental decision in the nematode, \\textit{Pristonchus pacificus}. In this study, we fit 13,824 distinct regulatory network models to gene expression data from three experimental conditions to determine which regulatory features are supported by the data. We discover \\textit{model sets}, or collections of models with shared regulatory network features that best fit the data, for each of the three experiments we considered, and identify a regulatory network in the intersection of the three model sets. This model describes the data across the experimental conditions and exhibits a high degree of positive regulation and interconnectivity between the key regulators, \\textit{eud-1}, \\textit{sult-1}, and \\textit{nhr-40}. While the biological results are specific to the molecular biology of development in \\textit{Pristonchus pacificus}, the comparative modeling framework introduced here can be applied to other systems of gene regulation in an evolutionary developmental context.",

In contrast to widely used indirect methods-such as those based on sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy)-which infer reaction dynamics by fitting numerically estimated derivatives, our approach fits entire trajectories by solving a dynamically constrained optimization problem. This formulation enables the construction of reduced CRNs that are both low-dimensional and sparse, while preserving key dynamical behaviors of the original system. We develop an accelerated proximal gradient algorithm to efficiently solve the resulting non-convex optimization problem. Through illustrative examples, including a Drosophila circadian oscillator and a glycolytic oscillator, we demonstrate the ability of our method to recover accurate and interpretable reduced-order CRNs. Notably, the direct approach avoids the derivative estimation step and mitigates error accumulation issues inherent in indirect methods, making it a robust alternative for data-driven CRN realizations.",

    "abstract": "Cancer research has traditionally focused on identifying driver genes, those with mutations that initiate tumorigenesis. The Cancer Driver Gene (CDG) paradigm, further supported by the observation of oncogene addiction in tumors, has successfully guided the development of targeted therapies. However, the limitations of this driver-centric view, highlighted by the broad emergence of frequent therapeutic resistance, the presence of driver mutations in healthy tissues or individuals, and the lack of identifiable drivers in many tumors, call for a shift in perspective and clinical practice. The latest network controllability perspective on cancer cells introduced the concept of Cancer Keeper Genes (CKGs) and a CKG-based paradigm for cancer therapeutics. The new concept encompasses the concept of non-oncogene addiction, emphasizing reliance on non-mutated pathways crucial for maintaining oncogenic cellular states. Here, we explore the transition towards a system-level understanding of cancer based on the CKG paradigm, emphasizing the essential role of genes required for tumor maintenance, irrespective of their initiating function or mutational capacity. We discuss clinical implications of this paradigm shift, highlighting the progress made so far and potential of targeting non-driver CKGs, genes involved in processes like DNA damage response, proteostasis, and metabolism, as a promising strategy to overcome therapeutic challenges and achieve more durable cancer control. Targeting these maintenance vulnerabilities represents a critical evolution in precision oncology, moving towards therapies designed to dismantle the networks sustaining malignancies.",

    "abstract": "Oscillatory chemical reactions are functional components in a variety of biological contexts. In chemistry, the construction and identification of even rudimentary oscillators remain elusive and lack a general framework. Using parameter-rich kinetics - a methodology enabling the disentanglement of parametric dependencies from structural analysis - we investigate the stoichiometry of chemical oscillators. We introduce the concept of oscillatory cores: minimal subnetworks that guarantee the potential for oscillations in any reaction network containing them. These cores fall into two classes, depending on whether they involve positive or negative feedback. In particular, the latter class unveils a family of oscillators - yet to be synthesized - that require a minimum number of reaction steps to exhibit oscillations, a phenomenon we refer to as the principle of length. We identify several mechanisms through which catalysis promotes oscillations: (I) furnishing instability (e.g. autocatalysis), (II) lifting dependencies, (III) lowering length thresholds. Notwithstanding this mechanistic ubiquity, we show that oscillators can also be realized without employing any catalysis. Our results highlight branches of chemistry where oscillators are likely to arise by chance, suggest new strategies for their design, and point to novel classes of oscillators yet to be realized experimentally.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the complex and stochastic nature of Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) remains a central challenge in systems biology. Existing modeling paradigms often struggle to effectively capture the intricate, multi-factor regulatory logic and to rigorously manage the dual uncertainties of network structure and kinetic parameters. In response, this work introduces the Probabilistic Categorical GRN(PC-GRN) framework. It is a novel theoretical approach founded on the synergistic integration of three core methodologies. Firstly, category theory provides a formal language for the modularity and composition of regulatory pathways. Secondly, Bayesian Typed Petri Nets (BTPNs) serve as an interpretable,mechanistic substrate for modeling stochastic cellular processes, with kinetic parameters themselves represented as probability distributions. The central innovation of PC-GRN is its end-to-end generative Bayesian inference engine, which learns a full posterior distribution over BTPN models (P (G, Θ|D)) directly from data. This is achieved by the novel interplay of a GFlowNet, which learns a policy to sample network topologies, and a HyperNetwork, which performs amortized inference to predict their corresponding parameter distributions. The resulting framework provides a mathematically rigorous, biologically interpretable, and uncertainty-aware representation of GRNs, advancing predictive modeling and systems-level analysis.",

    "abstract": "Biological organisms are simple at heart: cells, their basic units, perform a variety of behaviors by expressing proteins from DNA-encoded genes. Gene expression though depends on sets of often-convoluted regulatory interactions known as gene networks, contributing to biology's apparent complexity. Even in Escherichia coli K-12, the pioneering model organism of molecular biology, gene networks are complicated and inconsistent with gene expression data. Recent discoveries of multicellular self-organization in E. coli suggest a new model for gene regulation that may help in many cases: control of gene networks by multicellular interaction networks, i.e. the changing physical and chemical interactions between cells in communities. E. coli's observed dynamics indicate multicellular interactions serve as inputs for key gene networks, thereby producing robust expression of otherwise noisy genes. In turn, multicellular interaction networks are dynamically generated as outputs of gene networks during self-organization. Thus, multicellular self-organization enables uniquely-biological control mechanisms that are not available to individual cells. As further suggested by E. coli self-organization, the gene-network outputs from one multicellular stage can be linked, via multicellular interaction networks, to serve as the gene-network inputs for later stages, thereby creating multicellular daisy chains. Daisy chains are a general model for reliably propagating multicellular communities and, therefore, for predictably determining the gene-network inputs of each cell throughout multicellular self-organization and development. Considerations for several fields are briefly discussed and suggest multicellular daisy chains are a general mechanism for biological organisms to control cell behavior and to be simpler than the sum of their parts.",

We present a first principles theoretical framework, grounded in nonequilibrium thermodynamics, to describe GPCR switching as observed in light-controlled impedance assays. The model identifies two fundamental control parameters: (1) ATP/GTP-driven chemical flux through the receptor complex, and (2) the free-energy difference between phosphorylated and dephosphorylated switch states. Together, these parameters defin the switch configuration. The model predicts that GPCRs can occupy one of three quasi-stable configurations, each corresponding to a local maximum in information transmission. Active states support chemical flux and exist in an on or off switch configuration, whereas inactive states lack flux, introducing a distinction absent in conventional phosphorylation models. The model takes two ligand-derived inputs: fixed structural features and inducible conformations (e.g. cis or trans). It shows that phosphatase activity, modeled as an energy barrier, chiefly governs on/off occupancy, whereas the kinase sustains flux without directly determining the switch configuration. Comparison with experimental data confirms the predicted existence of multiple quasi-stable states modulated by ligand conformation. Importantly, this framework generalizes beyond GPCRs to encompass a wider class of biological switching systems driven by nonequilibrium chemical flux.",

We show that at homeostatic regime: i. the trajectories of the MRG expression levels can be adjusted towards specific ranges using both the exact solutions of the stochastic model and the exact stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA); ii. there exists a sampling rate which optimizes the feedback control of the MRG activity, and non-optimal controls resulting in alternative homeostatic dynamics; iii. the feedback control of MRG activity leads to updates which intensities and time intervals are non-linearly related; iv. the ON state probability of an MRG promoter has dynamics confined within a narrow domain. Our results help to understand the quantitative constraints underpinning dynamic homeostasis despite randomness, the mechanisms underlying alternative, non-optimal, homeostatic regimes, and may be useful for theoretically prototyping therapies aiming at gene networks modulation.",

Identifying the causal relation among these ID-associated genes and their gene expression pattern during brain development process would gain us a better understanding of the molecular basis of ID. In this paper, we interpret gene expression data collected at different time points during the in vitro brain development process as time series and further introduce Granger causality test to evaluate the dynamic dependence relations among genes. These evaluations are used as input to construct gene expression network and extract the pathological information associated to ID including identi-fying new genes that can be critically related to the disease.

    "title": "Decoding and Engineering the Phytobiome Communication for Smart Agriculture",
    "abstract": "Smart agriculture applications, integrating technologies like the Internet of Things and machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) into agriculture, hold promise to address modern challenges of rising food demand, environmental pollution, and water scarcity. Alongside the concept of the phytobiome, which defines the area including the plant, its environment, and associated organisms, and the recent emergence of molecular communication (MC), there exists an important opportunity to advance agricultural science and practice using communication theory. In this article, we motivate to use the communication engineering perspective for developing a holistic understanding of the phytobiome communication and bridge the gap between the phytobiome communication and smart agriculture. Firstly, an overview of phytobiome communication via molecular and electrophysiological signals is presented and a multi-scale framework modeling the phytobiome as a communication network is conceptualized. Then, how this framework is used to model electrophysiological signals is demonstrated with plant experiments. Furthermore, possible smart agriculture applications, such as smart irrigation and targeted delivery of agrochemicals, through engineering the phytobiome communication are proposed. These applications merge ML/AI methods with the Internet of Bio-Nano-Things enabled by MC and pave the way towards more efficient, sustainable, and eco-friendly agricultural production. Finally, the implementation challenges, open research issues, and industrial outlook for these applications are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Endothelial cells release various vasorelaxing molecules, such as nitric oxide and prostacyclin, along with defined factors that induce hyperpolarization of vascular smooth muscle cells through the opening of calcium-sensitive potassium channels. Potassium channel-dependent vasorelaxation is prevalent in microvessels and can partially compensate for deficiencies in other vasodilatory mechanisms. Enhancing this backup vasorelaxant mechanism may aid the treatment of microvascular disorders, such as cerebral small vessel disease and preeclampsia, a pregnancy-specific hypertensive syndrome, which is characterized by systemic endothelial dysfunction. The development of pharmacological potassium channel openers has encountered significant challenges, including issues of specificity, safety concerns, and off-target effects. This study critically evaluates the advantages and drawbacks of integrating hyperpolarization into a holistic vasorelaxant strategy for managing ischemic disease through single or combination drug therapies.",

    "abstract": "Background: The rational identification of essential genes is a cornerstone of drug discovery, yet standard computational methods like Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) often struggle to produce accurate predictions in complex, redundant metabolic networks. Hypothesis: We hypothesized that the topological structure of a metabolic network contains a more robust predictive signal for essentiality than functional simulations alone. Methodology: To test this hypothesis, we developed a machine learning pipeline by first constructing a reaction-reaction graph from the e_coli_core metabolic model. Graph-theoretic features, including betweenness centrality and PageRank, were engineered to describe the topological role of each gene. A RandomForestClassifier was trained on these features, and its performance was rigorously benchmarked against a standard FBA single-gene deletion analysis using a curated ground-truth dataset. Results: Our machine learning model achieved a solid predictive performance with an F1-Score of 0.400 (Precision: 0.412, Recall: 0.389). In profound contrast, the standard FBA baseline method failed to correctly identify any of the known essential genes, resulting in an F1-Score of 0.000. Conclusion: This work demonstrates that a \"structure-first\" machine learning approach is a significantly superior strategy for predicting gene essentiality compared to traditional FBA on the E. coli core network. By learning the topological signatures of critical network roles, our model successfully overcomes the known limitations of simulation-based methods in handling biological redundancy. While the performance of topology-only models is expected to face challenges on more complex genome-scale networks, this validated framework represents a significant step forward and highlights the primacy of network architecture in determining biological function.",

Autocatalysis was recently defined stoichiometrically for reaction networks; five types of minimal autocatalytic networks, termed autocatalytic cores were identified. A necessary and sufficient stoichiometric criterion was later established for dynamical autocatalysis in diluted regimes, ensuring a positive growth rate of autocatalytic species starting from infinitesimal concentrations, given that degradation rates are sufficiently low. Here, we show that minimal autocatalytic networks in the dynamical sense, in the diluted regime, follow the same classification as autocatalytic cores in the stoichiometric sense. We further prove the uniqueness of the stationary regimes of autocatalytic cores, with and without degradation, for all types, except types II with three catalytic loops or more. These results indicate that the stationary point is likely to be robust under perturbation at low concentrations. More complex behaviours are likely to arise by additional non-linear couplings between cores.",

    "abstract": "Computing equilibrium concentrations of molecular complexes is generally analytically intractable and requires numerical approaches. In this work we focus on the polymer-monomer level, where indivisible molecules (monomers) combine to form complexes (polymers). Rather than employing free-energy parameters for each polymer, we focus on the athermic setting where all interactions preserve enthalpy. This setting aligns with the strongly bonded (domain-based) regime in DNA nanotechnology when strands can bind in different ways, but always with maximum overall bonding -- and is consistent with the saturated configurations in the Thermodynamic Binding Networks (TBNs) model. Within this context, we develop an iterative algorithm for assigning polymer concentrations to satisfy detailed-balance, where on-target (desired) polymers are in high concentrations and off-target (undesired) polymers are in low. Even if not directly executed, our algorithm provides effective insights into upper bounds on concentration of off-target polymers, connecting combinatorial arguments about discrete configurations such as those in the TBN model to real-valued concentrations. We conclude with an application of our method to decreasing leak in DNA logic and signal propagation. Our results offer a new framework for design and verification of equilibrium concentrations when configurations are distinguished by entropic forces.",

Despite the molecular complexity of this process, recent studies reveal a surprising invariance of the \"switching correlation time\" ($T_C$), which characterizes promoter activity fluctuations, across gene expression levels in diverse genes and organisms. A biophysically plausible explanation for this invariance remains missing. Here, we show that this invariance imposes stringent constraints on minimal yet plausible models of transcriptional regulation, requiring at least four system states and non-equilibrium dynamics that break detailed balance. Using Bayesian inference on Drosophila gap gene expression data, we demonstrate that such models (i) accurately reproduce the observed $T_C$-invariance; (ii) remain robust to parameter perturbations; and (iii) maximize information transmission from transcription factor concentration to gene expression. These findings suggest that eukaryotic gene regulation has evolved to balance precision with reaction rate and energy dissipation constraints, favoring non-equilibrium architectures for optimal information transmission.",

    "abstract": "Random graph models have been instrumental in characterizing complex networks, but chemical reaction networks (CRNs) are better represented as hypergraphs. Traditional models of random CRNs often reduce CRNs to bipartite graphs, representing species and reactions as distinct nodes, or simpler derived graphs, which can obscure the relationship between the statistical properties of these representations and the physical characteristics of the CRN. We introduce a straightforward model for generating random CRNs that preserves their hypergraph structure as well as atomic composition, enabling the direct study of chemically relevant features. Notably, our approach distinguishes two notions of connectivity that are equivalent in graphs but differ fundamentally in hypergraphs. These notions exhibit percolation-like phase transitions, which we analyze in detail. The first type of connectivity has relevance to steady-state synthesis and transduction, determining the effective reactions an open CRN can perform at steady state. The second type is suitable to identify which species can be produced from a given initial set of species in a closed CRN. Our findings highlight the importance of hypergraph-based modeling for uncovering the complex behaviors of CRNs.",

These models are continuous-time Markov chains whose transition rates depend on certain parameters called rate constants, which despite the name may not be constant in real-world applications. In this paper we study how random switching between different stochastic reaction networks with asymptotically linear rate functions affects the stability of the process. We give matrix conditions for both positive recurrence (indeed, exponentially ergodicity) and transience (indeed, evanescence) in both the regime with high switching rates and the regime with low switching rates. We then make use of these conditions to provide examples of processes whose stability behavior changes as the switching rate varies. We also explore what happens in the middle regime where the switching rates are neither high nor low and our theorems do not apply. Specifically, we show by examples that there can be arbitrarily many phase transitions between exponentially ergodicity and evanescence as the switching rate increases.",

In this work, we identify all degenerate two-dimensional zero-one reaction networks with up to three species by an efficient algorithm. By analyzing the structure of these networks, we arrive at the following conclusion: if a two-dimensional zero-one reaction network with three species is degenerate, then its steady-state system is equivalent to a binomial system.",

    "abstract": "Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) represent a critical challenge in pharmacology, often leading to adverse drug reactions with significant implications for patient safety and healthcare outcomes. While graph-based methods have achieved strong predictive performance, most approaches treat drug pairs independently, overlooking the complex, context-dependent interactions unique to drug pairs. Additionally, these models struggle to integrate biological interaction networks and molecular-level structures to provide meaningful mechanistic insights. In this study, we propose MolecBioNet, a novel graph-based framework that integrates molecular and biomedical knowledge for robust and interpretable DDI prediction. By modeling drug pairs as unified entities, MolecBioNet captures both macro-level biological interactions and micro-level molecular influences, offering a comprehensive perspective on DDIs. The framework extracts local subgraphs from biomedical knowledge graphs and constructs hierarchical interaction graphs from molecular representations, leveraging classical graph neural network methods to learn multi-scale representations of drug pairs. To enhance accuracy and interpretability, MolecBioNet introduces two domain-specific pooling strategies: context-aware subgraph pooling (CASPool), which emphasizes biologically relevant entities, and attention-guided influence pooling (AGIPool), which prioritizes influential molecular substructures. The framework further employs mutual information minimization regularization to enhance information diversity during embedding fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that MolecBioNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in DDI prediction, while ablation studies and embedding visualizations further validate the advantages of unified drug pair modeling and multi-scale knowledge integration.",

Here, we consider non-equilibrium models which are generically used to describe natural and synthetic biological processes, such as gene regulation and protein conformational dynamics, and investigate their capacity for effective control using imperfect local feedback mechanisms. We derive a thermodynamic constraint on the response of non-equilibrium steady-state properties to changes in the driving forces. We show that this constraint enables linear, local, and easily implementable feedback rules to achieve environmental tracking and adaptation without consideration of network topology. In particular, we demonstrate that local stability of these feedback dynamics implies global stability for systems with one or two chemical regulators, regardless of the network topology. For higher-dimensional systems, global stability is not guaranteed. However, in part due to simplifications in attractor landscapes implied by our thermodynamic constraint, we find the basin of attraction remains significantly larger than would be expected from linear approximation alone. Our findings provide insight into how biological and synthetically engineered systems can respond effectively to environmental changes given only minimal feedback, without highly engineered interactions or precise parameter tuning.",

Conventional approaches rely heavily on expert interpretation and lack scalability, while retrieval-based machine learning approaches remain constrained by limited reference libraries. Generative models offer a promising alternative, yet most adopt autoregressive architectures that overlook 3D geometry and struggle to integrate diverse spectral modalities. In this work, we present DiffSpectra, a generative framework that formulates molecular structure elucidation as a conditional generation process, directly inferring 2D and 3D molecular structures from multi-modal spectra using diffusion models. Its denoising network is parameterized by the Diffusion Molecule Transformer, an SE(3)-equivariant architecture for geometric modeling, conditioned by SpecFormer, a Transformer-based spectral encoder capturing multi-modal spectral dependencies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiffSpectra accurately elucidates molecular structures, achieving 40.76% top-1 and 99.49% top-10 accuracy. Its performance benefits substantially from 3D geometric modeling, SpecFormer pre-training, and multi-modal conditioning. To our knowledge, DiffSpectra is the first framework that unifies multi-modal spectral reasoning and joint 2D/3D generative modeling for de novo molecular structure elucidation.",

DeepRetro is a novel, open-source framework that tightly integrates large language models (LLMs), traditional retrosynthetic engines, and expert human feedback in an iterative design loop. Prior approaches rely solely on template-based methods or unconstrained LLM outputs. In contrast, DeepRetro combines the precision of template-based methods with the generative flexibility of LLMs, controlled by rigorous chemical validity checks and enhanced by recursive refinement. This hybrid system dynamically explores and revises synthetic pathways, guided by both algorithmic checks and expert chemist feedback through an interactive user interface. While DeepRetro achieves strong performance on standard retrosynthesis benchmarks, its true strength lies in its ability to propose novel, viable pathways to highly complex natural products-targets that have historically eluded automated planning. Through detailed case studies, we illustrate how this approach enables new routes for total synthesis and facilitates human-machine collaboration in organic chemistry. Beyond retrosynthesis, DeepRetro represents a working model for how to leverage LLMs in scientific discovery. We provide a transparent account of the system's design, algorithms, and human-feedback loop, enabling broad adaptation across scientific domains. By releasing DeepRetro as an open-source tool, we aim to empower chemists to tackle increasingly ambitious synthetic targets, accelerating progress in drug discovery, materials design, and beyond.",

    "title": "Intuitive dissection of the Gaussian information bottleneck method with an application to optimal prediction",
    "abstract": "Efficient signal representation is essential for the functioning of living and artificial systems operating under resource constraints. A widely recognized framework for deriving such representations is the information bottleneck method, which yields the optimal strategy for encoding a random variable, such as the signal, in a way that preserves maximal information about a functionally relevant variable, subject to an explicit constraint on the amount of information encoded. While in its general formulation the method is numerical, it admits an analytical solution in an important special case where the variables involved are jointly Gaussian. In this setting, the solution predicts discrete transitions in the dimensionality of the optimal representation as the encoding capacity is increased. Although these signature transitions, along with other features of the optimal strategy, can be derived from a constrained optimization problem, a clear and intuitive understanding of their emergence is still lacking. In our work, we advance our understanding of the Gaussian information bottleneck method through multiple mutually enriching perspectives, including geometric and information-theoretic ones. These perspectives offer novel intuition about the set of optimal encoding directions, the nature of the critical points where the optimal number of encoding components changes, and about the way the optimal strategy navigates between these critical points. We then apply our treatment of the method to a previously studied signal prediction problem, obtaining new insights on how different features of the signal are encoded across multiple components to enable optimal prediction of future signals. Altogether, our work deepens the foundational understanding of the information bottleneck method in the Gaussian setting, motivating the exploration of analogous perspectives in broader, non-Gaussian contexts.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning-based computational methods have achieved promising results in predicting protein-protein interactions (PPIs). However, existing benchmarks predominantly focus on isolated pairwise evaluations, overlooking a model's capability to reconstruct biologically meaningful PPI networks, which is crucial for biology research. To address this gap, we introduce PRING, the first comprehensive benchmark that evaluates protein-protein interaction prediction from a graph-level perspective. PRING curates a high-quality, multi-species PPI network dataset comprising 21,484 proteins and 186,818 interactions, with well-designed strategies to address both data redundancy and leakage. Building on this golden-standard dataset, we establish two complementary evaluation paradigms: (1) topology-oriented tasks, which assess intra and cross-species PPI network construction, and (2) function-oriented tasks, including protein complex pathway prediction, GO module analysis, and essential protein justification. These evaluations not only reflect the model's capability to understand the network topology but also facilitate protein function annotation, biological module detection, and even disease mechanism analysis. Extensive experiments on four representative model categories, consisting of sequence similarity-based, naive sequence-based, protein language model-based, and structure-based approaches, demonstrate that current PPI models have potential limitations in recovering both structural and functional properties of PPI networks, highlighting the gap in supporting real-world biological applications. We believe PRING provides a reliable platform to guide the development of more effective PPI prediction models for the community.

    "abstract": "The use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) models is becoming ubiquitous in many fields. Though progress continues to be made, general purpose large language AI models (LLM) show a tendency to deliver creative answers, often called \"hallucinations\", which have slowed their application in the medical and biomedical fields where accuracy is paramount. We propose that the design and use of much smaller, domain and even task-specific LM may be a more rational and appropriate use of this technology in biomedical research. In this work we apply a very small LM by today's standards to the specialized task of predicting regulatory interactions between molecular components to fill gaps in our current understanding of intracellular pathways. Toward this we attempt to correctly posit known pathway-informed interactions recovered from manually curated pathway databases by selecting and using only the most informative examples as part of an active learning scheme. With this example we show that a small (~110 million parameters) LM based on a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) architecture can propose molecular interactions relevant to tuberculosis persistence and transmission with over 80% accuracy using less than 25% of the ~520 regulatory relationships in question. Using information entropy as a metric for the iterative selection of new tuning examples, we also find that increased accuracy is driven by favoring the use of the incorrectly assigned statements with the highest certainty (lowest entropy). In contrast, the concurrent use of correct but least certain examples contributed little and may have even been detrimental to the learning rate.",

    "abstract": "Cells integrate signals and make decisions about their future state in short amounts of time. A lot of theoretical effort has gone into asking how to best design gene regulatory circuits that fulfill a given function, yet little is known about the constraints that performing that function in a small amount of time imposes on circuit architectures. Using an optimization framework, we explore the properties of a class of promoter architectures that distinguish small differences in transcription factor concentrations under time constraints. We show that the full temporal trajectory of gene activity allows for faster decisions than its integrated activity represented by the total number of transcribed mRNA. The topology of promoter architectures that allow for rapidly distinguishing low transcription factor concentrations result in a low, shallow, and non cooperative response, while at high concentrations, the response is high and cooperative. In the presence of non-cognate ligands, networks with fast and accurate decision times need not be optimally selective, especially if discrimination is difficult. While optimal networks are generically out of equilibrium, the energy associated with that irreversibility is only modest, and negligible at small concentrations. Instead, our results highlight the crucial role of rate-limiting steps imposed by biophysical constraints.",

    "abstract": "The discovery of new ionizable lipids for efficient lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-mediated RNA delivery remains a critical bottleneck for RNA-based therapeutics development. Recent advances have highlighted the potential of machine learning (ML) to predict transfection efficiency from molecular structure, enabling high-throughput virtual screening and accelerating lead identification. However, existing approaches are hindered by inadequate data quality, ineffective feature representations, low predictive accuracy, and poor generalizability. Here, we present LANTERN (Lipid nANoparticle Transfection Efficiency pRedictioN), a robust ML framework for predicting transfection efficiency based on ionizable lipid representation. We benchmarked a diverse set of ML models against AGILE, a previously published model developed for transfection prediction. Our results show that combining simpler models with chemically informative features, particularly count-based Morgan fingerprints, outperforms more complex models that rely on internally learned embeddings, such as AGILE. We also show that a multi-layer perceptron trained on a combination of Morgan fingerprints and Expert descriptors achieved the highest performance ($\\text{R}^2$ = 0.8161, r = 0.9053), significantly exceeding AGILE ($\\text{R}^2$ = 0.2655, r = 0.5488). We show that the models in LANTERN consistently have strong performance across multiple evaluation metrics. Thus, LANTERN offers a robust benchmarking framework for LNP transfection prediction and serves as a valuable tool for accelerating lipid-based RNA delivery systems design.",

We tested earthworms in lunar soil simulant mixed with organic waste (from \"Lunar Palace 365\" experiment) under three magnetic conditions: lunar-low, Earth, and high. Stronger fields increased earthworm oxidative stress (MDA) and impaired neurotransmitters. Weaker fields enhanced substrate cultivability: neutralized pH, increased nutrients, humus, and wheat seedling rate. Microbial analyses showed: (1) Higher fungal Shannon index under high fields indicated impaired digestion; (2) More positive correlations in gut networks suggested slower microbial cooperation (e.g., lignocellulose degradation); (3) Reduced Network Size, Path Length and Modularity confirmed disrupted interactions. This disproves lunar low-magnetic stress on earthworm-soil-waste systems, aiding deep-space BLSS research.",

To account for this property, gene expression may be modeled as a continuous-time Markov chain where biochemical species are described in a discrete way, leading to Gillespie's stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) which turns out to be computationally expensive for realistic mRNA and protein copy numbers. Alternatively, hybrid models based on piecewise-deterministic Markov processes (PDMPs) offer an effective compromise for capturing cell-to-cell variability, but their simulation remains limited to specialized mathematical communities. With a view to making them more accessible, we present here a simple simulation method that is reminiscent of SSA, while allowing for much lower computational cost. We detail the algorithm for a bursty PDMP describing an arbitrary number of interacting genes, and prove that it simulates exact trajectories of the model. As an illustration, we use the algorithm to simulate a two-gene toggle switch: this example highlights the fact that bimodal distributions as observed in real data are not explained by transcriptional bursting per se, but rather by distinct burst frequencies that may emerge from interactions between genes.",

We employed quantum-accelerated machine learning to analyze HIV prevalence at the ZIP-code level using AIDSVu and synthetic SDoH data for 2022. Our approach compared classical clustering (DBSCAN, HDBSCAN) with a quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA), developed a hybrid quantum-classical neural network for HIV prevalence forecasting, and used quantum Bayesian networks to explore causal links between SDoH factors and HIV incidence. The QAOA-based method achieved 92% accuracy in cluster detection within 1.6 seconds, outperforming classical algorithms. Meanwhile, the hybrid quantum-classical neural network predicted HIV prevalence with 94% accuracy, surpassing a purely classical counterpart. Quantum Bayesian analysis identified housing instability as a key driver of HIV cluster emergence and expansion, with stigma exerting a geographically variable influence. These quantum-enhanced methods deliver greater precision and efficiency in HIV surveillance while illuminating critical causal pathways.

    "abstract": "One of the puzzles left open by energetic analyses of irreversible stochastic processes is that boundary conditions that prevent the performance of work or the dissipation of heat make no contribution to an entropy-production budget; yet we see ubiquitously in both engineered and living systems that both transient and persistent energy costs are paid to create and maintain such boundaries. We wish to know whether there are inherent limits for the costs of such phenomena, and common units in which those can be traded off against more familiar costs measured in terms of heat dissipation. We give this problem a concrete framing in the context of CRNs, for the problem of extracting a topologically restricted pathway from a larger distributed network, through activation of some reactions and selective elimination of others. We define a thermodynamic cost function for pathways derived from large-deviation theory of stochastic CRNs, which decomposes into two components: an ongoing maintenance cost to sustain a NESS, and a restriction cost, quantifying the ongoing improbability of neutralizing reactions outside the specified pathway. Applying this formalism to detailed-balanced CRNs in the linear response regime, we make use of their formal equivalence to electrical circuits. We prove that the resistance of a CRN decreases as reactions are added that support the throughput current, and that the maintenance cost, the restriction cost, and the thermodynamic cost of nested pathways are bounded below by those of their hosting network. For small CRNs, we show how catalytic and inhibitory mechanisms can drastically alter pathway costs, enabling unfavorable pathways to become favorable and approach the cost of the hosting pathway. Our results provide insights into the thermodynamic principles governing open CRNs and offer a foundation for understanding the evolution of metabolic networks.",

    "abstract": "Populations of cells regulate gene expression in response to external signals, but their ability to make reliable collective decisions is limited by both intrinsic noise in molecular signaling and variability between individual cells. In this work, we use optogenetic control of the canonical Wnt pathway as an example to study how reliably information about an external signal is transmitted to a population of cells, and determine an optimal encoding strategy to maximize information transmission from Wnt signals to gene expression. We find that it is possible to reach an information capacity beyond 1 bit only through an appropriate, discrete encoding of signals. By averaging over an increasing number of outputs, we systematically vary the effective noise in the pathway. As the effective noise decreases, the optimal encoding comprises more discrete input signals. These signals do not need to be fine-tuned. The optimal code transitions into a continuous code in the small-noise limit, which can be shown to be consistent with the Jeffreys prior. We visualize the performance of signal encodings using decoding maps. Our results suggest optogenetic Wnt signaling allows for regulatory control beyond a simple binary switch, and provides a framework to apply ideas from information processing to single-cell in vitro experiments.",

    "title": "Unlasting: Unpaired Single-Cell Multi-Perturbation Estimation by Dual Conditional Diffusion Implicit Bridges",
    "abstract": "Estimating single-cell responses across various perturbations facilitates the identification of key genes and enhances drug screening, significantly boosting experimental efficiency. However, single-cell sequencing is a destructive process, making it impossible to capture the same cell's phenotype before and after perturbation. Consequently, data collected under perturbed and unperturbed conditions are inherently unpaired. Existing methods either attempt to forcibly pair unpaired data using random sampling, or neglect the inherent relationship between unperturbed and perturbed cells during the modeling. In this work, we propose a framework based on Dual Diffusion Implicit Bridges (DDIB) to learn the mapping between different data distributions, effectively addressing the challenge of unpaired data. We further interpret this framework as a form of data augmentation. We integrate gene regulatory network (GRN) information to propagate perturbation signals in a biologically meaningful way, and further incorporate a masking mechanism to predict silent genes, improving the quality of generated profiles. Moreover, gene expression under the same perturbation often varies significantly across cells, frequently exhibiting a bimodal distribution that reflects intrinsic heterogeneity. To capture this, we introduce a more suitable evaluation metric. We propose Unlasting, dual conditional diffusion models that overcome the problem of unpaired single-cell perturbation data and strengthen the model's insight into perturbations under the guidance of the GRN, with a dedicated mask model designed to improve generation quality by predicting silent genes. In addition, we introduce a biologically grounded evaluation metric that better reflects the inherent heterogeneity in single-cell responses.",

    "abstract": "The propagation of noise through parallel regulatory pathways is a characteristic feature of feed-forward loops in genetic networks. Although the contributions of the direct and indirect regulatory pathways of feed-forward loops to output variability have been well characterized, the impact of their joint action arising from their shared input and output remains poorly understood. Here, we identify an additional component of noise that emerges specifically from this convergent nature of the pathways. Using inter-gene correlations, we reveal the regulatory basis of the cross-interaction noise and interpret it as synergy or redundancy in noise propagation, depending on whether the combined pathways amplify or suppress fluctuations. Synergy typically arises in coherent feed-forward loops, whereas redundancy is common in incoherent ones. This framework not only accounts for previously observed differences in noise behavior across coherent and incoherent structures but also provides a generalizable strategy to connect network structure with stochastic gene regulation. Furthermore, by relating these synergy and redundancy to dynamical properties such as sign-sensitive delay or response acceleration, the framework offers a statistical lens to interpret the functional roles in cellular decision-making.",

While the Central Dogma is necessary for genetic information flow, it is not sufficient to fully explain cellular memory and information management. The CDC incorporates additional well-established steps, including protein folding and protein networking, highlighting the cyclical nature of information flow in cells. This cyclic architecture is proposed as a key mechanism for cellular memory, drawing analogies to memory functions in computers, such as input, read, write, execute, and erase. The interconnected cycles within the CDCN, including metabolic cycles and signaling pathways, are suggested to function akin to latches in computer memory, contributing to the storage and processing of cellular information beyond nucleic acid sequences. Understanding cellular memory through this cyclic network model offers a new perspective on heredity, cell processes, and the potential disruptions in disease pathology.",

By constructing attractor matrices based on single-node perturbations, we propose a framework to quantify attractor stability and identify dominant attractors. We find that attractors are more stable than predicted by basin sizes, showing the importance of dynamical structure in noisy environments. In addition, under global perturbations, basin sizes dictate long-term behavior; under local noise, however, attractor dominance is determined by noise-induced transition patterns rather than basin sizes. Our results show that transition dynamics induced by stochastic perturbations provide an efficient and quantitative description for the attractor stability and dynamics in Boolean networks under noise.",

We show that these networks can be trained in vitro through directed evolution, enabling the implementation of complex learning tasks such as multiclass classification without digital hardware or explicit parameter tuning. Each molecular species functions analogously to a neuron, with binding affinities acting as tunable synaptic weights. A training protocol involving mutation, selection, and amplification of DNA-based components allows CDNs to robustly discriminate among noisy input patterns. The resulting classifiers exhibit strong output contrast and high mutual information between input and output, especially when guided by a contrast-enhancing loss function. Comparative analysis with in silico gradient descent training reveals closely correlated performance. These results establish CDNs as a promising platform for analog physical computation, bridging synthetic biology and machine learning, and advancing the development of adaptive, energy-efficient molecular computing systems.",

Group theory has been applied to study symmetries in unweighted networks. However, in real-world weighted networks, edge weights are rarely equal, making exact symmetry uncommon. To study symmetries in weighted networks, we aggregate edge weights into a small number of discrete categories. The symmetries of these aggregated networks identify vertices with similar roles in the original weighted network.   In food webs, this approach helps to quantify ecological co-existence and competition by assessing the functional substitutability of species. We apply our method to 250 empirical food webs, finding that symmetric vertices emerge even under weak approximations, typically forming small orbits of size two or three. These symmetric vertices can appear at any trophic level or network position. We also apply three symmetry measures to compare structural patterns at the network level.",

Ci Bai Capsule (CB) has been reported to enhance white blood cell levels; however, its mechanisms and bioactive compounds remain unclear.Aim: This study aimed to identify the bioactive compounds group of CB and elucidate its potential mechanisms in radiation-induced leukopenia.Methods: Syndrome-related data were gathered from SYMMAP and CTD database. CB's target profile is predicted by DrugCIPHER. Network pharmacology approaches were employed to identify active compounds and related pathways. Experimental validation was conducted through flow cytometry and RNA-sequencing in both ex vivo and in vivo models.Results: A total of 22 pathways related to cellular processes, immune responses, and signal transduction were identified. Five key bioactive compounds (kaempferol-3-glucorhamnoside, syringin, schisandrin, 3-hydroxytyrosol 3-O-glucoside and salidroside) were found to significantly modulate syndrome-related pathways. Optimal dosing of this compound combination enhanced leukocyte counts and splenic immune cell proliferation in irradiated mice. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that the compounds exert regulatory effects on PP1A, RB, CDK4/6, CDK2, and CDK1, thereby modulating downstream immune and hematopoietic markers such as MNDA, BST2, and HSPA1A.Conclusion: Our findings suggest that CB mitigates radiation-induced leukopenia by enhancing immune and hematopoietic recovery, offering a promising therapeutic approach for managing radiation-related hematological disorders.",

    "abstract": "The complex regulatory dynamics of a biological network can be succinctly captured using discrete logic models. Given even sparse time-course data from the system of interest, previous work has shown that global optimization schemes are suitable for proposing logic models that explain the data and make predictions about how the system will behave under varying conditions. Considering the large scale of the parameter search spaces associated with these regulatory systems, performance optimizations on the level of both hardware and software are necessary for making this a practical tool for in silico pharmaceutical research. We show here how the implementation of these global optimization algorithms in a GPU-computing environment can accelerate the solution of these parameter search problems considerably. We carry out parameter searches on two model biological regulatory systems that represent almost an order of magnitude scale-up in complexity, and we find the gains in efficiency from GPU to be a 33%-43% improvement compared to multi-thread CPU implementations and a 33%-1866% increase compared to CPU in serial. These improvements make global optimization of logic model identification a far more attractive and feasible method for in silico hypothesis generation and design of experiments.",

    "title": "On Quantum Random Walks in Biomolecular Networks",
    "abstract": "Biomolecular networks, such as protein-protein interactions, gene-gene associations, and cell-cell interactions, offer valuable insights into the complex organization of biological systems. These networks are key to understanding cellular functions, disease mechanisms, and identifying therapeutic targets. However, their analysis is challenged by the high dimensionality, heterogeneity, and sparsity of multi-omics data. Random walk algorithms are widely used to propagate information through disease modules, helping to identify disease-associated genes and uncover relevant biological pathways. In this work, we investigate the limitations of classical random walks and explore the potential of quantum random walks (QRWs) for biomolecular network analysis. We evaluate QRWs in two network-based applications. First, in a gene-gene interaction network associated with asthma, autism, and schizophrenia, QRWs more accurately rank disease-associated genes compared to classical methods. Second, in a structured multi-partite cell-cell interaction network derived from mouse brown adipose tissue, QRWs identify key driver genes in malignant cells that are overlooked by classical random walks. Our findings suggest that quantum random walks offer a promising alternative to classical approaches, with improved sensitivity to network structure and better performance in identifying biologically relevant features. This highlights their potential in advancing network medicine and systems biology.",

We find the population is structured in two metabolically distinct clusters: cells optimizing carbon yield while excessively turning over nitrogen, and cells which act reciprocally, optimizing nitrogen yield and excessively turning over carbon. This partition enables partial heterotrophy within the population via metabolic exchange, likely in the form of organic acids. Exchange increases the feasible metabolic space, and mixotrophic cells achieve the fastest growth rates. Metabolic flux analysis at the single-cell level reveals heterogeneity in carbon fixation rates, Rubisco specificity, and nitrogen assimilation. Our results provide a necessary foundation for understanding how population level phenotypes arise from the collective contributions of distinct individuals.",

    "abstract": "Protein sequestration motifs appear in many biological regulatory networks and introduce special properties into the network dynamics. Sequestration can be described as a mode of inactivation of a given protein by its binding to a second protein to form a new complex. In this complexed form, the original protein is prevented from performing its specific functions and is thus rendered inactive. We study a mathematical model of the mammalian circadian clock with a protein sequestration motif, which generates one of the negative feedback loops that guarantees periodic behavior. First, the motif permits a time-scale separation, which can be used to simplify the model. We show that the simplified model admits a periodic orbit over a fairly large region of parameters. Second, we are able to show that the sequestration motif induces a phase response curve with a very specific form, implying that external perturbations can affect the system only in a narrow window of the periodic orbit. Finally, we compare our model with a classic Goodwin oscillator, to illustrate the dynamical and robustness properties induced by the protein sequestration motif.",

Our main contributions are as follows: (a) we show how the concept of a siphon, prevalent in Petri nets and chemical reaction network theory, identifies sets of species that may become depleted at steady state, analogous to a disease-free boundary steady state; (b) we develop an approach for incorporating biochemically motivated conservation laws, which allows the stability of boundary steady states to be determined within specific compatibility classes; and (c) we present an effective heuristic for decomposing the Jacobian of the system that reduces the computational complexity required to compute the stability domain of a boundary steady state. The boundary reproduction number approach significantly simplifies existing parameter-dependent methods for determining the stability of boundary steady states in chemical reaction systems and has implications for the capacity of critical metabolites and substrates in metabolic pathways to become exhausted.",

    "abstract": "Molecular computation based on chemical reaction networks (CRNs) has emerged as a promising paradigm for designing programmable biochemical systems. However, the implementation of complex computations still requires excessively large and intricate network structures, largely due to the limited understanding of composability, that is, how multiple subsystems can be coupled while preserving computational functionality. Existing composability frameworks primarily focus on rate-independent CRNs, whose computational capabilities are severely restricted. This article aims to establish a systematic framework for composable CRNs governed by mass-action kinetics, a common type of rate-dependent CRNs. Drawing upon the concepts of composable rate-independent CRNs, we introduce the notions of mass-action chemical reaction computers (msCRCs), dynamic computation and dynamic composability to establish a rigorous mathematical framework for composing two or more msCRCs to achieve layer-by-layer computation of composite functions. Further, we derive several sufficient conditions based on the notions of input-to-state stability (ISS) to characterize msCRCs that can be composed to implement desired molecular computations, thereby providing theoretical support for this framework. Some examples are presented to illustrate the efficiency of our method. Finally, comparative results demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits notable advantages in both computational ability and accuracy over the state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "Cell sensory transcription networks are the intracellular computation structure that regulates and drives cellular activity. Activity in these networks determines the the cell's ability to adapt to changes in its environment. Resilient cells successfully identify (classify) and appropriately respond to environmental shifts. We present a model for identification and response to environmental changes in resilient bacteria. This model combines two known motifs in transcription networks: dense overlapping regulons (DORs) and single input modules (SIMs). DORs have the ability to perform cellular decision making and have a network structure similar to that of a shallow neural network, with a number of input transcription factors (TFs) mapping to a distinct set of genes. SIMs contain a master TF that simultaneously activates a number of target genes. Within most observed cell sensory transcription networks, the master transcription factor of SIMs are output genes of a DOR creating a fan-in-fan-out (bowtie) structure in the transcriptional network. We model this hybrid network motif (which we call the DOR2SIM motif) with a superposition of modular nonlinear functions to describe protein signaling in the network and basic mass action kinetics to describe the other chemical reactions in this process. We analyze this model's biological feasibility and capacity to perform classification, the first step in adaptation. We provide sufficient conditions for models of the DOR2SIM motif to classify constant (environmental) inputs. These conditions suggest that generally low monomer degradation rates as well as low expression of source node genes at equilibrium in the DOR component enable classification.",

    "abstract": "Trajectory mutual information is frequently used to quantify information transfer in biochemical systems. Tractable solutions of the trajectory mutual information can be obtained via the widely used Linear-Noise Approximation (LNA) using Gaussian channel theory. This approach is expected to be accurate for sufficiently large systems. However, recent observations show that there are cases, where the mutual information obtained this way differs qualitatively from results derived using an exact Markov jump process formalism, and that the differences persist even for large systems. In this letter, we show that these differences can be explained by introducing the notion of reaction- versus state-based descriptions of trajectories. In chemical systems, the information is encoded in the sequence of reaction events, and the reaction-based trajectories of Markov jump processes capture this information. In contrast, the commonly used form of the LNA uses a state (concentration) based description of trajectories, which contains, in general, less information than a reaction-based description. Here, we show that an alternative formulation of the LNA that retains the reaction-specific information of trajectories can accurately describe the trajectory mutual information for large systems. We illustrate the consequences of different trajectory descriptions for two common cellular reaction motifs and discuss the connection with Berg-Purcell and Maximum-Likelihood sensing.",

    "abstract": "Accurate molecular property prediction (MPP) is a critical step in modern drug development. However, the scarcity of experimental validation data poses a significant challenge to AI-driven research paradigms. Under few-shot learning scenarios, the quality of molecular representations directly dictates the theoretical upper limit of model performance. We present AdaptMol, a prototypical network integrating Adaptive multimodal fusion for Molecular representation. This framework employs a dual-level attention mechanism to dynamically integrate global and local molecular features derived from two modalities: SMILES sequences and molecular graphs. (1) At the local level, structural features such as atomic interactions and substructures are extracted from molecular graphs, emphasizing fine-grained topological information; (2) At the global level, the SMILES sequence provides a holistic representation of the molecule. To validate the necessity of multimodal adaptive fusion, we propose an interpretable approach based on identifying molecular active substructures to demonstrate that multimodal adaptive fusion can efficiently represent molecules. Extensive experiments on three commonly used benchmarks under 5-shot and 10-shot settings demonstrate that AdaptMol achieves state-of-the-art performance in most cases. The rationale-extracted method guides the fusion of two modalities and highlights the importance of both modalities.",

Changes in the cell response to PGE2 can have important effects on immunity and development of diseases, however, a thorough understanding of the EP2-EP4 receptors' signaling pathways is lacking. Experimental data show that receptor activity (indicated by cAMP expression) has a different kinetics depending on which receptor is triggered by PGE2 and that crosstalk exists between EP2 and EP4. To better understand the underlying mechanisms and be able to predict cell responses to PGE2, we develop novel mathematical models for the cAMP signaling pathways of EP2 and EP4 and their crosstalk. Ligand binding dynamics plays a crucial role for both, the single receptor activity and their crosstalk. The mathematical models can predict the qualitative cAMP levels observed experimentally and provide possible explanations for the differences and commonalities in the signaling behavior of EP2 and EP4. As inhibition of PGE2 signaling is gaining increasing attention in tumor immunology, these mathematical models could contribute to design effective anti-tumor therapies targeting EP2 and EP4.",

    "abstract": "Embryonic development relies on the formation of sharp, precise gene expression boundaries. In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, boundary formation has been proposed to occur at a dynamical critical point. Yet, in the paradigmatic case of the hunchback (hb) gene, evidence suggests that boundary formation occurs in a bistable regime, not at the dynamical critical point. We develop a minimal model for hb expression and identify a single parameter that tunes the system from its monostable regime to its bistable regime, crossing the critical point in between. We find that boundary precision is maximized when the system is weakly bistable--near, but not at, the critical point--optimally negotiating the tradeoff between two key effects of bistability: sharpening the boundary and amplifying its noise. Incorporating the diffusion of Hb proteins into our model, we show that boundary precision is maximized simultaneously at an optimal degree of bistability and an optimal diffusion strength. Our work elucidates design principles of precise boundary formation and has general implications for pattern formation in multicellular systems.",

    "abstract": "Network science has become an essential interdisciplinary tool for understanding complex biological systems. However, because these systems undergo continuous, often stimulus-driven changes in both structure and function, traditional static network approaches frequently fall short in capturing their dynamic nature. Dynamic network analysis (DNA) addresses this limitation and offers a powerful framework to investigate these evolving relationships. This work focuses on temporal networks, a central paradigm within DNA, as an effective approach for modelling time-resolved changes in biological systems. While DNA has gained traction in domains like social and communication sciences, its integration in biology has been more gradual, hindered by data limitations and the need for domain-specific adaptations. Aimed at supporting researchers, particularly those new to the field, the review offers an integrative overview of the diverse and multidisciplinary landscape of DNA, with a focus on temporal networks in systems biology. I begin by clarifying foundational terminology and concepts, then present a multi-scale perspective spanning microscale (nodes and edges), mesoscale (motifs and communities), and macroscale (global topology) analyses. Finally, I explore analytical strategies and computational tools suited to various research objectives, including methods for detecting structural shifts, assessing network similarity, tracking module evolution, and predictive modelling of future network states.",

    "abstract": "Gene regulatory network (GRN) inference serves as a cornerstone for deciphering cellular decision-making processes. Early approaches rely exclusively on gene expression data, thus their predictive power remain fundamentally constrained by the vast combinatorial space of potential gene-gene interactions. Subsequent methods integrate prior knowledge to mitigate this challenge by restricting the solution space to biologically plausible interactions. However, we argue that the effectiveness of these approaches is contingent upon the precision of prior information and the reduction in the search space will circumscribe the models' potential for novel biological discoveries. To address these limitations, we introduce KINDLE, a three-stage framework that decouples GRN inference from prior knowledge dependencies. KINDLE trains a teacher model that integrates prior knowledge with temporal gene expression dynamics and subsequently distills this encoded knowledge to a student model, enabling accurate GRN inference solely from expression data without access to any prior. KINDLE achieves state-of-the-art performance across four benchmark datasets. Notably, it successfully identifies key transcription factors governing mouse embryonic development and precisely characterizes their functional roles. In mouse hematopoietic stem cell data, KINDLE accurately predicts fate transition outcomes following knockout of two critical regulators (Gata1 and Spi1). These biological validations demonstrate our framework's dual capability in maintaining topological inference precision while preserving discovery potential for novel biological mechanisms.",

This is central to exponentially improving generalized artificial intelligence models, which can improve their own architecture to handle new problem domains in an efficient manner that leverages the latest hardware. However, current automated compilation methods are poor, and efficient algorithms require years of human development. In this paper, we use neural circuit diagrams, based in category theory, to prove a general theorem related to deep learning algorithms, guide the development of a novel attention algorithm catered to the domain of gene regulatory networks, and produce a corresponding efficient kernel. The algorithm we propose, spherical attention, shows that neural circuit diagrams enable a principled and systematic method for reasoning about deep learning architectures and providing high-performance code. By replacing SoftMax with an $L^2$ norm as suggested by diagrams, it overcomes the special function unit bottleneck of standard attention while retaining the streaming property essential to high-performance. Our diagrammatically derived \\textit{FlashSign} kernel achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art, fine-tuned FlashAttention algorithm on an A100, and $3.6\\times$ the performance of PyTorch. Overall, this investigation shows neural circuit diagrams' suitability as a high-level framework for the automated development of efficient, novel artificial intelligence architectures.",

The spatial distribution of molecules plays a critical role and requires the inclusion of spatial coordinates in their analysis. Stochastic models such as the chemical master equation are commonly used to study these systems. However, analytical solutions are limited to specific cases, and stochastic simulations require significant computational resources. To mitigate these challenges, approximation methods, such as the moment approach, reduce the system to a set of ordinary differential equations, thereby lowering the computational requirements. This study investigates the conditions under which the second-moment approach yields exact results during the dynamic evolution of chemical reaction-diffusion networks. The analysis encompasses second-order or higher-order reactions and Hill functions without relying on higher-order moment estimations or closure approximations. Starting with stationary states, we extended the analysis to a dynamic evolution. An enzymatic process and an antithetic feedback system were examined for purely reactive systems, demonstrating the approach's accuracy in capturing system behavior and quantifying errors. The study was further extended to genetic regulatory networks governed by Hill functions, including both purely reactive and reaction-diffusion systems, validating the method in spatially distributed contexts. This framework enables precise characterization of biochemical systems, avoiding information loss typically associated with approximations and allowing for stability analysis under fluctuations. These findings optimize computational strategies while providing insights into intracellular signaling and regulatory processes, paving the way for efficient and accurate stochastic modeling in biochemical systems.",

We investigate the diffusion approximation of reaction networks with mass-action kinetics, focusing on the identifiability of the generator of the associated stochastic differential equations. We derive conditions under which the law of the diffusion approximation is identifiable and provide theorems for verifying identifiability in practice. Notably, our results show that some reaction networks have non-identifiable reaction rates, even when the law of the corresponding stochastic process is completely known. Moreover, we show that reaction networks with distinct graphical structures can generate the same diffusion law under specific choices of reaction rates. Finally, we compare our framework with identifiability results in the deterministic ODE setting and the discrete continuous-time Markov chain models for reaction networks.",

    "title": "The Dynamics of Inducible Genetic Circuits",
    "abstract": "Genes are connected in complex networks of interactions where often the product of one gene is a transcription factor that alters the expression of another. Many of these networks are based on a few fundamental motifs leading to switches and oscillators of various kinds. And yet, there is more to the story than which transcription factors control these various circuits. These transcription factors are often themselves under the control of effector molecules that bind them and alter their level of activity. Traditionally, much beautiful work has shown how to think about the stability of the different states achieved by these fundamental regulatory architectures by examining how parameters such as transcription rates, degradation rates and dissociation constants tune the circuit, giving rise to behavior such as bistability. However, such studies explore dynamics without asking how these quantities are altered in real time in living cells as opposed to at the fingertips of the synthetic biologist's pipette or on the computational biologist's computer screen. In this paper, we make a departure from the conventional dynamical systems view of these regulatory motifs by using statistical mechanical models to focus on endogenous signaling knobs such as effector concentrations rather than on the convenient but more experimentally remote knobs such as dissociation constants, transcription rates and degradation rates that are often considered. We also contrast the traditional use of Hill functions to describe transcription factor binding with more detailed thermodynamic models. This approach provides insights into how biological parameters are tuned to control the stability of regulatory motifs in living cells, sometimes revealing quite a different picture than is found by using Hill functions and tuning circuit parameters by hand.",

    "abstract": "Feedback in cellular processes is typically inferred through cellular responses to experimental perturbations. Modular response analysis provides a theoretical framework for translating specific perturbations into feedback sensitivities between cellular modules. However, in large-scale drug perturbation studies the effect of any given drug may not be known and may not only affect one module at a time. Here, we analyze the response of gene expression models to random perturbations that affect multiple modules simultaneously. In the deterministic regime we analytically show how cellular responses to infinitesimal random perturbations can be used to infer the nature of feedback regulation in gene expression, as long as the effects of perturbations are statistically independent between modules. We numerically extend this deterministic analysis to the response of average abundances of stochastic gene expression models to finite perturbations. Across a large sample of stochastic models, the response of average abundances generally obeyed predicted bounds from the deterministic analysis, but dramatic deviations occurred in systems with bimodal or fat-tailed stationary state distributions. These discrepancies demonstrate how deterministic analyses can fail to capture the effect of perturbations on averages of stochastic cellular feedback systems--even in the linear response regime.",

In this puzzle, a contestant chooses one of three doors (only one hides a prize), the host, knowing the content, opens another door revealing no prize, and finally the contestant must decide whether to stay with the original choice or switch to the remaining closed door. Assigning distinct molecular species to the player, initial choice, reveal step, and final decision, we encode the problem in mass-action kinetics. For pseudo-first-order conditions, tuning a single rate constant shifts the network continuously between \"always-stay\" (1/3 success) and \"always-switch\" (2/3 success) regimes. We derive closed-form, time-dependent expressions for the success kinetics, concluding with a brief discussion of proposed DNA strand-displacement implementations and kinetically hard-wired molecular decision-making.",

In the literature, three main classes of gene network models can be distinguished: (i) non-quantitative (or data-based) models which do not describe the probability distribution of gene expressions; (ii) quantitative models which fully describe the probability distribution of all genes coexpression; and (iii) mechanistic models which allow for a causal interpretation of gene interactions. We propose two rigorous frameworks to model gene alteration in a dynamical GRN, depending on whether the network model is quantitative or mechanistic. We explain how these models can be used for design of experiment, or, if additional alteration data are available, for validation purposes or to improve the parameter estimation of the original model. We apply these methods to the Gaussian graphical model, which is quantitative but non-mechanistic, and to mechanistic models of Bayesian networks and penalized linear regression.",

    "abstract": "Quantitative Systems Pharmacology (QSP) promises to accelerate drug development, enable personalized medicine, and improve the predictability of clinical outcomes. Realizing this potential requires effectively managing the complexity of mathematical models representing biological systems. Here, we present and validate a novel QSP workflow--CRISP (Contextualized Reduction for Identifiability and Scientific Precision)--that addresses a central challenge in QSP: the problem of complexity and over-parameterization, in which models contain irrelevant parameters that obscure interpretation and hinder predictive reliability. The CRISP workflow begins with a literature-derived model, constructed to be comprehensive and unbiased by integrating prior mechanistic insights. At the core of the workflow is the Manifold Boundary Approximation Method (MBAM), a reduction technique that simplifies models while preserving mechanistic structure and predictive fidelity. By applying MBAM in a context-specific manner, CRISP links parsimonious models directly to predictions of interest, clarifying causal structure and enhancing interpretability. The resulting models are computationally efficient and well-suited to key QSP tasks, including virtual population generation, experimental design, toxicology, and target discovery. We demonstrate the utility of CRISP on case studies involving the coagulation cascade and SHIV infection, and identify promising directions for improving the efficacy of bNAb therapies for HIV. Together, these results establish CRISP as a general-purpose QSP workflow for turning complex mechanistic models into tools for precise scientific reasoning to guide pharmacological and regulatory decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Cellular reprogramming, the artificial transformation of one cell type into another, has been attracting increasing research attention due to its therapeutic potential for complex diseases. However, identifying effective reprogramming strategies through classical wet-lab experiments is hindered by lengthy time commitments and high costs.   In this study, we explore the use of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to control Boolean network models of complex biological systems, such as gene regulatory and signalling pathway networks. We formulate a novel control problem for Boolean network models under the asynchronous update mode, specifically in the context of cellular reprogramming. To solve it, we devise GATTACA, a scalable computational framework.   To facilitate scalability of our framework, we consider previously introduced concept of a pseudo-attractor and improve the procedure for effective identification of pseudo-attractor states. We then incorporate graph neural networks with graph convolution operations into the artificial neural network approximator of the DRL agent's action-value function. This allows us to leverage the available knowledge on the structure of a biological system and to indirectly, yet effectively, encode the system's modelled dynamics into a latent representation.   Experiments on several large-scale, real-world biological networks from the literature demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of our approach.",

    "abstract": "We extend the traditional framework of steady state energy transduction -- typically characterized by a single input and output -- to multi-resource transduction in open chemical reaction networks (CRNs). Transduction occurs when stoichiometrically balanced processes are driven against their spontaneous directions by coupling them with thermodynamically favorable ones. However, when multiple processes (resources) interact through a shared CRN, identifying the relevant set of processes for analyzing transduction becomes a critical and complex challenge. To address this, we introduce a systematic procedure based on elementary processes, which cannot be further decomposed into subprocesses. Our theory generalizes the methodology used to define transduction efficiency in thermal engines operating between multiple heat baths. By selecting a reference equilibrium environment, it explicitly reveals the inherently relative nature of transduction efficiency and ties its definition to exergy. This framework also allows one to exclude unusable outputs from efficiency calculations. We further extend the concept of chemical gears to multi-process transduction, demonstrating their versatility as an analytical tool in complex settings. Finally, we apply our framework to central metabolic pathways, uncovering deep insights into their operation and highlighting the crucial difference between thermodynamic efficiencies and stoichiometric yields.",

    "abstract": "Molecular chirality is critical to biochemical function, but it is unknown when chiral selectivity first became important in the evolutionary transition from geochemistry to biochemistry during the emergence of life. Here, we identify key transitions in the selection of chiral molecules in metabolic evolution, showing how achiral molecules (lacking chiral centers) may have given rise to specific and abundant chiral molecules in the elaboration of metabolic networks from geochemically available precursor molecules. Simulated expansions of biosphere-scale metabolism suggest new hypotheses about the evolution of chiral molecules within biochemistry, including a prominent role for both achiral and chiral compounds as nucleation sites of early metabolic network growth, an increasing enrichment of molecules with more chiral centers as these networks expand, and conservation of broken chiral symmetries along reaction pathways as a general organizing principle. We also find an unexpected enrichment in large, non-polymeric achiral molecules. Leveraging metabolic data of 40,023 genomes and metagenomes, we analyzed the statistics of chiral and achiral molecules in the large-scale organization of metabolism, revealing a chiral-enriched phase of network organization evidenced by system-size dependent chiral scaling laws that differ for individuals and ecosystems. By uncovering how metabolic networks could lead to chiral selection, our findings open new avenues for bridging metabolism and genetics-first approaches to the origin of chirality, allowing tools for better timing of major transitions in molecular organization during the emergence of life, understanding the role of chirality in extant and synthetic metabolisms, and informing targets for chirality-based biosignatures.",

    "abstract": "There is an abundance of highly stochastic, non-linear phenomena present in population dynamics across various fields, including molecular biology, epidemiology, and ecology. Oscillations and multi-stability are particularly prevalent in gene regulation systems. None of the currently available stochastic models for population dynamics are accurate and computationally efficient for long-term predictions. A prominent model in this field, known as the Linear Noise Approximation (LNA), is computationally efficient for tasks such as simulation, sensitivity analysis, and parameter estimation, still, it is only accurate for linear systems and short-time predictions. Other models may achieve greater accuracy across a broader range of systems, but they sacrifice computational efficiency and analytical tractability. This paper demonstrates that, with specific modifications, the LNA can indeed accurately capture non-linear dynamics in population dynamics. We introduce a new framework that employs centre manifold theory, a classical concept in non-linear dynamical systems. This approach allows us to identify simple, specialised modifications to the LNA tailored to classes of qualitatively similar non-linear dynamical systems. With these modifications, the LNA can achieve accurate long-term predictions without compromising its computational efficiency. We apply our methodology to a class of oscillatory systems and a class of bi-stable systems, and we provide multiple examples in molecular population dynamics that showcase accurate long-term predictions, and significant improvements in computational efficiency.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of chemical reaction networks is often analyzed through kinetic models and energy landscapes, but these approaches fail to capture the deeper structural constraints governing complexity growth. In chemical reaction networks, emergent constraints dictate the organization of reaction pathways, limiting combinatorial expansion and determining stability conditions. This paper introduces a novel approach to modeling chemical reaction networks by incorporating differential geometry into the classical framework of reaction kinetics. By utilizing the Riemannian metric, Christoffel symbols, and a system-specific entropy-like term, we provide a new method for understanding the evolution of complex reaction systems. The approach captures the interdependence between species, the curvature of the reaction network's configuration space, and the tendency of the system to evolve toward more probable states. The interaction topology constrains the accessible reaction trajectories and the introduced differential geometrical approach allows analysis of curvature constraints which help us to understand pathway saturation and transition dynamics. Rather than treating reaction space as an unconstrained combinatorial landscape, we frame it as a structured manifold with higher order curvature describing a geodesic for system evolution under intrinsic constraints. This geometrical perspective offers a unique insight into pathway saturation, self-interruption, and emergent behavior in reaction networks, and provides a scalable framework for modeling large biochemical or catalytic systems.",

Nevertheless primordial life somehow emerged despite that presumed handicap. A~resolution of this problem is important in emergence-of-life science because it would provide valuable guidance in choosing subsequent paths of investigation, such as identifying pre-biotic patterns on Mars. To study the problem we set up a simple non-equilibrium flow dynamical model for the coupled temperature and mass dynamics of the decomposition of a polymeric carbohydrate adsorbed on a mineral surface, with incident stochastic thermal fluctuations. Results show that the model system behaves as a reciprocating thermochemical oscillator. The output fluctuation distribution is bimodal, with a right-weighted component that guarantees a bias towards detachment and desorption of monomeric species such as ribose, even while tar is formed concomitantly. This fluctuating thermochemical reciprocator may ensure that non-performing polymers can be fractionated into a refractory carbon reservoir and active monomers which may be reincorporated into better-performing polymers with less vulnerability towards adsorptive tarring.",

    "abstract": "The ribosome flow model (RFM) is a phenomenological model for the unidirectional flow of particles along a 1D chain of $n$ sites. The RFM has been extensively used to study the dynamics of ribosome flow along a single mRNA molecule during translation. In this case, the particles model ribosomes and each site corresponds to a consecutive group of codons. Networks of interconnected RFMs have been used to model and analyze large-scale translation in the cell and, in particular, the effects of competition for shared resources. Here, we analyze the RFM with a negative feedback connection from the protein production rate to the initiation rate. This models, for example, the production of proteins that inhibit the translation of their own mRNA. Using tools from the theory of 2-cooperative dynamical systems, we provide a simple condition guaranteeing that the closed-loop system admits at least one non-trivial periodic solution. When this condition holds, we also explicitly characterize a large set of initial conditions such that any solution emanating from this set converges to a non-trivial periodic solution. Such a solution corresponds to a periodic pattern of ribosome densities along the mRNA, and to a periodic pattern of protein production.",

    "abstract": "Substrate modification networks are ubiquitous in living, biochemical systems. A higher-level hypergraph \"skeleton\" captures key information about which substrates are transformed in the presence of modification-specific enzymes. Many different detailed models can be associated to the same skeleton, however uncertainty related to model fitting increases with the level of detail. We show that essential dynamical properties such as existence of positive steady states and concentration robustness can be extracted directly from the skeleton independent of the detailed model. The novel formalism of directed hypergraphs is used to prove that bifunctional enzyme action plays a key role in generating robustness. Moreover, we use another novel concept of \"current\" on a directed hypergraph to establish a link between potentially remote network components. Current is an essential notion required for existence of positive steady states, and furthermore, current-matching combined with bifunctionality generates concentration robustness.",

    "title": "Identifying Protein Co-regulatory Network Logic by Solving B-SAT Problems through Gate-based Quantum Computing",
    "abstract": "There is growing awareness that the success of pharmacologic interventions on living organisms is significantly impacted by context and timing of exposure. In turn, this complexity has led to an increased focus on regulatory network dynamics in biology and our ability to represent them in a high-fidelity way, in silico. Logic network models show great promise here and their parameter estimation can be formulated as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) that is well-suited to the often sparse, incomplete data in biology. Unfortunately, even in the case of Boolean logic, the combinatorial complexity of these problems grows rapidly, challenging the creation of models at physiologically-relevant scales. That said, quantum computing, while still nascent, facilitates novel information-processing paradigms with the potential for transformative impact in problems such as this one. In this work, we take a first step at actualizing this potential by identifying the structure and Boolean decisional logic of a well-studied network linking 5 proteins involved in the neural development of the mammalian cortical area of the brain. We identify the protein-protein connectivity and binary decisional logic governing this network by formulating it as a Boolean Satisfiability (B-SAT) problem. We employ Grover's algorithm to solve the NP-hard problem faster than the exponential time complexity required by deterministic classical algorithms. Using approaches deployed on both quantum simulators and actual noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) hardware, we accurately recover several high-likelihood models from very sparse protein expression data. The results highlight the differential roles of data types in supporting accurate models; the impact of quantum algorithm design as it pertains to the mutability of quantum hardware; and the opportunities for accelerated discovery enabled by this approach.",

    "abstract": "The in vitro transcription reaction (IVT) is of growing importance for the manufacture of RNA vaccines and therapeutics. While the kinetics of the microscopic steps of this reaction (promoter binding, initiation, and elongation) are well studied, the rate law of overall RNA synthesis that emerges from this system is unclear. In this work, we show that a model that incorporates both initiation and elongation steps is essential for describing trends in IVT kinetics in conditions relevant to RNA manufacturing. In contrast to previous reports, we find that the IVT reaction can be either initiation- or elongation-limited depending on solution conditions. This initiation-elongation model is also essential for describing the effect of salts, which disrupt polymerase-promoter binding, on transcription rates. Polymerase-polymerase interactions during elongation are incorporated into our modeling framework and found to have nonzero but unidentifiable effects on macroscopic transcription rates. Finally, we develop an extension of our modeling approach to quantitatively describe and experimentally evaluate RNA- and DNA-templated mechanisms for the formation of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) impurities. We show experimental results that indicate that an RNA-templated mechanism is not appropriate for describing macroscopic dsRNA formation in the context of RNA manufacturing.",

In this paper, we provide a comprehensive description of biochemical networks by considering individual atoms and chemical bonds. To address combinatorial complexity, we introduce a well-established approach to group similar types of information within biochemical networks. A conserved moiety is a set of atoms whose association is invariant across all reactions in a network. A reacting moiety is a set of bonds that are either broken, formed, or undergo a change in bond order in at least one reaction in the network. By mathematically identifying these moieties, we establish the biological significance of conserved and reacting moieties according to the mathematical properties of the stoichiometric matrix. We also present a novel decomposition of the stoichiometric matrix based on conserved moieties. This approach bridges the gap between graph theory, linear algebra, and biological interpretation, thus opening up new horizons in the study of chemical reaction networks.",

    "abstract": "Protein representation learning is critical for numerous biological tasks. Recently, large transformer-based protein language models (pLMs) pretrained on large scale protein sequences have demonstrated significant success in sequence-based tasks. However, pLMs lack structural context. Conversely, graph neural networks (GNNs) designed to leverage 3D structural information have shown promising generalization in protein-related prediction tasks, but their effectiveness is often constrained by the scarcity of labeled structural data. Recognizing that sequence and structural representations are complementary perspectives of the same protein entity, we propose a multimodal bidirectional hierarchical fusion framework to effectively merge these modalities. Our framework employs attention and gating mechanisms to enable effective interaction between pLMs-generated sequential representations and GNN-extracted structural features, improving information exchange and enhancement across layers of the neural network. This bidirectional and hierarchical (Bi-Hierarchical) fusion approach leverages the strengths of both modalities to capture richer and more comprehensive protein representations. Based on the framework, we further introduce local Bi-Hierarchical Fusion with gating and global Bi-Hierarchical Fusion with multihead self-attention approaches. Our method demonstrates consistent improvements over strong baselines and existing fusion techniques in a variety of protein representation learning benchmarks, including enzyme EC classification, model quality assessment, protein-ligand binding affinity prediction, protein-protein binding site prediction, and B cell epitopes prediction. Our method establishes a new state-of-the-art for multimodal protein representation learning, emphasizing the efficacy of Bi-Hierarchical Fusion in bridging sequence and structural modalities.",

We show that the formation of larger oligomers, corresponding to larger Hill coefficients of the regulation function, and thus to sharper non-linearities, improves the system resilience, even close to critical concentrations of TFs. We also explore a complementary definition of resilience that can be assessed within a stochastic formulation relying on the Fokker-Planck equation.

Studies suggest that EMS modulates dendritic cell (DC) maturation in adjuvant arthritis (AA) rats, though the precise mechanisms remain unclear. Prostaglandin receptor 4 (EP4) is critical in inflammation and DC function, while cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) regulates cellular signaling, potentially influencing RA pathogenesis via protein kinase A (PKA) and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) activation. EMS exerts protective effects in RA rats by suppressing DC functions, including reduced EP4 mRNA/protein expression, diminished cAMP levels, and impaired CREB phosphorylation. Additionally, serum from EMS-treated rats inhibited antigen uptake by bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs), downregulating CD40, CD80, and CD86 expression and altering pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion. Mechanistically, EMS-treated serum suppressed the EP4-cAMP pathway by decreasing EP4 protein expression and CREB activation, alongside reduced intracellular cAMP and PKA levels in BMDCs co-stimulated with PGE2 and TNF-a. These findings indicate that EMS alleviates RA by inhibiting the EP4-cAMP-CREB signaling axis in DCs, providing a scientific rationale for its clinical application in RA treatment.",

Many perturbations induce compensatory cellular responses, making it difficult to distinguish direct from indirect effects on gene regulation. Modeling how gene regulatory functions shape the temporal dynamics of these responses is key to improving our understanding of biological perturbations. Dynamical models based on differential equations offer a principled way to capture transcriptional dynamics, but their application to single-cell data has been hindered by computational constraints, stochasticity, sparsity, and noise. Existing methods either rely on low-dimensional representations or make strong simplifying assumptions, limiting their ability to model transcriptional dynamics at scale. We introduce a Functional and Learnable model of Cell dynamicS, FLeCS, that incorporates gene network structure into coupled differential equations to model gene regulatory functions. Given (pseudo)time-series single-cell data, FLeCS accurately infers cell dynamics at scale, provides improved functional insights into transcriptional mechanisms perturbed by gene knockouts, both in myeloid differentiation and K562 Perturb-seq experiments, and simulates single-cell trajectories of A549 cells following small-molecule perturbations.",

    "abstract": "Information geometry is based on classical Legendre duality but allows to incorporate additional structure such as algebraic constraints and Bregman divergence functions. It is naturally suited, and has been successfully used, to describe the thermodynamics of chemical reaction networks (CRNs) based on the Legendre duality between concentration and potential spaces, where algebraic constraints are enforced by the stoichiometry. In this article, the Riemannian geometrical aspects of the theory are explored. It is shown that duality between concentration and potential spaces and the natural parametrizations of equilibrium subspace are isometries, which leads to a multivariate Cramer-Rao bound through the comparison of two Riemannian metric tensors.   In the subsequent part, the theory is applied to the recently introduced concept of absolute sensitivity. Using the Riemannian geometric tools, it is proven that the absolute sensitivity is a projection operator onto the tangent bundle of the equilibrium manifold. A linear algebraic characterization and explicit results on first order corrections to the thermodynamics of ideal solutions are provided. Finally, the theory is applied to the IDHKP-IDH glyoxylate bypass regulation system.   The novelty of the theory is that it is applicable to CRNs with non-ideal thermodynamical behavior, which are prevalent in highly crowded cellular environments due to various interactions between the chemicals. Indeed, the analyzed example shows remarkable behavior ranging from hypersensitivity to negative-self regulations. These are effects which usually require strongly nonlinear reaction kinetics. However, here, they are obtained by tuning thermodynamical interactions providing a complementary, and physically well-founded, viewpoint on such phenomena.",

For large networks, where ODE-based simulation formalisms do not scale well, GRiNS implements Boolean Ising formalism, providing a simplified, coarse-grained alternative, significantly reducing the computational cost while capturing key dynamical behaviours of large regulatory networks.

    "abstract": "Enzyme kinetics has historically been described by deterministic models, with the Michaelis-Menten (MM) equation serving as a paradigm. However, recent experimental and theoretical advances have made it clear that stochastic fluctuations, particularly at low copy numbers or single-enzyme levels, can profoundly impact reaction outcomes. In this paper, we present a comprehensive view of enzyme kinetics from both deterministic and stochastic perspectives. We begin by deriving the classical Michaelis-Menten equation under the quasi-steady-state assumption (QSSA) and discuss its validity. We then formulate the corresponding stochastic model via the chemical master equation (CME) and illustrate how the Gillespie algorithm can simulate single-molecule events and briefly use Kampen's system-size expansion to justify our simulation methods. Through extended computational analyses -- including variance calculations, phase-plane exploration, and parameter sensitivity -- we highlight how deterministic and stochastic predictions coincide in certain limits but can diverge in small systems. We further incorporate case studies from single-enzyme turnover experiments and cellular contexts to showcase the real-world implications of noise. Taken together, our results underscore the necessity of a multifaceted modeling strategy, whereby one can switch between deterministic methods and stochastic realism to gain a fuller understanding of enzyme kinetics at different scales.",

    "title": "ATP requirements for growth reveal the bioenergetic impact of mitochondrial symbiosis",
    "abstract": "Studies by microbiologists from the 1970s provided robust estimates for the energy supply and demand of a prokaryotic cell. The amount of ATP needed to support growth was calculated from the chemical composition of the cell and known enzymatic pathways that synthesize its constituents from known substrates in culture. Starting in 2015, geneticists and evolutionary biologists began investigating the bioenergetic role of mitochondria at eukaryote origin and energy in metazoan evolution using their own, widely trusted but hitherto unvetted model for the costs of growth in terms of ATP per cell. The more recent model contains, however, a severe and previously unrecognized error that systematically overestimates the ATP cost of amino acid synthesis up to 200 fold. The error applies to all organisms studied by such models and leads to conspicuously false inferences, for example that the synthesis of an average amino acid in humans requires 30 ATP, which no biochemistry textbook will confirm. Their ATP cost calculations would require that Escherichia coli obtains roughly 100 ATP per glucose and that mammals obtain roughly 240 ATP per glucose, propositions that invalidate evolutionary inferences so based. By contrast, established methods for estimating the ATP cost of microbial growth show that the first mitochondrial endosymbionts could have easily doubled the hosts available ATP pool, provided that genes for growth on environmental amino acids were transferred from the mitochondrial symbiont to the archaeal host and that the host for mitochondrial origin was an autotroph using the acetyl-CoA pathway.",

    "title": "Noise equals control",
    "abstract": "Stochastic systems have a control-theoretic interpretation in which noise plays the role of control. In the weak-noise limit, relevant at low temperatures or in large populations, this leads to a precise mathematical mapping: the most probable trajectory between two states minimizes an action functional and corresponds to an optimal control strategy. In Langevin dynamics, the noise term itself serves as the control. For general Markov jump processes, such as chemical reaction networks or electronic circuits, we use the Doi-Peliti formalism to identify the `response' (or `momentum') field $π$ as the control variable. This resolves a long-standing interpretational problem in the field-theoretic description of stochastic systems: although $π$ evolves backward in time, it has a clear physical role as the control that steers the system along rare trajectories. This implies that Nature is constantly sampling control strategies. We illustrate the mapping on multistable chemical reaction networks, systems with unstable fixed points, and specifically on stochastic resonance and Brownian ratchets. The noise-control mapping justifies agential descriptions of these phenomena, and builds intuition for otherwise puzzling phenomena of stochastic systems: why probabilities are generically non-smooth functions of state out of thermal equilibrium; why biological mechanisms can work better in the presence of noise; and how agential behavior emerges naturally without recourse to mysticism.",

    "abstract": "Chemical reaction networks underpin biological and physical phenomena across scales, from microbial interactions to planetary atmosphere dynamics. Bacterial communities exhibit complex competitive interactions for resources, human organs and tissues demonstrate specialized biochemical functions, and planetary atmospheres are capable of displaying diverse organic and inorganic chemical processes. Despite their complexities, comparing these networks methodically remains a challenge due to the vast underlying degrees of freedom. In biological systems, comparative genomics has been pivotal in tracing evolutionary trajectories and classifying organisms via DNA sequences. However, purely genomic classifications often fail to capture functional roles within ecological systems. Metabolic changes driven by nutrient availability highlight the need for classification schemes that integrate metabolic information. Here we introduce and apply a computational framework for a classification scheme of organisms that compares matrix representations of chemical reaction networks using the Grassmann distance, corresponding to measuring distances between the fundamental subspaces of stoichiometric matrices. Applying this framework to human gut microbiome data confirms that metabolic distances are distinct from phylogenetic distances, underscoring the limitations of genetic information in metabolic classification. Importantly, our analysis of metabolic distances reveals functional groups of organisms enriched or depleted in specific metabolic processes and shows robustness to metabolically silent genetic perturbations. The generalizability of metabolic Grassmann distances is illustrated by application to chemical reaction networks in human tissue and planetary atmospheres, highlighting its potential for advancing functional comparisons across diverse chemical reaction systems.",

    "abstract": "Living organisms maintain stable functioning amid environmental fluctuations through homeostasis, a property that preserves a system's behavior despite changes in environmental conditions. To elucidate homeostasis in stochastic biochemical reactions, theoretical tools for assessing population-level invariance under parameter perturbations are crucial. In this paper, we propose a systematic method for identifying the stationary moments that remain invariant under parameter perturbations by leveraging the structural properties of the stationary moment equations. A key step in this development is addressing the underdetermined nature of moment equations, which has traditionally made it difficult to characterize how stationary moments depend on system parameters. To overcome this, we utilize the Dulmage-Mendelsohn (DM) decomposition of the coefficient matrix to extract welldetermined subequations and reveal their hierarchical structure. Leveraging this structure, we identify stationary moments whose partial derivatives with respect to parameters are structurally zero, facilitating the exploration of fundamental constraints that govern homeostatic behavior in stochastic biochemical systems.",

    "abstract": "Molecular communication (MC) offers a groundbreaking approach to communication inspired by biological signaling. It is particularly suited for environments where traditional electromagnetic methods fail, such as fluid mediums or within the human body. This study focuses on addressing a major challenge in MC systems: inter symbol interference (ISI), which arises due to the random, diffusive propagation of molecules. We propose a novel technique that leverages transmission shaping to mitigate ISI effectively by designing optimal transmission pulse (or sequence) for symbols. Our approach centers on solving a multi-objective optimization problem that aims to maximize the separability of individual symbol's responses within the symbol duration while matching the interference caused by molecular spillover for all symbols. By making ISI of each symbol similar, the approach reduces the effect of previous symbols and thus not require any adaptive computations. We introduce a geometric analogy involving two families of ellipses to derive the optimal solution. Analytical insights are supported by numerical simulations to design optimized transmission profiles to enhance the resilience toward ISI. The proposed transmission shaping method is evaluated through symbol error rate (SER). These results mark a significant step forward in developing robust and efficient MC systems, opening doors to advanced applications in bio-inspired and nano-scale communication technologies.",

However, HJR suffers from the curse of dimensionality, with computation times growing exponentially in the dimension of the system state. Many autonomous and controlled systems involve dynamics that evolve on multiple timescales, and for these systems, singular perturbation methods can be used for model reduction. However, such methods are more challenging to apply in HJR due to the presence of an underlying differential game. In this work, we leverage prior work on singularly perturbed differential games to identify a class of systems which can be readily reduced, and we relate these results to the quantities of interest in HJR. We demonstrate the utility of our results on two examples involving biological systems, where dynamics fitting the identified class are frequently encountered.",

We developed POINT, a novel NP platform enhanced by multi-omics biological networks, advanced algorithms, and knowledge graphs (KGs) featuring network-based and KG-based analytical functions. In the network-based analysis, users can perform NP studies flexibly using 1,158 multi-omics biological networks encompassing proteins, transcription factors, and non-coding RNAs across diverse cell line-, tissue- and disease-specific conditions. Network-based analysis-including random walk with restart (RWR), GSEA, and diffusion profile (DP) similarity algorithms-supports tasks such as target prediction, functional enrichment, and drug screening. We merged networks from experimental sources to generate a pre-integrated multi-layer human network for evaluation. RWR demonstrated superior performance with a 33.1% average ranking improvement over the second-best algorithm, PageRank, in identifying known targets across 2,002 drugs. Additionally, multi-layer networks significantly improve the ability to identify FDA-approved drug-disease pairs compared to the single-layer network. For KG-based analysis, we compiled three high-quality KGs to construct POINT KG, which cross-references over 90% of network-based predictions. We illustrated the platform's capabilities through two case studies. POINT bridges the gap between multi-omics networks and drug discovery; it is freely accessible at http://point.gene.ac/.",

    "abstract": "Graphical modeling is a widely used tool for analyzing conditional dependencies between variables and traditional methods may struggle to capture shared and distinct structures in multi-group or multi-condition settings. Joint graphical modeling (JGM) extends this framework by simultaneously estimating network structures across multiple related datasets, allowing for a deeper understanding of commonalities and differences. This capability is particularly valuable in fields such as genomics and neuroscience, where identifying variations in network topology can provide critical biological insights. Existing JGM methodologies largely fall into two categories: regularization-based approaches, which introduce additional penalties to enforce structured sparsity, and Bayesian frameworks, which incorporate prior knowledge to improve network inference. In this study, we explore an alternative method based on two-target linear covariance matrix shrinkage. Formula for optimal shrinkage intensities is proposed which leads to the development of JointStein framework. Performance of JointStein framework is proposed through simulation benchmarking which demonstrates its effectiveness for large-scale single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data analysis. Finally, we apply our approach to glioblastoma scRNA-seq data, uncovering dynamic shifts in T cell network structures across disease progression stages. The result highlights potential of JointStein framework in extracting biologically meaningful insights from high-dimensional data.",

    "abstract": "In biochemical reaction networks, the first passage time (FPT) of a reaction quantifies the time it takes for the reaction to first occur, from the initial state. While the mean FPT historically served as a summary metric, a far more comprehensive characterization of the dynamics of the network is contained within the complete FPT distribution. The relatively uncommon theoretical treatments of the FPT distribution that have been given in the past have been confined to linear systems, with zero and first-order processes. Recently, we presented theoretically exact solutions for the FPT distribution, within nonlinear systems involving two-particle collisions, such as A+B - C. Although this research yielded invaluable results, it was based upon the assumption of initial conditions in the form of a Poisson distribution. This somewhat restricts its relevance to real-world biochemical systems, which frequently display intricate behaviour and initial conditions that are non-Poisson in nature. Our current study extends prior analyses to accommodate arbitrary initial conditions, thereby expanding the applicability of our theoretical framework and providing a more adaptable tool for capturing the dynamics of biochemical reaction networks.",

Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) effectively treats CSG, as exemplified by Jinhong Tablets (JHT) with known anti-inflammatory properties, though their mechanism remains unclear. This study integrated network pharmacology, untargeted metabolomics, and gut microbiota analyses to investigate how JHT alleviates CSG. A rat CSG model was established and evaluated via H&E staining. We identified JHT's target profiles and constructed a multi-layer biomolecular network. Differential metabolites in plasma were determined by untargeted metabolomics, and gut microbiota diversity/composition in fecal and cecal samples was assessed via 16S rRNA sequencing. JHT markedly reduced gastric inflammation. Network pharmacology highlighted metabolic pathways, particularly lipid and nitric oxide metabolism, as essential to JHT's therapeutic effect. Metabolomics identified key differential metabolites including betaine (enhancing gut microbiota), phospholipids, and citrulline (indicating severity of CSG). Pathway enrichment supported the gut microbiota's involvement. Further microbiota analysis showed that JHT increased betaine abundance, improved short-chain fatty acid production, and elevated Faecalibaculum and Bifidobacterium, thereby alleviating gastric inflammation. In conclusion, JHT alleviates CSG via diverse metabolic processes, especially lipid and energy metabolism, and influences metabolites like betaine alongside gut microbes such as Faecalibaculum and Bifidobacterium. These findings underscore JHT's therapeutic potential and deepen our understanding of TCM's role in CSG management.",

    "abstract": "Accurately predicting complex protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is crucial for decoding biological processes, from cellular functioning to disease mechanisms. However, experimental methods for determining PPIs are computationally expensive. Thus, attention has been recently drawn to machine learning approaches. Furthermore, insufficient effort has been made toward analyzing signed PPI networks, which capture both activating (positive) and inhibitory (negative) interactions. To accurately represent biological relationships, we present the Signed Two-Space Proximity Model (S2-SPM) for signed PPI networks, which explicitly incorporates both types of interactions, reflecting the complex regulatory mechanisms within biological systems. This is achieved by leveraging two independent latent spaces to differentiate between positive and negative interactions while representing protein similarity through proximity in these spaces. Our approach also enables the identification of archetypes representing extreme protein profiles. S2-SPM's superior performance in predicting the presence and sign of interactions in SPPI networks is demonstrated in link prediction tasks against relevant baseline methods. Additionally, the biological prevalence of the identified archetypes is confirmed by an enrichment analysis of Gene Ontology (GO) terms, which reveals that distinct biological tasks are associated with archetypal groups formed by both interactions. This study is also validated regarding statistical significance and sensitivity analysis, providing insights into the functional roles of different interaction types. Finally, the robustness and consistency of the extracted archetype structures are confirmed using the Bayesian Normalized Mutual Information (BNMI) metric, proving the model's reliability in capturing meaningful SPPI patterns.",

To address these issues, model reduction approaches based on deterministic quasi-steady-state approximations (QSSA) have been employed, resulting in propensity functions in the form of deterministic non-elementary reaction functions, such as the Michaelis-Menten equation. In particular, the total QSSA (tQSSA), known for its accuracy in deterministic frameworks, has been perceived as universally valid for stochastic model reduction. However, recent studies have challenged this perception. In this review, we demonstrate that applying tQSSA in stochastic model reduction can distort dynamics, even in cases where the deterministic tQSSA is rigorously valid. This highlights the need for caution when using deterministic QSSA in stochastic model reduction to avoid erroneous conclusions from model simulations.",

    "title": "Symmetries of Living Systems: Symmetry Fibrations and Synchronization in Biological Networks",
    "abstract": "A symmetry is a `change without change'. As simple as it sounds, this concept is the fundamental cornerstone that unifies all branches of theoretical physics. Virtually all physical laws -- ranging from classical mechanics and electrodynamics to relativity, quantum mechanics, and the standard model -- can be expressed in terms of symmetry invariances. In this book, we explore whether the same principle can also explain the emergent laws of biological systems. We introduce a new geometry for biological networks and AI architectures, drawing inspiration from the mystic genius of Grothendieck's fibrations in category theory. We attempt to bridge the gap between physics and biology using symmetries but with a twist. The traditional symmetry groups of physics are global and too rigid to describe biology. Instead, the novel notion of symmetry fibration is local, flexible, and adaptable to evolutionary pressures, providing the right framework for understanding biological complexity. In other words, this more general symmetry invariance is necessary and sufficient to ensure that a given biological network configuration can support a synchronized function. In this book, we review the theoretical progress over the last decades from mathematics, physics, computer science, dynamical systems, and graph theory that has led to the discovery of symmetry fibrations in biological networks. These symmetries act as organizing principles for biological networks. They serve as effective tools for describing the structure of these networks, blending geometry and topology. Fibrations explain how structure dictates function across various biological domains, including the transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, and connectome. Additionally, they facilitate a reduction in the dimensionality of the network, simplifying it into its fundamental building blocks for biological computation.",

Our findings highlight the critical role of CDK1-APC interactions in regulating the cell cycle and examine the impact of Zingerone, a compound derived from ginger, on modulating the period of the oscillatory dynamics. These results provide new insights into the potential of Zingerone to influence cell proliferation and offer avenues for less harmful cancer treatments.

We show that closed chemical reaction networks -- with specific stoichiometries imposed by mass-action kinetics -- behave like open ones in the limit where the abundances of a subset of species become macroscopic, thus playing the role of chemostats. We prove that this limit is thermodynamically consistent by recovering the local detailed balance condition of open chemical reaction networks and deriving the proper expression of the entropy production rate. In particular, the entropy production rate features two contributions: one accounting for the dissipation of the stochastic reactions, the other for the dissipation of continuous reactions controlling the chemostats. Finally, we illustrate our results for two prototypical examples.",

    "abstract": "Many biological and social systems are naturally represented as edge-weighted directed or undirected hypergraphs since they exhibit group interactions involving three or more system units as opposed to pairwise interactions that can be incorporated in graph-theoretic representations. However, finding influential cores in hypergraphs is still not as extensively studied as their graph-theoretic counter-parts. To this end, we develop and implement a hypergraph-curvature guided discrete time diffusion process with suitable topological surgeries and edge-weight re-normalization procedures for both undirected and directed weighted hypergraphs to find influential cores. We successfully apply our framework for directed hypergraphs to seven metabolic hypergraphs and our framework for undirected hypergraphs to two social (co-authorship) hypergraphs to find influential cores, thereby demonstrating the practical feasibility of our approach. In addition, we prove a theorem showing that a certain edge weight re-normalization procedure in a prior research work for Ricci flows for edge-weighted graphs has the undesirable outcome of modifying the edge-weights to negative numbers, thereby rendering the procedure impossible to use. To the best of our knowledge, this seems to be one of the first articles that formulates algorithmic approaches for finding core(s) of (weighted or unweighted) directed hypergraphs.",

    "abstract": "Graphs depict pairwise relationships between objects within a system. Higher-order interactions (HOIs), which involve more than two objects simultaneously, are common in nature. Such interactions can change the stability of a complex system. Hypergraphs can represent an HOI as an arbitrary subset of vertices. However, they fail to capture the specific roles of the vertices involved, which can be highly asymmetric, particularly in the case of interaction modifications.   We introduce pangraphs, a robust and quantitative generalisation of graphs that accurately captures arbitrarily complex higher-order interactions. We demonstrate that several higher-order representations proposed in the literature are specific instances of pangraphs. Additionally, we introduce an incidence multilayer digraph representation of a pangraph, referred to as Levi digraph. We adapt degree and Katz centrality measures to the pangraph framework and show that a consistent generalisation of recursive graph measures cannot be simplified to a Levi digraph of a pangraph.   We construct a pangraph for a real-world coffee agroecosystem and compare Katz centrality between its dihypergraph and pangraph representations, both analytically and numerically. The choice of representation significantly affects centrality values and alters vertex ranks. Additionally, we emphasise the use of real-valued incidence matrices to quantify interaction strengths and the roles of vertices within the system.",

In gene regulation, the timescales for changes in chromatin states can differ from those for changes in the concentration of product protein, raising questions about how to understand their coupled dynamics. In this study, we examine the effects of these different timescales on eukaryotic gene regulation using a stochastic model that describes the landscapes and probability currents of nonequilibrium fluctuations.This model shows that slow, nonadiabatic transitions of chromatin states significantly impact gene-regulation dynamics. The simulated circular flow of the probability currents indicates a maximum entropy production when the rates of chromatin-state transitions are low in the intensely nonadiabatic regime. In the mildly nonadiabatic regime, this circular flow fosters hysteresis, suggesting that changes in chromatin states precede changes in transcription activity. Furthermore, calculations using a model of a circuit involving three core genes in mouse embryonic stem cells illustrate how the timescale difference can tune fluctuations in individual genes. These findings highlight the rich effects of nonadiabatic chromatin-state transitions on gene regulation in eukaryotic cells.",

This process of polynomialization/quadratization reveals new variables (in most cases, additional variables have to be added to achieve this) in which the system dynamics adhere to that specific form, which leads us to discover new structures of a model. This chapter summarizes the state of the art for the discovery of polynomial and quadratic representations of finite-dimensional dynamical systems.

To fill this critical gap, we introduce HODDI, the first Higher-Order Drug-Drug Interaction Dataset, constructed from U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) records spanning the past decade, to advance computational pharmacovigilance. HODDI contains 109,744 records involving 2,506 unique drugs and 4,569 unique side effects, specifically curated to capture multi-drug interactions and their collective impact on adverse effects. Comprehensive statistical analyses demonstrate HODDI's extensive coverage and robust analytical metrics, making it a valuable resource for studying higher-order drug relationships. Evaluating HODDI with multiple models, we found that simple Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) can outperform graph models, while hypergraph models demonstrate superior performance in capturing complex multi-drug interactions, further validating HODDI's effectiveness.

    "abstract": "What is the most crucial characteristic of a system with life activity? Currently, many theories have attempted to explain the most essential difference between living systems and general systems, such as the self-organization theory and the free energy principle, but there is a lack of a reasonable indicator that can measure to what extent a system can be regarded as a system with life characteristics, especially the lack of attention to the dynamic characteristics of life systems. In this article, we propose a new indicator at the level of dynamic mechanisms to measure the ability of a system to flexibly respond to the environment. We proved that this indicator satisfies the axiom system of multivariate information decomposition in the partial information decomposition (PID) framework. Through further disassembly and analysis of this indicator, we found that it is determined by the degree of entanglement between system and environmental variables in the dynamics and the magnitude of noise. We conducted measurements on cellular automata (CA), random Boolean networks, and real gene regulatory networks (GRN), verified its relationship with the type of CA and the Langton parameter, and identified that the feedback loops have high abilities to flexibly respond to the environment on the GRN. We also combined machine learning technology to prove that this framework can be applied in the case of unknown dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Intracellular networks process cellular-level information and control cell fate. They can be computationally modeled using Boolean networks, which are implicit-time causal models of discrete binary events. These networks can be embedded in computational agents to drive cellular behavior. To explore this integration, we construct a set of candidate interventions that induce apoptosis in a cell-survival network of a rare leukemia using exhaustive search simulation, stable motif control, and an individual-based mean field approach (IBMFA). Due to inherent algorithmic limitations, these interventions are most suitable for cell-level determinations, not the more realistic multicellular setting. To address these limitations, we treat the target control solutions as putative targets for therapeutic interventions and develop a pipeline to translate them to continuous-time multicellular, agent-based models. We set the discrete-to-continuous transitions between the Boolean network and multicellular model via thresholding and produce simple computational simulations designed to emulate situations in experimental and translational biology. These include a series of simulations: constant substrate gradients, global substrate pulses, and time-varying boundary conditions. We find that interventions that perform equally well in the implicit-time single-cell setting are separable in the multiscale setting in ability to impact population growth and spatial distribution. Further analysis shows that the population and spatial distribution differences arise from differences in internal dynamics (stable motif controls versus target controls) and network distance between the intervention and output nodes. This proof of concept work demonstrates the importance of accounting for internal dynamics in multicellular simulations as well as impacts on understanding of Boolean network control.",

In this study, we applied quantum walk (QW), a computational approach leveraging quantum interference, to explore large-scale SARS-CoV-2-induced protein (SIP) networks. Compared to the conventional random walk with restart (RWR) method, QW demonstrated superior capacity to traverse deeper regions of the network, uncovering proteins and pathways implicated in Long COVID. Key findings include mitochondrial dysfunction, thromboinflammatory responses, and neuronal inflammation as central mechanisms. QW uniquely identified the CDGSH iron-sulfur domain-containing protein family and VDAC1, a mitochondrial calcium transporter, as critical regulators of these processes. VDAC1 emerged as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target, supported by FDA-approved compounds such as cannabidiol. These findings highlight QW as a powerful tool for elucidating complex biological systems and identifying novel therapeutic targets for conditions like Long COVID.",

    "abstract": "Global climate change has reduced crop resilience and pesticide efficacy, making reliance on synthetic pesticides inevitable, even though their widespread use poses significant health and environmental risks. While these pesticides remain a key tool in pest management, previous machine-learning applications in pesticide and agriculture have focused on classification or regression, leaving the fundamental challenge of generating new molecular structures or designing novel candidates unaddressed. In this paper, we propose Pesti-Gen, a novel generative model based on variational auto-encoders, designed to create pesticide candidates with optimized properties for the first time. Specifically, Pesti-Gen leverages a two-stage learning process: an initial pre-training phase that captures a generalized chemical structure representation, followed by a fine-tuning stage that incorporates toxicity-specific information. The model simultaneously optimizes over multiple toxicity metrics, such as (1) livestock toxicity and (2) aqua toxicity to generate environmentally friendly pesticide candidates. Notably, Pesti-Gen achieves approximately 68\\% structural validity in generating new molecular structures, demonstrating the model's effectiveness in producing optimized and feasible pesticide candidates, thereby providing a new way for safer and more sustainable pest management solutions.",

This model combines supervised and self-supervised learning, taking into account for the loss function the embeddings learned and patterns with and without ground truth. Additionally it incorporates an attention mechanism that leverages both node and edge features. The architecture, trained end-to-end, comprises two primary components: embedding generation and prediction. First, a graph neural network (GNN) transform raw node features into dense, low-dimensional embeddings, incorporating edge attributes. Then, a feedforward neural model processes the node embeddings to produce the final output. Experiments demonstrate that our model matches or exceeds existing methods for protein-protein interactions prediction and Gene Ontology (GO) terms prediction. The model also performs effectively with one-hot encoding for node features, providing a solution for the previously unsolved problem of predicting similarity between compounds with unknown structures.",

Traditional numerical methods often require specific initial guesses and may fail to find all the solutions in systems exhibiting multistability. Gröbner bases offer an algebraic framework that systematically transforms polynomial equations into simpler forms, facilitating comprehensive solution enumeration. In this work, we propose a conjecture that CRNs with at most pairwise interactions yield Gröbner bases possessing a near-\"triangular\" structure, under appropriate assumptions. We illustrate this phenomenon using examples from a gene regulatory network and the Wnt signaling pathway, where the Gröbner basis approach reliably captures all real positive solutions. Our computational experiments reveal the potential of Gröbner bases to overcome limitations of local numerical methods for finding the steady states of complex biological systems, making them a powerful tool for understanding dynamical processes across diverse biochemical models.",

Including all of these processes into a practical mathematical framework requires complex expressions that are difficult to interpret and apply. We construct a simple theory that incorporates intracellular stochastic gene expression dynamics, signaling chemicals that influence these dynamics and mediate cell-cell interactions, and cell proliferation and its accompanying differentiation. Cellular states (genetic and epigenetic) are described by a Waddington vector field that allows for non-gradient dynamics (cycles, entropy production, loss of detailed balance) which is precluded in Waddington potential landscape representations of gene expression dynamics. We define an epigenetic fitness landscape that describes the proliferation of different cell types, and elucidate how this fitness landscape is related to Waddington's vector field. We illustrate the applicability of our framework by analyzing two model systems: an interacting two-gene differentiation process and a spatiotemporal organism model inspired by planaria.",

    "abstract": "A fluctuation theorem is examined for the first-passage time of a biomolecular machine (e.g., a motor protein or an enzyme) in a nonequilibrium steady-state. For such machines in which the driven, observable process is coupled to a hidden process in a kinetically cooperative fashion, the entropy produced along first-passage trajectories is no longer constant, resulting in a breakdown of this expression. Here, we consider the canonical model for this type of system, a kinetic scheme for conformation-modulated single-enzyme catalysis (a type of continuous-time Markov process with relevance to $β$-galactosidase and human glucokinase), as we explore this fluctuation theorem in cooperative biomolecular networks. Kinetic evaluations are performed using a novel, efficient pathway analysis technique, allowing us to attain surprising and concise results from complex calculations. We find that in the absence of hidden current, a fluctuation theorem can be established for the first-passage time of the observable process, and we demonstrate that this dramatic reduction is a general feature applicable to a wide variety of cooperative networks. The validity of this expression can be experimentally tested, with its violation serving as a unique signature of hidden detailed balance breaking. In addition, we obtain a remarkably compact exact expression for the integrated correction to this first-passage time fluctuation theorem, as well as the general form, revealing a thermodynamic bound on the kinetic branching ratio (a measure of directionality defined as the ratio of the forward observable process probability to the backward one). These results provide detailed insight into the rich connections between dynamic measurements and the underlying nonequilibrium thermodynamics for cooperative biomolecular machines.",

    "title": "Benchmarking Constraint-Based Bayesian Structure Learning Algorithms: Role of Network Topology",
    "abstract": "Modeling the associations between real world entities from their multivariate cross-sectional profiles can provide cues into the concerted working of these entities as a system. Several techniques have been proposed for deciphering these associations including constraint-based Bayesian structure learning (BSL) algorithms that model them as directed acyclic graphs. Benchmarking these algorithms have typically focused on assessing the variation in performance measures such as sensitivity as a function of the dimensionality represented by the number of nodes in the DAG, and sample size. The present study elucidates the importance of network topology in benchmarking exercises. More specifically, it investigates variations in sensitivity across distinct network topologies while constraining the nodes, edges, and sample-size to be identical, eliminating these as potential confounders. Sensitivity of three popular constraint-based BSL algorithms (Peter-Clarke, Grow-Shrink, Incremental Association Markov Blanket) in learning the network structure from multivariate cross-sectional profiles sampled from network models with sub-linear, linear, and super-linear DAG topologies generated using preferential attachment is investigated. Results across linear and nonlinear models revealed statistically significant $(α=0.05)$ decrease in sensitivity estimates from sub-linear to super-linear topology constitutively across the three algorithms. These results are demonstrated on networks with nodes $(N_{nods}=48,64)$, noise strengths $(σ=3,6)$ and sample size $(N = 2^{10})$. The findings elucidate the importance of accommodating the network topology in constraint-based BSL benchmarking exercises.",

    "abstract": "The human MHC transplantation loci (HLA-A, -B, -C, -DPB1, -DQB1, -DRB1) are the most polymorphic in the human genome. It is generally accepted this polymorphism reflects a role in presenting pathogen-derived peptide to the adaptive immune system. Proposed mechanisms for the polymorphism such as negative frequency-dependent selection (NFDS) and heterozygote advantage (HA) focus on HLA alleles, not haplotypes. Here, we propose a model for the polymorphism in which infectious diseases impose independent density-dependent regulation on HLA haplotypes. More specifically, a complex pathogen environment drives extensive host polymorphism through a guild of HLA haplotypes that are specialised and show incomplete peptide recognition. Separation of haplotype guilds is maintained by limiting similarity. The outcome is a wide and stable range of haplotype densities at steady-state in which effective Fisher fitnesses are zero. Densities, and therefore frequencies, emerge theoretically as alternative measures of fitness. A catalogue of ranked frequencies is therefore one of ranked fitnesses. The model is supported by data from a range of sources including a Caucasian HLA dataset compiled by the US National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP). These provide evidence of positive selection on the top 350-2000 5-locus HLA haplotypes taken from an overall NMDP sample set of 10E5. High-fitness haplotypes drive the selection of 137 high-frequency alleles spread across the 5 HLA loci under consideration. These alleles demonstrate positive epistasis and pleiotropy in the formation of haplotypes. Allelic pleiotropy creates a network of highly inter-related HLA haplotypes that account for 97% of the census sample. We suggest this network has properties of a quasi-species and is itself under selection. We also suggest this is the origin of balancing selection in the HLA system.",

    "title": "A unified model for the origins of spongiform degeneration and other neuropathological features in prion diseases",
    "abstract": "Decades after their initial observation in prion-infected brain tissues, the identities of virus-like dense particles, varicose tubules, and oval bodies containing parallel bands and fibrils have remained elusive. Our recent work revealed that a phenotype of dilation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), most notable for the perinuclear space (PNS), contributes to spongiform degeneration. To assess the significance of this phenotype for the etiology of prion diseases, we explored whether it can be functionally linked to other neuropathological hallmarks observed in these diseases, as this would indicate it to be a central event. Having surveyed the neuropathological record and other distant literature niches, we propose a model in which pathogenic forms of the prion protein poison raft domains, including essential Na+, K+-ATPases (NKAs) embedded within them, thereby triggering an ER-centered cellular rescue program coordinated by the unfolded protein response (UPR). The execution of this program stalls general protein synthesis, causing the deterioration of synaptic spines. As the disease progresses, cells selectively increase sterol biosynthesis, along with ribosome and ER biogenesis. These adaptive rescue attempts cause morphological changes to the ER which manifest as ER dilation or ER hypertrophy in a manner that is influenced by Ca2+ influx into the cell. The nuclear-to-cytoplasmic transport of mRNAs and tRNAs interrupts in late stage disease, thereby depriving ribosomes of supplies and inducing them to aggregate into a paracrystalline form. In support of this model, we share previously reported data, whose features are consistent with the interpretation that 1) the phenotype of ER dilation is observed in major prion diseases, 2) varicose tubules and oval bodies represent ER hypertrophy, and 3) virus-like dense particles are paracrystalline aggregates of inactive ribosomes.",

We introduce polyexponential dynamical systems, which are equivalent to the generalized Lotka-Volterra systems, and we use an analogy to the theory of mass-action kinetics to define and analyze complex balanced polyexponential systems, and implicitly analyze complex balanced generalized Lotka-Volterra systems. We prove that complex balanced generalized Lotka-Volterra systems have globally attracting states, up to standard conservation relations, which become linear for the associated polyexponential systems. In particular, complex balanced generalized Lotka-Volterra systems cannot give rise to periodic solutions, chaotic dynamics, or other complex dynamical behaviors.

    "title": "A theoretical investigation provides an integrated understanding of the complex regulatory network controlling Arabidopsis root hair patterning",
    "abstract": "A complex regulatory network controlling Arabidopsis root hair patterning has been defined using data collected over decades. The network, embedded in the root epidermis, contains positive and negative feedback loops, cell-cell signalling within the epidermal tissue, and receives positional signalling from underlying tissue. While there are extensive data regarding individual components and their interactions within the network, the sufficiency of the regulatory network to produce robust epidermal patterning is not clear, nor is it clear how individual components and interactions work together to ensure correct epidermal patterning. Mathematical modelling was used to address the questions of sufficiency, and to gain an integrated understanding of collective behaviour emerging from individual components and interactions within the regulatory network. Theoretical experiments were performed on a model of the root hair patterning regulatory network. It was found that our current understanding of the epidermal patterning network was insufficient to reproduce experimental data. The model was used to hypothesise the existence of an additional negative feedback loop which, when added to the currently understood regulatory network, enabled the model to reproduce wild type and mutant root hair patterning. Results of theoretical experiments on the modified regulatory network were used to; define an essential relationship between diffusive movement of two cell-cell signalling proteins; show that directed movement dysregulation of another cell-cell signalling protein causes root hair patterning to appear as though it no longer receives positional cues; and show that cooperativity or oligomerisation within the regulatory network's positive feedback loop are essential. This work presents an integrated, exploration of the regulatory network controlling epidermal root hair patterning in Arabidopsis.",

    "title": "Hierarchical cell identities emerge from animal gene regulatory mechanisms",
    "abstract": "The hierarchical organisation of cell identity is a fundamental feature of animal development with rich and well-characterized experimental phenomenology, yet the mechanisms driving its emergence remain unknown. The regulation of cell identity genes relies on a distinct mechanism involving higher-order interactions of transcription factors on distant regulatory regions called enhancers. These interactions are mediated by epigenetic regulators that are broadly shared between enhancers. Through the development of a new and predictive mathematical theory on the effects of epigenetic regulator activity on gene network dynamics, we demonstrate that hierarchical identities are essential emergent properties of animal-specific gene regulatory mechanisms. Hierarchical identities arise from the interplay between enhancer competition for epigenetic readers and cooperation through activation of shared transcriptional programs. We show that epigenetic regulatory mechanisms provide the network with self-similar properties that enable multilineage priming and signal-dependent control of progenitor states. The stabilisation of progenitor states is predicted to be controlled by the balance in activities between epigenetic writers and erasers. Our model quantitatively predicts lineage relationships, reconstructs all known blood progenitor states from terminal states, and explains mechanisms of cell identity dysregulation in cancer and the general differentiation effects of histone deacetylase inhibition. We identify non-specific modulation of enhancer competition as a central regulatory axis, with implications for developmental biology, cancer, and differentiation therapy.",

Method 1 involves decomposing chemicals and transmitting their formulas digitally. Method 2 embeds chemicals in water, freezes it into ice, and transports it to the receiver, where the chemicals are extracted upon melting. Method 3 transfers chemicals via water logistics, with the receiver extracting them from the water. Method 4 uses airtight pipelines to transport chemicals in water, which are then extracted by the receiver. Method 5 projects chemical odors into the air, where the receiver captures them using suction. Method 6 draws from optical fiber technology to transmit chemical odors through a cable, ensuring the chemical composition remains intact. Each method ensures the receiver experiences the same scent as the sender.",

    "abstract": "To advance understanding of cellular metabolism and reduce batch-to-batch variability in cell culture processes, this study introduces a multi-scale hybrid modeling framework designed to simulate and predict the dynamic behavior of CHO cell cultures undergoing metabolic phase transitions. The model captures dependencies across molecular, cellular, and macro-kinetic levels, accounting for variability in single-cell metabolic phases. It integrates three components: (i) a stochastic mechanistic model of single-cell metabolic networks, (ii) a probabilistic model of phase transitions, and (iii) a macro-kinetic model of heterogeneous population dynamics. This modular architecture enables flexible representation of process trajectories under diverse conditions and incorporates heterogeneous online (e.g., oxygen uptake, pH) and offline measurements (e.g., viable cell density, metabolite concentrations). Leveraging these data and single-cell insights, the framework predicts culture dynamics using only readily available online measurements and initial conditions, delivering accurate long-term forecasts of multivariate culture behavior and uncertainty-aware estimates of batch-to-batch variation. Overall, this work establishes a robust foundation for digital twin platforms and predictive bioprocess analytics, supporting systematic experimental design and process control to improve yield and production stability in biomanufacturing.",

    "abstract": "Modeling dynamical biological systems is key for understanding, predicting, and controlling complex biological behaviors. Traditional methods for identifying governing equations, such as ordinary differential equations (ODEs), typically require extensive quantitative data, which is often scarce in biological systems due to experimental limitations. To address this challenge, we introduce an approach that determines biomolecular models from qualitative system behaviors expressed as Signal Temporal Logic (STL) statements, which are naturally suited to translate expert knowledge into computationally tractable specifications. Our method represents the biological network as a graph, where edges represent interactions between species, and uses a genetic algorithm to identify the graph. To infer the parameters of the ODEs modeling the interactions, we propose a gradient-based algorithm. On a numerical example, we evaluate two loss functions using STL robustness and analyze different initialization techniques to improve the convergence of the approach.",

    "abstract": "Biochemical reaction networks are typically modeled by $\\dfrac{dx}{dt}=N\\cdot K(x)=Y\\cdot I_a\\cdot K(x)$, with $x$ and $K(x)$ as the concentration and rate vectors, respectively, and $N$, $Y$, and $I_a$ as the stoichiometric, molecularity, and incidence matrices, respectively. Steady states, which describe their long-term behaviors, are determined by solving $N\\cdot K(x)=0$, while complex balanced steady states are found by solving $I_a \\cdot K(x)=0$. To investigate these complex networks, decomposition techniques are important, in particular, for computing steady states. Previously, we identified a widespread property across many networks: the existence of independent and incidence-independent decompositions, characterized by the ability to directly sum the stoichiometric and incidence matrices of the subnetworks, respectively, to match those of the entire network. Here, we discover the ubiquitous property that we call the Finest Decomposition Coarsening (FDC), where the finest independent decomposition (FID) is a coarsening of the finest incidence-independent decomposition (FIID). To support the analysis of this property, we introduce a MATLAB package designed to compute both these decompositions. We then characterize the FDC property and its relationship to structural factors such as the invertibility of the molecularity matrix. We also introduce and characterize the Finest Decompositions Equality (FDE) property, where FIID equals FID. Notably, we show that all deficiency zero networks exhibit the FDE property. Furthermore, we establish important relationships of the FID and FIID with decomposition of the network into its connected components. Our results highlight the prevalence of the coarsening property in reaction networks and deepens the understanding of the algebraic structure and dynamics of biochemical networks.",

Despite the prevalence of frequency-encoded signals in natural systems, fundamental challenges in designing and implementing frequency-responsive gene circuits have limited their development in synthetic biology. Here we present a Time-Resolved Gene Circuit (TRGC) architecture that enables frequency-to-amplitude signal conversion in engineered biological systems. Through systematic analysis, we establish a theoretical framework that guides the design of synthetic circuits capable of distinct frequency-dependent responses, implementing both high-pass and low-pass filtering behaviors. To enable rigorous characterization of these dynamic circuits, we developed a high-throughput automated platform that ensures stable and reproducible measurements of frequency-dependent r esponses across diverse conditions. Using this platform, we demonstrate that these frequency-modulated circuits can access cellular states unreachable through conventional amplitude modulation, significantly expanding the controllable gene expression space in multi-gene systems. Our results show that frequency modulation expands the range of achievable expression patterns when controlling multiple genes through a single input, demonstrating a new paradigm for engineering cellular behaviors. This work establishes frequency modulation as a powerful strategy for expanding the capabilities of engineered biological systems and enhancing cellular response to dynamic signals.",

In more detail, we give a mixed-integer linear programming (mixed ILP) formulation of the search problem into which we integrate chemical potentials and concentrations for individual molecules, enabling us to constrain the search to return pathways containing only thermodynamically favorable reactions. Moreover, if multiple possible pathways are found, we can rank these by objective functions based on thermodynamics.

    "abstract": "Gaining insights from realistic dynamical models of biochemical systems can be challenging given their large number of state variables. Model reduction techniques can mitigate this by decreasing complexity by mapping the model onto a lower-dimensional state space. Exact constrained lumping identifies reductions as linear combinations of the original state variables in systems of nonlinear ordinary differential equations, preserving specific user-defined output variables without error. However, exact reductions can be too stringent in practice, as model parameters are often uncertain or imprecise -- a particularly relevant problem for biochemical systems. We propose approximate constrained lumping. It allows for a relaxation of exactness within a given tolerance parameter $\\varepsilon$, while still working in polynomial time. We prove that the accuracy, i.e., the difference between the output variables in the original and reduced model, is in the order of $\\varepsilon$. Furthermore, we provide a heuristic algorithm to find the smallest $\\varepsilon$ for a given maximum allowable size of the lumped system. Our method is applied to several models from the literature, resulting in coarser aggregations than exact lumping while still capturing the dynamics of the original system accurately.",

We study the noisy behaviour of the circuit and compare the profile with the network where the activator and repressor bind the promoter non-competitively. We further notice that, due to the effect of transcriptional reinitiation in the presence of the activator and repressor molecules, there exits some anomalous characteristic features in the mean expressions and noise profiles. We find that, in presence of the reinitiation the noise in transcriptional level remains low while it is higher in translational level than the noise when the reinitiation is absent. In addition, it is possible to reduce the noise further below the Poissonian level in competitive circuit than the non-competitive one with the help of some noise reducing parameters.",

    "abstract": "In computational metabolic design, it is often necessary to modify the original constraint-based metabolic networks to lead to growth-coupled production, where cell growth forces target metabolite production. However, in genome-scale models, finding strategies to simultaneously delete and add genes to induce growth-coupled production is challenging. This is particularly true when heavy computation is necessary due to numerous gene deletions and additions. In this study, we mathematically defined related problems, proved NP-hardness and/or NP-completeness, and developed an algorithm named RatGene that (1) automatically integrates multiple constraint-based metabolic networks, (2) identifies gene deletion-addition strategies by a growth-to-production ratio-based approach, and (3) eliminates redundant gene additions and deletions. The results of computational experiments demonstrated that the RatGene-based approach can significantly improve the success ratio for identifying the strategies for growth-coupled production. RatGene can facilitate a more rational approach to computational metabolic design for the production of useful substances using microorganisms by concurrently considering both gene deletions and additions.",

    "abstract": "Mathematical models of living cells have been successively refined with advancements in experimental techniques. A main concern is striking a balance between modelling power and the tractability of the associated mathematical analysis.   In this work we model the dynamics for the transcription factor Hairy and enhancer of split-1 (Hes1), whose expression oscillates during neural development, and which critically enables stable fate decision in the embryonic brain. We design, parametrise, and analyse a detailed spatial model using ordinary differential equations (ODEs) over a grid capturing both transient oscillatory behaviour and fate decision on a population-level. We also investigate the relationship between this ODE model and a more realistic grid-based model involving intrinsic noise using mostly directly biologically motivated parameters.   While we focus specifically on Hes1 in neural development, the approach of linking deterministic and stochastic grid-based models shows promise in modelling various biological processes taking place in a cell population. In this context, our work stresses the importance of the interpretability of complex computational models into a framework which is amenable to mathematical analysis.",

We extend this construction to allow for any finite spanning set of the kernel, and explore how the choice of spanning set influences the dynamics of the resulting network, including the existence of boundary steady states, the deficiency of the network, and the rate of convergence.

    "abstract": "Understanding how viral mutant spectra organize and explore genotype space is essential for unraveling the mechanisms driving evolution at the finest scale. Here we use deep-sequencing data of an amplicon in the A2 protein of the RNA bacteriophage Q$β$ to reconstruct genotype networks with tens of thousands of different haplotypes. The study of populations evolved under different temperature regimes uncovers generic topological features conditioned by fundamental structural motifs of genotype networks -- tetrahedrons, triangles, and squares -- that govern their local architecture. Mutant swarms display a hierarchical structure where sequences cluster around a highly connected and abundant sequence core that sustains population diversity. The immediate neighborhood of this core is comprehensively sampled, with no signs of selection, while a few mutations away sampling becomes dynamical and sparse, showing signs of purifying selection. By aggregating genotype networks from populations adapted to different temperatures, we capture the early stages of evolutionary divergence, with overlapping populations that remain connected through short mutational paths. Even at the time scale of these experiments, evolutionary pathways might be multiple, preventing the backward reconstruction of unique trajectories once mutations have been fixed. This analysis provides a detailed view of the local, fine-scale processes shaping viral quasispecies evolution and underscores the usefulness of genotype networks as an enlightening visualization of the organization of mutant swarms.",

    "abstract": "In this essay, we investigate some relations between Chemical Reaction Networks (CRN) and Mathematical Epidemiology (ME) and report on several pleasant surprises which we had simply by putting these two topics together.   Firstly, we propose a definition of ME models as a subset of CRN models.   Secondly, we review a fundamental stability result for boundary points, known in ME as the NGM method since it replaces the investigation of the Jacobian by that of a matrix whose origins lie in probability (the theory of branching processes). This important result seems to be little known outside of ME; even in ME, it has not been made clear before that the method gets sometimes the right answer, even though the conditions of the NGM theorem are not all satisfied. Thus, beyond the theorem, there is a heuristic approach, the validity conditions for which are not sufficiently understood.   Thirdly, we show that some simple CRN models with absolute concentration robustness (ACR), are close qualitatively to simple ME models, in the sense that they have an unique disease free equilibrium, and a unique interior fixed point, and the latter enters the positive domain and becomes stable precisely when $R_0:=s_{dfe} \\mathcal{R}=\\frac{s_{dfe}}{s_e}>1.$   (where $s$ denotes the \"ACR species\"). Thus, for these \"ME type models\", a \"relay phenomena\" takes place: precisely when the DFE loses stability, a new fixed point enters the domain, and takes over.   Last but not least, we offer in the associated GitHub repository https://github.com/adhalanay/epidemiology_crns a Mathematica package, Epid-CRN, which is addressed to researchers of both disciplines, and provide illustrative notebooks, which in particular solve a few minor open ME and CRN problems. Our package may also be used to study easy cases of analogue continuous time Markov chain (CTMC) ME and CRN models.",

    "abstract": "$β$-arrestins play pivotal roles in seven transmembrane receptor (7TMR) signalling and trafficking. To study their functional role in the regulation of specific receptor systems, current research relies mainly on genetic tools, as few pharmacological options are available. To address this issue, we designed and synthesised a novel lipidated phosphomimetic peptide inhibitor targeting $β$-arrestins, called ARIP, which was developed based on the C-terminal tail (A343-S371) of the vasopressin V2 receptor. As the V2R sequence has been shown to bind $β$-arrestins with high affinity and stability, we added an N-terminal palmitate residue to allow membrane tethering and subsequent cell entry. Here, using BRET2-based biosensors, we demonstrated the ability of ARIP to inhibit agonist-induced $β$-arrestin recruitment on a series of 7TMRs belonging to class A (low stable associations with arrestins) or class B (high stability), with efficiencies that dependent on receptor type. In addition, we showed that ARIP was unable to recruit $β$-arrestins to the cell membrane by itself, and that it did not interfere with canonical G protein signalling. Molecular modelling studies also revealed that ARIP binds $β$-arrestins in the same way as V2Rpp, the phosphorylated peptide derived from the V2R C-terminal domain, and that replacing the p-Ser and p-Thr residues of V2Rpp with Glu residues does not alter the inhibitory activity of ARIP on $β$-arrestin recruitment. Importantly, ARIP exerted an opioid-sparing effect in vivo, as intrathecal injection of ARIP potentiated the analgesic effect of morphine in the tail-flick nociceptive model, a behavioural response consistent with $β$-arrestin genetic inhibition. ARIP therefore represents a promising pharmacological tool for investigating the fine-tuning roles of $β$-arrestins in 7TMR-driven pathophysiological processes.",

    "abstract": "Molecular property prediction (MPP) is integral to drug discovery and material science, but often faces the challenge of data scarcity in real-world scenarios. Addressing this, few-shot molecular property prediction (FSMPP) has been developed. Unlike other few-shot tasks, FSMPP typically employs a pre-trained molecular encoder and a context-aware classifier, benefiting from molecular pre-training and molecular context information. Despite these advancements, existing methods struggle with the ineffective fine-tuning of pre-trained encoders. We attribute this issue to the imbalance between the abundance of tunable parameters and the scarcity of labeled molecules, and the lack of contextual perceptiveness in the encoders. To overcome this hurdle, we propose a parameter-efficient in-context tuning method, named Pin-Tuning. Specifically, we propose a lightweight adapter for pre-trained message passing layers (MP-Adapter) and Bayesian weight consolidation for pre-trained atom/bond embedding layers (Emb-BWC), to achieve parameter-efficient tuning while preventing over-fitting and catastrophic forgetting. Additionally, we enhance the MP-Adapters with contextual perceptiveness. This innovation allows for in-context tuning of the pre-trained encoder, thereby improving its adaptability for specific FSMPP tasks. When evaluated on public datasets, our method demonstrates superior tuning with fewer trainable parameters, improving few-shot predictive performance.",

    "abstract": "Conventional histopathology has long been essential for disease diagnosis, relying on visual inspection of tissue sections. Immunohistochemistry aids in detecting specific biomarkers but is limited by its single-marker approach, restricting its ability to capture the full tissue environment. The advent of multiplexed imaging technologies, like multiplexed immunofluorescence and spatial transcriptomics, allows for simultaneous visualization of multiple biomarkers in a single section, enhancing morphological data with molecular and spatial information. This provides a more comprehensive view of the tissue microenvironment, cellular interactions, and disease mechanisms - crucial for understanding disease progression, prognosis, and treatment response. However, the extensive data from multiplexed imaging necessitates sophisticated computational methods for preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction, and spatial analysis. These tools are vital for managing large, multidimensional datasets, converting raw imaging data into actionable insights. By automating labor-intensive tasks and enhancing reproducibility and accuracy, computational tools are pivotal in diagnostics and research. This review explores the current landscape of multiplexed imaging in pathology, detailing workflows and key technologies like PathML, an AI-powered platform that streamlines image analysis, making complex dataset interpretation accessible for clinical and research settings.",

    "abstract": "Metabolite biosynthesis is regulated via metabolic pathways, which can be activated and deactivated within organisms. Understanding and identifying an organism's metabolic pathway network is a crucial aspect for various research fields, including crop and life stock breeding, pharmacology, and medicine. The problem of identifying whether a pathway is part of a studied metabolic system is commonly framed as a hyperlink prediction problem. The most important challenge in prediction of metabolic pathways is the sparsity of the labeled data. This challenge can partially be mitigated using metabolite correlation networks which are affected by all active pathways including those that were not confirmed yet in laboratory experiments. Unfortunately, extracting properties that can confirm or refute existence of a metabolic pathway in a particular organism is not a trivial task. In this research, we introduce the Network Auralization Hyperlink Prediction (NetAurHPD) which is a framework that relies on (1) graph auralization to extract and aggregate representations of nodes in metabolite correlation networks and (2) data augmentation method that generates metabolite correlation networks given a subset of chemical reactions defined as hyperlinks. Experiments with metabolites correlation-based networks of tomato pericarp demonstrate promising results for NetAurHPD, compared to alternative methods. Furthermore, the application of data augmentation improved NetAurHPD's learning capabilities and overall performance. Additionally, NetAurHPD outperformed state-of-the-art method in experiments under challenging conditions, and has the potential to be a valuable tool for exploring organisms with limited existing knowledge.",

Many current methods rely on single-cell velocity to obtain pseudotime, which can lead to inconsistencies between pseudotime and velocity. It is challenging to simultaneously infer cell pseudotime and gene interaction networks, especially in multi-branch differentiation scenarios. We present single-cell Piecewise Network (scPN), a novel high-dimensional dynamical modeling approach that iteratively extracts temporal patterns and inter-gene relationships from scRNA-seq data. To tackle multi-branch differentiation challenges, scPN models gene regulatory dynamics using piecewise gene-gene interaction networks, offering an interpretable framework for deciphering complex gene regulation patterns over time. Results on synthetic data and multiple scRNA-seq datasets demonstrate the superior performance of scPN in reconstructing cellular dynamics and identifying key transcription factors involved in development compared to existing methods. To the best of our knowledge, scPN is the first attempt at modeling that can recover pseudotime, velocity fields, and gene interactions all at once on multi-branch datasets.",

The complexity of molecular and cellular processes forces experimental studies to focus on subsystems. To study the functioning of biological systems across levels of structural and functional organisation, we require tools to compose and organise networks with different levels of detail and abstraction.   We address these challenges by introducing a category-theoretic formalism for biochemical processes visualised using SBGN Process Description (SBGN-PD) language. Using the theory of structured cospans, we construct a symmetric monoidal double category and demonstrate its horizontal 1-morphisms as SBGN Process Descriptions. We obtain organisational principles such as 'compositionality' (building a large SBGN-PD from smaller ones) and 'zooming-out' (abstracting away details in biochemical processes) defined in category-theoretic terms. We also formally investigate how a particular portion of a biochemical network influences the remaining portion of the network and vice versa. Throughout the paper, we illustrate our findings using standard SBGN-PD examples.",

    "abstract": "Antiterminators are essential components of bacterial transcriptional regulation, allowing the control of gene expression in response to fluctuating environmental conditions. RNA-binding antiterminators are particularly important regulatory proteins that play a significant role in preventing transcription termination by binding to specific RNA sequences. These RNA-binding antiterminators have been extensively studied for their roles in regulating various metabolic pathways. However, their role in modulating the physiology of pathogens requires further investigations. This review focuses on these RNA-binding proteins in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, particularly on their structures, mechanism of action, and target genes. Additionally, the involvement of the antitermination mechanisms in bacterial pathogenicity will be discussed. This knowledge is crucial for understanding the regulatory mechanisms that govern bacterial pathogenicity, opening up exciting prospects for future research, and potentially new alternative strategies to fight against infectious diseases.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the origins of complexity is a fundamental challenge with implications for biological and technological systems. Network theory emerges as a powerful tool to model complex systems. Networks are an intuitive framework to represent inter-dependencies among many system components, facilitating the study of both local and global properties. However, it is unclear whether we can define a universal theoretical framework for evolving networks. While basic growth mechanisms, like preferential attachment, recapitulate common properties such as the power-law degree distribution, they fall short in capturing other system-specific properties. Tinkering, on the other hand, has shown to be very successful in generating modular or nested structures \"for-free\", highlighting the role of internal, non-adaptive mechanisms in the evolution of complexity. Different network extensions, like hypergraphs, have been recently developed to integrate exogenous factors in evolutionary models, as pairwise interactions are insufficient to capture environmentally-mediated species associations. As we confront global societal and climatic challenges, the study of network and hypergraphs provides valuable insights, emphasizing the importance of scientific exploration in understanding and managing complexity.",

    "abstract": "In the modelling of stochastic phenomena, such as quasi-reaction systems, parameter estimation of kinetic rates can be challenging, particularly when the time gap between consecutive measurements is large. Local linear approximation approaches account for the stochasticity in the system but fail to capture the nonlinear nature of the underlying process. At the mean level, the dynamics of the system can be described by a system of ODEs, which have an explicit solution only for simple unitary systems. An analytical solution for generic quasi-reaction systems is proposed via a first order Taylor approximation of the hazard rate. This allows a nonlinear forward prediction of the future dynamics given the current state of the system. Predictions and corresponding observations are embedded in a nonlinear least-squares approach for parameter estimation. The performance of the algorithm is compared to existing SDE and ODE-based methods via a simulation study. Besides the increased computational efficiency of the approach, the results show an improvement in the kinetic rate estimation, particularly for data observed at large time intervals. Additionally, the availability of an explicit solution makes the method robust to stiffness, which is often present in biological systems. An illustration on Rhesus Macaque data shows the applicability of the approach to the study of cell differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Through experimental studies, many details of the pathway of integrin $α_{\\rm IIb}β_3$ activation by ADP during the platelet aggregation process have been mapped out. ADP binds to two separate G protein coupled receptors on platelet surfaces, leading to alterations in the regulation of the small GTPase RAP1. We seek to (1) gain insights into the relative contributions of both pathways to RAP1-mediated integrin activation and to (2) predict wildtype and mutated cell behavior in response to a continuous range of external agonist concentrations. To this end, we develop a dynamical systems model detailing the action of each protein in the two pathways up to the regulation of RAP1. We perform a parameter estimation using flow cytometry data to determine a number of unknown rate constants. We then validate with already published data; in particular, the model confirmed the effect of impaired P2Y$_1$ receptor desensitization or reduced RASA3 expression on RAP1 activation. We then predict the effect of protein expression levels on integrin activation and show that components of the P2Y$_{12}$ pathway are critical to the regulation of integrin. This model aids in our understanding of interindividual variability in platelet response to ADP and therapeutic P2Y$_{12}$ inhibition. It also provides a more detailed view of platelet activation in the ongoing mathematical study of platelet aggregation.",

A fundamental question is whether the cell follows the cue prioritized by its internal signaling network or the cue that carries the most external information. We introduce a theoretical framework to answer this question. We derive information limits for four types of directional cues: external and self-generated chemical gradients, fluid flow, and contact inhibition of locomotion. When the cues compete as pairs, these limits predict which cue a cell should follow if its decision is based on environmental information alone. We compare these predicted decision boundaries with data from our and others' cell migration experiments, finding cases where the boundary is obeyed and cases where it is violated by orders of magnitude. Both outcomes are informative, and we find that they rationalize known properties, or predict putative properties, of cells' internal signaling networks. Our work introduces a physical framework to quantify the degree to which a cell acts like an autonomous agent, rather than a passive detector, favoring a cue even when it is less informative.",

    "abstract": "Artificial neural networks (NNs) can be implemented using chemical reaction networks (CRNs), where the concentrations of species act as inputs and outputs. In such biochemical computing, noise-robust computing is crucial due to the intrinsic and extrinsic noise present in chemical reactions. Previously suggested CRNs for feed-forward networks often utilized the rectified linear unit (ReLU) or discrete activation functions. However, one concern in this case is the discontinuities of the derivatives of those non-smooth functions, which can cause significant noise disruption during backpropagation. In this study, we propose a CRN that performs both feed-forward and training processes using smooth activation functions to avoid discontinuities in the backpropagation. All reactions occur in a single pot, and the reactions for training are bimolecular. Our case studies on XOR, Iris, MNIST datasets, and a non-linear regression model demonstrate that computation via the CRN (i) maintains accuracy despite noise in the reaction rates and the concentration of species and (ii) is insensitive to the choice of the running time and the magnitude of the noise in comparison to NNs with a non-smooth activation function. This work presents a noise-robust CRN for full NN computation, including backpropagation, paving the way for more stable and efficient biochemical computing systems.",

However, biological gene-regulatory pathways are more complex than simple Turing activator-inhibitor models and generally do not require fine-tuning of parameters as dictated by the Turing conditions. To address these issues, we employ random matrix theory to analyze the Jacobian matrices of larger networks with robust statistical properties. Our analysis reveals that Turing patterns are more likely to occur by chance than previously thought and that the most robust Turing networks have an optimal size, surprisingly consisting only of a handful of molecular species, thus significantly increasing their identifiability in biological systems. This optimal size emerges from a tradeoff between the highest stability in small networks and the greatest instability with diffusion in large networks. Furthermore, we find that with multiple immobile nodes, differential diffusion ceases to be important for Turing patterns. Our findings may inform future synthetic biology approaches and provide insights into bridging the gap to complex developmental pathways.",

These models formulate the reaction dynamics as Continuous-Time Markov Chains (CTMCs) whose propensities are parameterized by a vector $θ$ and parameter sensitivities are introduced as derivatives of their expected outputs with respect to components of the parameter vector. Sensitivities characterise key properties of the output like robustness and are also at the heart of numerically efficient optimisation routines like Newton-type algorithms used in parameter inference and the design of of control mechanisms. Currently the only unbiased estimator for second-order sensitivities is based on the Girsanov transform and it often suffers from high estimator variance. We develop a novel estimator for second-order sensitivities by first rigorously deriving an integral representation of these sensitivities. We call the resulting method the Double Bernoulli Path Algorithm and illustrate its efficiency through numerical examples.",

Among these channels are both protein systems that process oxidative stress, such as the 2-Cys peroxiredoxin-thioredoxin system (PTRS), as well as changes in transcriptional activity that target outcomes such as growth, damage control and repair, or cell death. Recent work has revealed connections between the PTRS and temporal phases of transcriptional activity involving famous transcription factors like p53 and FOXO1. To examine potential mechanisms for these connections, we implement an existing dynamical systems mathematical model for the PTRS. We hypothesize that dose-dependent hyperoxidation events enact ultrasensitive switches by which the PTRS can categorize stress severity and activate appropriate transcriptional responses. Using numerical simulations of the PTRS in human cells, we provide a proof of principle for staggered, switchlike hyperoxidation of peroxiredoxins (Prx) as well as an underlying mechanism requiring simultaneous signaling by Prx I and II. Then, we use our model to make testable predictions about individual Prx knockouts as well as the affinity for hydrogen peroxide of Prx across oxidation states. This study provides direction for future experimental work and sheds light into the mechanisms underlying oxidative stress response in human cells.",

However, the development of networks science urged us to fathom the systematic architecture of biological networks and their evolutionary advantages. We found the dissipation of biological dissipative networks is highly related to their structure. By interrogating these well-adapted networks, we find that the energy producing module is relatively isolated in all situations. We applied evolutionary simulation and analysis on premature networks of classic dissipative networks, namely kinetic proofreading, activator-inhibitor oscillator and two typical adaptative response models. We found despite that selection was imposed merely on the network function, the networks tended to decouple high energy molecules as fuels from the functional module, to achieve higher overall dissipation during the course of evolution. Furthermore, we find that decoupled fuel modules can increase the robustness of the networks towards parameter or structure perturbations. We provide theoretical analysis on the kinetic proofreading networks and the general case of energy-driven networks. We find fuel decoupling can guarantee higher dissipation and, in most cases when considering dissipative networks, higher performance. We conclude that fuel decoupling is an evolutionary outcome and bears benefits during evolution.",

Our approach is a data-driven modeling workflow using a physics-informed machine learning algorithm to train a non-linear mathematical model for interpreting gene expression dynamics and to lead discovery for protein regulators using redox proteome analysis. We distinguish light-responsive elements within central carbon metabolism pathways from independent variables like circadian time using the publicly available transcriptome datasets of Synechococcus elongatus over diel cycles responding to light perturbations. Our approach provides interpretable de novo models for elucidating events of reactions in complex regulatory pathways in response to stressful disturbance from the environment. We discovered protein regulators in response to light disturbance in the proteome analysis involving shifts in protein abundance as well as cysteine redox states under constant illumination and after two hours of darkness. We discovered significant shifts in cysteine redox states in regulatory proteins such as transcription sigma factors and metabolic enzymes in the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway and the Calvin-Benson cycle, while the changes in their protein abundance were minimal. These results indicate that regulatory dynamics in reductant generation link photo-induced electron transport pathways and redox metabolic pathways with circadian rhythms through fast redox-induced conformational changes or slow expression regulations across networks.",

    "abstract": "Asynchronous Boolean networks are a type of discrete dynamical system in which each variable can take one of two states, and a single variable state is updated in each time step according to pre-selected rules. Boolean networks are popular in systems biology due to their ability to model long-term biological phenotypes within a qualitative, predictive framework. Boolean networks model phenotypes as attractors, which are closely linked to minimal trap spaces (inescapable hypercubes in the system's state space). In biological applications, attractors and minimal trap spaces are typically in one-to-one correspondence. However, this correspondence is not guaranteed: motif-avoidant attractors (MAAs) that lie outside minimal trap spaces are possible.   MAAs are rare and (despite recent efforts) poorly understood. Here we summarize the current state of knowledge regarding MAAs and present several novel observations regarding their response to node deletion reductions and linear extensions of edges. We conduct large-scale computational studies on an ensemble of 14,000 models derived from published Boolean models of biological systems, and more than 100 million Random Boolean Networks. Our findings quantify the rarity of MAAs (in particular, we found no MAAs in the biological models), but highlight the role of network reduction in introducing MAAs into the dynamics. We also show that MAAs are fragile to linear extensions: in sparse networks, even a single linear node can disrupt virtually all MAAs. Motivated by this observation, we improve the upper bound on the number of delays needed to disrupt a motif-avoidant attractor.",

    "abstract": "In this study, the predominant lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolates were obtained from Gouda, Jack, Cheddar, and Parmesan cheeses produced in Uganda. The isolates were identified through Gram staining, catalase and oxidase tests, and 16S rDNA sequencing. Approximately 90% of the isolates were cocci (n=192), including Streptococcus, Enterococcus, and Lactococcus. The remaining 10% were identified as rod-shaped bacteria, primarily belonging to the Lactobacillus species (n=23). BLAST analysis revealed that Pediococcus pentosaceus dominated in all cheese samples (23.7%, of the total 114 isolates). This was followed by uncultured bacterium (15.8%), uncultured Pediococcus species (13.2%), Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus (8.8%) among others",

    "abstract": "Identifying driver genes is crucial for understanding oncogenesis and developing targeted cancer therapies. Driver discovery methods using protein or pathway networks rely on traditional network science measures, focusing on nodes, edges, or community metrics. These methods can overlook the high-dimensional interactions that cancer genes have within cancer networks. This study presents a novel method using Persistent Homology to analyze the role of driver genes in higher-order structures within Cancer Consensus Networks derived from main cellular pathways. We integrate mutation data from six cancer types and three biological functions: DNA Repair, Chromatin Organization, and Programmed Cell Death. We systematically evaluated the impact of gene removal on topological voids ($β_2$ structures) within the Cancer Consensus Networks. Our results reveal that only known driver genes and cancer-associated genes influence these structures, while passenger genes do not. Although centrality measures alone proved insufficient to fully characterize impact genes, combining higher-order topological analysis with traditional network metrics can improve the precision of distinguishing between drivers and passengers. This work shows that cancer genes play an important role in higher-order structures, going beyond pairwise measures, and provides an approach to distinguish drivers and cancer-associated genes from passenger genes.",

    "abstract": "Motivation   Network visualization is critical for effective communication in various fields of knowledge. Currently, a gap separates network manipulation from network visualization in programming environments. Users often export network data to be laid out in external interactive software, like Cytoscape and Gephi. We argue the current R package ecosystem lacks an interactive layout engine well integrated with common data analysis workflows.   Results   We present easylayout, an R package that bridges network manipulation and visualization by leveraging interactive force simulations within the IDE itself (e.g., RStudio, VSCode). It is not yet another visualization library, but instead aims to interconnect existing libraries and streamline their usage into the R ecosystem. easylayout takes an igraph object and serializes it into a web application integrated with the IDE's interface through a Shiny server. The app lays out the network by simulating attraction and repulsion forces. Simulation parameters can be adjusted in real-time. An editing mode allows moving and rotating nodes. The implementation aims for performance, so that even lower-end devices are able to work with relatively large networks. Once the user finishes tweaking the layout, it is sent back to the R session to be plotted through popular libraries like ggraph, igraph or even the base package itself. The current implementation focuses on the R ecosystem, but using web technologies makes it easily portable to similar environments, like Python/Jupyter Notebooks. We expect this tool to reduce the time spent searching for suitable network layouts, ultimately allowing researchers to generate more compelling figures.

    "abstract": "Controlling the stochastic dynamics of biological populations is a challenge that arises across various biological contexts. However, these dynamics are inherently nonlinear and involve a discrete state space, i.e., the number of molecules, cells, or organisms. Additionally, the possibility of extinction has a significant impact on both dynamics and control strategies, particularly when the population size is small. These factors hamper the direct application of conventional control theories to biological systems. To address these challenges, we formulate the optimal control problem for stochastic population dynamics by utilizing control cost functions based on the f-divergence, which naturally accounts for population-specific factors. If Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence is adopted for the cost function, the complex nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation is simplified into a linear form, facilitating efficient computation of optimal solutions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to the control of interacting random walkers, Moran processes, and SIR models, and observe the mode-switching phenomena in the control strategies. Our approach provides new opportunities for applying control theory to a wide range of biological problems.",

    "abstract": "Stochastic fluctuations of molecular abundances are a ubiquitous feature of cellular processes and lead to significant cell-to-cell variability. Recent theoretical work established lower bounds for stochastic fluctuations in cells for broad classes of cellular processes by analyzing the dynamics of reaction motifs that are embedded within a larger network with arbitrary interactions and dynamics. For example, a class of generalized assembly processes in which two co-regulated subunits irreversibly form a complex was shown to exhibit an unavoidable trade-off between assembly efficiency and subunit fluctuations: Regardless of rate constants and details of feedback control, subunit fluctuations were shown to diverge as the assembly efficiency approaches 100%. In contrast, other work has reported how efficient assembly processes work as stochastic noise filters or can achieve robust adaptation through integral control. While all of these results are technically correct their seemingly contradictory conclusions raise the question of how broadly applicable the previously reported efficiency-fluctuation trade-off is. Here, we show that a much broader class of assembly processes than previously considered is subject to an efficiency-fluctuation trade-off which diverges in the high efficiency regime. We find the proposed noise filtering property of efficient assembly processes corresponds to a singular limit of this class of systems. Additionally, we show that combining feedback control with distinct subunit synthesis rates is a necessary condition to overcome the generalized efficiency-fluctuation trade-off. Through numerical examples, we show that biomolecular integral controllers are one of several realizations of such control. How small a change to joint subunit control is sufficient to avoid diverging fluctuations in the high-efficiency limit remains an open question.",

This general duplication-divergence model includes a new coupled divergence asymmetry rate, which allows to obtain the structure of random growing networks by duplication-divergence in a continuous range of configurations between two known limit cases (i) complete asymmetric divergence, i.e., divergence rates affect only edges of either the original or the copy vertex, and (ii) symmetric divergence, i.e., divergence rates affect equiprobably both the original and the copy vertex. Multiple connected sub-graphs (of order greater than one) (of order greater than one) emerge as the divergence asymmetry rate slightly moves from the complete asymmetric divergence case. Mean-field results of priorly published models are nicely reproduced by this generalization. In special cases, the connected components size distribution $C_s$ suggests a power-law scaling of the form $C_s \\sim s^{-λ}$ for $s>1$, e.g., with $λ\\approx 5/3$ for divergence rate $δ\\approx 0.7$.",

    "abstract": "Incomplete knowledge of metabolic processes hinders the accuracy of GEnome-scale Metabolic models (GEMs), which in turn impedes advancements in systems biology and metabolic engineering. Existing gap-filling methods typically rely on phenotypic data to minimize the disparity between computational predictions and experimental results. However, there is still a lack of an automatic and precise gap-filling method for initial state GEMs before experimental data and annotated genomes become available. In this study, we introduce CLOSEgaps, a deep learning-driven tool that addresses the gap-filling issue by modeling it as a hyperedge prediction problem within GEMs. Specifically, CLOSEgaps maps metabolic networks as hypergraphs and learns their hyper-topology features to identify missing reactions and gaps by leveraging hypothetical reactions. This innovative approach allows for the characterization and curation of both known and hypothetical reactions within metabolic networks. Extensive results demonstrate that CLOSEgaps accurately gap-filling over 96% of artificially introduced gaps for various GEMs. Furthermore, CLOSEgaps enhances phenotypic predictions for 24 GEMs and also finds a notable improvement in producing four crucial metabolites (Lactate, Ethanol, Propionate, and Succinate) in two organisms. As a broadly applicable solution for any GEM, CLOSEgaps represents a promising model to automate the gap-filling process and uncover missing connections between reactions and observed metabolic phenotypes.",

A vast majority of TFs (770 of 716; 98%) comprising protein constituents of these networks appear to share common Gene Ontology (GO) features of sequence-specific double-stranded DNA binding (GO: 1990837). Genome-wide and individual chromosome-level analyses of 17,935 ATAC-seq-defined brain development regulatory regions (BDRRs) revealed nearly universal representations of TFBS for TF-constituents of these networks, TFBS densities of which appear consistently higher within thousands BDRRs of Modern Humans compare to Chimpanzee. Transposable elements (TE), including LTR/HERV, SINE/Alu, SVA, and LINE families, appear to harbor and spread genome-wide consensus regulatory nodes of identified herein highly conserved sequence-specific double-stranded DNA binding networks, selections of TFBS panels of which manifest individual chromosome-specific profiles and species-specific divergence patterns.

However, the emergence of loads on the key molecular resources constituting CRISPRa by the orthogonal short RNA that guide such resources to gene targets, couple theoretically independent CRISPRa modules. This coupling negates the ability of CRISPRa systems to concurrently regulate multiple genes independent of one another. In this paper, we propose to reduce this coupling by mitigating the loads on the molecular resources that constitute CRISPRa. In particular, we design a multi-variable controller that makes the concentration of these molecular resources robust to variations in the level of the short RNA loads.

Any mass action network gives rise to a parameterised family of polynomial equations whose positive solutions are the positive equilibria of the network. Here, we start by deriving alternative systems of equations, whose solutions are in smooth, one-to-one correspondence with positive equilibria of the network, and capture degeneracy or nondegeneracy of the corresponding equilibria. The derivation leads us to consider partitions of networks in a natural sense, and we explore the implications of choosing different partitions. The alternative systems are often simpler than the original mass action equations, sometimes giving explicit parameterisations of positive equilibria, and allowing us to rapidly identify various algebraic and geometric properties of the positive equilibrium set, including toricity and local toricity. We can use the approaches we develop to bound the number of positive nondegenerate equilibria on stoichiometric classes; to derive semialgebraic descriptions of the parameter regions for multistationarity; and to study bifurcations. We present the main construction, various consequences for particular classes of networks, and numerous examples. We also develop additional techniques specifically for quadratic networks, the most common class of networks in applications, and use these techniques to derive strengthened results for quadratic networks.",

    "abstract": "Epigenetics plays a key role in cellular differentiation and maintaining cell identity, enabling cells to regulate their genetic activity without altering the DNA sequence. Epigenetic regulation occurs within the context of hierarchically folded chromatin, yet the interplay between the dynamics of epigenetic modifications and chromatin architecture remains poorly understood. In addition, it remains unclear what mechanisms drive the formation of rugged epigenetic patterns, characterised by alternating genomic regions enriched in activating and repressive marks. In this study, we focus on post-translational modifications of histone H3 tails, particularly H3K27me3, H3K4me3, and H3K27ac. We introduce a mesoscopic stochastic model that incorporates chromatin architecture and competition of histone-modifying enzymes into the dynamics of epigenetic modifications in small genomic loci comprising several nucleosomes. Our approach enables us to investigate the mechanisms by which epigenetic patterns form on larger scales of chromatin organisation, such as loops and domains. Through bifurcation analysis and stochastic simulations, we demonstrate that the model can reproduce uniform chromatin states (open, closed, and bivalent) and generate previously unexplored rugged profiles. Our results suggest that enzyme competition and chromatin conformations with high-frequency interactions between distant genomic loci can drive the emergence of rugged epigenetic landscapes. Additionally, we hypothesise that bivalent chromatin can act as an intermediate state, facilitating transitions between uniform and rugged landscapes. This work offers a powerful mathematical framework for understanding the dynamic interactions between chromatin architecture and epigenetic regulation, providing new insights into the formation of complex epigenetic patterns.",

We first disentangle the circadian clock behavior from the bacterial cold shock response by identifying a sequence of \"death steps\" based on cellular indicators. By analyzing only \"alive\" tracks, we show that the dynamic response of individual oscillatory tracks to a step-down temperature signal is described by a simple Stuart-Landau oscillator model. The same dynamical analysis applied to in vitro data (KaiC phosphorylation level following a temperature step-down) allows for extracting and comparing both clock's responses to a temperature step down. It appears, therefore, that both oscillators go through a similar supercritical Hopf bifurcation. Finally, to quantitatively describe the temperature dependence of the resulting in vivo and in vitro Stuart-Landau parameters $μ(T)$ and $ω_c(T)$, we propose two simplified analytical models: temperature-dependent positive feedback or time-delayed negative feedback that is temperature compensated. Our results provide strong constraints for future models and emphasize the importance of studying transitory regimes along temperature effects in circadian systems.",

    "abstract": "Reaction networks have been widely used as generic models in diverse areas of applied science, such as biology, chemistry, ecology, epidemiology, and computer science. Reaction networks incorporating noisy effect are modelled as continuous time Markov chains (CTMC), and are called stochastic reaction systems. Non-explosivity is a concept that characterizes regularity of CTMCs. In this paper, we study non-explosivity of stochastic reaction systems, in the sense of their underlying CTMCs. By constructing a simple linear Lyapunov function, we obtain non-explosivity for a class of endotactic stochastic reaction systems containing second-order endotactic stochastic mass-action systems as a subset. As a consequence, we prove that every bimolecular weakly reversible stochastic mass-action system is non-explosive. We apply our results to diverse models in biochemistry, epidemiology, ecology, and synthetic biology in the literature.",

    "abstract": "Irreversibility, in which a transient perturbation leaves a system in a new state, is an emergent property in systems of interacting entities. This property has well-established implications in statistical physics but remains underexplored in biological networks, especially for bacteria and other prokaryotes whose regulation of gene expression occurs predominantly at the transcriptional level. Focusing on the reconstructed regulatory network of \\emph{Escherichia coli}, we examine network responses to transient single-gene perturbations. We predict irreversibility in numerous cases and find that the incidence of irreversibility increases with the proximity of the perturbed gene to positive circuits in the network. Comparison with experimental data suggests a connection between the predicted irreversibility to transient perturbations and the evolutionary response to permanent perturbations.",

    "abstract": "Molecular communication (MC) within the synaptic cleft is vital for neurotransmitter diffusion, a process critical to cognitive functions. In Alzheimer's Disease (AD), beta-amyloid oligomers (A$β$os) disrupt this communication, leading to synaptic dysfunction. This paper investigates the molecular interactions between glutamate, a key neurotransmitter, and A$β$os within the synaptic cleft, aiming to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of this disruption. Through stochastic modeling, we simulate the dynamics of A$β$os and their impact on glutamate diffusion. The findings, validated by comparing simulated results with existing experimental data, demonstrate that A$β$os serve as physical obstacles, hindering glutamate movement and increasing collision frequency. This impairment of synaptic transmission and long-term potentiation (LTP) by binding to receptors on the postsynaptic membrane is further validated against known molecular interaction behaviors observed in similar neurodegenerative contexts. The study also explores potential therapeutic strategies to mitigate these disruptions. By enhancing our understanding of these molecular interactions, this research contributes to the development of more effective treatments for AD, with the ultimate goal of alleviating synaptic impairments associated with the disease.",

We consider the FTP distribution in nonlinear stochastic biochemical networks, where obtaining exact solutions of the distribution is a challenging problem. Even simple two-particle collisions cause strong nonlinearities that hinder the theoretical determination of the full FPT distribution. Previous research has either focused on analyzing the mean FPT, which provides limited information about a system, or has considered time-consuming stochastic simulations that do not clearly expose causal relationships between parameters and the system's dynamics. This paper presents the first exact theoretical solution of the full FPT distribution in a broad class of chemical reaction networks involving $A + B \\rightarrow C$ type of second-order reactions. Our exact theoretical method outperforms stochastic simulations, in terms of computational efficiency, and deviates from approximate analytical solutions. Given the prevalence of bimolecular reactions in biochemical systems, our approach has the potential to enhance the understanding of real-world biochemical processes.",

We theoretically explores the possible relevance of waveform distortions in circadian gene-protein dynamics to the temperature compensation and synchronization. Our analysis of the Goodwin model provides a coherent explanation of most of temperature compensation hypotheses. Using the renormalization group method, we analytically demonstrate that the decreasing phase of circadian protein oscillations should lengthen with increasing temperature, leading to waveform distortions to maintain a stable period. This waveform-period correlation also occurs in other oscillators like Lotka-Volterra and van der Pol models. A reanalysis of known data nicely confirms our findings on waveform distortion and its impact on synchronization range. Thus we conclude that circadian rhythm waveforms are fundamental to both temperature compensation and synchronization.",

A widely used measure to quantify this information flow is the transfer entropy. However, until now, this quantity could only be obtained in dynamical models using approximations that are typically uncontrolled. Here we introduce a computational algorithm called Transfer Entropy-Path Weight Sampling (TE-PWS), which makes it possible, for the first time, to quantify the transfer entropy and its variants exactly for any stochastic model, including those with multiple hidden variables, nonlinearity, transient conditions, and feedback. By leveraging techniques from polymer and path sampling, TE-PWS efficiently computes the transfer entropy as a Monte-Carlo average over signal trajectory space. We use our exact technique to demonstrate that commonly used approximate methods to compute transfer entropies incur large systematic errors and high computational costs. As an application, we use TE-PWS in linear and nonlinear systems to reveal how transfer entropy can overcome naive applications of the data processing inequality in the presence of feedback.",

    "abstract": "The formation, dissolution, and dynamics of multi-particle complexes is of fundamental interest in the study of stochastic chemical systems. In 1976, Masao Doi introduced a Fock space formalism for modeling classical particles. Doi's formalism, however, does not support the assembly of multiple particles into complexes. Starting in the 2000's, multiple groups developed rule-based methods for computationally simulating biochemical systems involving large macromolecular complexes. However, these methods are based on graph-rewriting rules and/or process algebras that are mathematically disconnected from the statistical physics methods generally used to analyze equilibrium and nonequilibrium systems. Here we bridge these two approaches by introducing an operator algebra for the rule-based modeling of multi-particle complexes. Our formalism is based on a Fock space that supports not only the creation and annihilation of classical particles, but also the assembly of multiple particles into complexes, as well as the disassembly of complexes into their components. Rules are specified by algebraic operators that act on particles through a manifestation of Wick's theorem. We further describe diagrammatic methods that facilitate rule specification and analytic calculations. We demonstrate our formalism on systems in and out of thermal equilibrium, and for nonequilibrium systems we present a stochastic simulation algorithm based on our formalism. The results provide a unified approach to the mathematical and computational study of stochastic chemical systems in which multi-particle complexes play an important role.",

In this study, we propose RGDA-DDI, a residual graph attention network (residual-GAT) and dual-attention based framework for drug-drug interaction prediction. A residual-GAT module is introduced to simultaneously learn multi-scale feature representations from drugs and DDPs. In addition, a dual-attention based feature fusion block is constructed to learn local joint interaction representations. A series of evaluation metrics demonstrate that the RGDA-DDI significantly improved DDI prediction performance on two public benchmark datasets, which provides a new insight into drug development.",

    "abstract": "Living cells inherently exhibit the ability to spontaneously reorganize their structures in response to changes in both their internal and external environments. Among these responses, the organization of stress fibers composed of actin molecules changes in direct accordance with the mechanical stiffness of their environments. On soft substrates, SFs are rarely formed, but as stiffness increases, they emerge with random orientation, progressively align, and eventually form thicker bundles as stiffness surpasses successive thresholds. These transformations share similarities with phase transitions studied in condensed matter physics, yet despite extensive research on cellular dynamics, the introduction of the statistical mechanics perspective to the environmental dependence of intracellular structures remains underexplored. With this physical framework, we identify key relationships governing these intracellular transitions, highlighting the delicate balance between energy and entropy. Our analysis provides a unified understanding of the stepwise phase transitions of actin structures, offering new insights into related biological mechanisms. Notably, our study suggests the existence of mechanical checkpoints in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, which sequentially regulate the formation of intracellular structures to ensure proper cell cycle progression.",

    "abstract": "Fluctuations are inherent to biological systems, arising from the stochastic nature of molecular interactions, and influence various aspects of system behavior, stability, and robustness. These fluctuations can be categorized as intrinsic, stemming from the system's inherent structure and dynamics, and extrinsic, arising from external factors, such as temperature variations. Understanding the interplay between these fluctuations is crucial for obtaining a comprehensive understanding of biological phenomena. However, studying these effects poses significant computational challenges. In this study, we used an underexplored methodology to analyze the effect of extrinsic fluctuations in stochastic systems using ordinary differential equations instead of solving the Master Equation with stochastic parameters. By incorporating temperature fluctuations into reaction rates, we explored the impact of extrinsic factors on system dynamics. We constructed a master equation and calculated the equations for the dynamics of the first two moments, offering computational efficiency compared with directly solving the chemical master equation. We applied this approach to analyze a biological oscillator, focusing on the p53 model and its response to temperature-induced extrinsic fluctuations. Our findings underscore the impact of extrinsic fluctuations on the nature of oscillations in biological systems, with alterations in oscillatory behavior depending on the characteristics of extrinsic fluctuations. We observed an increased oscillation amplitude and frequency of the p53 concentration cycle. This study provides valuable insights into the effects of extrinsic fluctuations on biological oscillations and highlights the importance of considering them in more complex systems to prevent unwanted scenarios related to health issues.",

Motivated by the extensive work on computational methods for parametric sensitivity analysis in the context of stochastic reaction networks over the past few decades, we provide a number of methods in the basic RNIC setting. Provided methods include the (unbiased) Girsanov transformation method (also called the Likelihood Ratio method) and a number of coupling methods for the implementation of finite differences, each motivated by methods from previous work related to stochastic reaction networks. We provide several numerical examples comparing the various methods in the new setting.

Identification of TCM targets is essential to elucidate the chemical basis and mechanisms of TCM for treating diseases. Given the chemical complexity of TCM, both in silico high-throughput drug-target interaction predicting models and biological profile-based methods have been commonly applied for identifying TCM targets based on the structural information of TCM chemical components and biological information, respectively. However, the existing methods lack the integration of TCM chemical and biological information, resulting in difficulty in the systematic discovery of TCM action pathways. To solve this problem, we propose a novel target identification model NP-TCMtarget to explore the TCM target path by combining the overall chemical and biological profiles. First, NP-TCMtarget infers TCM effect targets by calculating associations between drug/disease inducible gene expression profiles and specific gene signatures for 8,233 targets. Then, NP-TCMtarget utilizes a constructed binary classification model to predict binding targets of herbal ingredients. Finally, we can distinguish TCM direct and indirect targets by comparing the effect targets and binding targets to establish the action pathways of herbal components-direct targets-indirect targets by mapping TCM targets in the biological molecular network. We apply NP-TCMtarget to the formula XiaoKeAn to demonstrate the power of revealing the action pathways of herbal formula. We expect that this novel model could provide a systematic framework for exploring the molecular mechanisms of TCM at the target level.

    "abstract": "The description of gene interactions that constantly occur in the cellular environment is an extremely challenging task due to an immense number of degrees of freedom and incomplete knowledge about microscopic details. Hence, a coarse-grained and rather powerful modeling of such dynamics is provided by Boolean Networks (BNs). BNs are dynamical systems composed of Boolean agents and a record of their possible interactions over time. Stable states in these systems are called attractors which are closely related to the cellular expression of biological phenotypes. Identifying the full set of attractors is, therefore, of substantial biological interest. However, for conventional high-performance computing, this problem is plagued by an exponential growth of the dynamic state space. Here, we demonstrate a novel quantum search algorithm inspired by Grover's algorithm to be implemented on quantum computing platforms. The algorithm performs an iterative suppression of states belonging to basins of previously discovered attractors from a uniform superposition, thus increasing the amplitudes of states in basins of yet unknown attractors. This approach guarantees that a new attractor state is measured with each iteration of the algorithm, an optimization not currently achieved by any other algorithm in the literature. Tests of its resistance to noise have also shown promising performance on devices from the current Noise Intermediate Scale Quantum Computing (NISQ) era.",

In this study, we propose a novel approach incorporating distal genetic variants acting through gene regulatory networks (GRNs) into gene expression prediction models, in line with the omnigenic model of complex trait inheritance. Using causal and coexpression GRNs reconstructed from genomic and transcriptomic data and modeling the data as a Bayesian network jointly over genetic variants and genes, inference of gene expression from observed genotypic data is achieved through a two-step process. Initially, the expression level of each gene in the network is predicted using its local genetic variants. The residuals, calculated as the differences between the observed and predicted expression levels, are then modeled using the genotype information of parent and/or grandparent nodes in the GRN. The final predicted expression level of the gene is obtained by summing the predictions from the local variants model and the residual model, effectively incorporating both local and distal genetic influences. Using various regularized regression techniques for parameter estimation, we found that GRN-based gene expression prediction outperformed the traditional local-variant approach on simulated data from the DREAM5 Systems Genetics Challenge and real data from the Geuvadis study and an eQTL mapping study in yeast. This study provides important insights into the challenge of gene expression prediction for TWAS. It reaffirms the importance of GRNs for understanding the genetic effects on gene expression and complex traits more generally.",

However, evolutionary divergence between humans and research organisms hinders effective knowledge transfer across species. Here, we review state-of-the-art methods for computationally transferring knowledge across species, primarily focusing on methods that utilize transcriptome data and/or molecular networks. Our review addresses four key areas: (1) transferring disease and gene annotation knowledge across species, (2) identifying functionally equivalent molecular components, (3) inferring equivalent perturbed genes or gene sets, and (4) identifying equivalent cell types. We conclude with an outlook on future directions and several key challenges that remain in cross-species knowledge transfer, including introducing the concept of \"agnology\" to describe functional equivalence of biological entities, regardless of their evolutionary origins. This concept is becoming pervasive in integrative data-driven models where evolutionary origins of functions can remain unresolved.",

Current approaches to analyze these experiments involve clustering or low-dimensional projections. Here we use the principle of maximum entropy to obtain a probabilistic description that captures the observed presence or absence of mRNAs from hundreds of genes in cells from the mammalian brain. We construct the Ising model compatible with experimental means and pairwise correlations, and validate it by showing that it gives good predictions for higher-order statistics. We notice that the probability distribution of cell states has many local maxima. By labeling cell states according to the associated maximum, we obtain a cell classification that agrees well with previous results that use traditional clustering techniques. Our results provide quantitative descriptions of gene expression statistics and interpretable criteria for defining cell classes, supporting the hypothesis that cell classes emerge from the collective interaction of gene expression levels.",

    "abstract": "We prove that nested canalizing functions are the minimum-sensitivity Boolean functions for any activity ratio and we determine the functional form of this boundary which has a nontrivial fractal structure. We further observe that the majority of the gene regulatory functions found in known biological networks (submitted to the Cell Collective database) lie on the line of minimum sensitivity which paradoxically remains largely in the unstable regime. Our results provide a quantitative basis for the argument that an evolutionary preference for nested canalizing functions in gene regulation (e.g., for higher robustness) and for elasticity of gene activity are sufficient for concentration of such systems near the \"edge of chaos.\" The original structure of gene regulatory networks is unknown due to the undiscovered functions of some genes. Most gene function discovery approaches make use of unsupervised clustering or classification methods that discover and exploit patterns in gene expression profiles. However, existing knowledge in the field derives from multiple and diverse sources. Incorporating this know-how for novel gene function prediction can, therefore, be expected to improve such predictions. We here propose a function-specific novel gene discovery tool that uses a semi-supervised autoencoder. Our method is thus able to address the needs of a modern researcher whose expertise is typically confined to a specific functional domain. Lastly, the dynamics of unorthodox learning approaches like biologically plausible learning algorithms are investigated and found to exhibit a general form of Einstein relation.",

The rapid development of high-throughput sequencing techniques and computational tools has recently enabled models that span multiple scales, often integrating signaling, gene regulatory, and metabolic networks. These multiscale models enable comprehensive investigations of cellular networks and thus reveal previously unknown disease mechanisms and pharmacological interventions. Here, we review systems biology models from classical mechanistic models to larger, multiscale models that integrate multiple layers of cellular networks. We introduce several examples of models of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, exercise, and cancer cell proliferation. Additionally, we discuss methods that increase the certainty and accuracy of model predictions.

However, quantifying their information transmission capacity remains challenging. Here, we engineer an isolated cAMP signaling channel in Pseudomonas aeruginosa using targeted gene knockouts, optogenetics, and a fluorescent cAMP probe. This design allows precise optical control and real-time monitoring of cAMP dynamics. By integrating experimental data with information theory, we reveal an optimal frequency for light-mediated cAMP signaling that maximizes information transmission, reaching about 40 bits/h. This rate correlates strongly with cAMP degradation kinetics and employs a two-state encoding scheme. Our findings suggest a mechanism for fine-tuned regulation of multiple genes through temporal encoding of second messenger signals, providing new insights into bacterial adaptation strategies.

    "abstract": "Notch signaling is a ubiquitous and versatile intercellular signaling system that drives collective behaviors and pattern formation in biological tissues. During embryonic development, Notch is involved in generation of collective biochemical oscillations that form the vertebrate body segments, and its failure results in embryonic defects. Notch ligands of the Delta family are key components of this collective rhythm, but it is unclear how different Delta ligands with distinct properties contribute to relaying information among cells. Motivated by the zebrafish segmentation clock, in this work we propose a theory describing interactions between biochemical oscillators, where Notch receptor is bound by both oscillatory and nonoscillatory Delta ligands. Based on previous in vitro binding studies, we first consider Notch activation by Delta dimers. This hypothesis is consistent with experimental observations in conditions of perturbed Notch signaling. Then we test an alternative hypothesis where Delta monomers directly bind and activate Notch, and show that this second model can also describe the experimental observations. We show that these two hypotheses assign different roles for a non-oscillatory ligand, as a binding partner or as a baseline signal. Finally, we discuss experiments to distinguish between the two scenarios. Broadly, this work highlights how a multiplicity of ligands may be harnessed by a signaling system to generate versatile responses.",

    "abstract": "Markov chains on the non-negative quadrant of dimension $d$ are often used to model the stochastic dynamics of the number of $d$ entities, such as $d$ chemical species in stochastic reaction networks. The infinite state space poses technical challenges, and the boundary of the quadrant can have a dramatic effect on the long term behavior of these Markov chains. For instance, the boundary can slow down the convergence speed of an ergodic Markov chain towards its stationary distribution due to the extinction or the lack of an entity. In this paper, we quantify this slow-down for a class of stochastic reaction networks and for more general Markov chains on the non-negative quadrant. We establish general criteria for such a Markov chain to exhibit a power-law lower bound for its mixing time. The lower bound is of order $|x|^θ$ for all initial state $x$ on a boundary face of the quadrant, where $θ$ is characterized by the local behavior of the Markov chain near the boundary of the quadrant. A better understanding of how these lower bounds arise leads to insights into how the structure of chemical reaction networks contributes to slow-mixing.",

    "abstract": "Living systems are usually maintained out of equilibrium and consume energy to sustain emergent organized states. Their robust functioning rely on a set of interconnected chemical reaction networks (CRN) in which the external energy supply often comes from fluxes that can keep some species concentrations constant. Hence, to capture the emergent complexity of living systems and the role of their non-equilibrium nature, it is fundamental to uncover constraints and properties of the CRNs underpinning their functions. In particular, while kinetics plays a key role in shaping detailed dynamical phenomena, the range of operations of these underlying CRNs is fundamentally constrained by thermodynamics. Here, we derive universal thermodynamic upper and lower bounds for species concentrations in a generic CRN operating within a given energy budget. The resulting region determines the thermodynamic space of the CRN, a concept we introduce in this work that determines the range of accessible concentrations for the chemical species involved at a given value of non-equilibrium driving. We obtain similar bounds for the affinities, shedding light on how global thermodynamic properties, such as the total dissipation, can limit local non-equilibrium quantities. We illustrate our results in various paradigmatic examples, the Schlogl model for bistability, a minimal self-assembly process, a paradigmatic system exhibiting chiral symmetry breaking, and a multi-molecular model for reaction-diffusion patterns, demonstrating how the onset of complex behaviors is intimately tangled with the presence of non-equilibrium conditions. By providing a general tool for analyzing CRNs, the presented framework constitutes a stepping stone to deepen our ability to predict complex out-of-equilibrium phenomena and design artificial chemical systems, starting from the sole knowledge of the underlying thermodynamic properties.",

We derive several results that allow to verify the existence of infinitesimal homeostasis points both in the absence of conservation and under conservation laws where conserved quantities serve as input parameters. In particular, we introduce the notion of infinitesimal concentration robustness, where the output variable remains nearly constant despite fluctuations in the conserved quantities.

The method is built on a stochastic integro-differential formulation derived from the Langevin bridge formalism, which constrains molecular trajectories to reach a prescribed final state within a finite time and yields an efficient low-temperature approximation of the exact bridge equation. To obtain physically meaningful protein transitions, we couple this formulation to a new coarse-grained potential combining a Go-like term that preserves native backbone geometry with a Rouse-type elastic energy term from polymer physics; we refer to the resulting approach as SIDE. We evaluate SIDE on several proteins undergoing large-scale conformational changes and compare its performance with established methods such as MinActionPath and EBDIMS. SIDE generates smooth, low-energy trajectories that maintain molecular geometry and frequently recover experimentally supported intermediate states. Although challenges remain for highly complex motions-largely due to the simplified coarse-grained potential-our results demonstrate that SIDE offers a powerful and computationally efficient strategy for modeling bio-molecular conformational transitions.",

    "abstract": "Red blood cells (RBCs) sustain mechanical stresses associated with microcirculatory flow through ATP-driven plasma membrane flickering. This is an active phenomenon driven by motor proteins that regulate interactions between the spectrin cytoskeleton and the lipid bilayer; it is manifested in RBC shape fluctuations reflecting the cell's mechanical and metabolic state. Yet, direct quantification of the forces and energetic costs underlying this non-equilibrium behavior remains challenging due to the invasiveness of existing techniques. Here, a minimally invasive method that combines bead-free, low-power optical tweezers with high-speed video microscopy was employed to track local membrane forces and displacements in single RBCs during the same time window. This independent dual-channel measurement enabled the construction of a mechano-dynamic phase space for RBCs under different chemical treatments, that allowed for differentiating between metabolic and structural states based on their fluctuation-force signatures. Quantification of mechanical work during flickering demonstrated that membrane softening enhanced fluctuations while elevating energy dissipation. The proposed optical tweezers methodology provides a robust framework for mapping the active mechanics of living cells, enabling precise probing of cellular physiology and detection of biomechanical dysfunction in diseases.",

    "title": "A Review of Wearable Sweat Monitoring Platforms: From Biomarker Detection to Signal Processing Systems",
    "abstract": "Wearable electronics hold great potential in defining new paradigms of modern healthcare, including personalized health management, precision medicine, and athletic performance optimization. This stems from their ability in enabling continuous, real-time health monitoring. To enable molecular-level analysis, biofluids rich in molecular analytes have become one of the most important target samples for wearable sensors. Among them, sweat stands out as an ideal candidate for next-generation wearable health monitoring platforms due to its completely noninvasive nature and ease of acquisition. In recent years, several studies have demonstrated feasible prototype designs for sweat-based wearable sensors. However, one of the major gaps toward large-scale commercialization is the development of clinically validated standards for sweat analysis. One key requirement is to establish the relationship between sweat analytes and those of blood, the latter serving as the gold standard in modern diagnostics. This review provides an overview of sweat biomarkers, with a particular focus on their partitioning mechanisms, which reveal the underlying connections between sweat analytes and their counterparts within systemic metabolic pathways. In addition, this review offers a mechanistic-level examination of biosensors employed in sweat sensing, addressing a gap that has not been adequately covered in prior reviews. Given the critical role of electronic systems in constructing highly integrated wearable sweat-monitoring platforms, this review also analyzes the electronic architectures used for sensor signal processing from an interdisciplinary perspective, with particular emphasis on the analog circuitry that interfaces with electrochemical sensors.",

    "abstract": "Advancements in AI for science unlocks capabilities for critical drug discovery tasks such as protein-ligand binding affinity prediction. However, current models overfit to existing oversimplified datasets that does not represent naturally occurring and biologically relevant proteins with modifications. In this work, we curate a complete and modification-aware version of the widely used DAVIS dataset by incorporating 4,032 kinase-ligand pairs involving substitutions, insertions, deletions, and phosphorylation events. This enriched dataset enables benchmarking of predictive models under biologically realistic conditions. Based on this new dataset, we propose three benchmark settings-Augmented Dataset Prediction, Wild-Type to Modification Generalization, and Few-Shot Modification Generalization-designed to assess model robustness in the presence of protein modifications. Through extensive evaluation of both docking-free and docking-based methods, we find that docking-based model generalize better in zero-shot settings. In contrast, docking-free models tend to overfit to wild-type proteins and struggle with unseen modifications but show notable improvement when fine-tuned on a small set of modified examples. We anticipate that the curated dataset and benchmarks offer a valuable foundation for developing models that better generalize to protein modifications, ultimately advancing precision medicine in drug discovery.

Our findings reveal that the model's predictions often prioritize conserved motifs over truly deterministic residues, complicating the identification of functional sites. Quantitative analyses show that explainability methods differ significantly in granularity, with GradCAM providing broad relevance and PGExplainer pinpointing specific active sites.

    "abstract": "The constrained nature of synthesizable chemical space poses a significant challenge for sampling molecules that are both synthetically accessible and possess desired properties. In this work, we present PrexSyn, an efficient and programmable model for molecular discovery within synthesizable chemical space. PrexSyn is based on a decoder-only transformer trained on a billion-scale datastream of synthesizable pathways paired with molecular properties, enabled by a real-time, high-throughput C++-based data generation engine. The large-scale training data allows PrexSyn to reconstruct the synthesizable chemical space nearly perfectly at a high inference speed and learn the association between properties and synthesizable molecules. Based on its learned property-pathway mappings, PrexSyn can generate synthesizable molecules that satisfy not only single-property conditions but also composite property queries joined by logical operators, thereby allowing users to ``program'' generation objectives. Moreover, by exploiting this property-based querying capability, PrexSyn can efficiently optimize molecules against black-box oracle functions via iterative query refinement, achieving higher sampling efficiency than even synthesis-agnostic baselines, making PrexSyn a powerful general-purpose molecular optimization tool. Overall, PrexSyn pushes the frontier of synthesizable molecular design by setting a new state of the art in synthesizable chemical space coverage, molecular sampling efficiency, and inference speed.",

We present EnzyCLIP, a novel dual-encoder framework that leverages contrastive learning and cross-attention mechanisms to predict enzyme kinetic parameters from protein sequences and substrate molecular structures. Our approach integrates ESM-2 protein language model embeddings with ChemBERTa chemical representations through a CLIP-inspired architecture enhanced with bidirectional cross-attention for dynamic enzyme-substrate interaction modeling. EnzyCLIP combines InfoNCE contrastive loss with Huber regression loss to learn aligned multimodal representations while predicting log10-transformed kinetic parameters. The model is trained on the CatPred-DB database containing 23,151 Kcat and 41,174 Km experimentally validated measurements, and achieved competitive performance with R2 scores of 0.593 for Kcat and 0.607 for Km prediction. XGBoost ensemble methods applied to the learned embeddings further improved Km prediction (R2 = 0.61) while maintaining robust Kcat performance.",

Amino acid mutations in protein-nucleic acid complexes often lead to vital diseases. Experimental techniques have their own specific limitations in predicting mutational effects in protein-nucleic acid complexes. In this study, we compiled a large dataset of 1951 mutations including both protein-DNA and protein-RNA complexes and integrated structural and sequential features to build a deep learning-based regression model named DeepPNI. This model estimates mutation-induced binding free energy changes in protein-nucleic acid complexes. The structural features are encoded via edge-aware RGCN and the sequential features are extracted using protein language model ESM-2. We have achieved a high average Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.76 in the large dataset via five-fold cross-validation. Consistent performance across individual dataset of protein-DNA, protein-RNA complexes, and different experimental temperature split dataset make the model generalizable. Our model showed good performance in complex-based five-fold cross-validation, which proved its robustness.

    "abstract": "Machine learning models for 3D molecular property prediction typically rely on atom-based representations, which may overlook subtle physical information. Electron density maps -- the direct output of X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy -- offer a continuous, physically grounded alternative. We compare three voxel-based input types for 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs): atom types, raw electron density, and density gradient magnitude, across two molecular tasks -- protein-ligand binding affinity prediction (PDBbind) and quantum property prediction (QM9). We focus on voxel-based CNNs because electron density is inherently volumetric, and voxel grids provide the most natural representation for both experimental and computed densities. On PDBbind, all representations perform similarly with full data, but in low-data regimes, density-based inputs outperform atom types, while a shape-based baseline performs comparably -- suggesting that spatial occupancy dominates this task. On QM9, where labels are derived from Density Functional Theory (DFT) but input densities from a lower-level method (XTB), density-based inputs still outperform atom-based ones at scale, reflecting the rich structural and electronic information encoded in density. Overall, these results highlight the task- and regime-dependent strengths of density-derived inputs, improving data efficiency in affinity prediction and accuracy in quantum property modeling.",

    "abstract": "Generative artificial intelligence (AI) models learn probability distributions from data and produce novel samples that capture the salient properties of their training sets. Proteins are particularly attractive for such approaches given their abundant data and the versatility of their representations, ranging from sequences to structures and functions. This versatility has motivated the rapid development of generative models for protein design, enabling the generation of functional proteins and enzymes with unprecedented success. However, because these models mirror their training distribution, they tend to sample from its most probable modes, while low-probability regions, often encoding valuable properties, remain underexplored. To address this challenge, recent work has focused on guiding generative models to produce proteins with user-specified properties, even when such properties are rare or absent from the original training distribution. In this review, we survey and categorize recent advances in conditioning generative models for protein design. We distinguish approaches that modify model parameters, such as reinforcement learning or supervised fine-tuning, from those that keep the model fixed, including conditional generation, retrieval-augmented strategies, Bayesian guidance, and tailored sampling methods. Together, these developments are beginning to enable the steering of generative models toward proteins with desired, and often previously inaccessible, properties.",

In order to address tertiary RNA inverse folding, we present BeeRNA, a bio-inspired method that employs the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) optimization algorithm. Our approach combines base-pair distance filtering with RMSD-based structural assessment using RhoFold for structure prediction, resulting in a two-stage fitness evaluation strategy.

In this work, we focus primarily on short and medium-length RNAs ($<$ 100 nucleotides), a biologically significant regime that includes microRNAs (miRNAs), aptamers, and ribozymes, where BeeRNA achieves high structural fidelity with practical CPU runtimes.

Existing diffusion-based generative models typically operate in Cartesian coordinate space, where adding noise disrupts strict geometric constraints such as fixed bond lengths and angles, often producing physically invalid structures. To address this limitation, we propose a Torsion-Space Diffusion Model that generates protein backbones by denoising torsion angles, ensuring perfect local geometry by construction. A differentiable forward-kinematics module reconstructs 3D coordinates with fixed 3.8 Angstrom backbone bond lengths while a constrained post-processing refinement optimizes global compactness via Radius of Gyration (Rg) correction, without violating bond constraints. Experiments on standard PDB proteins demonstrate 100% bond-length accuracy and significantly improved structural compactness, reducing Rg error from 70% to 18.6% compared to Cartesian diffusion baselines. Overall, this hybrid torsion-diffusion plus geometric-refinement framework generates physically valid and compact protein backbones, providing a promising path toward full-atom protein generation.",

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases are driven by the accumulation of protein aggregates in the brain of affected individuals. The aggregation behaviour in vitro is well understood and driven by the equilibration of a super-saturated protein solution to its aggregated equilibrium state. However, the situation is altered fundamentally in living systems where active processes consume energy to remove aggregates. It remains unclear how and why cells transition from a state with predominantly monomeric protein, which is stable over decades, to one dominated by aggregates. Here, we develop a simple but universal theoretical framework to describe cellular systems that include both aggregate formation and removal. Using a two-dimensional phase-plane representation, we show that the interplay of aggregate formation and removal generates cell-level bistability, with a bifurcation structure that explains both the emergence of disease and the effects of therapeutic interventions. We explore a wide range of aggregate formation and removal mechanisms and show that phenomena such as seeding arise robustly when a minimal set of requirements on the mechanism are satisfied. By connecting in vitro aggregation mechanisms to changes in cell state, our framework provides a general conceptual link between molecular-level therapeutic interventions and their impact on disease progression.",

In this paper, we introduce the Joint Gromov-Wasserstein (JGW) objective and extend the original framework of GW to enable simultaneous matching between collections of objects. Our formulation provides a non-negative dissimilarity measure that identifies partially isomorphic distributions of mm-spaces, with point sampling convergence. We also show that the objective can be formulated and solved for point cloud object representations by adapting traditional algorithms in Optimal Transport, including entropic regularization. Our benchmarking with other variants of GW for partial matching indicates superior performance in accuracy and computational efficiency of our method, while experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show its effectiveness for multiple shape matching, including geometric shapes and biomolecular complexes, suggesting promising applications for solving complex matching problems across diverse domains, including computer graphics and structural biology.",

    "abstract": "Generative models for structure-based drug design are often limited to a specific modality, restricting their broader applicability. To address this challenge, we introduce FuncBind, a framework based on computer vision to generate target-conditioned, all-atom molecules across atomic systems. FuncBind uses neural fields to represent molecules as continuous atomic densities and employs score-based generative models with modern architectures adapted from the computer vision literature. This modality-agnostic representation allows a single unified model to be trained on diverse atomic systems, from small to large molecules, and handle variable atom/residue counts, including non-canonical amino acids. FuncBind achieves competitive in silico performance in generating small molecules, macrocyclic peptides, and antibody complementarity-determining region loops, conditioned on target structures. FuncBind also generated in vitro novel antibody binders via de novo redesign of the complementarity-determining region H3 loop of two chosen co-crystal structures. As a final contribution, we introduce a new dataset and benchmark for structure-conditioned macrocyclic peptide generation. The code is available at https://github.com/prescient-design/funcbind.",

    "abstract": "Microproteins are a newly recognized and rapidly growing class of small proteins, typically encoded by fewer than 100 to 150 codons and translated from small open reading frames (smORFs). Although research has shown that smORFs and their corresponding microproteins constitute a significant portion of the genome and proteome, there is still limited information available in the literature regarding the structural characteristics of microproteins. In this paper, we discuss the methods available for predicting their secondary and tertiary structures and provide examples of calculations done with three archetypical methods (AlphaFold, I TASSER and ROSETTA). We present results predicting the structures of 44 microproteins. For this set of microproteins the methods considered here show a reasonable agreement among them and with the very few cases in which experimental structures are available. None the less, the agreement with experimental structures is not as good as for larger proteins, indicating that it is necessary to obtain a much larger set of experimental microproteins structures to better evaluate and eventually calibrate prediction methods.",

    "abstract": "AlphaFold 3 (AF3) is a powerful biomolecular structure-predicting tool based on the latest deep learning algorithms and revolutionized AI model architectures. A few of papers have already investigated its accuracy in predicting different biomolecular structures. However, the potential applications of AF3 beyond basic structure prediction have not been fully explored. In our study, we firstly focused on structure predictions of antibody-antigen (CD47) complexes, which is believed to be challenge for AF3 due to limited resolved cognate crystallographic structures. Furtherly, we aimed to the potentiality of AF3 in performing pre-screening for potent antibody candidates as an auxiliary work through binding affinity analysis compared to other molecular docking modules of commercial software, which would greatly benefit the lead identification or optimization process in the drug development. In essence, this is not limited to antibody-antigen binding affinity, but many other chemical or physical properties of any drug candidate based on AF3's accurate predicting structures that are extremely close to the reality. According to our experimental results, AF3 is a very promising competitor, which can efficiently produce highly reliable molecular structures and subsequent binding energy predictions for most subjects. Surprisingly, an unexpected and nonrandom phenomenon \"reverse docking\" was observed for two of our antibody subjects, suggesting new issues arising from the architectural revolution of AF3. Our analysis and error correction experiments show that this phenomenon is likely to be caused by revolutionized AI model architectures, which provides important experience and reminders for the optimization and design direction of AI for structural prediction.

    "title": "ApexGen: Simultaneous design of peptide binder sequence and structure for target proteins",
    "abstract": "Peptide-based drugs can bind to protein interaction sites that small molecules often cannot, and are easier to produce than large protein drugs. However, designing effective peptide binders is difficult. A typical peptide has an enormous number of possible sequences, and only a few of these will fold into the right 3D shape to match a given protein target. Existing computational methods either generate many candidate sequences without considering how they will fold, or build peptide backbones and then find suitable sequences afterward. Here we introduce ApexGen, a new AI-based framework that simultaneously designs a peptide's amino-acid sequence and its three-dimensional structure to fit a given protein target. For each target, ApexGen produces a full all-atom peptide model in a small number of deterministic integration steps. In tests on hundreds of protein targets, the peptides designed by ApexGen fit tightly onto their target surfaces and cover nearly the entire binding site. These peptides have shapes similar to those found in natural protein-peptide complexes, and they show strong predicted binding affinity in computational experiments. Because ApexGen couples sequence and structure design at every step of Euler integration within a flow-matching sampler, it is much faster and more efficient than prior approaches. This unified method could greatly accelerate the discovery of new peptide-based therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs7903146 in the TCF7L2 gene has been determined as one of the strongest common genetic risk factors for Type 2 Diabetes (T2D). The location of the SNP in a non-coding region suggests a regulatory mechanism, meaning the SNP doesn't change the protein's own structure but rather affects how the TCF7L2 protein binds to DNA to control other genes. This binding, however, is highly dependent on the shape and flexibility of the DNA. This study aims to reveal the atomic-level effects of the SNP's cytosine-to-thymine substitution on the TCF7L2-DNA complex. We first utilized AlphaFold to generate individual high-confidence structures of the TCF7L2 protein and two 15-base pair DNA duplexes: one containing the reference C allele and one containing the variant T allele. These structures were then used as inputs for Neurosnap's Boltz2 deep learning model to generate two complete protein-DNA complexes of the TCF7L2 HMG-box bound to each DNA variant. Using the iMODS server, we conducted a Normal Mode Analysis (NMA) to predict and compare large-scale flexibility and differences in interactions between the complexes. The protein-DNA interface was dissected using PDBsum to locate atomic contacts, clefts, and interaction maps. Overall, our results show that the T allele variant exhibits increased global stiffness with a higher eigenvalue and reduced flexibility, suggesting that the SNP disrupts the mechanism and biomechanical balance needed for efficient TCF7L2-DNA binding, thus affecting downstream gene regulation.",

However, the reliability and success of these docking tools rely on their scoring function. Accurate and efficient scoring functions are necessary to distinguish between native and non-native docking models to ensure the accuracy of a docking tool. Like in other fields where deep learning methods have been successfully utilized, these methods have also introduced innovative scoring functions. An outstanding tool for scoring and differentiating native-like docking models from non-native or incorrect conformations is called Protein binding Interfaces with Transformer Networks (PIsToN). PIsToN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art scoring functions. Using models of complexes obtained from binding the Ebola Virus Protein VP40 to the host cell's Sec24c protein as an example, we show how to evaluate docking models using PIsToN.",

Analyzing such data benefits from estimating the minimal number of variables required to describe the explored conformational manifold, known as the intrinsic dimension (ID). We present MDIntrinsicDimension, an open-source Python package that estimates ID directly from MD trajectories by combining rotation- and translation-invariant molecular projections (e.g., backbone dihedrals and inter-residue distances) with state-of-the-art estimators. The package provides three complementary analysis modes: whole-molecule ID; sliding windows along the sequence; and per-secondary-structure elements. It computes both overall ID (a single summary value) and instantaneous, time-resolved ID that can reveal transitions and heterogeneity over time. We illustrate the approach on fast folding-unfolding trajectories from the DESRES dataset, demonstrating that ID complements conventional geometric descriptors by highlighting spatially localized flexibility and differences across structural segments.",

    "abstract": "Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) enables the atomic-resolution visualization of biomolecules; however, modern direct detectors generate data volumes that far exceed the available storage and transfer bandwidth, thereby constraining practical throughput. We introduce cryoSENSE, the computational realization of a hardware-software co-designed framework for compressive cryo-EM sensing and acquisition. We show that cryo-EM images of proteins lie on low-dimensional manifolds that can be independently represented using sparse priors in predefined bases and generative priors captured by a denoising diffusion model. cryoSENSE leverages these low-dimensional manifolds to enable faithful image reconstruction from spatial and Fourier-domain undersampled measurements while preserving downstream structural resolution. In experiments, cryoSENSE increases acquisition throughput by up to 2.5$\\times$ while retaining the original 3D resolution, offering controllable trade-offs between the number of masked measurements and the level of downsampling. Sparse priors favor faithful reconstruction from Fourier-domain measurements and moderate compression, whereas generative diffusion priors achieve accurate recovery from pixel-domain measurements and more severe undersampling.

    "abstract": "This study introduces a novel iron-based gas diffusion electrode-photocatalytic system aimed at enhancing the degradation of phenolic compounds in wastewater. Phenolic compounds are toxic environmental pollutants with significant resistance to biodegradation. The traditional methods for treating phenol wastewater, including biological treatments and adsorption techniques, often fall short in achieving complete mineralization. Our approach utilizes a dual-chamber electrochemical setup integrating stainless steel felt-2-EAQ gas diffusion electrodes with TiO2 photocatalysis. This combination significantly boosts hydroxyl radical production, critical for effective pollutant breakdown. Experimentally, the system achieved up to 92% degradation efficiency for phenol at an optimized operating current of 10 mA/cm^2 in 3 hours, surpassing traditional methods. Additionally, energy consumption was reduced by 40% compared to conventional electro-Fenton systems. The stability tests indicated that the electrodes maintain over 80% of their initial activity after five cycles of use. These findings suggest that our system offers a more sustainable and efficient solution for treating phenolic wastewater by enhancing both degradation rates and energy efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Aligning molecular sequence representations (e.g., SMILES notations) with textual descriptions is critical for applications spanning drug discovery, materials design, and automated chemical literature analysis. Existing methodologies typically treat molecular captioning (molecule-to-text) and text-based molecular design (text-to-molecule) as separate tasks, relying on supervised fine-tuning or contrastive learning pipelines. These approaches face three key limitations: (i) conventional metrics like BLEU prioritize linguistic fluency over chemical accuracy, (ii) training datasets frequently contain chemically ambiguous narratives with incomplete specifications, and (iii) independent optimization of generation directions leads to bidirectional inconsistency. To address these issues, we propose RTMol, a bidirectional alignment framework that unifies molecular captioning and text-to-SMILES generation through self-supervised round-trip learning. The framework introduces novel round-trip evaluation metrics and enables unsupervised training for molecular captioning without requiring paired molecule-text corpora. Experiments demonstrate that RTMol enhances bidirectional alignment performance by up to 47% across various LLMs, establishing an effective paradigm for joint molecule-text understanding and generation.",

    "abstract": "The PTPN11 gene encodes the Src homology 2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase (SHP2), a key regulator of cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis through its modulation of various signaling pathways, including the RAS/MAPK signaling pathway. Missense variants in PTPN11 disrupt SHP2's proper catalytic activity and the regulation of signaling pathways, leading to disorders such as Noonan syndrome (NS), LEOPARD syndrome (LS), or juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML). These missense variants have molecular disruptions resulting in gains and losses of function at both the molecular and phenotypic levels. Depending on their location within SHP2, missense substitutions disrupt inter-domain regulation or impair phosphatase function, resulting in altered phosphatase activity. In this study, we investigate the molecular basis underlying the differential pathogenicity of PTPN11 missense variants and predict the structural consequences of these variants using MutPred2 and AlphaFold2. We find that LOF and GOF variants display distinct functional mechanisms in sodium and DNA binding, and that NS-associated missense variants identified in fetuses with ultrasound-detected anomalies and familiar cases are more likely to be pathogenic.",

    "abstract": "Peri-implant inflammation in orthodontic mini-implant may lead to patient discomfort and treatment failure. This study aims to evaluate the effects of diode laser application on the health of mini-implant, preventing peri-implantitis and promoting healing. A randomized controlled trial was conducted involving 30 orthodontic patients (12 males and 18 females, aged 18-32) who had mini-implants implanted on both sides of the maxilla for anterior teeth retraction. One side of each patient was assigned to either an experimental group receiving diode laser irradiation (650 nm, 25 mW) at specific postoperative intervals or a control group receiving simulated radiation. Clinical assessments included plaque index, modified sulcus bleeding index, probing depth, and incidence of peri-implant mucositis and implant mobility, measured at 1, 4, and 12 weeks post-implantation. Additionally, interleukin-1 beta (IL-1\\b{eta}) levels in peri-implant fluid were analyzed via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results indicated that the experimental group exhibited significantly lower plaque indices, sulcus bleeding indices, and probing depths (p < 0.05) compared to the control group. Moreover, the experimental group had fewer cases of peri-implant mucositis (p < 0.05), while differences in implant stability were not statistically significant (p > 0.05). IL-1\\b{eta} levels were consistently lower in the experimental group throughout the study duration (p < 0.05). In conclusion, adjunctive diode laser therapy appears to enhance peri-implant health and reduce complications associated with orthodontic mini-implants, suggesting a promising direction for improving patient outcomes in orthodontics. Future research should explore long-term effects and the mechanisms underlying these benefits.",

    "abstract": "Saturnian moon Titan presents a compelling testbed for probing prebiotic chemistry beyond early Earth. Impact-generated melt pools provide transient aqueous habitats in an otherwise cryogenic environment. We use Cantera equilibrium models to assess whether mixtures of hydrogen cyanide (HCN), acetylene (C2H2), and ammonia (NH3) can drive amino acid synthesis in Selk-sized craters. Across twenty-one amino acids (twenty proteinogenic plus beta-alanine), NH3-free systems yield only proline, alanine, and beta-alanine, whereas adding as little as 1% NH3 (relative to H2O) renders almost the full suite accessible, with yields peaking at 2% and tapering thereafter. The NH3-free alanine result implies alternative pathways beyond classical Strecker or aminonitrile hydrolysis, suggesting acetylene, abundant on Titan but scarce on early Earth, as a plausible feedstock. We identify acrylonitrile (detected on Titan) as a thermodynamically favorable intermediate that can convert to alanine under aqueous conditions in an NH3-free pathway. For glycine and alanine production from nitrile hydrolysis, comparison with laboratory kinetics shows that our equilibrium models predict near-complete conversion, while observed rates yield only partial products over weeks. Yet estimated chemical equilibration times (years-centuries) are far shorter than melt lifetimes, supporting plausibility of equilibrium in situ. These predictions are directly testable with Dragonfly mass spectrometer (DraMS), for which we recommend pre-flight standards to test proline, alanine, beta-alanine, cysteine, and methionine. The first three offer the best chances for amino acid detection regardless of ammonia availability; the latter two offer diagnostic tools for determining the presence of reactive sulfur in post-impact Titan ponds.",

    "title": "Compact Artificial Neural Network Models for Predicting Protein Residue -- RNA Base Binding",
    "abstract": "Large Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models have demonstrated success in various domains, including general text and image generation, drug discovery, and protein-RNA (ribonucleic acid) binding tasks. However, these models typically demand substantial computational resources, time, and data for effective training. Given that such extensive resources are often inaccessible to many researchers and that life sciences data sets are frequently limited, we investigated whether small ANN models could achieve acceptable accuracy in protein-RNA prediction. We experimented with shallow feed-forward ANNs comprising two hidden layers and various non-linearities. These models did not utilize explicit structural information; instead, a sliding window approach was employed to implicitly consider the context of neighboring residues and bases. We explored different training techniques to address the issue of highly unbalanced data. Among the seven most popular non-linearities for feed-forward ANNs, only three: Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), Gated Linear Unit (GLU), and Hyperbolic Tangent (Tanh) yielded converging models. Common re-balancing techniques, such as under- and over-sampling of training sets, proved ineffective, whereas increasing the volume of training data and using model ensembles significantly improved performance. The optimal context window size, balancing both false negative and false positive errors, was found to be approximately 30 residues and bases. Our findings indicate that high-accuracy protein-RNA binding prediction is achievable using computing hardware accessible to most educational and research institutions.",

    "abstract": "Simulating trajectories of multi-particle systems on complex energy landscapes is a central task in molecular dynamics (MD) and drug discovery, but remains challenging at scale due to computationally expensive and long simulations. Previous approaches leverage techniques such as flow or Schrödinger bridge matching to implicitly learn joint trajectories through data snapshots. However, many systems, including biomolecular systems and heterogeneous cell populations, undergo dynamic interactions that evolve over their trajectory and cannot be captured through static snapshots. To close this gap, we introduce Entangled Schrödinger Bridge Matching (EntangledSBM), a framework that learns the first- and second-order stochastic dynamics of interacting, multi-particle systems where the direction and magnitude of each particle's path depend dynamically on the paths of the other particles. We define the Entangled Schrödinger Bridge (EntangledSB) problem as solving a coupled system of bias forces that entangle particle velocities. We show that our framework accurately simulates heterogeneous cell populations under perturbations and rare transitions in high-dimensional biomolecular systems.",

This review provides a comprehensive overview of the main polysaccharides employed as wall materials, including starch, maltodextrin, alginate, pectin, inulin, chitosan, and gum arabic, and discusses how structural interactions and physicochemical properties can benefit the microencapsulation of polyphenols and pigments. The main findings and principles of the major encapsulation techniques, including spray drying, freeze drying, extrusion, emulsification, and coacervation, related to the production of microparticles, were briefly described. Polysaccharides can entrap hydrophilic and hydrophobic compounds by physical interactions, forming a barrier around the nucleus or binding to the bioactive compound. Intermolecular binding between polysaccharides in the wall matrix, polyphenols, and pigments in the nucleus can confer up to 90% of encapsulation efficiency, governed mainly by hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions. The mixture of wall polysaccharides in the microparticles synthesis favors the encapsulation solubility, storage stability, bioaccessibility, and bioactivity of the microencapsulate compounds. Clinical trials on the bioefficacy of polyphenols and pigments loaded in polysaccharide microparticles are scarce and require further evidence to reinforce the use of this technology.",

    "abstract": "For several decades, experimental and computational studies have been used to investigate the potential functional role of knots in protein structures. A property that has attracted considerable attention is thermal stability, i.e., the extent to which a protein retains its native conformation and biological activity at high temperatures, without undergoing denaturation or aggregation. Thermal stability is quantified by the melting temperature $T_m$, an equilibrium property that corresponds to the peak of heat capacity in differential scanning calorimetry experiments. Since protein energy does not depend on the topological state, equilibrium properties such as $T_m$ should not depend on the topology, provided that the exploration of the equilibrium space is ergodic. However, experimental and computational results reported in the literature provide conflicting views on this problem, with some studies reporting an enhancement of thermal stability for certain knotted proteins. Here, we use extensive Monte Carlo simulations of a simple C-alpha protein model of protein YibK to show in a comprehensive manner that $T_m$ does not depend on the topological state of the protein.",

Recent studies have highlighted the circadian rhythm critical role in AD pathophysiology, implicating circadian clock kinases, such as the Salt-Inducible Kinase 3 (SIK3), as promising therapeutic target. Generative AI models have surpassed traditional methods of drug discovery, untapping the vast unexplored chemical space of drug-like molecules. We present a sequence-to-sequence Variational Autoencoder (Seq2Seq-VAE) model guided by an Active Learning (AL) approach to optimize molecular generation. Our pipeline iteratively guided a pre-trained Seq2Seq-VAE model towards the pharmacological landscape relevant to SIK3 using a two-step framework, an inner loop that iteratively improves physiochemical properties profile, drug likeliness and synthesizability, followed by an outer loop that steer the latent space towards high-affinity ligands for SIK3. Our approach introduces feedback-driven optimization without requiring large labeled datasets, making it particularly suited for early-stage drug discovery in under-explored therapeutic targets. Our results demonstrate the models convergence toward SIK3-specific small molecules with desired properties and high binding affinity. This work highlights the use of generative AI combined with AL for rational drug discovery that can be extended to other protein targets with minimal modifications, offering a scalable solution to the molecular design bottleneck in drug design.",

    "abstract": "Chemical reaction prediction remains a fundamental challenge in organic chemistry, where existing machine learning models face two critical limitations: sensitivity to input permutations (molecule/atom orderings) and inadequate modeling of substructural interactions governing reactivity. These shortcomings lead to inconsistent predictions and poor generalization to real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose ReaDISH, a novel reaction prediction model that learns permutation-invariant representations while incorporating interaction-aware features. It introduces two innovations: (1) symmetric difference shingle encoding, which extends the differential reaction fingerprint (DRFP) by representing shingles as continuous high-dimensional embeddings, capturing structural changes while eliminating order sensitivity; and (2) geometry-structure interaction attention, a mechanism that models intra- and inter-molecular interactions at the shingle level. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReaDISH improves reaction prediction performance across diverse benchmarks. It shows enhanced robustness with an average improvement of 8.76% on R$^2$ under permutation perturbations.",

    "abstract": "Nuclei segmentation is the cornerstone task in histology image reading, shedding light on the underlying molecular patterns and leading to disease or cancer diagnosis. Yet, it is a laborious task that requires expertise from trained physicians. The large nuclei variability across different organ tissues and acquisition processes challenges the automation of this task. On the other hand, data annotations are expensive to obtain, and thus, Deep Learning (DL) models are challenged to generalize to unseen organs or different domains. This work proposes Local-to-Global NuSegHop (LG-NuSegHop), a self-supervised pipeline developed on prior knowledge of the problem and molecular biology. There are three distinct modules: (1) a set of local processing operations to generate a pseudolabel, (2) NuSegHop a novel data-driven feature extraction model and (3) a set of global operations to post-process the predictions of NuSegHop. Notably, even though the proposed pipeline uses { no manually annotated training data} or domain adaptation, it maintains a good generalization performance on other datasets. Experiments in three publicly available datasets show that our method outperforms other self-supervised and weakly supervised methods while having a competitive standing among fully supervised methods. Remarkably, every module within LG-NuSegHop is transparent and explainable to physicians.",

Two main mechanisms of aggregation have been proposed: hydrogen bonding by polar-zipper formation and covalent bonding by transglutaminase-catalyzed cross-linking. In cell culture models of Huntington's disease, aggregates are mostly stabilized by hydrogen bonds, but covalent bonds are also likely to occur. Nothing is known about the nature of the bonds that stabilize the aggregates in the brain of patients with Huntington's disease.

To acquire complex protein information, we introduce reconstructive pre-training to mine more fine-grained information with low semantic levels. Moreover, we put forward the Bidirectional Interaction Module (BInM) to facilitate interactive learning among multimodal features.

    "abstract": "The chemical space of drug-like molecules is vast, motivating the development of generative models that must learn broad chemical distributions, enable conditional generation by capturing structure-property representations, and provide fast molecular generation. Meeting the objectives depends on modeling choices, including the probabilistic modeling approach, the conditional generative formulation, the architecture, and the molecular input representation. To address the challenges, we present STAR-VAE (Selfies-encoded, Transformer-based, AutoRegressive Variational Auto Encoder), a scalable latent-variable framework with a Transformer encoder and an autoregressive Transformer decoder. It is trained on 79 million drug-like molecules from PubChem, using SELFIES to guarantee syntactic validity. The latent-variable formulation enables conditional generation: a property predictor supplies a conditioning signal that is applied consistently to the latent prior, the inference network, and the decoder. Our contributions are: (i) a Transformer-based latent-variable encoder-decoder model trained on SELFIES representations; (ii) a principled conditional latent-variable formulation for property-guided generation; and (iii) efficient finetuning with low-rank adapters (LoRA) in both encoder and decoder, enabling fast adaptation with limited property and activity data. On the GuacaMol and MOSES benchmarks, our approach matches or exceeds baselines, and latent-space analyses reveal smooth, semantically structured representations that support both unconditional exploration and property-aware generation. On the Tartarus benchmarks, the conditional model shifts docking-score distributions toward stronger predicted binding. These results suggest that a modernized, scale-appropriate VAE remains competitive for molecular generation when paired with principled conditioning and parameter-efficient finetuning.",

The field has evolved from foundational but accuracy-limited thermodynamic approaches to a new data-driven paradigm dominated by machine learning and deep learning. These models learn folding patterns directly from data, leading to significant performance gains. This review surveys the modern landscape of these methods, covering single-sequence, evolutionary-based, and hybrid models that blend machine learning with biophysics. A central theme is the field's \"generalization crisis,\" where powerful models were found to fail on new RNA families, prompting a community-wide shift to stricter, homology-aware benchmarking. In response to the underlying challenge of data scarcity, RNA foundation models have emerged, learning from massive, unlabeled sequence corpora to improve generalization. Finally, we look ahead to the next set of major hurdles-including the accurate prediction of complex motifs like pseudoknots, scaling to kilobase-length transcripts, incorporating the chemical diversity of modified nucleotides, and shifting the prediction target from static structures to the dynamic ensembles that better capture biological function. We also highlight the need for a standardized, prospective benchmarking system to ensure unbiased validation and accelerate progress.",

To address this need, we developed DL4Proteins, a series of ten interactive notebook modules that introduce fundamental machine learning (ML) concepts, guide users through training ML models for protein-related tasks, and ultimately present cutting-edge protein structure prediction and design pipelines. With nothing more than a web browser, learners can now access state-of-the-art computational tools employed by professional protein engineers - ranging from all-atom protein design to fine-tuning protein language models for biophysically relevant functional tasks. By increasing accessibility, this notebook series broadens participation in AI-driven protein research. The complete notebook series is publicly available at https://github.com/Graylab/DL4Proteins-notebooks.",

Advances in Machine Learning (ML) methodologies have led to the development of Machine Learned Potential Energy Surfaces (ML-PES) which are now widely used to simulate such systems. The present work provides an overview of concepts, methodologies and recommendations for constructing and using ML-PESs. The choice of topics is focused on practical and recurrent issues to conceive and use such model. Application of the principles discussed are illustrated through two different systems of biomolecular importance: the non-reactive dynamics of the Alanine-Lysine-Alanine tripeptide in gas and solution phases, and double proton transfer reactions in DNA base pairs.",

    "title": "The transitional kinetics between open and closed Rep structures can be tuned by salt via two intermediate states",
    "abstract": "DNA helicases undergo conformational changes; however, their structural dynamics are poorly understood. Here, we study single molecules of superfamily 1A DNA helicase Rep, which undergo conformational transitions during bacterial DNA replication, repair and recombination. We use time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC), fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), rapid single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET), Anti-Brownian ELectrokinetic (ABEL) trapping and molecular dynamics simulations (MDS) to provide unparalleled temporal and spatial resolution of Rep's domain movements. We detect four states revealing two hitherto hidden intermediates (S2, S3), between the open (S1) and closed (S4) structures, whose stability is salt dependent. Rep's open-to-closed switch involves multiple changes to all four subdomains 1A, 1B, 2A and 2B along the S1 to S2 to S3 to S4 transitional pathway comprising an initial truncated swing of 2B which then rolls across the 1B surface, following by combined rotations of 1B, 2A and 2B. High forward and reverse rates for S1 to S2 suggest that 1B may act to frustrate 2B movement to prevent premature Rep closure in the absence of DNA. These observations support a more general binding model for accessory DNA helicases that utilises conformational plasticity to explore a multiplicity of structures whose landscape can be tuned by salt prior to locking-in upon DNA binding.",

    "abstract": "The remarkable progress of artificial intelligence (AI) has revealed the enormous energy demands of modern digital architectures, raising deep concerns about sustainability. In stark contrast, the human brain operates efficiently on only ~20 watts, and individual cells process gigabit-scale genetic information using energy on the order of trillionths of a watt. Under the same energy budget, a general-purpose digital processor can perform only a few simple operations per second. This striking disparity suggests that biological systems follow algorithms fundamentally distinct from conventional computation. The framework of information thermodynamics-especially Maxwell's demon and the Szilard engine-offers a theoretical clue, setting the lower bound of energy required for information processing. However, digital processors exceed this limit by about six orders of magnitude. Recent single-molecule studies have revealed that biological molecular motors convert Brownian motion into mechanical work, realizing a \"demon-like\" operational principle. These findings suggest that living systems have already implemented an ultra-efficient information-energy conversion mechanism that transcends digital computation. Here, we experimentally establish a quantitative correspondence between positional information (bits) and mechanical work, demonstrating that molecular machines selectively exploit rare but functional fluctuations arising from Brownian motion to achieve ATP-level energy efficiency. This integration of information, energy, and timescale indicates that life realizes a Maxwell's demon-like mechanism for energy-efficient information processing.",

    "abstract": "How proteins fold remains a central unsolved problem in biology. While the idea of a folding code embedded in the amino acid sequence was introduced more than 6 decades ago, this code remains undefined. While we now have powerful predictive tools to predict the final native structure of proteins, we still lack a predictive framework for how sequences dictate folding pathways. Two main conceptual models dominate as explanations of folding mechanism: the funnel model, in which folding proceeds through many alternative routes on a rugged, hyperdimensional energy landscape; and the foldon model, which proposes a hierarchical sequence of discrete intermediates. Recent advances on two fronts are now enabling folding studies in unprecedented ways. Powerful experimental approaches; in particular, single-molecule force spectroscopy and hydrogen (deuterium exchange assays) allow time-resolved tracking of the folding process at high resolution. At the same time, computational breakthroughs culminating in algorithms such as AlphaFold have revolutionized static structure prediction, opening opportunities to extend machine learning toward dynamics. Together, these developments mark a turning point: for the first time, we are positioned to resolve how proteins fold, why they misfold, and how this knowledge can be harnessed for biology and medicine.",

    "abstract": "Aggregated Markov models provide a flexible framework for stochastic dynamics that develops on multiple timescales. For example, Markov models for ion channels often consist of multiple open and closed state to account for \"slow\" and \"fast\" openings and closings of the channel. The approach is a popular tool in the construction of mechanistic models of ion channels - instead of viewing model states as generators of sojourn times of a certain characteristic length, each individual model state is interpreted as a representation of a distinct biophysical state. We will review the properties of aggregated Markov models and discuss the implications for mechanistic modelling. First, we show how the aggregated Markov models with a given number of states can be calculated using Pólya enumeration However, models with $n_O$ open and $n_C$ closed states that exceed the maximum number $2 n_O n_C$ of parameters are non-identifiable. We will present two derivations for this classical result and investigate non-identifiability further via a detailed analysis of the non-identifiable fully connected three-state model. Finally, we will discuss the implications of non-identifiability for mechanistic modelling of ion channels. We will argue that instead of designing models based on assumed transitions between distinct biophysical states which are modulated by ligand binding, it is preferable to build models based on additional sources of data that give more direct insight into the dynamics of conformational changes.",

    "abstract": "Designing enzyme backbones with substrate-specific functionality is a critical challenge in computational protein engineering. Current generative models excel in protein design but face limitations in binding data, substrate-specific control, and flexibility for de novo enzyme backbone generation. To address this, we introduce EnzyBind, a dataset with 11,100 experimentally validated enzyme-substrate pairs specifically curated from PDBbind. Building on this, we propose EnzyControl, a method that enables functional and substrate-specific control in enzyme backbone generation. Our approach generates enzyme backbones conditioned on MSA-annotated catalytic sites and their corresponding substrates, which are automatically extracted from curated enzyme-substrate data. At the core of EnzyControl is EnzyAdapter, a lightweight, modular component integrated into a pretrained motif-scaffolding model, allowing it to become substrate-aware. A two-stage training paradigm further refines the model's ability to generate accurate and functional enzyme structures. Experiments show that our EnzyControl achieves the best performance across structural and functional metrics on EnzyBind and EnzyBench benchmarks, with particularly notable improvements of 13\\% in designability and 13\\% in catalytic efficiency compared to the baseline models.

Here, this work shows that local electromagnetic fields (EMFs), ubiquitous in proteins, membranes and nanodomains, can lawfully modulate the Eyring barrier and orientate reactants, accelerating cysteine oxidation without changing the underlying chemistry. Embedding a field term into the Eyring expression, demonstrated that plausible local EMFs with realistic dipole changes accelerate rate constants by orders of magnitude. This local acceleration reconciles the discrepancy between predicted vs. observed rates of H2O2-mediated cysteine oxidation. The framework generates falsifiable predictions, such as vibrational Stark readouts in thiolate peroxide complexes should fall within predicted ranges, and reframes rate-constants as mutable, field conditioned parameters. Cysteine redox sensing is fast not because the chemistry is exotic, but because the physics is local.",

    "title": "Symbolic Neural Generation with Applications to Lead Discovery in Drug Design",
    "abstract": "We investigate a relatively underexplored class of hybrid neurosymbolic models integrating symbolic learning with neural reasoning to construct data generators meeting formal correctness criteria. In \\textit{Symbolic Neural Generators} (SNGs), symbolic learners examine logical specifications of feasible data from a small set of instances -- sometimes just one. Each specification in turn constrains the conditional information supplied to a neural-based generator, which rejects any instance violating the symbolic specification. Like other neurosymbolic approaches, SNG exploits the complementary strengths of symbolic and neural methods. The outcome of an SNG is a triple $(H, X, W)$, where $H$ is a symbolic description of feasible instances constructed from data, $X$ a set of generated new instances that satisfy the description, and $W$ an associated weight. We introduce a semantics for such systems, based on the construction of appropriate \\textit{base} and \\textit{fibre} partially-ordered sets combined into an overall partial order, and outline a probabilistic extension relevant to practical applications. In this extension, SNGs result from searching over a weighted partial ordering. We implement an SNG combining a restricted form of Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) with a large language model (LLM) and evaluate it on early-stage drug design. Our main interest is the description and the set of potential inhibitor molecules generated by the SNG. On benchmark problems -- where drug targets are well understood -- SNG performance is statistically comparable to state-of-the-art methods. On exploratory problems with poorly understood targets, generated molecules exhibit binding affinities on par with leading clinical candidates. Experts further find the symbolic specifications useful as preliminary filters, with several generated molecules identified as viable for synthesis and wet-lab testing.",

Across entity-, token-, and atom-level benchmarks in the protein modality, ODesign demonstrates superior controllability and performance to modality-specific baselines. Extending beyond proteins, it generalizes to nucleic acid and small-molecule design, enabling interaction types such as protein-binding RNA/DNA and RNA/DNA-binding ligands that were previously inaccessible. By unifying multimodal biomolecular interactions within a single generative framework, ODesign moves toward a general-purpose molecular world model capable of programmable design.

Alt-SNAPP exhibited rapid and stable binding to bacterial membranes, driven by electrostatic interactions with anionic lipids such as phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and cardiolipin (CL), and supported by membrane fluidity. In contrast, mammalian and red blood cell membranes, enriched in zwitterionic lipids and cholesterol, resisted peptide association entirely. Analyses of center of mass distance, partial density, hydrogen bonding, and interaction energy confirmed that SNAPP remains fully excluded from host like membranes while forming stable, multivalent interactions with bacterial bilayers. These findings provide mechanistic insight into membrane selectivity of SNAPP and offer a molecular framework for designing next generation antimicrobial polymers with minimal off target toxicity.",

In this study, we identify VPS39, a core component of the HOPS complex, as a molecular switch coordinating these processes. Genetic ablation of VPS39 not only impairs autophagic flux but also triggers cell migration through RhoA/Rac1 GTPases upregulation, consequently facilitating migrasome formation. Using super-resolution microscopy, we further demonstrate that migrasomes serve as an alternative disposal route for damaged mitochondria during VPS39-induced autophagy impairment, revealing a novel stress adaptation mechanism. Our work establishes a previously unrecognized autophagy-migrasome axis and provides direct visual evidence of organelle quality control via migrasomal extrusion. These findings position VPS39-regulated pathway switching as a potential therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative diseases characterized by autophagy dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the dynamic behavior of proteins is critical to elucidating their functional mechanisms, yet generating realistic, temporally coherent trajectories of protein ensembles remains a significant challenge. In this work, we introduce a novel hierarchical autoregressive framework for modeling protein dynamics that leverages the intrinsic multi-scale organization of molecular motions. Unlike existing methods that focus on generating static conformational ensembles or treat dynamic sampling as an independent process, our approach characterizes protein dynamics as a Markovian process. The framework employs a two-scale architecture: a low-resolution model captures slow, collective motions driving major conformational transitions, while a high-resolution model generates detailed local fluctuations conditioned on these large-scale movements. This hierarchical design ensures that the causal dependencies inherent in protein dynamics are preserved, enabling the generation of temporally coherent and physically realistic trajectories. By bridging high-level biophysical principles with state-of-the-art generative modeling, our approach provides an efficient framework for simulating protein dynamics that balances computational efficiency with physical accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Designing RNA sequences that reliably adopt specified three-dimensional structures while maintaining thermodynamic stability remains challenging for synthetic biology and therapeutics. Current inverse folding approaches optimize for sequence recovery or single structural metrics, failing to simultaneously ensure global geometry, local accuracy, and ensemble stability-three interdependent requirements for functional RNA design. This gap becomes critical when designed sequences encounter dynamic biological environments. We introduce RiboPO, a Ribonucleic acid Preference Optimization framework that addresses this multi-objective challenge through reinforcement learning from physical feedback (RLPF). RiboPO fine-tunes gRNAde by constructing preference pairs from composite physical criteria that couple global 3D fidelity and thermodynamic stability. Preferences are formed using structural gates, PLDDT geometry assessments, and thermostability proxies with variability-aware margins, and the policy is updated with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). On RNA inverse folding benchmarks, RiboPO demonstrates a superior balance of structural accuracy and stability. Compared to the best non-overlap baselines, our multi-round model improves Minimum Free Energy (MFE) by 12.3% and increases secondary-structure self-consistency (EternaFold scMCC) by 20%, while maintaining competitive 3D quality and high sequence diversity. In sampling efficiency, RiboPO achieves 11% higher pass@64 than the gRNAde base under the conjunction of multiple requirements. A multi-round variant with preference-pair reconstruction delivers additional gains on unseen RNA structures. These results establish RLPF as an effective paradigm for structure-accurate and ensemble-robust RNA design, providing a foundation for extending to complex biological objectives.",

    "abstract": "The rapid progress of graph generation has raised new security concerns, particularly regarding backdoor vulnerabilities. While prior work has explored backdoor attacks in image diffusion and unconditional graph generation, conditional, especially text-guided graph generation remains largely unexamined. This paper proposes BadGraph, a backdoor attack method against latent diffusion models for text-guided graph generation. BadGraph leverages textual triggers to poison training data, covertly implanting backdoors that induce attacker-specified subgraphs during inference when triggers appear, while preserving normal performance on clean inputs. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (PubChem, ChEBI-20, PCDes, MoMu) demonstrate the effectiveness and stealth of the attack: less than 10% poisoning rate can achieves 50% attack success rate, while 24% suffices for over 80% success rate, with negligible performance degradation on benign samples. Ablation studies further reveal that the backdoor is implanted during VAE and diffusion training rather than pretraining. These findings reveal the security vulnerabilities in latent diffusion models of text-guided graph generation, highlight the serious risks in models' applications such as drug discovery and underscore the need for robust defenses against the backdoor attack in such diffusion models.",

    "abstract": "The extracellular matrix of biofilms presents a dense and intricate architecture. Numerous biophysical properties of the matrix surrounding microbial cells contribute to the heterogeneity of biofilms and their functions at the microscale. Previous mathematical models assume the matrix to be homogeneous, often overlooking the need for a detailed mechanistic understanding of the extracellular space. In this theoretical study, we introduce a novel cell-capsule approach to investigate geometric patterns in biofilm morphology and predict their role in oxygen transport. The thickness of the capsule and the arrangement of cell-capsule patterns can influence matrix heterogeneity, providing a clear picture of biofilm structure. By incorporating the bacterial capsule as a distinct, low-diffusivity phase, our novel cell-capsule model reveals that this architecture acts as a significant 'resistance-in-series' barrier. We found that a thick capsule/dense matrix arrangement can reduce local oxygen transfer by approximately 70%, a substantial drop that may give drive further research into oxygen limitations during early stage biofilm development.",

    "abstract": "The rapid evolution of molecular dynamics (MD) methods, including machine-learned dynamics, has outpaced the development of standardized tools for method validation. Objective comparison between simulation approaches is often hindered by inconsistent evaluation metrics, insufficient sampling of rare conformational states, and the absence of reproducible benchmarks. To address these challenges, we introduce a modular benchmarking framework that systematically evaluates protein MD methods using enhanced sampling analysis. Our approach uses weighted ensemble (WE) sampling via The Weighted Ensemble Simulation Toolkit with Parallelization and Analysis (WESTPA), based on progress coordinates derived from Time-lagged Independent Component Analysis (TICA), enabling fast and efficient exploration of protein conformational space. The framework includes a flexible, lightweight propagator interface that supports arbitrary simulation engines, allowing both classical force fields and machine learning-based models. Additionally, the framework offers a comprehensive evaluation suite capable of computing more than 19 different metrics and visualizations across a variety of domains. We further contribute a dataset of nine diverse proteins, ranging from 10 to 224 residues, that span a variety of folding complexities and topologies. Each protein has been extensively simulated at 300K for one million MD steps per starting point (4 ns). To demonstrate the utility of our framework, we perform validation tests using classic MD simulations with implicit solvent and compare protein conformational sampling using a fully trained versus under-trained CGSchNet model. By standardizing evaluation protocols and enabling direct, reproducible comparisons across MD approaches, our open-source platform lays the groundwork for consistent, rigorous benchmarking across the molecular simulation community.",

One promising route to relieving data bottlenecks is through high throughput screens, which can experimentally test the activity of $10^6-10^{12}$ protein sequences in parallel. In this article, we introduce algorithms to optimize high throughput screens for data creation and model training. We focus on the large scale regime, where dataset sizes are limited by the cost of measurement and sequencing. We show that when active sequences are rare, we maximize information gain if we only collect positive examples of active sequences, i.e. $x$ with $y>0$. We can correct for the missing negative examples using a generative model of the library, producing a consistent and efficient estimate of the true $p(y | x)$. We demonstrate this approach in simulation and on a large scale screen of antibodies. Overall, co-design of experiments and inference lets us accelerate learning dramatically.",

    "abstract": "Applications of machine learning in chemistry are often limited by the scarcity and expense of labeled data, restricting traditional supervised methods. In this work, we introduce a framework for molecular reasoning using general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) that operates without requiring labeled training data. Our method anchors chain-of-thought reasoning to the molecular structure by using unique atomic identifiers. First, the LLM performs a one-shot task to identify relevant fragments and their associated chemical labels or transformation classes. In an optional second step, this position-aware information is used in a few-shot task with provided class examples to predict the chemical transformation. We apply our framework to single-step retrosynthesis, a task where LLMs have previously underperformed. Across academic benchmarks and expert-validated drug discovery molecules, our work enables LLMs to achieve high success rates in identifying chemically plausible reaction sites ($\\geq90\\%$), named reaction classes ($\\geq40\\%$), and final reactants ($\\geq74\\%$). Beyond solving complex chemical tasks, our work also provides a method to generate theoretically grounded synthetic datasets by mapping chemical knowledge onto the molecular structure and thereby addressing data scarcity.",

Existing cryo-EM heterogeneity analysis methods either lack atomic details or tend to subject to overfitting due to image noise and limited information in single views.

Combining coarse-grained MARTINI representation with atomic backmapping, CryoDyna achieves near-atomic interpretation of protein conformational landscapes. Validated on multiple simulated and experimental datasets, CryoDyna demonstrates improved modeling accuracy and robustly recovers multi-scale complex structure changes hidden in the cryo-EM particle stacks. As examples, we generated protein-RNA coordinated motions, resolved dynamics in the unseen region of RAG signal end complex, mapped translocating ribosome states in a one-shot manner, and revealed step-wise closure of a membrane-anchored protein multimer.

While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating high-level editing intentions in natural language, they often struggle to faithfully execute these modifications-particularly when operating on non-intuitive representations like SMILES. We introduce MECo, a framework that bridges reasoning and execution by translating editing actions into executable code. MECo reformulates molecular optimization for LLMs as a cascaded framework: generating human-interpretable editing intentions from a molecule and property goal, followed by translating those intentions into executable structural edits via code generation. Our approach achieves over 98% accuracy in reproducing held-out realistic edits derived from chemical reactions and target-specific compound pairs. On downstream optimization benchmarks spanning physicochemical properties and target activities, MECo substantially improves consistency by 38-86 percentage points to 90%+ and achieves higher success rates over SMILES-based baselines while preserving structural similarity. By aligning intention with execution, MECo enables consistent, controllable and interpretable molecular design, laying the foundation for high-fidelity feedback loops and collaborative human-AI workflows in drug discovery.",

    "abstract": "Background: In the Nearest-Neighbor Thermodynamic Model, a standard approach for RNA secondary structure prediction, the energy of the multiloops is modeled using a linear entropic penalty governed by three branching parameters. Although these parameters are typically fixed, recent work has shown that reparametrizing the multiloop score and considering alternative branching conformations can lead to significantly better structure predictions. However, prior approaches for exploring the alternative branching structures were computationally inefficient for long sequences.   Results: We present a novel algorithm that partitions the parameter space, identifying all distinct branching structures (optimal under different branching parameters) for a given RNA sequence using the fewest possible minimum free energy computations. Our method efficiently computes the full parameter-space partition and the associated optimal structures, enabling a comprehensive evaluation of the structural landscape across parameter choices. We apply this algorithm to the Archive II benchmarking dataset, assessing the maximum attainable prediction accuracy for each sequence under the reparameterized multiloop model. We find that the potential for improvement over default predictions is substantial in many cases, and that the optimal prediction accuracy is highly sensitive to auxiliary modeling decisions, such as the treatment of lonely base pairs and dangling ends.   Conclusion: Our results support the hypothesis that the conventional choice of multiloop parameters may limit prediction accuracy and that exploring alternative parameterizations is both tractable and worthwhile. The efficient partitioning algorithm we introduce makes this exploration feasible for longer sequences and larger datasets. Furthermore, we identify several open challenges in identifying the optimal structure.",

    "abstract": "Deciphering the function of unseen protein sequences is a fundamental challenge with broad scientific impact, yet most existing methods depend on task-specific adapters or large-scale supervised fine-tuning. We introduce the \"Protein-as-Second-Language\" framework, which reformulates amino-acid sequences as sentences in a novel symbolic language that large language models can interpret through contextual exemplars. Our approach adaptively constructs sequence-question-answer triples that reveal functional cues in a zero-shot setting, without any further training. To support this process, we curate a bilingual corpus of 79,926 protein-QA instances spanning attribute prediction, descriptive understanding, and extended reasoning. Empirically, our method delivers consistent gains across diverse open-source LLMs and GPT-4, achieving up to 17.2% ROUGE-L improvement (average +7%) and even surpassing fine-tuned protein-specific language models. These results highlight that generic LLMs, when guided with protein-as-language cues, can outperform domain-specialized models, offering a scalable pathway for protein understanding in foundation models.",

    "abstract": "Generative modeling techniques such as Diffusion and Flow Matching have achieved significant successes in generating designable and diverse protein backbones. However, many current models are computationally expensive, requiring hundreds or even thousands of function evaluations (NFEs) to yield samples of acceptable quality, which can become a bottleneck in practical design campaigns that often generate $10^4\\ -\\ 10^6$ designs per target. In image generation, Rectified Flows (ReFlow) can significantly reduce the required NFEs for a given target quality, but their application in protein backbone generation has been less studied. We apply ReFlow to improve the low NFE performance of pretrained SE(3) flow matching models for protein backbone generation and systematically study ReFlow design choices in the context of protein generation in data curation, training and inference time settings. In particular, we (1) show that ReFlow in the protein domain is particularly sensitive to the choice of coupling generation and annealing, (2) demonstrate how useful design choices for ReFlow in the image domain do not directly translate to better performance on proteins, and (3) make improvements to ReFlow methodology for proteins.",

    "abstract": "The rapid adoption of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in the biosciences is transforming biotechnology, medicine, and synthetic biology. Yet this advancement is intrinsically linked to new vulnerabilities, as GenAI lowers the barrier to misuse and introduces novel biosecurity threats, such as generating synthetic viral proteins or toxins. These dual-use risks are often overlooked, as existing safety guardrails remain fragile and can be circumvented through deceptive prompts or jailbreak techniques. In this Perspective, we first outline the current state of GenAI in the biosciences and emerging threat vectors ranging from jailbreak attacks and privacy risks to the dual-use challenges posed by autonomous AI agents. We then examine urgent gaps in regulation and oversight, drawing on insights from 130 expert interviews across academia, government, industry, and policy. A large majority ($\\approx 76$\\%) expressed concern over AI misuse in biology, and 74\\% called for the development of new governance frameworks. Finally, we explore technical pathways to mitigation, advocating a multi-layered approach to GenAI safety. These defenses include rigorous data filtering, alignment with ethical principles during development, and real-time monitoring to block harmful requests. Together, these strategies provide a blueprint for embedding security throughout the GenAI lifecycle. As GenAI becomes integrated into the biosciences, safeguarding this frontier requires an immediate commitment to both adaptive governance and secure-by-design technologies.",

We frame calibration as a constrained optimization problem and seek the closest model in Kullback-Leibler divergence satisfying calibration constraints.

We demonstrate that these approaches substantially reduce calibration error across hundreds of simultaneous constraints and models with up to one billion parameters, spanning applications in protein design, image generation, and language modeling.",

    "abstract": "Biomolecular interaction modeling has been substantially advanced by foundation models, yet they often produce all-atom structures that violate basic steric feasibility. We address this limitation by enforcing physical validity as a strict constraint during both training and inference with a uniffed module. At its core is a differentiable projection that maps the provisional atom coordinates from the diffusion model to the nearest physically valid conffguration. This projection is achieved using a Gauss-Seidel scheme, which exploits the locality and sparsity of the constraints to ensure stable and fast convergence at scale. By implicit differentiation to obtain gradients, our module integrates seamlessly into existing frameworks for end-to-end ffnetuning. With our Gauss-Seidel projection module in place, two denoising steps are sufffcient to produce biomolecular complexes that are both physically valid and structurally accurate. Across six benchmarks, our 2-step model achieves the same structural accuracy as state-of-the-art 200-step diffusion baselines, delivering approximately 10 times faster wall-clock speed while guaranteeing physical validity.",

    "abstract": "Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are a leading cause of preventable adverse events, often complicating treatment and increasing healthcare costs. At the same time, knowing which drugs do not interact is equally important, as such knowledge supports safer prescriptions and better patient outcomes. In this study, we propose an interpretable and efficient framework that blends modern machine learning with domain knowledge to improve DDI prediction. Our approach combines two complementary molecular embeddings - Mol2Vec, which captures fragment-level structural patterns, and SMILES-BERT, which learns contextual chemical features - together with a leakage-free, rule-based clinical score (RBScore) that injects pharmacological knowledge without relying on interaction labels. A lightweight neural classifier is then optimized using a novel three-stage metaheuristic strategy (RSmpl-ACO-PSO), which balances global exploration and local refinement for stable performance. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that the model achieves high predictive accuracy (ROC-AUC 0.911, PR-AUC 0.867 on DrugBank) and generalizes well to a clinically relevant Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus cohort. Beyond raw performance, studies show how embedding fusion, RBScore, and the optimizer each contribute to precision and robustness. Together, these results highlight a practical pathway for building reliable, interpretable, and computationally efficient models that can support safer drug therapies and clinical decision-making.",

Across multiple neoantigen benchmarks, PhysicoGPTCR substantially improves edit-distance, similarity, and longest-common-subsequence scores, while populating a broader region of sequence space. Blind in-silico docking and structural modelling further reveal a higher proportion of binding-competent clones than the strongest baseline, validating the benefit of explicit context conditioning and physicochemical awareness.

Accurate identification of this small yet critical region can accelerate the development of therapeutic antibodies. Determining paratope locations typically relies on modeling the antibody structure, which is computationally intensive and difficult to scale across large antibody repertoires. We introduce Paraplume, a sequence-based paratope prediction method that leverages embeddings from protein language models (PLMs), without the need for structural input and achieves superior performance across multiple benchmarks compared to current methods. In addition, reweighting PLM embeddings using Paraplume predictions yields more informative sequence representations, improving downstream tasks such as affinity prediction, binder classification, and epitope binning. Applied to large antibody repertoires, Paraplume reveals that antigen-specific somatic hypermutations are associated with larger paratopes, suggesting a potential mechanism for affinity enhancement. Our findings position PLM-based paratope prediction as a powerful, scalable alternative to structure-dependent approaches, opening new avenues for understanding antibody evolution.",

    "abstract": "DNA frequently adopts liquid-crystalline conformations in both cells and viruses. The Oseen--Frank framework provides a powerful continuum description of these phases through three elastic moduli: splay ($K_1$), twist or cholesteric ($K_2$), and bending ($K_3$). While $K_1$ is typically assumed to dominate, the relative magnitude of $K_2$ and $K_3$ in confined DNA remains poorly understood. Here, we combine cryo-electron microscopy, liquid-crystal modeling, and knot theory to quantify this relationship in bacteriophage P4, whose genome is partially organized in a spool-like liquid-crystalline phase. We first show experimentally that the ordered DNA occupies three concentric layers within the capsid. We then formulate an Oseen--Frank model for this geometry and use it, together with the measured layer radii, to estimate the elastic ratio $α= K_3/K_2$. We find $α\\approx 0.0064$, indicating that twist elasticity overwhelmingly dominates bending. To validate this result, we perform Langevin dynamics simulations of DNA trajectories and classify the resulting knots. The predicted knot distribution agrees with experimental data from P4, demonstrating consistency between elasticity, topology, and observed genome organization.",

The model supports de novo generation, pharmacophore-conditional sampling, fragment elaboration, and multi-endpoint affinity prediction (pIC50, pKi, pKd, pEC50). Training combines large-scale ligand libraries with mixed-fidelity protein-ligand complexes, followed by refinement on curated co-crystal datasets and parameter-efficient finetuning for project-specific adaptation. FLOWR:root achieves state-of-the-art performance in unconditional 3D molecule generation and pocket-conditional ligand design, producing geometrically realistic, low-strain structures. The integrated affinity prediction module demonstrates superior accuracy on the SPINDR test set and outperforms recent models on the Schrodinger FEP+/OpenFE benchmark with substantial speed advantages. As a foundation model, FLOWR:root requires finetuning on project-specific datasets to account for unseen structure-activity landscapes, yielding strong correlation with experimental data. Joint generation and affinity prediction enable inference-time scaling through importance sampling, steering molecular design toward higher-affinity compounds. Case studies validate this: selective CK2$α$ ligand generation against CLK3 shows significant correlation between predicted and quantum-mechanical binding energies, while ER$α$, TYK2 and BACE1 scaffold elaboration demonstrates strong agreement with QM calculations.

In this work, we investigate whether pure, unmodified Transformers trained directly on Cartesian coordinates$\\unicode{x2013}$without predefined graphs or physical priors$\\unicode{x2013}$can approximate molecular energies and forces. As a starting point for our analysis, we demonstrate how to train a Transformer to competitive energy and force mean absolute errors under a matched training compute budget, relative to a state-of-the-art equivariant GNN on the OMol25 dataset. We discover that the Transformer learns physically consistent patterns$\\unicode{x2013}$such as attention weights that decay inversely with interatomic distance$\\unicode{x2013}$and flexibly adapts them across different molecular environments due to the absence of hard-coded biases. The use of a standard Transformer also unlocks predictable improvements with respect to scaling training resources, consistent with empirical scaling laws observed in other domains. Our results demonstrate that many favorable properties of GNNs can emerge adaptively in Transformers, challenging the necessity of hard-coded graph inductive biases and pointing toward standardized, scalable architectures for molecular modeling.",

We show that this problem in its QUBO form can be swiftly and consistently solved for chain length 48, using either classical simulated annealing or hybrid quantum-classical annealing on a D-Wave system. In fact, the latter computations required about 10 seconds. We also test linear and quadratic programming methods, which work well for a lattice gas but struggle with chain constraints.

    "title": "From Supervision to Exploration: What Does Protein Language Model Learn During Reinforcement Learning?",
    "abstract": "Protein language models (PLMs) have advanced computational protein science through large-scale pretraining and scalable architectures. In parallel, reinforcement learning (RL) has broadened exploration and enabled precise multi-objective optimization in protein design. Yet whether RL can push PLMs beyond their pretraining priors to uncover latent sequence-structure-function rules remains unclear. We address this by pairing RL with PLMs across four domains: antimicrobial peptide design, kinase variant optimization, antibody engineering, and inverse folding. Using diverse RL algorithms and model classes, we ask if RL improves sampling efficiency and, more importantly, if it reveals capabilities not captured by supervised learning. Across benchmarks, RL consistently boosts success rates and sample efficiency. Performance follows a three-factor interaction: task headroom, reward fidelity, and policy capacity jointly determine gains. When rewards are accurate and informative, policies have sufficient capacity, and tasks leave room beyond supervised baselines, improvements scale; when rewards are noisy or capacity is constrained, gains saturate despite exploration. This view yields practical guidance for RL in protein design: prioritize reward modeling and calibration before scaling policy size, match algorithm and regularization strength to task difficulty, and allocate capacity where marginal gains are largest.

Advances in time-dependent and time-resolved experimental methods have made it possible to capture the dynamics of biomolecules at increasingly higher spatial and temporal resolutions. To complement these, computational models can represent the structural and dynamical behaviour of biomolecules at atomistic resolution and femtosecond timescale, and are therefore useful to interpret these experiments. Here, we review the progress in integrating simulations with dynamical experiments, focusing on the combination of simulations with time-resolved and time-dependent experimental data.",

    "abstract": "Peptide drugs incorporating non-standard amino acids (NSAAs) offer improved binding affinity and improved pharmacological properties. However, existing peptide design methods are limited to standard amino acids, leaving NSAA-aware design largely unexplored. We introduce NS-Pep, a unified framework for co-designing peptide sequences and structures with NSAAs. The main challenge is that NSAAs are extremely underrepresented-even the most frequent one, SEP, accounts for less than 0.4% of residues-resulting in a severe long-tailed distribution. To improve generalization to rare amino acids, we propose Residue Frequency-Guided Modification (RFGM), which mitigates over-penalization through frequency-aware logit calibration, supported by both theoretical and empirical analysis. Furthermore, we identify that insufficient side-chain modeling limits geometric representation of NSAAs. To address this, we introduce Progressive Side-chain Perception (PSP) for coarse-to-fine torsion and location prediction, and Interaction-Aware Weighting (IAW) to emphasize pocket-proximal residues. Moreover, NS-Pep generalizes naturally to the peptide folding task with NSAAs, addressing a major limitation of current tools. Experiments show that NS-Pep improves sequence recovery rate and binding affinity by 6.23% and 5.12%, respectively, and outperforms AlphaFold3 by 17.76% in peptide folding success rate.",

Building on Rectified Discrete Flows (ReDi), AReUReDi combines Tchebycheff scalarization, locally balanced proposals, and annealed Metropolis-Hastings updates to bias sampling toward Pareto-optimal states while preserving distributional invariance. Applied to peptide and SMILES sequence design, AReUReDi simultaneously optimizes up to five therapeutic properties (including affinity, solubility, hemolysis, half-life, and non-fouling) and outperforms both evolutionary and diffusion-based baselines. These results establish AReUReDi as a powerful, sequence-based framework for multi-property biomolecule generation.",

Current approaches to protein structure tokenization rely on bespoke components that are invariant to spatial symmetries, but that are challenging to optimize and scale. We present Kanzi, a flow-based tokenizer for tokenization and generation of protein structures. Kanzi consists of a diffusion autoencoder trained with a flow matching loss. We show that this approach simplifies several aspects of protein structure tokenizers: frame-based representations can be replaced with global coordinates, complex losses are replaced with a single flow matching loss, and SE(3)-invariant attention operations can be replaced with standard attention. We find that these changes stabilize the training of parameter-efficient models that outperform existing tokenizers on reconstruction metrics at a fraction of the model size and training cost. An autoregressive model trained with Kanzi outperforms similar generative models that operate over tokens, although it does not yet match the performance of state-of-the-art continuous diffusion models.

We investigate whether thin contrastive bridges, lightweight projection heads over frozen unimodal encoders can align chemical and textual representations without training a full multimodal model. Using paired mechanisms from ChEMBL, we align ECFP4 molecular fingerprints with biomedical sentence embeddings through dual linear projections trained with a contrastive objective. To better handle drugs sharing the same therapeutic target, we incorporate hard negative weighting and a margin loss. Evaluation under scaffold based splits, which require generalization across disjoint chemical cores, demonstrates that our approach achieves non-trivial cross modal alignment and substantially improves within target discrimination compared to frozen baselines. These results suggest that thin bridges offer a compute efficient alternative to large scale multimodal pretraining, enabling scaffold aware drug text alignment and target specific retrieval in precision medicine.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in structure-based protein design have accelerated de novo binder generation, yet interfaces on large domains or spanning multiple domains remain challenging due to high computational cost and declining success with increasing target size. We hypothesized that protein folding neural networks (PFNNs) operate in a ``local-first'' manner, prioritizing local interactions while displaying limited sensitivity to global foldability. Guided by this hypothesis, we propose an epitope-only strategy that retains only the discontinuous surface residues surrounding the binding site. Compared to intact-domain workflows, this approach improves in silico success rates by up to 80% and reduces the average time per successful design by up to forty-fold, enabling binder design against previously intractable targets such as ClpP and ALS3. Building on this foundation, we further developed a tailored pipeline that incorporates a Monte Carlo-based evolution step to overcome local minima and a position-specific biased inverse folding step to refine sequence patterns. Together, these advances not only establish a generalizable framework for efficient binder design against structurally large and otherwise inaccessible targets, but also support the broader ``local-first'' hypothesis as a guiding principle for PFNN-based design.",

To overcome this challenge, we introduce TRee Search Guided TRajectory-Aware Fine-Tuning for Discrete Diffusion (TR2-D2), a novel framework that optimizes reward-guided discrete diffusion trajectories with tree search to construct replay buffers for trajectory-aware fine-tuning. These buffers are generated using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and subsequently used to fine-tune a pre-trained discrete diffusion model under a stochastic optimal control objective.

However, the need for fine-grained integration and the long timescales of biomolecular events make MD computationally expensive. To address this, several generative models have been proposed to generate surrogate trajectories at lower cost.

We introduce a new class of generative models, MSM Emulators, which instead learn to sample transitions across discrete states defined by an underlying Markov State Model (MSM). We instantiate this class with Markov Space Flow Matching (MarS-FM), whose sampling offers more than two orders of magnitude speedup compared to implicit- or explicit-solvent MD simulations. We benchmark Mars-FM ability to reproduce MD statistics through structural observables such as RMSD, radius of gyration, and secondary structure content. Our evaluation spans protein domains (up to 500 residues) with significant chemical and structural diversity, including unfolding events, and enforces strict sequence dissimilarity between training and test sets to assess generalization.

    "abstract": "Structural prediction of protein-protein interactions is important to understand the molecular basis of cellular interactions, but it still faces major challenges when significant conformational changes are present. We propose a generative framework of hierarchical adaptive diffusion to improve accuracy and efficiency in such cases. It is hierarchical in separating global inter-protein rigid-body motions and local intra-protein flexibility in diffusion processes, and the distinct local and global noise schedules are designed to mimic the induced-fit effect. It is adaptive in conditioning the local flexibility schedule on predicted levels of conformational change, allowing faster flexing for larger anticipated conformational changes. Furthermore, it couples the local and global diffusion processes through a common score and confidence network with sequence, evolution, structure, and dynamics features as inputs, and maintains rotational or translational invariance or equivariance in outputs. It builds on our newly curated DIPS-AF dataset of nearly 39,000 examples for pre-training. Experiments on the independent docking benchmark dataset DB5.5 show that our model outperforms an AlphaFold2-like iterative transformer (GeoDock) and a diffusion model (DiffDock-PP) in both rigid and flexible cases, with larger improvements in more flexible cases. Ablation studies prove the importance of adaptive schedules, dynamics features, and pre-training. Additional analyses and case studies reveal remaining gaps in sampling, scoring, and conformational resolution.",

Built on the complete ZINC-22 fragment subset comprising over 62 million molecules, it achieves unprecedented coverage of fragment chemical space. Our GPT-2 based model (42.7M parameters) generates 99.90% chemically valid fragments. Validation across 12 descriptors and three fingerprint methods shows generated fragments closely match the training distribution (all effect sizes < 0.4). The model retains 53.6% of known ZINC fragments while producing 22% novel structures with practical relevance.

    "title": "A Novel Mathematical Model of Protein Interactions from the Perspective of Electron Delocalization",
    "abstract": "Proteins are the workhorse molecules of the cell and perform their biological functions by binding to other molecules through physical contact. Protein function is then regulated through coupling of bindings on the protein (allosteric regulation). Just as the genetic code provides the blueprint for protein synthesis, the coupling is thought to provide the basis for protein communication and interaction. However, it is not yet fully understood how binding of a molecule at one site affects binding of another molecule at another distal site on a protein, even more than $60$ years after its discovery in 1961. In this paper, I propose a simple mathematical model of protein interactions, using a ``quantized'' version of differential geometry, i.e., the discrete differential geometry of $n$-simplices. The model is based on the concept of electron delocalization, one of the main features of quantum chemistry, Allosteric regulation then follows tautologically from the definition of interactions. No prior knowledge of conventional discrete differential geometry, protein science, or quantum chemistry is required. I hope this paper will provide a starting point for many mathematicians to study chemistry and molecular biology.",

    "abstract": "Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is the most common neuropathic disorder; however, its pathogenesis remains unclear. A prevailing theory suggests that nitric oxide (NO) may induce nerve compression and irritation via vascular dilation, thereby being responsible for the condition, making real-time detection of generated NO critical. However, traditional evaluations of NO rely on indirect colorimetric or chemiluminescence techniques, which offer limited sensitivity and spatial resolution for its real-time assessment in biological environments. Herein, we reported the development of a highly sensitive NO electrochemical biosensor based cerium single-atom nanozyme (Ce1-CN) with ultrawide linear range from 1.08 nM to 143.9 μM, and ultralow detection limit of 0.36 nM, which enables efficient and real-time evaluation of NO in TN rats. In-situ attenuated total reflection surface-enhanced infrared spectroscopy combined with density functional theory calculations revealed the high-performance biosensing mechanism, whereby the Ce centers in Ce1-CN nanoenzymes adsorb NO and subsequently react with OH- to form *HNO2. Results demonstrated that NO concentration was associated with TN onset. Following carbamazepine treatment, NO production from nerves decreased, accompanied by an alleviation of pain. These findings indicate that the biosensor serves as a valuable tool for investigating the pathogenesis of TN and guiding subsequent therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "The goal of protein design is to generate amino acid sequences that fold into functional structures with desired properties. Prior methods combining autoregressive language models with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) struggle with long-range dependencies and suffer from an impractically large search space. We propose MCTD-ME, Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion with Multiple Experts, which integrates masked diffusion models with tree search to enable multi-token planning and efficient exploration. Unlike autoregressive planners, MCTD-ME uses biophysical-fidelity-enhanced diffusion denoising as the rollout engine, jointly revising multiple positions and scaling to large sequence spaces. It further leverages experts of varying capacities to enrich exploration, guided by a pLDDT-based masking schedule that targets low-confidence regions while preserving reliable residues. We propose a novel multi-expert selection rule (PH-UCT-ME) extends predictive-entropy UCT to expert ensembles. On the inverse folding task (CAMEO and PDB benchmarks), MCTD-ME outperforms single-expert and unguided baselines in both sequence recovery (AAR) and structural similarity (scTM), with gains increasing for longer proteins and benefiting from multi-expert guidance. More generally, the framework is model-agnostic and applicable beyond inverse folding, including de novo protein engineering and multi-objective molecular generation.",

Hardware implementations of spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a promising alternative for low-power, fast, event-driven processing. This study compares hardware compatible SNN models with various traditional ML ones, using an open-source multimodal dataset. Our results show that multimodal integration improves accuracy, with SNN performance comparable to the ML one, demonstrating their potential for real-time implementations of cognitive load detection.

    "abstract": "A device capable of performing real time classification of proteins in a clinical setting would allow for inexpensive and rapid disease diagnosis. One such candidate for this technology are nanopore devices. These devices work by measuring a current signal that arises when a protein or peptide enters a nanometer-length-scale pore. Should this current be uniquely related to the structure of the peptide and its interactions with the pore, the signals can be used to perform identification. While such a method would allow for real time identification of peptides and proteins in a clinical setting, to date, the complexities of these signals limit their accuracy. In this work, we tackle the issue of classification by converting the current signals into scaleogram images via wavelet transforms, capturing amplitude, frequency, and time information in a modality well-suited to machine learning algorithms. When tested on 42 peptides, our method achieved a classification accuracy of ~$81\\,\\%$, setting a new state-of-the-art in the field and taking a step toward practical peptide/protein diagnostics at the point of care. In addition, we demonstrate model transfer techniques that will be critical when deploying these models into real hardware, paving the way to a new method for real-time disease diagnosis.",

Here we present ApexAmphion, a deep-learning framework for de novo design of antibiotics that couples a 6.4-billion-parameter protein language model with reinforcement learning. The model is first fine-tuned on curated peptide data to capture antimicrobial sequence regularities, then optimised with proximal policy optimization against a composite reward that combines predictions from a learned minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) classifier with differentiable physicochemical objectives. In vitro evaluation of 100 designed peptides showed low MIC values (nanomolar range in some cases) for all candidates (100% hit rate). Moreover, 99 our of 100 compounds exhibited broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against at least two clinically relevant bacteria. The lead molecules killed bacteria primarily by potently targeting the cytoplasmic membrane. By unifying generation, scoring and multi-objective optimization with deep reinforcement learning in a single pipeline, our approach rapidly produces diverse, potent candidates, offering a scalable route to peptide antibiotics and a platform for iterative steering toward potency and developability within hours.",

    "abstract": "Unraveling the dynamical motions of biomolecules is essential for bridging their structure and function, yet it remains a major computational challenge. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation provides a detailed depiction of biomolecular motion, but its high-resolution temporal evolution comes at significant computational cost, limiting its applicability to timescales of biological relevance. Deep learning approaches have emerged as promising solutions to overcome these computational limitations by learning to predict long-timescale dynamics. However, generalizable kinetics models for proteins remain largely unexplored, and the fundamental limits of achievable acceleration while preserving dynamical accuracy are poorly understood. In this work, we fill this gap with DeepJump, an Euclidean-Equivariant Flow Matching-based model for predicting protein conformational dynamics across multiple temporal scales. We train DeepJump on trajectories of the diverse proteins of mdCATH, systematically studying our model's performance in generalizing to long-term dynamics of fast-folding proteins and characterizing the trade-off between computational acceleration and prediction accuracy. We demonstrate the application of DeepJump to ab initio folding, showcasing prediction of folding pathways and native states. Our results demonstrate that DeepJump achieves significant $\\approx$1000$\\times$ computational acceleration while effectively recovering long-timescale dynamics, providing a stepping stone for enabling routine simulation of proteins.",

The initial step of fragment identification remains challenging, as fragments often bind weakly and non-specifically. We developed a protein-fragment encoder that relies on a contrastive learning approach to map both molecular fragments and protein surfaces in a shared latent space. The encoder captures interaction-relevant features and allows to perform virtual screening as well as generative design with our new method LatentFrag. In LatentFrag, fragment embeddings and positions are generated conditioned on the protein surface while being chemically realistic by construction. Our expressive fragment and protein representations allow location of protein-fragment interaction sites with high sensitivity and we observe state-of-the-art fragment recovery rates when sampling from the learned distribution of latent fragment embeddings. Our generative method outperforms common methods such as virtual screening at a fraction of its computational cost providing a valuable starting point for fragment hit discovery. We further show the practical utility of LatentFrag and extend the workflow to full ligand design tasks. Together, these approaches contribute to advancing fragment identification and provide valuable tools for fragment-based drug discovery.",

In this study, we introduce a novel workflow for the procedural generation and validation of synthetic protein-ligand complexes, combining a diverse ensemble of generation techniques and rigorous quality control. We assessed the utility of these synthetic datasets by retraining established docking models, Smina and Gnina, and evaluating their performance on standard benchmarks including the PDBBind core set and the PoseBusters dataset. Our results demonstrate that models trained on synthetic data achieve performance comparable to models trained on experimental data, indicating that current synthetic complexes can effectively capture many salient features of protein-ligand interactions. However, we did not observe significant improvements in docking or scoring accuracy over conventional methods or experimental data augmentation. These findings highlight the promise as well as the current limitations of synthetic data for deep learning-based molecular docking and underscore the need for further refinement in generation methodologies and evaluation strategies to fully exploit the potential of synthetic datasets for this application.",

    "abstract": "In structure-based drug design, accurately estimating the binding affinity between a candidate ligand and its protein receptor is a central challenge. Recent advances in artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning, have demonstrated superior performance over traditional empirical and physics-based methods for this task, enabled by the growing availability of structural and experimental affinity data. In this work, we introduce DeepGGL, a deep convolutional neural network that integrates residual connections and an attention mechanism within a geometric graph learning framework. By leveraging multiscale weighted colored bipartite subgraphs, DeepGGL effectively captures fine-grained atom-level interactions in protein-ligand complexes across multiple scales. We benchmarked DeepGGL against established models on CASF-2013 and CASF-2016, where it achieved state-of-the-art performance with significant improvements across diverse evaluation metrics. To further assess robustness and generalization, we tested the model on the CSAR-NRC-HiQ dataset and the PDBbind v2019 holdout set. DeepGGL consistently maintained high predictive accuracy, highlighting its adaptability and reliability for binding affinity prediction in structure-based drug discovery.",

However, enzyme turnover rates remain scarce across most organisms due to the high cost and complexity of experimental measurements. To address this gap, we propose a multimodal framework for predicting the enzyme turnover rate by integrating enzyme sequences, substrate structures, and environmental factors. Our model combines a pre-trained language model and a convolutional neural network to extract features from protein sequences, while a graph neural network captures informative representations from substrate molecules. An attention mechanism is incorporated to enhance interactions between enzyme and substrate representations. Furthermore, we leverage symbolic regression via Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks to explicitly learn mathematical formulas that govern the enzyme turnover rate, enabling interpretable and accurate predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms both traditional and state-of-the-art deep learning approaches.

    "abstract": "Protein-ligand binding affinity is critical in drug discovery, but experimentally determining it is time-consuming and expensive. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been used to predict binding affinity, significantly accelerating this process. However, the high-performance requirements and vast datasets involved in affinity prediction demand increasingly large AI models, requiring substantial computational resources and training time. Quantum machine learning has emerged as a promising solution to these challenges. In particular, hybrid quantum-classical models can reduce the number of parameters while maintaining or improving performance compared to classical counterparts. Despite these advantages, challenges persist: why hybrid quantum models achieve these benefits, whether quantum neural networks (QNNs) can replace classical neural networks, and whether such models are feasible on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. This study addresses these challenges by proposing a hybrid quantum neural network (HQNN) that empirically demonstrates the capability to approximate non-linear functions in the latent feature space derived from classical embedding. The primary goal of this study is to achieve a parameter-efficient model in binding affinity prediction while ensuring feasibility on NISQ devices. Numerical results indicate that HQNN achieves comparable or superior performance and parameter efficiency compared to classical neural networks, underscoring its potential as a viable replacement. This study highlights the potential of hybrid QML in computational drug discovery, offering insights into its applicability and advantages in addressing the computational challenges of protein-ligand binding affinity prediction.",

    "abstract": "Fragment-Based Drug Discovery (FBDD) is a popular approach in early drug development, but designing effective linkers to combine disconnected molecular fragments into chemically and pharmacologically viable candidates remains challenging. Further complexity arises when fragments contain structural redundancies, like duplicate rings, which cannot be addressed by simply adding or removing atoms or bonds. To address these challenges in a unified framework, we introduce FragmentGPT, which integrates two core components: (1) a novel chemically-aware, energy-based bond cleavage pre-training strategy that equips the GPT-based model with fragment growing, linking, and merging capabilities, and (2) a novel Reward Ranked Alignment with Expert Exploration (RAE) algorithm that combines expert imitation learning for diversity enhancement, data selection and augmentation for Pareto and composite score optimality, and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to align the learner policy with multi-objective goals. Conditioned on fragment pairs, FragmentGPT generates linkers that connect diverse molecular subunits while simultaneously optimizing for multiple pharmaceutical goals. It also learns to resolve structural redundancies-such as duplicated fragments-through intelligent merging, enabling the synthesis of optimized molecules. FragmentGPT facilitates controlled, goal-driven molecular assembly. Experiments and ablation studies on real-world cancer datasets demonstrate its ability to generate chemically valid, high-quality molecules tailored for downstream drug discovery tasks.",

    "abstract": "Strategies to improve the predicting performance of Message-Passing Neural-Networks for molecular property predictions can be achieved by simplifying how the message is passed and by using descriptors that capture multiple aspects of molecular graphs. In this work, we designed model architectures that achieved state-of-the-art performance, surpassing more complex models such as those pre-trained on external databases. We assessed dataset diversity to complement our performance results, finding that structural diversity influences the need for additional components in our MPNNs and feature sets.   In most datasets, our best architecture employs bidirectional message-passing with an attention mechanism, applied to a minimalist message formulation that excludes self-perception, highlighting that relatively simpler models, compared to classical MPNNs, yield higher class separability. In contrast, we found that convolution normalization factors do not benefit the predictive power in all the datasets tested. This was corroborated in both global and node-level outputs. Additionally, we analyzed the influence of both adding spatial features and working with 3D graphs, finding that 2D molecular graphs are sufficient when complemented with appropriately chosen 3D descriptors. This approach not only preserves predictive performance but also reduces computational cost by over 50%, making it particularly advantageous for high-throughput screening campaigns.",

    "abstract": "Bacteriophages, viruses that infect bacteria, store their micron long DNA inside an icosahedral capsid with a typical diameter of 40 nm to 100 nm. Consistent with experimental observations, such confinement conditions induce an arrangement of DNA that corresponds to a hexagonal chromonic liquid-crystalline phase, and increase the topological complexity of the genome in the form of knots. A mathematical model that implements a chromonic liquid-crystalline phase and that captures the changes in topology has been lacking. We adopt a mathematical model that represents the viral DNA as a pair of a vector field and a line. The vector field is a minimizer of the total Oseen-Frank energy for nematic liquid crystals under chromonic constraints, while the line is identified with the tangent to the field at selected locations, representing the central axis of the DNA molecule. The fact that the Oseen-Frank functional assigns infinite energy to topological defects (point defects in two dimensions and line defects in three dimensions) precludes the presence of singularities and, in particular, of knot structures. To address this issue, we begin with the optimal vector field and helical line, and propose a new algorithm to introduce knots through stochastic perturbations associated with splay and twist deformations, modeled by means of a Langevin system. We conclude by comparing knot distributions generated by the model and by interpreting them in the context of previously published experimental results. Altogether, this work relies on the synergy of modeling, analysis and computation in the study of viral DNA organization in capsids.",

    "abstract": "The complementarity-determining regions of antibodies are loop structures that are key to their interactions with antigens, and of high importance to the design of novel biologics. Since the 1980s, categorizing the diversity of CDR structures into canonical clusters has enabled the identification of key structural motifs of antibodies. However, existing approaches have limited coverage and cannot be readily incorporated into protein foundation models. Here we introduce ImmunoGlobulin LOOp Tokenizer, Igloo, a multimodal antibody loop tokenizer that encodes backbone dihedral angles and sequence. Igloo is trained using a contrastive learning objective to map loops with similar backbone dihedral angles closer together in latent space. Igloo can efficiently retrieve the closest matching loop structures from a structural antibody database, outperforming existing methods on identifying similar H3 loops by 5.9\\%. Igloo assigns tokens to all loops, addressing the limited coverage issue of canonical clusters, while retaining the ability to recover canonical loop conformations. To demonstrate the versatility of Igloo tokens, we show that they can be incorporated into protein language models with IglooLM and IglooALM. On predicting binding affinity of heavy chain variants, IglooLM outperforms the base protein language model on 8 out of 10 antibody-antigen targets. Additionally, it is on par with existing state-of-the-art sequence-based and multimodal protein language models, performing comparably to models with $7\\times$ more parameters. IglooALM samples antibody loops which are diverse in sequence and more consistent in structure than state-of-the-art antibody inverse folding models. Igloo demonstrates the benefit of introducing multimodal tokens for antibody loops for encoding the diverse landscape of antibody loops, improving protein foundation models, and for antibody CDR design.",

Our experiments reveal nearly equal phase composition regardless of the proton/deuterium isotope balance.

For α-chain generation, transfer learning improves predicted binding, length realism and diversity over representative methods. Full-length assembly from known or de novo CDR3s preserves k-mer spectra, yields low edit distances to references, and, in paired α/\\b{eta} co-modelling with epitope, attains higher pTM/ipTM than single-chain settings.

    "abstract": "Antibody binding site prediction plays a pivotal role in computational immunology and therapeutic antibody design. Existing sequence or structure methods rely on single-view features and fail to identify antibody-specific binding sites on the antigens. In this paper, we propose \\textbf{CAME-AB}, a novel Cross-modality Attention framework with a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) backbone for robust antibody binding site prediction. CAME-AB integrates five biologically grounded modalities, including raw amino acid encodings, BLOSUM substitution profiles, pretrained language model embeddings, structure-aware features, and GCN-refined biochemical graphs, into a unified multimodal representation. To enhance adaptive cross-modal reasoning, we propose an \\emph{adaptive modality fusion} module that learns to dynamically weight each modality based on its global relevance and input-specific contribution. A Transformer encoder combined with an MoE module further promotes feature specialization and capacity expansion. We additionally incorporate a supervised contrastive learning objective to explicitly shape the latent space geometry, encouraging intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. To improve optimization stability and generalization, we apply stochastic weight averaging during training. Extensive experiments on benchmark antibody-antigen datasets demonstrate that CAME-AB consistently outperforms strong baselines on multiple metrics, including Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC, and MCC. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of each architectural component and the benefit of multimodal feature integration.

We show for the first time the benefits of physics-informed pre-training to train a surrogate MMGBSA model on a collection of over 1.4 million 3D trajectories collected from MD simulations of the CASF-2016 benchmark. SurGBSA demonstrates a dramatic 27,927x speedup versus a traditional physics-based single-point MMGBSA calculation while nearly matching single-point MMGBSA accuracy on the challenging pose ranking problem for identification of the correct top pose (-0.4% difference). Our work advances the development of molecular foundation models by showing model improvements when training on MD simulations. Models, code and training data are made publicly available.",

    "title": "Beyond Ensembles: Simulating All-Atom Protein Dynamics in a Learned Latent Space",
    "abstract": "Simulating the long-timescale dynamics of biomolecules is a central challenge in computational science. While enhanced sampling methods can accelerate these simulations, they rely on pre-defined collective variables that are often difficult to identify, restricting their ability to model complex switching mechanisms between metastable states. A recent generative model, LD-FPG, demonstrated that this problem could be bypassed by learning to sample the static equilibrium ensemble as all-atom deformations from a reference structure, establishing a powerful method for all-atom ensemble generation. However, while this approach successfully captures a system's probable conformations, it does not model the temporal evolution between them. We introduce the Graph Latent Dynamics Propagator (GLDP), a modular component for simulating dynamics within the learned latent space of LD-FPG. We then compare three classes of propagators: (i) score-guided Langevin dynamics, (ii) Koopman-based linear operators, and (iii) autoregressive neural networks. Within a unified encoder-propagator-decoder framework, we evaluate long-horizon stability, backbone and side-chain ensemble fidelity, and temporal kinetics via TICA. Benchmarks on systems ranging from small peptides to mixed-topology proteins and large GPCRs reveal that autoregressive neural networks deliver the most robust long rollouts and coherent physical timescales; score-guided Langevin best recovers side-chain thermodynamics when the score is well learned; and Koopman provides an interpretable, lightweight baseline that tends to damp fluctuations. These results clarify the trade-offs among propagators and offer practical guidance for latent-space simulators of all-atom protein dynamics.",

We introduce PepMorph, an end-to-end peptide discovery pipeline that generates novel sequences that are not only prone to aggregate but self-assemble into a specified fibrillar or spherical morphology. We compiled a new dataset by leveraging existing aggregation propensity datasets and extracting geometric and physicochemical isolated peptide descriptors that act as proxies for aggregate morphology. This dataset is then used to train a Transformer-based Conditional Variational Autoencoder with a masking mechanism, which generates novel peptides under arbitrary conditioning. After filtering to ensure design specifications and validation of generated sequences through coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, PepMorph yielded 83% accuracy in intended morphology generation, showcasing its promise as a framework for application-driven peptide discovery.",

    "title": "OTMol: Robust Molecular Structure Comparison via Optimal Transport",
    "abstract": "Root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) is widely used to assess structural similarity in systems ranging from flexible ligand conformers to complex molecular cluster configurations. Despite its wide utility, RMSD calculation is often challenged by inconsistent atom ordering, indistinguishable configurations in molecular clusters, and potential chirality inversion during alignment. These issues highlight the necessity of accurate atom-to-atom correspondence as a prerequisite for meaningful alignment. Traditional approaches often rely on heuristic cost matrices combined with the Hungarian algorithm, yet these methods underutilize the rich intra-molecular structural information and may fail to generalize across chemically diverse systems. In this work, we introduce OTMol, a method that formulates the molecular alignment task as a fused supervised Gromov-Wasserstein (fsGW) optimal transport problem. By leveraging the intrinsic geometric and topological relationships within each molecule, OTMol eliminates the need for manually defined cost functions and enables a principled, data-driven matching strategy. Importantly, OTMol preserves key chemical features such as molecular chirality and bond connectivity consistency. We evaluate OTMol across a wide range of molecular systems, including Adenosine triphosphate, Imatinib, lipids, small peptides, and water clusters, and demonstrate that it consistently achieves low RMSD values while preserving computational efficiency. Importantly, OTMol maintains molecular integrity by enforcing one-to-one mappings between entire molecules, thereby avoiding erroneous many-to-one alignments that often arise in comparing molecular clusters. Our results underscore the utility of optimal transport theory for molecular alignment and offer a generalizable framework applicable to structural comparison tasks in cheminformatics, molecular modeling, and related disciplines.",

While molecular dynamics (MD) simulations remain the in silico gold standard, its high computational cost limits scalability. We present DynaProt, a lightweight, SE(3)-invariant framework that predicts rich descriptors of protein dynamics directly from static structures. By casting the problem through the lens of multivariate Gaussians, DynaProt estimates dynamics at two complementary scales: (1) per-residue marginal anisotropy as $3 \\times 3$ covariance matrices capturing local flexibility, and (2) joint scalar covariances encoding pairwise dynamic coupling across residues. From these dynamics outputs, DynaProt achieves high accuracy in predicting residue-level flexibility (RMSF) and, remarkably, enables reasonable reconstruction of the full covariance matrix for fast ensemble generation. Notably, it does so using orders of magnitude fewer parameters than prior methods. Our results highlight the potential of direct protein dynamics prediction as a scalable alternative to existing methods.",

Alternative radicals, such as superoxide and ascorbate, have been proposed to enhance anisotropy or suppress decoherence. This review summarizes the quantum basis of magnetoreception, evaluates both canonical and alternative radical pair models, and discusses amplification strategies including triads, spin scavenging, and bystander radicals. Emphasis is placed on how molecular geometry, exchange and dipolar interactions, and hyperfine topology modulate magnetic sensitivity.

    "abstract": "The fundamental laws governing proteoform dynamics have yet to be formulated. As a result, it is unclear how a specific proteoform, a distinct molecular variant of a protein, dynamically shapes its own future by evolving into new modes that exist only in potential until realised. Here, Modal Geometric Field (MGF) Theory couples real and abstract proteoform transitions through four axioms. Axioms 1 to 3 (invariant) dictate that only first-order transitions occur on the discrete, volume-invariant, non symplectic modal manifold. Axiom 4 (mutable) projects the occupancy and shape of a real, instantiated molecule into the modal manifold, generating occupancy-induced curvature. By coupling what is real to what is abstract, curvature, which is always conserved, governs proteoform dynamics by dictating the least-action modal transition. Because curvature distribution renders activation energy relative, barriers are mutable, and entropy emerges inevitably from curvature transport. This unification of energy, entropy, and curvature yields hysteresis, path dependence, fractal self similarity, and trajectories that oscillate between order and chaos. As a scale invariant and universal framework, MGF Theory reveals how modal geometry governs proteoform dynamics",

By integrating computational models, machine learning tools, and experimental platforms, this system aims to replicate and predict both physiological and pathological processes, ranging from molecules and cells to tissues, organs, and entire body systems. Central to the Full-Body AI Agent is its emphasis on integration and coordination across these biological levels, enabling analysis of how molecular changes influence cellular behaviors, tissue responses, organ function, and systemic outcomes. With a focus on biological functionality, the system is designed to advance the understanding of disease mechanisms, support the development of therapeutic interventions, and enhance personalized medicine. We propose two specialized implementations to demonstrate the utility of this framework: (1) the metastasis AI Agent, a multi-scale metastasis scoring system that characterizes tumor progression across the initiation, dissemination, and colonization phases by integrating molecular, cellular, and systemic signals; and (2) the drug AI Agent, a system-level drug development paradigm in which a drug AI-Agent dynamically guides preclinical evaluations, including organoids and chip-based models, by providing full-body physiological constraints. This approach enables the predictive modeling of long-term efficacy and toxicity beyond what localized models alone can achieve.

    "abstract": "Predicting the binding free energy between antibodies and antigens is a key challenge in structure-aware biomolecular modeling, with direct implications for antibody design. Most existing methods either rely solely on sequence embeddings or struggle to capture complex structural relationships, thus limiting predictive performance. In this work, we present a novel framework that integrates sequence-based representations from pre-trained protein language models (ESM-2) with a set of topological features. Specifically, we extract contact map metrics reflecting residue-level connectivity, interface geometry descriptors characterizing cross-chain interactions, distance map statistics quantifying spatial organization, and persistent homology invariants that systematically capture the emergence and persistence of multi-scale topological structures - such as connected components, cycles, and cavities - within individual proteins and across the antibody-antigen interface. By leveraging a cross-attention mechanism to fuse these diverse modalities, our model effectively encodes both global and local structural organization, thereby substantially enhancing the prediction of binding free energy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms sequence-only and conventional structural models, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy in binding free energy prediction.",

Highest antibacterial activity was exhibited against B. subtilis at 1000 μg/ disk (27.43-+0.02 mm). The extract showed inhibitory effects comparable to gentamicin towards B. subtilis and P. aeruginosa at 500 μg/ disk and towards E. coli and S. aureus at 1000 μg/ disk. Qualitative phytochemical screening revealed the presence of flavonoids, tannins, phenols, cardiac glycosides, amino acids, carbohydrates, alkaloids and saponins. Therefore it is likely that the antibacterial effect of the extract is mediated by synergistic mechanisms.

The urgent need for new treatment alternatives has brought attention to the potential of plants, which harbor a wealth of unexplored phytochemicals with therapeutic properties. This study aims to evaluate the anti-bacterial efficacy of methanol and aqueous extracts from the leaves and bark of Horsfieldia iryaghedhi In vitro. Methodology: Aqueous and methanol extracts were obtained from the cold maceration method. In vitro anti-bacterial activity of methanol and aqueous leaf, bark, and combination extracts were determined against gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922) and gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC25923). The anti-bacterial assay for different concentrations of each extract was conducted through the well-diffusion method, with Gentamycin serving as the positive control. Results: Methanol leaf and combination extracts of Horsfieldia iryaghedhi have shown a positive anti-bacterial response at their highest concentrations of 1000mcg/mL and 500mcg/mL against grampositive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus while none of the extracts showed anti-bacterial activity against gram-negative E. coli at the experimented concentrations.

A dataset of 213 antibody-antigen complexes was curated to extract geometric and physicochemical features, and a LightGBM regressor was trained to predict binding affinity with high precision. The model reduced the antibody candidate search space by 89%, and fine-tuning on 117 SARS-CoV-2 binding pairs further reduced Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) from 1.70 to 0.92. In the absence of an experimental structure for the hMPV A2.2 variant, AlphaFold2 was used to predict its 3D structure. The fine-tuned model identified two optimal antibodies with predicted picomolar affinities targeting key mutation sites (G42V and E96K), making them excellent candidates for experimental testing.

    "abstract": "The modulator pocket is a cryptic site discovered in the TREK1 K2P channel that accommodates agonists capable of increasing the channel's activity. Since its discovery, equivalent sites in other K2P channels have been shown to bind various ligands, both endogenous and exogenous. In this review, we attempt to elucidate how the modulator pocket contributes to K2P channel activation. To this end, we first describe the gating mechanisms reported in the literature and rationalize their modes of action. We then highlight previous experimental and computational evidence for agonists that bind to the modulator pocket, together with mutations at this site that affect gating. Finally, we elaborate how the activation signal arising from the modulator pocket is transduced to the gates in K2P channels. In doing so, we outline a potential common modulator pocket architecture across K2P channels: a largely amphipathic structure -consistent with the expected properties of a pocket exposed at the interface between a hydrophobic membrane and the aqueous solvent- but still with some important channel-sequence-variations. This architecture and its key differences can be leveraged for the design of new selective and potent modulators.",

    "abstract": "In structure-based drug discovery, virtual screening using conventional molecular docking methods can be performed rapidly but suffers from limitations in prediction accuracy. Recently, Boltz-2 was proposed, achieving extremely high accuracy in binding affinity prediction, but requiring approximately 20 seconds per compound per GPU, making it difficult to apply to large-scale screening of hundreds of thousands to millions of compounds. This study proposes Boltzina, a novel framework that leverages Boltz-2's high accuracy while significantly improving computational efficiency. Boltzina achieves both accuracy and speed by omitting the rate-limiting structure prediction from Boltz-2's architecture and directly predicting affinity from AutoDock Vina docking poses. We evaluate on eight assays from the MF-PCBA dataset and show that while Boltzina performs below Boltz-2, it provides significantly higher screening performance compared to AutoDock Vina and GNINA. Additionally, Boltzina achieved up to 11.8$\\times$ faster through reduced recycling iterations and batch processing. Furthermore, we investigated multi-pose selection strategies and two-stage screening combining Boltzina and Boltz-2, presenting optimization methods for accuracy and efficiency according to application requirements. This study represents the first attempt to apply Boltz-2's high-accuracy predictions to practical-scale screening, offering a pipeline that combines both accuracy and efficiency in computational biology.

    "abstract": "Living cells exhibit a complex organization comprising numerous compartments, among which are RNA- and protein-rich membraneless, liquid-like organelles known as biomolecular condensates. Energy-consuming processes regulate their formation and dissolution, with (de-)phosphorylation by specific enzymes being among the most commonly involved reactions. By employing a model system consisting of a phosphorylatable peptide and homopolymeric RNA, we elucidate how enzymatic activity modulates the growth kinetics and alters the local structure of biomolecular condensates. Under passive condition, time-resolved ultra-small-angle X-ray scattering with synchrotron source reveals a nucleation-driven coalescence mechanism maintained over four decades in time, similar to the coarsening of simple binary fluid mixtures. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations show that peptide-decorated RNA chains assembled shortly after mixing constitute the relevant subunits. In contrast, actively-formed condensates initially display a local mass fractal structure, which gradually matures upon enzymatic activity before condensates undergo coalescence. Both types of condensate eventually reach a steady state but fluorescence recovery after photobleaching indicates a peptide diffusivity twice higher in actively-formed condensates consistent with their loosely-packed local structure. We expect multiscale, integrative approaches implemented with model systems to link effectively the functional properties of membraneless organelles to their formation and dissolution kinetics as regulated by cellular active processes.",

    "abstract": "Biology stores information and computes at the molecular scale, yet the ways in which it does so are often distinct from human-engineered computers. Mapping biological computation onto architectures familiar to computer science remains an outstanding challenge. Here, inspired by Crick's proposal for molecular memory, we analyse a thermodynamically-consistent model of a protein complex subject to driven, nonequilibrium enzymatic reactions. In the strongly driven limit, we find that the system maps onto a stochastic, asynchronous variant of cellular automata, where each rule corresponds to a different set of enzymes being present. We find a broad class of phenomena in these 'molecular automata' that can be exploited for molecular computation, including error-tolerant memory via multistable attractors, and long transients that can be used as molecular stopwatches. By systematically enumerating all possible dynamical rules, we identify those that allow molecular automata to implement simple computational architectures such as finite-state machines. Overall, our results provide a framework for engineering synthetic molecular automata, and offer a route to building protein-based computation in living cells.",

However, obtaining these structures is often costly and time-intensive, limiting their availability. In contrast, ligand-free structures are more accessible but suffer from reduced docking performance due to pocket geometries being less suited for ligand accommodation in apo structures. Traditional methods for artificially inducing these conformations, such as molecular dynamics simulations, are computationally expensive. In this work, we introduce Sesame, a generative model designed to predict this conformational change efficiently. By generating geometries better suited for ligand accommodation at a fraction of the computational cost, Sesame aims to provide a scalable solution for improving virtual screening workflows.",

    "abstract": "A short (<150 bp) double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) molecule ligated end-to-end forms a DNA minicircle. Due to sequence-dependent, nonuniform bending energetics, such a minicircle is predicted to adopt a certain inside-out orientation, known as the poloidal orientation. Despite theoretical and computational predictions, experimental evidence for this phenomenon has been lacking. In this study, we introduce a single-molecule approach to visualize the poloidal orientation of DNA minicircles. We constructed a set of DNA minicircles, each containing a single biotin located at a different position along one helical turn of the dsDNA, and imaged the location of biotin-bound NeutrAvidin relative to the DNA minicircle using atomic force microscopy (AFM). We applied this approach to two DNA sequences previously predicted to exhibit strongly preferred poloidal orientations. The observed relative positions of NeutrAvidin shifted between the inside and outside of the minicircle with different phases, indicating distinct poloidal orientations for the two sequences. Coarse-grained simulations revealed narrowly distributed poloidal orientations with different mean orientations for each sequence, consistent with the AFM results. Together, our findings provide experimental confirmation of preferred poloidal orientations in DNA minicircles, offering insights into the intrinsic dynamics of circular DNA.",

    "abstract": "Despite growth being fundamental to all aspects of cell biology, we do not yet know its organizing principles in eukaryotic cells. Classic models derived from the bacteria E. coli posit that protein-synthesis rates are set by mass-action collisions between charged tRNAs produced by metabolic enzymes and mRNA-bound ribosomes. These models show that faster growth is achieved by simultaneously raising both ribosome content and peptide elongation speed. Here, we test if these models are valid for eukaryotes by combining single-molecule tracking, spike-in RNA sequencing, and proteomics in 15 carbon- and nitrogen-limited conditions using the budding yeast S. cerevisiae. Ribosome concentration increases linearly with growth rate, as in bacteria, but the peptide elongation speed remains constant (~9 amino acids/s) and charged tRNAs are not limiting. Total mRNA concentration rises in direct proportion to ribosomes, driven by enhanced RNA polymerase II occupancy of the genome. We show that a simple kinetic model of mRNA-ribosome binding predicts both the fraction of active ribosomes, the growth rate, and responses to transcriptional perturbations. Yeast accelerate growth by coordinately and proportionally co-up-regulating total mRNA and ribosome concentrations, not by speeding elongation. Taken together, our work establishes a new framework for eukaryotic growth control and resource allocation.",

In 2019, Kim et al. demonstrated Davydov splitting in circular dichroism spectra, revealing strong J-like coupling, while antibunched fluorescence emission was confirmed by combined antibunching--fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (AB/FCS fingerprinting). To investigate the implications of this coexistence, Venus yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) dimer population dynamics are modeled within a Lindblad master equation framework, testing its ability to cope with typical, data-informed, Venus YFP dimer time and energy values. Simulations predict multiple-femtosecond (fs) decoherence, yielding bright/dark state mixtures consistent with antibunched fluorescence emission at room temperature. Thus, excitonic coupling and photon AB in Venus YFP dimers are reconciled without invoking long-lived quantum coherence. However, clear violations of several Lindblad approximation validity conditions appear imminent, calling for careful modifications to choices of standard system and bath definitions and parameter values.",

Toward this goal, significant effort has focused on developing models that jointly sample molecular topology and 3D structure. We present FlowMol3, an open-source, multi-modal flow matching model that advances the state of the art for all-atom, small-molecule generation. Its substantial performance gains over previous FlowMol versions are achieved without changes to the graph neural network architecture or the underlying flow matching formulation. Instead, FlowMol3's improvements arise from three architecture-agnostic techniques that incur negligible computational cost: self-conditioning, fake atoms, and train-time geometry distortion. FlowMol3 achieves nearly 100% molecular validity for drug-like molecules with explicit hydrogens, more accurately reproduces the functional group composition and geometry of its training data, and does so with an order of magnitude fewer learnable parameters than comparable methods. We hypothesize that these techniques mitigate a general pathology affecting transport-based generative models, enabling detection and correction of distribution drift during inference. Our results highlight simple, transferable strategies for improving the stability and quality of diffusion- and flow-based molecular generative models.",

    "abstract": "The use of generative machine learning models, trained on the experimentally resolved structures deposited in the protein data bank, is an attractive approach to sampling conformational ensembles of proteins. Unfortunately, since the machine-learned model utilized to generate these ensembles is not tied to an equation of motion, such as a molecular dynamics integrator or other causal generator of the dynamics, there is no timescale or causal information encoded in them. As such, with this work, we use the structural ensembles generated from AlphaFold2 at a range of reduced MSA depths to parameterize the potential of mean force of an overdamped, memory-free, coarse-grained Langevin equation. This approach couples the AlphaFold2 ensembles to a causal model, allowing us to estimate the timescales spanned by the AlphaFold2-generated ensembles at each MSA depth. Performing this analysis on six variants of HIV-1 protease, we confirm an inverse relationship between MSA depth and the timescale of an ensemble's conformational fluctuations, since the MSA depth essentially serves as a conformational restraint, and AlphaFold2 is generally able to probe timescales at or below those seen in microsecond-long, unbiased molecular dynamics simulations. We conclude by generalizing this approach to other machine-learned structure-prediction methods.",

In this work, we propose a conformer-based model trained on antigen sequences derived from 1,080 antigen-antibody complexes, leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract local features and Transformers to capture long-range dependencies within antigen sequences. Ablation studies demonstrate that CNN enhances the prediction of linear epitopes, and the Transformer module improves the prediction of conformational epitopes. Experimental results show that our model outperforms existing baselines in terms of PCC, ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, and F1 scores on both linear and conformational epitopes.",

    "abstract": "Three-dimensional generative models increasingly drive structure-based drug discovery, yet it remains constrained by the scarce publicly available protein-ligand complexes. Under such data scarcity, almost all existing pipelines struggle to learn transferable geometric priors and consequently overfit to training-set biases. As such, we present IBEX, an Information-Bottleneck-EXplored coarse-to-fine pipeline to tackle the chronic shortage of protein-ligand complex data in structure-based drug design. Specifically, we use PAC-Bayesian information-bottleneck theory to quantify the information density of each sample. This analysis reveals how different masking strategies affect generalization and indicates that, compared with conventional de novo generation, the constrained Scaffold Hopping task endows the model with greater effective capacity and improved transfer performance. IBEX retains the original TargetDiff architecture and hyperparameters for training to generate molecules compatible with the binding pocket; it then applies an L-BFGS optimization step to finely refine each conformation by optimizing five physics-based terms and adjusting six translational and rotational degrees of freedom in under one second. With only these modifications, IBEX raises the zero-shot docking success rate on CBGBench CrossDocked2020-based from 53% to 64%, improves the mean Vina score from $-7.41 kcal mol^{-1}$ to $-8.07 kcal mol^{-1}$, and achieves the best median Vina energy in 57 of 100 pockets versus 3 for the original TargetDiff. IBEX also increases the QED by 25%, achieves state-of-the-art validity and diversity, and markedly reduces extrapolation error.",

    "abstract": "Powerful AI tools for drug discovery reside in isolated web apps, desktop programs, and code libraries. Such fragmentation forces scientists to manage incompatible interfaces and specialized scripts, which can be a cumbersome and repetitive process. To address this issue, a Full-pROcess druG dEsign ageNT, named FROGENT, has been proposed. Specifically, FROGENT utilizes a Large Language Model and the Model Context Protocol to integrate multiple dynamic biochemical databases, extensible tool libraries, and task-specific AI models. This agentic framework allows FROGENT to execute complicated drug discovery workflows dynamically, including component tasks such as target identification, molecule generation and retrosynthetic planning. FROGENT has been evaluated on eight benchmarks that cover various aspects of drug discovery, such as knowledge retrieval, property prediction, virtual screening, mechanistic analysis, molecular design, and synthesis. It was compared against six increasingly advanced ReAct-style agents that support code execution and literature searches. Empirical results demonstrated that FROGENT triples the best baseline performance in hit-finding and doubles it in interaction profiling, significantly outperforming both the open-source model Qwen3-32B and the commercial model GPT-4o. In addition, real-world cases have been utilized to validate the practicability and generalization of FROGENT. This development suggests that streamlining the agentic drug discovery pipeline can significantly enhance researcher productivity.",

    "abstract": "Drug discovery through virtual screening (VS) has become a popular strategy for identifying hits against protein targets. Alongside VS, molecular design further expands accessible chemical space. Together, these approaches have the potential to reduce the cost and time needed for manual selection and wet-laboratory experiments, thereby accelerating drug discovery pipelines. Improving the cost-effectiveness of virtual screening is a significant challenge, aiming to explore larger compound libraries while maintaining lower screening costs. Here, we present HelixVS, a structure-based VS platform enhanced by deep learning models. HelixVS integrates a precise deep learning-based pose-scoring model and a pose-screening module into a multi-stage VS process, enabling more effective screening of active compounds. Compared to classic molecular docking tools like Vina, HelixVS demonstrated significantly improved screening performance across nearly a hundred targets, achieving an average 2.6-fold higher enrichment factor (EF) and more than 10 times faster screening speed. We applied HelixVS in four drug development pipelines, targeting both traditional competitive drug-binding pockets and novel protein-protein interaction interfaces. Wet-lab validations across these pipelines consistently identified active compounds, with over 10% of the molecules tested in wet labs demonstrating activity at uM or even nM levels. This demonstrates the ability of HelixVS to identify high-affinity ligands for various targets and pockets.In addition, the HelixVS platform has been extended with HelixVS-Syn, which enables design of novel compounds from reference scaffolds. These designed molecules are seamlessly integrated into the HelixVS screening workflow, allowing researchers to explore both existing chemical libraries and novel chemical space with high affinity, synthetic accessibility, and structural novelty.",

    "abstract": "Cytoskeletal filaments transported by surface immobilized molecular motors with one end pinned to the surface have been observed to spiral in a myosin-driven actin 'gliding assay'. The radius of the spiral was shown to scale with motor density with an exponent of -1/3, while the frequency was theoretically predicted to scale with an exponent of 4/3. While both the spiraling radius and frequency depend on motor density, the theory assumed independence of filament length, and remained to be tested on cytoskeletal systems other than actin-myosin. Here, we reconstitute dynein-driven microtubule spiraling and compare experiments to theory and numerical simulations. We characterize the scaling laws of spiraling MTs and find the radius dependence on force density to be consistent with previous results. Frequency on the other hand scales with force density with an exponent of ~1/3, contrary to previous predictions. We also predict that the spiral radius scales proportionally and the frequency scales inversely with filament length, both with an exponent of ~1/3. A model of variable persistence length best explains the length dependence observed in experiments. Our findings that reconcile theory, simulations, and experiments improve our understanding of the role of cytoskeletal filament elasticity, mechanics of microtubule buckling and motor transport and the physical principles of active filaments.",

    "abstract": "Proteins perform nearly all cellular functions and constitute most drug targets, making their analysis fundamental to understanding human biology in health and disease. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS$^2$) is the major analytical technique in proteomics that identifies peptides by ionizing them, fragmenting them, and using the resulting mass spectra to identify and quantify proteins in biological samples. In MS$^2$ analysis, peptide fragment ion probability prediction plays a critical role, enhancing the accuracy of peptide identification from mass spectra as a complement to the intensity information. Current approaches rely on global statistics of fragmentation, which assumes that a fragment's probability is uniform across all peptides. Nevertheless, this assumption is oversimplified from a biochemical principle point of view and limits accurate prediction. To address this gap, we present Pep2Prob, the first comprehensive dataset and benchmark designed for peptide-specific fragment ion probability prediction. The proposed dataset contains fragment ion probability statistics for 608,780 unique precursors (each precursor is a pair of peptide sequence and charge state), summarized from more than 183 million high-quality, high-resolution, HCD MS$^2$ spectra with validated peptide assignments and fragmentation annotations. We establish baseline performance using simple statistical rules and learning-based methods, and find that models leveraging peptide-specific information significantly outperform previous methods using only global fragmentation statistics. Furthermore, performance across benchmark models with increasing capacities suggests that the peptide-fragmentation relationship exhibits complex nonlinearities requiring sophisticated machine learning approaches.",

    "abstract": "We show how to localize and quantify the functional evolutionary constraints on natural proteins. The method compares the perturbations caused by local sequence variants to the energetics of the protein folding process and to the corresponding change to the apparent selection landscape of sequences over the evolutionary time scale. The difference between the physical folding free energies and the evolutionary free energies can be called a \"Dark Energy\". We analyse various protein sets and thereby show that Dark Energy is largely localized at functional sites, which are often energetically frustrated from the point of view of folding. Overall, we find that about 25% of the positions of the folded globular proteins display some significant Dark Energy. When a function relies on a free energy that can be thermodynamically quantified, such as a binding energy to a partner, the relationship of this physical free energy with Dark Energy can be used to define a Functional Selection Temperature. We show that selection for folding and binding functions bear similar weights in specific protein-protein interactions.",

    "abstract": "There are two approaches to describing DNA-ions interactions. The physical approach is an analysis of electrostatic interactions between ions and charges on the DNA molecule. The coordination chemistry approach is a search for modes of direct binding of ions to ionophores of DNA. We study both the inner and outer sphere coordination of ions by ionophores of the A and C forms of DNA in molecular dynamics simulations in two low-polarity solvents: in ethanol-water and methanol-water mixtures. We show that the counterion-DNA outer sphere coordination plays a key role in the experimentally observed conformational polymorphism of the DNA molecule: a transition to the A form in ethanol and to the C form in methanol. We identify the ionophores responsible for the existence of the A- and C-complexes. In both the complexes, the ions' inner sphere ligands are mostly water molecules, the ions reside in water clusters. In ethanol-water mixture, the water clusters are large, the major groove of the A-DNA is filled with water, and all ionophores are accessible to ions. In methanol-water mixture, the water clusters are small, and a large number of methanol clusters are present near DNA surface. They interfere with the coordination of ions in one of the ionophores of the major groove, and also with other ionophores near phosphates. Therefore, in methanol, the interaction energy of counterions with A-DNA cannot compensate for the repulsion between closely located phosphates. Therefore, the ions fill more accessible ionophores of the C-complex, converting DNA into the C form.",

Identifying an optimal reaction coordinate (RC) that accurately captures the progress of these dynamics is crucial for understanding and simulating such processes. This work introduces a nonparametric RC optimization framework that incorporates trajectory histories, enabling robust analysis even for irregular or incomplete data. The power of the method is demonstrated through increasingly challenging analyses of protein folding dynamics, where it provides accurate committor estimates that pass a stringent validation test and yield high-resolution free energy profiles. Its generality is further illustrated through applications to dynamics in phase space, a conceptual ocean circulation model, and a longitudinal clinical dataset. These results demonstrate that rare event dynamics can be accurately characterized without exhaustive sampling of the configuration space, establishing a general, flexible, and robust framework for analyzing complex dynamical systems and longitudinal datasets.",

    "abstract": "Achieving precise control over a molecule's biological activity-encompassing targeted activation/inhibition, cooperative multi-target modulation, and off-target toxicity mitigation-remains a critical challenge in de novo drug design. However, existing generative methods primarily focus on producing molecules with a single desired activity, lacking integrated mechanisms for the simultaneous management of multiple intended and unintended molecular interactions. Here, we propose ActivityDiff, a generative approach based on the classifier-guidance technique of diffusion models. It leverages separately trained drug-target classifiers for both positive and negative guidance, enabling the model to enhance desired activities while minimizing harmful off-target effects. Experimental results show that ActivityDiff effectively handles essential drug design tasks, including single-/dual-target generation, fragment-constrained dual-target design, selective generation to enhance target specificity, and reduction of off-target effects. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of classifier-guided diffusion in balancing efficacy and safety in molecular design. Overall, our work introduces a novel paradigm for achieving integrated control over molecular activity, and provides ActivityDiff as a versatile and extensible framework.",

We discuss historical and recent advances in de novo TIM barrel design from the landmark creation of sTIM11 to the development of the diversified variants, with a special focus on deepening our understanding of the determinants that modulate the sequence-structure-function relationships of this architecture. Also, we examine why the diversification of de novo TIM barrels towards functionalization remains a major challenge, given the absence of natural-like active site features. Current approaches have focused on incorporating structural extensions, modifying loops, and using cutting-edge AI-based strategies to create scaffolds with tailored characteristics. Despite significant advances, achieving enzymatically active de novo TIM barrels has been proven difficult, with only recent breakthroughs demonstrating functionalized designs. We discuss the limitations of stepwise functionalization approaches and support an integrated approach that simultaneously optimizes scaffold structure and active site shape, using both physical- and AI-driven methods. By combining computational and experimental insights, we highlight the TIM barrel as a powerful template for custom enzyme design and as a model system to explore the intersection of protein biochemistry, biophysics, and design.",

The counterpart to aqueous-soluble organics is the insoluble organic matter pool that makes up the largest portion of organic matter in natural samples and includes most types of organic signatures indicative of biological processes. Employing a range of sample preparation, molecular separation, detection, and imaging techniques enables the characterization of both labile (i.e., soluble and reactive) and recalcitrant (i.e., insoluble, non-reactive; include macromolecules) organic pools. Multiple orthogonal analytical modalities strengthen interpretations of signatures that we associate with biology as we know it and don't know it, by constraining possible abiotic sources, validating measurements across distinct techniques, and ensuring flexibility to interrogate diverse organic chemistries encountered in Martian subsurface environments.

    "abstract": "Polyphenols and proteins are essential biomolecules that influence food functionality and, by extension, human health. Their interactions -- hereafter referred to as PhPIs (polyphenol-protein interactions) -- affect key processes such as nutrient bioavailability, antioxidant activity, and therapeutic efficacy. However, these interactions remain challenging due to the structural diversity of polyphenols and the dynamic nature of protein binding. Traditional experimental techniques like nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectrometry (MS), along with computational tools such as molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD), have offered important insights but face constraints in scalability, throughput, and reproducibility. This review explores how deep learning (DL) is reshaping the study of PhPIs by enabling efficient prediction of binding sites, interaction affinities, and MD using high-dimensional bio- and chem-informatics data. While DL enhances prediction accuracy and reduces experimental redundancy, its effectiveness remains limited by data availability, quality, and representativeness, particularly in the context of natural products. We critically assess current DL frameworks for PhPIs analysis and outline future directions, including multimodal data integration, improved model generalizability, and development of domain-specific benchmark datasets. This synthesis offers guidance for researchers aiming to apply DL in unraveling structure-function relationships of polyphenols, accelerating discovery in nutritional science and therapeutic development.",

Although surface properties can be implicitly learned from the protein structure, we hypothesize that explicit knowledge of protein surfaces can improve a structure-based model's ability to predict changes in binding affinity. To this end, we introduce Pi-SAGE, a novel Permutation-Invariant Surface-Aware Graph Encoder. We first train Pi-SAGE to create a protein surface codebook directly from the structure and assign a token for each surface-exposed residue. Next, we augment the node features of the GearBind model with surface features from domain-adapted Pi-SAGE to predict binding affinity change on the SKEMPI dataset.

    "title": "Contrastive Multi-Task Learning with Solvent-Aware Augmentation for Drug Discovery",
    "abstract": "Accurate prediction of protein-ligand interactions is essential for computer-aided drug discovery. However, existing methods often fail to capture solvent-dependent conformational changes and lack the ability to jointly learn multiple related tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce a pre-training method that incorporates ligand conformational ensembles generated under diverse solvent conditions as augmented input. This design enables the model to learn both structural flexibility and environmental context in a unified manner. The training process integrates molecular reconstruction to capture local geometry, interatomic distance prediction to model spatial relationships, and contrastive learning to build solvent-invariant molecular representations. Together, these components lead to significant improvements, including a 3.7% gain in binding affinity prediction, an 82% success rate on the PoseBusters Astex docking benchmarks, and an area under the curve of 97.1% in virtual screening. The framework supports solvent-aware, multi-task modeling and produces consistent results across benchmarks. A case study further demonstrates sub-angstrom docking accuracy with a root-mean-square deviation of 0.157 angstroms, offering atomic-level insight into binding mechanisms and advancing structure-based drug design.",

    "title": "FGBench: A Dataset and Benchmark for Molecular Property Reasoning at Functional Group-Level in Large Language Models",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have gained significant attention in chemistry. However, most existing datasets center on molecular-level property prediction and overlook the role of fine-grained functional group (FG) information. Incorporating FG-level data can provide valuable prior knowledge that links molecular structures with textual descriptions, which can be used to build more interpretable, structure-aware LLMs for reasoning on molecule-related tasks. Moreover, LLMs can learn from such fine-grained information to uncover hidden relationships between specific functional groups and molecular properties, thereby advancing molecular design and drug discovery. Here, we introduce FGBench, a dataset comprising 625K molecular property reasoning problems with functional group information. Functional groups are precisely annotated and localized within the molecule, which ensures the dataset's interoperability thereby facilitating further multimodal applications. FGBench includes both regression and classification tasks on 245 different functional groups across three categories for molecular property reasoning: (1) single functional group impacts, (2) multiple functional group interactions, and (3) direct molecular comparisons. In the benchmark of state-of-the-art LLMs on 7K curated data, the results indicate that current LLMs struggle with FG-level property reasoning, highlighting the need to enhance reasoning capabilities in LLMs for chemistry tasks. We anticipate that the methodology employed in FGBench to construct datasets with functional group-level information will serve as a foundational framework for generating new question-answer pairs, enabling LLMs to better understand fine-grained molecular structure-property relationships. The dataset and evaluation code are available at https://github.com/xuanliugit/FGBench.",

    "title": "Learning Potential Energy Surfaces of Hydrogen Atom Transfer Reactions in Peptides",
    "abstract": "Hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reactions are essential in many biological processes, such as radical migration in damaged proteins, but their mechanistic pathways remain incompletely understood. Simulating HAT is challenging due to the need for quantum chemical accuracy at biologically relevant scales; thus, neither classical force fields nor DFT-based molecular dynamics are applicable. Machine-learned potentials offer an alternative, able to learn potential energy surfaces (PESs) with near-quantum accuracy. However, training these models to generalize across diverse HAT configurations, especially at radical positions in proteins, requires tailored data generation and careful model selection. Here, we systematically generate HAT configurations in peptides to build large datasets using semiempirical methods and DFT. We benchmark three graph neural network architectures (SchNet, Allegro, and MACE) on their ability to learn HAT PESs and indirectly predict reaction barriers from energy predictions. MACE consistently outperforms the others in energy, force, and barrier prediction, achieving a mean absolute error of 1.13 kcal/mol on out-of-distribution DFT barrier predictions. Using molecular dynamics, we show our MACE potential is stable, reactive, and generalizes beyond training data to model HAT barriers in collagen I. This accuracy enables integration of ML potentials into large-scale collagen simulations to compute reaction rates from predicted barriers, advancing mechanistic understanding of HAT and radical migration in peptides. We analyze scaling laws, model transferability, and cost-performance trade-offs, and outline strategies for improvement by combining ML potentials with transition state search algorithms and active learning. Our approach is generalizable to other biomolecular systems, enabling quantum-accurate simulations of chemical reactivity in complex environments.",

Firstly, it aims at elucidating the role of epistasis in shaping, at a molecular level, the evolutionary paths of proteins, as well as the extent to which these epistatic effects are the outcome of an as-yet-unidentified epistatic force. Second, it seeks to ascertain the extent to which the principle of least action will enable us to identify which of all potential trajectories has the highest evolutionary efficiency, as well as how variations in factors such as protein robustness and folding rates, resulting from the unavoidability of destabilizing mutations, might influence this critical evolutionary process. The initial findings suggest that protein evolution, at a molecular level, may be more predictable than previously thought, as epistasis and the principle of least action collectively impose constraints on evolutionary paths and trajectories, and consequently, on protein evolvability. Thus, this work should advance our understanding of the main molecular mechanisms that underlie the evolution of mutation-driven proteins and also provide grounds to answer a fundamental evolutionary question: how does Darwinian selection regard all potential trajectories available?",

Our pipeline combines domain-adapted deep learning, advanced OCR, semantic entity recognition, and prompt-driven LLM modules, together with human expert corrections, to extract kinetic parameters (e.g., kcat, Km), enzyme sequences, substrate SMILES, experimental conditions, and molecular diagrams from heterogeneous document formats. Through active learning strategies integrating AI-assisted annotation, expert validation, and iterative refinement, the system adapts rapidly to new data sources. We also release a large benchmark dataset comprising over 1,000 annotated tables and 5,000 biological fields from 270 P450-related enzymology publications. Benchmarking demonstrates that zERExtractor consistently outperforms existing baselines in table recognition (Acc 89.9%), molecular image interpretation (up to 99.1%), and relation extraction (accuracy 94.2%). zERExtractor bridges the longstanding data gap in enzyme kinetics with a flexible, plugin-ready framework and high-fidelity extraction, laying the groundwork for future AI-powered enzyme modeling and biochemical knowledge discovery.",

    "abstract": "Distance Geometry plays a central role in determining protein structures from Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) data, a task known as the Molecular Distance Geometry Problem (MDGP). A subclass of this problem, the Discretizable Distance Geometry Problem (DDGP), allows a recursive solution via the combinatorial Branch-and-Prune (BP) algorithm by exploiting specific vertex orderings in protein backbones. To accommodate the inherent uncertainty in NMR data, the interval Branch-and-Prune (\\textit{i}BP) algorithm was introduced, incorporating interval distance constraints through uniform sampling. In this work, we propose two new algorithmic frameworks for solving the three-dimensional interval DDGP (\\textit{i}DDGP): the interval Angular Branch-and-Prune (\\textit{i}ABP), and its extension, the interval Torsion-angle Branch-and-Prune (\\textit{i}TBP). These methods convert interval distances into angular constraints, enabling structured sampling over circular arcs. The \\textit{i}ABP method guarantees feasibility by construction and removes the need for explicit constraint checking. The \\textit{i}TBP algorithm further incorporates known torsion angle intervals, enforcing local chirality and planarity conditions critical for protein geometry. We present formal mathematical foundations for both methods and a systematic strategy for generating biologically meaningful \\textit{i}DDGP instances from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) structures. Computational experiments demonstrate that both \\textit{i}ABP and \\textit{i}TBP consistently outperform \\textit{i}BP in terms of solution rate and computational efficiency. In particular, \\textit{i}TBP yields solutions with lower RMSD variance relative to the original PDB structures, better reflecting biologically plausible conformations.",

However, current experimental methods for determining VLP stoichiometry are labor-intensive, and time consuming. Machine learning approaches have hardly been applied to the study of VLPs. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel persistent Laplacian-based machine learning (PLML) mode that leverages both harmonic and non-harmonic spectra to capture intricate topological and geometric features of VLP structures. This approach achieves superior performance on the VLP200 dataset compared to existing methods. To further assess robustness and generalizability, we collected a new dataset, VLP706, containing 706 VLP samples with expanded stoichiometry diversity. Our PLML model maintains strong predictive accuracy on VLP706. Additionally, through random sequence perturbative mutation analysis, we found that 60-mers and 180-mers exhibit greater stability than 240-mers and 420-mers.",

    "abstract": "DNA-binding proteins (DBPs) are integral to gene regulation and cellular processes, making their accurate identification essential for understanding biological functions and disease mechanisms. Experimental methods for DBP identification are time-consuming and costly, driving the need for efficient computational prediction techniques. In this study, we propose a novel deep learning framework, ResCap-DBP, that combines a residual learning-based encoder with a one-dimensional Capsule Network (1D-CapsNet) to predict DBPs directly from raw protein sequences. Our architecture incorporates dilated convolutions within residual blocks to mitigate vanishing gradient issues and extract rich sequence features, while capsule layers with dynamic routing capture hierarchical and spatial relationships within the learned feature space. We conducted comprehensive ablation studies comparing global and local embeddings from ProteinBERT and conventional one-hot encoding. Results show that ProteinBERT embeddings substantially outperform other representations on large datasets. Although one-hot encoding showed marginal advantages on smaller datasets, such as PDB186, it struggled to scale effectively. Extensive evaluations on four pairs of publicly available benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. It achieved AUC scores of 98.0% and 89.5% on PDB14189andPDB1075, respectively. On independent test sets PDB2272 and PDB186, the model attained top AUCs of 83.2% and 83.3%, while maintaining competitive performance on larger datasets such as PDB20000. Notably, the model maintains a well balanced sensitivity and specificity across datasets. These results demonstrate the efficacy and generalizability of integrating global protein representations with advanced deep learning architectures for reliable and scalable DBP prediction in diverse genomic contexts.",

    "abstract": "We propose a framework based on Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) for generating plausible ligand binding poses within protein pockets, enabling efficient structure-based virtual screening. The method discretizes the binding site into a grid and solves a QUBO problem to select spatially distributed, energetically favorable grid points. Each ligand is represented by a three-atom geometric contour, which is aligned to the selected grid points through rigid-body transformation, producing from hundreds to hundreds of thousands of candidate poses. Using a benchmark of 169 protein-ligand complexes, we generated an average of 110 to 600000 poses per ligand, depending on QUBO parameters and matching thresholds. Evaluation against crystallographic structures revealed that a larger number of candidates increases the likelihood of recovering near-native poses, with recovery rates reaching 100 percent for root mean square deviation (RMSD) values below 1.0 angstrom and 95.9 percent for RMSD values below 0.6 angstrom. Since the correct binding pose is not known in advance, we apply AutoDock-based scoring to select the most plausible candidates from the generated pool, achieving recovery rates of up to 82.8 percent for RMSD < 2.0 angstrom, 81.7 percent for RMSD < 1.5 angstrom, and 75.2 percent for RMSD < 1.0 angstrom. When poses with misleading scores are excluded, performance improves further, with recovery rates reaching up to 97.8 percent for RMSD < 2.0 angstrom and 1.5 angstrom, and 95.4 percent for RMSD < 1.0 angstrom. This modular and hardware-flexible framework offers a scalable solution for pre-filtering ligands and generating high-quality binding poses before affinity prediction, making it well-suited for large-scale virtual screening pipelines.",

MEVO is composed of three key components: a high-fidelity VQ-VAE for molecule representation in latent space, a diffusion model for pharmacophore-guided molecule generation, and a pocket-aware evolutionary strategy for molecule optimization with physics-based scoring function. This framework efficiently generate high-affinity binders for various protein targets, validated with predicted binding affinities using free energy perturbation (FEP) methods. In addition, we showcase the capability of MEVO in designing potent inhibitors to KRAS$^{\\textrm{G12D}}$, a challenging target in cancer therapeutics, with similar affinity to the known highly active inhibitor evaluated by FEP calculations. With high versatility and generalizability, MEVO offers an effective and data-efficient model for various tasks in structure-based ligand design.",

Moreover, existing computational approaches are often hindered by limited data availability and imbalanced distributions. To address these challenges, we introduce a curated temperature stability dataset designed for model development and benchmarking in enzyme thermal modeling. Leveraging this dataset, we present the \\textit{Segment Transformer}, a novel deep learning framework that enables efficient and accurate prediction of enzyme temperature stability. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance with an RMSE of 24.03, MAE of 18.09, and Pearson and Spearman correlations of 0.33, respectively. These results highlight the effectiveness of incorporating segment-level representations, grounded in the biological observation that different regions of a protein sequence contribute unequally to thermal behavior. As a proof of concept, we applied the Segment Transformer to guide the engineering of a cutinase enzyme. Experimental validation demonstrated a 1.64-fold improvement in relative activity following heat treatment, achieved through only 17 mutations and without compromising catalytic function.",

    "title": "Latent-X: An Atom-level Frontier Model for De Novo Protein Binder Design",
    "abstract": "Traditional drug discovery relies on rounds of screening millions of candidate molecules with low success rates, making drug discovery time and resource intensive. To overcome this screening bottleneck, we introduce Latent-X, an all-atom protein design model that enables a new paradigm of precision AI design. Given a target protein epitope, Latent-X jointly generates the all atom structure and sequence of the protein binder and target, directly modelling the non-covalent interactions essential for specific binding. We demonstrate its efficacy across two therapeutically relevant modalities through extensive wet lab experiments, testing as few as 30-100 designs per target. For macrocyclic peptides, Latent-X achieves experimental hit rates exceeding 90% on all evaluated benchmark targets. For mini-binders, it consistently produces potent candidates against all evaluated benchmark targets, with binding affinities reaching the low nanomolar and picomolar range - comparable to those of approved therapeutics - whilst also being highly specific in mammalian display. In direct comparisons with the state-of-the-art models AlphaProteo, RFdiffusion and RFpeptides under identical conditions demonstrates, Latent-X generates binders with higher hit rates and better binding affinities, and uniquely creates structurally diverse binders, including complex beta-sheet folds. Its end-to-end process is an order of magnitude faster than existing multi-step computational pipelines. By drastically improving the efficiency and success rate of de novo design, Latent-X represents a significant advance towards push-button biologics discovery and a valuable tool for protein engineers. Latent-X is available at https://platform.latentlabs.com, enabling users to reliably generate de novo binders without AI infrastructure or coding.",

    "abstract": "Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) arise when multiple drugs are administered concurrently. Accurately predicting the specific mechanisms underlying DDIs (named DDI events or DDIEs) is critical for the safe clinical use of drugs. DDIEs are typically represented as textual descriptions. However, most computational methods focus more on predicting the DDIE class label over generating human-readable natural language increasing clinicians' interpretation costs. Furthermore, current methods overlook the fact that each drug assumes distinct biological functions in a DDI, which, when used as input context, can enhance the understanding of the DDIE process and benefit DDIE generation by the language model (LM). In this work, we propose a novel pairwise knowledge-augmented generative method (termed PKAG-DDI) for DDIE text generation. It consists of a pairwise knowledge selector efficiently injecting structural information between drugs bidirectionally and simultaneously to select pairwise biological functions from the knowledge set, and a pairwise knowledge integration strategy that matches and integrates the selected biological functions into the LM. Experiments on two professional datasets show that PKAG-DDI outperforms existing methods in DDIE text generation, especially in challenging inductive scenarios, indicating its practicality and generalization.",

Our results highlight the formidable entropic and informational barriers to forming a viable protocell within the available window of Earth's early history.

    "abstract": "Porous nanomaterials have recently attracted a lot of attention due to various properties and potential applications. In this study, carbon nanoparticles (CNPs) were synthesized by the one-pot hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) using carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC). Urea was used as the nitrogen source for carbonization. The presence of urea in CMC solution for carbonization resulted in CNPsu reduction in the diameter of particles from 4 micrometer to 1 micrometer. Activation process at high temperature for both the above samples resulted in nanoparticles with diameter of 51 nm and 31 nm, respectively. The positive effect of presence urea and its activation generated different functional groups including C-N, N-H, and C -(triple bond)- N with increasing aromatic rings that probably may help entrapment of drugs into them. On the other hand, activation CNPsu (ACNPsu) has the most aromatic rings with the lowest hydroxyl groups with 84.66% carbon and 12.29% oxygen in its structures. ACNPs, and ACNPsu exhibited a type I isotherm indicating microporous materials with a high surface area about 552.9 m2/g and 351.01 m2/g, respectively. The high surface area was characteristic of activated carbons with their high adsorption capacity. Thus, the synthesized materials were characterized using SEM, TEM, DLS, BET, FTIR, HNMR, and TGA techniques. Finally, the encapsulation of clindamycin drug (CD) with positive charge in different types of NPs with negative charge was investigated for drug delivery in biomedical engineering applications.",

    "abstract": "The scarcity of molecules with desirable properties (i.e., 'positive' molecules) is an inherent bottleneck for generative molecule design. To sidestep such obstacle, here we propose molecular task arithmetic: training a model on diverse and abundant negative examples to learn 'property directions' $--$ without accessing any positively labeled data $--$ and moving models in the opposite property directions to generate positive molecules. When analyzed on 20 zero-shot design experiments, molecular task arithmetic generated more diverse and successful designs than models trained on positive molecules. Moreover, we employed molecular task arithmetic in dual-objective and few-shot design tasks. We find that molecular task arithmetic can consistently increase the diversity of designs while maintaining desirable design properties. With its simplicity, data efficiency, and performance, molecular task arithmetic bears the potential to become the $\\textit{de-facto}$ transfer learning strategy for de novo molecule design.",

    "abstract": "Phase separation in biomolecular mixtures can result from multiple physical interactions, which may act either complementarily or antagonistically. In the case of protein--nucleic acid mixtures, charge plays a key role but can have contrasting effects on phase behavior. Attractive electrostatic interactions between oppositely charged macromolecules are screened by added salt, reducing the driving force for coacervation. By contrast, base-pairing interactions between nucleic acids are diminished by charge repulsion and thus enhanced by added salt, promoting associative phase separation. To explore this interplay, we combine experiment and theory to map the complex phase behavior of a model solution of poly-L-lysine (PLL) and self-complementary DNA nanostars (NS) as a function of temperature, ionic strength, and macromolecular composition. Despite having opposite salt dependences, we find that electrostatics and base pairing cooperate to stabilize NS--PLL coacervation at high ionic strengths and temperatures, leading to two-phase or three-phase coexistence under various conditions. We further observe a variety of kinetic pathways to phase separation at different salt concentrations, resulting in the formation of nonequilibrium aggregates or droplets whose compositions evolve on long timescales. Finally, we show that the cooperativity between electrostatics and base pairing can be used to create multiphase coacervates that partition various NS species at intermediate salt concentrations. Our results illustrate how the interplay between distinct interaction modes can greatly increase the complexity of the phase behavior relative to systems with a single type of interaction.",

However, traditional Raman analysis relies on customized data-processing workflows that require fluorescence background removal and prior identification of Raman peaks of interest-introducing potential biases and inconsistencies. Here, we introduce DIVA (Deep-learning-based Investigation of Vibrational Raman spectra for plant-stress Analysis), a fully automated workflow based on a variational autoencoder. Unlike conventional approaches, DIVA processes native Raman spectra-including fluorescence backgrounds-without manual preprocessing, identifying and quantifying significant spectral features in an unbiased manner. We applied DIVA to detect a range of plant stresses, including abiotic (shading, high light intensity, high temperature) and biotic stressors (bacterial infections).

To address this limitation, we evaluated Bright-Dtech___-614 Europium nanoparticles to enhance LFIA assay sensitivity. These nanoparticles exhibited a luminescence quantum yield of 70 % and a 90 % conjugation efficacy with antibodies by direct adsorption. Considering these properties, we developed an LFIA to quantify human lactate dehydrogenase (h-LDH), a biomarker and therapeutic target in cancer disease. The Bright-Dtech___-614 Eu nanoparticle-based assay achieved a detection limit of 38 pg mL -1 , representing a 686-fold, 15-fold, and 2.9-fold improvement in sensitivity over conventional LFIA platforms using gold (AuNPs), carbon nanoparticles, and standard ELISA, respectively. The assay exhibited strong accuracy, with a mean recovery rate of 108 $\\pm$ 11 %, and demonstrated excellent reproducibility, as evidenced by inter-and intra-batch RSD values of 4.9 % and 9.7 %, respectively, when testing LDH-spiked serum samples.

    "abstract": "Plastics are essential to modern life, yet poor disposal practices contribute to low recycling rates and environmental accumulation-biological degradation and by-product reuse offer a path to mitigate this global threat. This report highlights key insights, future challenges, and research priorities identified during the CECAM workshop \"Computations Meet Experiments to Advance the Enzymatic Depolymerization of Plastics One Atom at a Time\", held in Trieste from May 6-8, 2025. The workshop brought together an interdisciplinary community of scientists focused on advancing the sustainable use of plastics through enzyme-based degradation. A key point from the discussions is that many bottlenecks in enzymatic recycling arise not only from process engineering challenges, but also from a limited understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms. We argue that constraints on economic viability and sustainability (e.g., harsh solvents, high temperatures, substrate crystallinity, pretreatments) can-and should-be addressed directly through enzyme design, provided these factors are understood at the molecular level, in synergy with process optimization. For this, it is essential to rely on the integration of experimental and computational approaches to uncover the molecular and mechanistic basis of enzymatic plastic degradation. We highlight how the small-format structure of the workshop, in line with the usual CECAM format, fostered a collaborative, friendly, and relaxed atmosphere. We hope this report encourages future initiatives and the formation of shared consortia to support an open, collaborative, and bio-based plastic recycling community.",

In this work, we propose a novel pipeline, MoDyGAN, that leverages molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to explore protein conformational spaces. MoDyGAN contains a generator that maps Gaussian distributions into MD-derived protein trajectories, and a refinement module that combines ensemble learning with a dual-discriminator to further improve the plausibility of generated conformations. Central to our approach is an innovative representation technique that reversibly transforms 3D protein structures into 2D matrices, enabling the use of advanced image-based GAN architectures. We use three rigid proteins to demonstrate that MoDyGAN can generate plausible new conformations. We also use deca-alanine as a case study to show that interpolations within the latent space closely align with trajectories obtained from steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations. Our results suggest that representing proteins as image-like data unlocks new possibilities for applying advanced deep learning techniques to biomolecular simulation, leading to an efficient sampling of conformational states. Additionally, the proposed framework holds strong potential for extension to other complex 3D structures.",

Bayesian Flow Networks (BFNs) have recently shown impressive performance across diverse chemical tasks, with their success often ascribed to the paradigm of modeling in a low-variance parameter space. However, the Bayesian inference-based strategy imposes limitations on designing more flexible distribution transformation pathways, making it challenging to adapt to diverse data distributions and varied task requirements. Furthermore, the potential for simpler, more efficient parameter-space-based models is unexplored. To address this, we propose a novel Parameter Interpolation Flow model (named PIF) with detailed theoretical foundation, training, and inference procedures. We then develop MolPIF for structure-based drug design, demonstrating its superior performance across diverse metrics compared to baselines.

    "abstract": "Unlocking the potential of nanomaterials in medicine and environmental science hinges on understanding their interactions with proteins, a complex decision space where AI is poised to make a transformative impact. However, progress has been hindered by limited datasets and the restricted generalizability of existing models. Here, we propose NanoPro-3M, the largest nanomaterial-protein interaction dataset to date, comprising over 3.2 million samples and 37,000 unique proteins. Leveraging this, we present NanoProFormer, a foundational model that predicts nanomaterial-protein affinities through multimodal representation learning, demonstrating strong generalization, handling missing features, and unseen nanomaterials or proteins. We show that multimodal modeling significantly outperforms single-modality approaches and identifies key determinants of corona formation. Furthermore, we demonstrate its applicability to a range of downstream tasks through zero-shot inference and fine-tuning. Together, this work establishes a solid foundation for high-performance and generalized prediction of nanomaterial-protein interaction endpoints, reducing experimental reliance and accelerating various in vitro applications.",

    "abstract": "Combinatorial optimization algorithm is essential in computer-aided drug design by progressively exploring chemical space to design lead compounds with high affinity to target protein. However current methods face inherent challenges in integrating domain knowledge, limiting their performance in identifying lead compounds with novel and valid binding mode. Here, we propose AutoLeadDesign, a lead compounds design framework that inspires extensive domain knowledge encoded in large language models with chemical fragments to progressively implement efficient exploration of vast chemical space. The comprehensive experiments indicate that AutoLeadDesign outperforms baseline methods. Significantly, empirical lead design campaigns targeting two clinically relevant targets (PRMT5 and SARS-CoV-2 PLpro) demonstrate AutoLeadDesign's competence in de novo generation of lead compounds achieving expert-competitive design efficacy. Structural analysis further confirms their mechanism-validated inhibitory patterns. By tracing the process of design, we find that AutoLeadDesign shares analogous mechanisms with fragment-based drug design which traditionally rely on the expert decision-making, further revealing why it works. Overall, AutoLeadDesign offers an efficient approach for lead compounds design, suggesting its potential utility in drug design.",

Fold-switching proteins challenge this expectation by remodeling their secondary and/or tertiary structures in response to cellular stimuli.

The widening scope of fold switching draws attention to the ways it challenges conventional wisdom, raising fundamental unanswered questions about protein structure, biophysics, and evolution.

    "abstract": "Generative chemical language models (CLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in molecular design, yet their impact in drug discovery remains limited by the absence of reliable reward signals and the lack of interpretability in their outputs. We present SAFE-T, a generalist chemical modeling framework that conditions on biological context -- such as protein targets or mechanisms of action -- to prioritize and design molecules without relying on structural information or engineered scoring functions. SAFE-T models the conditional likelihood of fragment-based molecular sequences given a biological prompt, enabling principled scoring of molecules across tasks such as virtual screening, drug-target interaction prediction, and activity cliff detection. Moreover, it supports goal-directed generation by sampling from this learned distribution, aligning molecular design with biological objectives. In comprehensive zero-shot evaluations across predictive (LIT-PCBA, DAVIS, KIBA, ACNet) and generative (DRUG, PMO) benchmarks, SAFE-T consistently achieves performance comparable to or better than existing approaches while being significantly faster. Fragment-level attribution further reveals that SAFE-T captures known structure-activity relationships, supporting interpretable and biologically grounded design. Together with its computational efficiency, these results demonstrate that conditional generative CLMs can unify scoring and generation to accelerate early-stage drug discovery.",

    "abstract": "This work presents BioPykrete, a new sustainable bio-composite material created from ice, nano-crystalline cellulose (CNC), and a tailor-made chimera protein designed to bind the two together. We developed and produced the chimera protein by linking AFPIII, an ice-binding protein, with CBM3a, a CNC-binding protein. As the suspension freezes, the CNC chains self-organize into a reinforcing network between the ice crystals. This structural enhancement limits crack propagation to typical pore sizes, allowing BioPykrete to avoid the brittle and sudden failure commonly associated with ice. Instead, it exhibits an elastic-like response to stress, making it suitable for construction and engineering applications. With compressive strength comparable with concrete, BioPykrete offers a sustainable and biodegradable alternative to construction materials suitable for the harsh arctic regions of the world where traditional methods are ineffective, and resources are scarce. Engineering chimera proteins with specific affinity to more than a single material type may help improve or tailor the properties of other composite materials.",

    "abstract": "Structure-based virtual screening aims to identify high-affinity ligands by estimating binding free energies between proteins and small molecules. However, the conformational flexibility of both proteins and ligands challenges conventional rigid docking methods that assume a fixed receptor structure. In this study, we examined the impact of conformational diversity on binding energy calculations using 79 HIV-1 protease-ligand complexes. Molecular dynamics simulations were employed to generate structural ensembles for both proteins and ligands in aqueous environments. RMSD-based clustering was applied to reduce redundancy while preserving structural diversity. Binding energies were computed using van der Waals and electrostatic interactions. The results demonstrated that native protein-ligand pairs consistently yielded favorable binding energies, whereas non-native pairings often failed to reproduce binding. Furthermore, clustering thresholds influenced the balance between computational cost and interaction accuracy. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating multiple protein and ligand conformations in SBVS protocols to improve prediction reliability and support more effective drug discovery strategies.",

Yet aimless sampling is inefficient and costly, producing many redundant conformations with limited diversity, so additional computation often yields little improvement. Here, we present HelixFold-S1, a guided planning approach that strategically targets the most informative regions of conformational space to produce accurate conformations. For each biomolecule, predicted inter-chain contact probabilities serve as a blueprint of the conformational space, guiding computational effort toward higher-probability, low-redundancy contacts that constrain structure generation. Across diverse biomolecular benchmarks, HelixFold-S1 achieves markedly higher structural accuracy than traditional unguided methods while reducing sampling requirements by an order of magnitude. Predicted contact probabilities also provide a rough indicator of prediction difficulty and sampling utility. These results demonstrate that guided planning reshapes conformational exploration and enables more efficient and accurate structural inference.",

While machine learning (ML) promises fast and accurate predictions, its progress is constrained by the availability of reliable data. In contrast, physics-based methods such as absolute binding free energy perturbation (AB-FEP) deliver high accuracy but are computationally prohibitive for high-throughput applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce ToxBench, the first large-scale AB-FEP dataset designed for ML development and focused on a single pharmaceutically critical target, Human Estrogen Receptor Alpha (ER$α$). ToxBench contains 8,770 ER$α$-ligand complex structures with binding free energies computed via AB-FEP with a subset validated against experimental affinities at 1.75 kcal/mol RMSE, along with non-overlapping ligand splits to assess model generalizability. Using ToxBench, we further benchmark state-of-the-art ML methods, and notably, our proposed DualBind model, which employs a dual-loss framework to effectively learn the binding energy function. The benchmark results demonstrate the superior performance of DualBind and the potential of ML to approximate AB-FEP at a fraction of the computational cost.",

Our motivation to encode the FCC lattice stems from our observation that the FCC lattice is more capable in terms of modeling realistic secondary structures in proteins compared to other lattices, as demonstrated using root mean square deviation (RMSD). We utilize two quantum methods to solve this problem: a polynomial fitting approach (PolyFit) and the Variational Quantum Eigensolver with constraints (VQEC) based on the Lagrangian duality principle. Both methods are successfully deployed on Eagle R3 (ibm_cleveland) and Heron R2 (ibm_kingston) quantum computers, where we are able to recover ground state configurations for the 6-amino acid sequence KLVFFA under noise. A comparative analysis of the outcomes generated by the two QPUs reveals a significant enhancement (reaching nearly a two-fold improvement for PolyFit and a three-fold improvement for VQEC) in the prediction and sampling of the optimal solution (ground state conformations) on the newer Heron R2 architecture, highlighting the impact of quantum hardware advancements for this application.",

    "abstract": "Motivation: Protein folding is a dynamic process during which a protein's amino acid sequence undergoes a series of 3-dimensional (3D) conformational changes en route to reaching a native 3D structure; the resulting 3D structural conformations are called folding intermediates. While data on native 3D structures are abundant, data on 3D structures of non-native intermediates remain sparse, due to limitations of current technologies for experimental determination of 3D structures. Yet, analyzing folding intermediates is crucial for understanding folding dynamics and misfolding-related diseases. Hence, we search the literature for available (experimentally and computationally obtained) 3D structural data on folding intermediates, organizing the data in a centralized resource. Additionally, we assess whether existing methods, designed for predicting native structures, can also be utilized to predict structures of non-native intermediates.   Results: Our literature search reveals six studies that provide 3D structural data on folding intermediates (two for post-translational and four for co-translational folding), each focused on a single protein, with 2-4 intermediates. Our assessment shows that an established method for predicting native structures, AlphaFold2, does not perform well for non-native intermediates in the context of co-translational folding; a recent study on post-translational folding concluded the same for even more existing methods. Yet, we identify in the literature recent pioneering methods designed explicitly to predict 3D structures of folding intermediates by incorporating intrinsic biophysical characteristics of folding dynamics, which show promise. This study assesses the current landscape and future directions of the field of 3D structural analysis of protein folding dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Red-blood-cell lysis (HC50) is the principal safety barrier for antimicrobial-peptide (AMP) therapeutics, yet existing models only say \"toxic\" or \"non-toxic.\" AmpLyze closes this gap by predicting the actual HC50 value from sequence alone and explaining the residues that drive toxicity. The model couples residue-level ProtT5/ESM2 embeddings with sequence-level descriptors in dual local and global branches, aligned by a cross-attention module and trained with log-cosh loss for robustness to assay noise. The optimal AmpLyze model reaches a PCC of 0.756 and an MSE of 0.987, outperforming classical regressors and the state-of-the-art. Ablations confirm that both branches are essential, and cross-attention adds a further 1% PCC and 3% MSE improvement. Expected-Gradients attributions reveal known toxicity hotspots and suggest safer substitutions. By turning hemolysis assessment into a quantitative, sequence-based, and interpretable prediction, AmpLyze facilitates AMP design and offers a practical tool for early-stage toxicity screening.",

    "abstract": "Molecular dynamics simulations are an essential tool in understanding protein structure, dynamics, and function at the atomic level. However, preparing high quality input files for MD simulations can be a time consuming and error prone process. In this work, we introduce an automated pipeline that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically Gemini 2.0 Flash, in conjunction with python scripting and Selenium based web automation to streamline the generation of MD input files. The pipeline exploits CHARMM GUI's comprehensive web-based interface for preparing simulation-ready inputs for NAMD. By integrating Gemini's code generation and iterative refinement capabilities, simulation scripts are automatically written, executed, and revised to navigate CHARMM GUI, extract appropriate parameters, and produce the required NAMD input files. Post processing is performed using additional software to further refine the simulation outputs, thereby enabling a complete and largely hands free workflow. Our results demonstrate that this approach reduces setup time, minimizes manual errors, and offers a scalable solution for handling multiple protein systems in parallel. This automated framework paves the way for broader application of LLMs in computational structural biology, offering a robust and adaptable platform for future developments in simulation automation.",

    "abstract": "Existing machine learning methods for molecular (e.g., gene) embeddings are restricted to specific tasks or data modalities, limiting their effectiveness within narrow domains. As a result, they fail to capture the full breadth of gene functions and interactions across diverse biological contexts. In this study, we have systematically evaluated knowledge representations of biomolecules across multiple dimensions representing a task-agnostic manner spanning three major data sources, including omics experimental data, literature-derived text data, and knowledge graph-based representations. To distinguish between meaningful biological signals from chance correlations, we devised an adjusted variant of Singular Vector Canonical Correlation Analysis (SVCCA) that quantifies signal redundancy and complementarity across different data modalities and sources. These analyses reveal that existing embeddings capture largely non-overlapping molecular signals, highlighting the value of embedding integration. Building on this insight, we propose Platform for Representation and Integration of multimodal Molecular Embeddings (PRISME), a machine learning based workflow using an autoencoder to integrate these heterogeneous embeddings into a unified multimodal representation. We validated this approach across various benchmark tasks, where PRISME demonstrated consistent performance, and outperformed individual embedding methods in missing value imputations. This new framework supports comprehensive modeling of biomolecules, advancing the development of robust, broadly applicable multimodal embeddings optimized for downstream biomedical machine learning applications.",

    "abstract": "This study introduces a hybrid approach integrating advanced plasmonic nanomaterials and machine learning (ML) for high-precision biomolecule detection. We leverage aluminum concave nanocubes (AlCNCs) as an innovative plasmonic substrate to enhance the native fluorescence of neurotransmitters, including dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE), and 3,4-Dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC). AlCNCs amplify weak fluorescence signals, enabling probe-free, label-free detection and differentiation of these molecules with great sensitivity and specificity. To further improve classification accuracy, we employ ML algorithms, with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks playing a central role in analyzing time-dependent fluorescence data. Comparative evaluations with k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Random Forest (RF) demonstrate the superior performance of LSTM in distinguishing neurotransmitters. The results reveal that AlCNC substrates provide up to a 12-fold enhancement in fluorescence intensity for DA, 9-fold for NE, and 7-fold for DOPAC compared to silicon substrates. At the same time, ML algorithms achieve classification accuracy exceeding 89%. This interdisciplinary methodology bridges the gap between nanotechnology and ML, showcasing the synergistic potential of AlCNC-enhanced native fluorescence and ML in biosensing. The framework paves the way for probe-free, label-free biomolecule profiling, offering transformative implications for biomedical diagnostics and neuroscience research.",

    "abstract": "Three-dimensional molecular generators based on diffusion models can now reach near-crystallographic accuracy, yet they remain fragmented across tasks. SMILES-only inputs, two-stage pretrain-finetune pipelines, and one-task-one-model practices hinder stereochemical fidelity, task alignment, and zero-shot transfer. We introduce MODA, a diffusion framework that unifies fragment growing, linker design, scaffold hopping, and side-chain decoration with a Bayesian mask scheduler. During training, a contiguous spatial fragment is masked and then denoised in one pass, enabling the model to learn shared geometric and chemical priors across tasks. Multi-task training yields a universal backbone that surpasses six diffusion baselines and three training paradigms on substructure, chemical property, interaction, and geometry. Model-C reduces ligand-protein clashes and substructure divergences while maintaining Lipinski compliance, whereas Model-B preserves similarity but trails in novelty and binding affinity. Zero-shot de novo design and lead-optimisation tests confirm stable negative Vina scores and high improvement rates without force-field refinement. These results demonstrate that a single-stage multi-task diffusion routine can replace two-stage workflows for structure-based molecular design.",

Existing therapeutic strategies often suffer from systemic toxicity, poor efficacy and fast-gained drug resistance. In this study, we designed a cyclic peptide system (c-RGDKYQ) that takes the advantage of the overexpression of tyrosinase in melanoma cells to trigger enzyme-mediated oxidation and self-assembly. The assembled peptide nanostructures can selectively disrupt the actin cytoskeleton, impairing cancer cellular functions, e.g., motility, adhesion, and proliferation, ultimately leading to apoptosis. This approach does not rely on external drug payloads or complex delivery mechanisms. c-RGDKYQ exhibits high selectivity for melanoma cells, strongly suppressing tumor growth in a murine model with minimal systemic toxicity. Our findings illuminate that, through targeting tyrosinase, c-RGDKYQ may be an enzyme-responsive alternative to conventional treatments for melanoma.",

Unfortunately, progress has been hindered by the lack of large-scale and high-quality binding affinity labels. The widely used PDBbind dataset has fewer than 20K labeled complexes. Self-supervised learning, especially graph contrastive learning (GCL), provides a unique opportunity to break the barrier by pre-training graph neural network models based on vast unlabeled complexes and fine-tuning the models on much fewer labeled complexes. However, the problem faces unique challenges, including a lack of a comprehensive unlabeled dataset with well-defined positive/negative complex pairs and the need to design GCL algorithms that incorporate the unique characteristics of such data. To fill the gap, we propose DecoyDB, a large-scale, structure-aware dataset specifically designed for self-supervised GCL on protein-ligand complexes. DecoyDB consists of high-resolution ground truth complexes (less than 2.5 Angstrom) and diverse decoy structures with computationally generated binding poses that range from realistic to suboptimal (negative pairs). Each decoy is annotated with a Root Mean Squared Deviation (RMSD) from the native pose. We further design a customized GCL framework to pre-train graph neural networks based on DecoyDB and fine-tune the models with labels from PDBbind. Extensive experiments confirm that models pre-trained with DecoyDB achieve superior accuracy, label efficiency, and generalizability.",

Several deep learning predictors for this task have been proposed, but, presumably due to the scarcity of binding data, these methods underperform computationally expensive estimates based on empirical force fields. In response, we propose a transfer-learning approach that leverages advances in protein sequence modeling and folding stability prediction for this task. The key idea is to parameterize the binding energy as the difference between the folding energy of the protein complex and the sum of the folding energies of its binding partners. We show that using a pre-trained inverse-folding model as a proxy for folding energy provides strong zero-shot performance, and can be fine-tuned with (1) copious folding energy measurements and (2) more limited binding energy measurements. The resulting predictor, StaB-ddG, is the first deep learning predictor to match the accuracy of the state-of-the-art empirical force-field method FoldX, while offering an over 1,000x speed-up.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have drawn rapidly increasing attention as the next-generation diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic agents. However, the heterogeneous nature of EVs necessitates advanced methods for profiling EVs at the single-particle level. While nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) is a widely used technique for quantifying particle size and concentration, conventional scattering-based systems are non-specific. In this study, we present an optimised protocol for quantitative profiling of EVs at the single-particle level by fluorescent NTA (F-NTA). The protocol integrates fluorescent immunolabeling of EVs with size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) to efficiently remove unbound labels, enabling the precise quantification of EV concentration, size distribution, and surface immunophenotype. We first validated this approach using biotinylated liposomes and EVs from cultured human cell lines, confirming effective removal of unbound labels and assessing labelling efficiency. We then demonstrated that F-NTA can distinguish EV subpopulations with distinct surface marker expression, exemplified by the differentiation of EpCAM-positive EVs derived from HT29 and HEK293 cells. Finally, we applied dual labelling to human plasma isolates to simultaneously profile EVs and non-vesicular extracellular particles, providing a quantitative quality assessment of EV purity at the single-particle level. The robustness of this method was further supported by comparative analysis with total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. This validated workflow enables robust, quantitative profiling of EV subpopulations, providing a critical tool for diverse EV applications, including biomarker discovery, therapeutic monitoring, and quality control for engineered vesicles.",

    "abstract": "Until today, the exact function of mammalian odorant binding proteins (OBPs) remains a topic of debate. Although their main established function lacks direct evidence in human olfaction, OBPs are traditionally believed to act as odorant transporters in the olfactory sense, which led to the exploration of OBPs as biomimetic sensor units in artificial noses. Now, available RNA-seq and proteomics data identified the expression of human OBPs (hOBP2A and hOBP2B) in both, male and female reproductive tissues. This observation prompted the conjecture that OBPs may possess functions that go beyond the olfactory sense, potentially as hormone transporters. Such a function could further link them to the tumorigenesis and cancer progression of hormone dependent cancer types including ovarian, breast, prostate and uterine cancer. In this structured review, we use available data to explore the effects of genetic alterations such as somatic copy number aberrations and single nucleotide variants on OBP function and their corresponding gene expression profiles. Our computational analyses suggest that somatic copy number aberrations in OBPs are associated with large changes in gene expression in reproductive cancers while point mutations have little to no effect. Additionally, the structural characteristics of OBPs, together with other lipocalin family members, allow us to explore putative functions within the context of cancer biology. Our overview consolidates current knowledge on putative human OBP functions, their expression patterns, and structural features. Finally, it provides an overview on applications, highlighting emerging hypotheses and future research directions within olfactory and non-olfactory roles.",

    "abstract": "The recent breakthrough of AlphaFold3 in modeling complex biomolecular interactions, including those between proteins and ligands, nucleotides, or metal ions, creates new opportunities for protein design. In so-called inverse protein folding, the objective is to find a sequence of amino acids that adopts a target protein structure. Many inverse folding methods struggle to predict sequences for complexes that contain non-protein components, and perform poorly with complexes that adopt multiple structural states. To address these challenges, we present ADFLIP (All-atom Discrete FLow matching Inverse Protein folding), a generative model based on discrete flow-matching for designing protein sequences conditioned on all-atom structural contexts. ADFLIP progressively incorporates predicted amino acid side chains as structural context during sequence generation and enables the design of dynamic protein complexes through ensemble sampling across multiple structural states. Furthermore, ADFLIP implements training-free classifier guidance sampling, which allows the incorporation of arbitrary pre-trained models to optimise the designed sequence for desired protein properties. We evaluated the performance of ADFLIP on protein complexes with small-molecule ligands, nucleotides, or metal ions, including dynamic complexes for which structure ensembles were determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in single-structure and multi-structure inverse folding tasks, demonstrating excellent potential for all-atom protein design.

    "title": "Molecular Machine Learning Using Euler Characteristic Transforms",
    "abstract": "The shape of a molecule determines its physicochemical and biological properties. However, it is often underrepresented in standard molecular representation learning approaches. Here, we propose using the Euler Characteristic Transform (ECT) as a geometrical-topological descriptor. Computed directly on a molecular graph derived from handcrafted atomic features, the ECT enables the extraction of multiscale structural features, offering a novel way to represent and encode molecular shape in the feature space. We assess the predictive performance of this representation across nine benchmark regression datasets, all centered around predicting the inhibition constant $K_i$. In addition, we compare our proposed ECT-based representation against traditional molecular representations and methods, such as molecular fingerprints/descriptors and graph neural networks (GNNs). Our results show that our ECT-based representation achieves competitive performance, ranking among the best-performing methods on several datasets. More importantly, its combination with traditional representations, particularly with the AVALON fingerprint, significantly \\emph{enhances predictive performance}, outperforming other methods on most datasets. These findings highlight the complementary value of multiscale topological information and its potential for being combined with established techniques. Our study suggests that hybrid approaches incorporating explicit shape information can lead to more informative and robust molecular representations, enhancing and opening new avenues in molecular machine learning tasks. To support reproducibility and foster open biomedical research, we provide open access to all experiments and code used in this work.",

    "title": "Quantifying Cross-Attention Interaction in Transformers for Interpreting TCR-pMHC Binding",
    "abstract": "CD8+ \"killer\" T cells and CD4+ \"helper\" T cells play a central role in the adaptive immune system by recognizing antigens presented by Major Histocompatibility Complex (pMHC) molecules via T Cell Receptors (TCRs). Modeling binding between T cells and the pMHC complex is fundamental to understanding basic mechanisms of human immune response as well as in developing therapies. While transformer-based models such as TULIP have achieved impressive performance in this domain, their black-box nature precludes interpretability and thus limits a deeper mechanistic understanding of T cell response. Most existing post-hoc explainable AI (XAI) methods are confined to encoder-only, co-attention, or model-specific architectures and cannot handle encoder-decoder transformers used in TCR-pMHC modeling. To address this gap, we propose Quantifying Cross-Attention Interaction (QCAI), a new post-hoc method designed to interpret the cross-attention mechanisms in transformer decoders. Quantitative evaluation is a challenge for XAI methods; we have compiled TCR-XAI, a benchmark consisting of 274 experimentally determined TCR-pMHC structures to serve as ground truth for binding. Using these structures we compute physical distances between relevant amino acid residues in the TCR-pMHC interaction region and evaluate how well our method and others estimate the importance of residues in this region across the dataset. We show that QCAI achieves state-of-the-art performance on both interpretability and prediction accuracy under the TCR-XAI benchmark.",

    "title": "Hierarchical Multi-Label Contrastive Learning for Protein-Protein Interaction Prediction Across Organisms",
    "abstract": "Recent advances in AI for science have highlighted the power of contrastive learning in bridging heterogeneous biological data modalities. Building on this paradigm, we propose HIPPO (HIerarchical Protein-Protein interaction prediction across Organisms), a hierarchical contrastive framework for protein-protein interaction(PPI) prediction, where protein sequences and their hierarchical attributes are aligned through multi-tiered biological representation matching. The proposed approach incorporates hierarchical contrastive loss functions that emulate the structured relationship among functional classes of proteins. The framework adaptively incorporates domain and family knowledge through a data-driven penalty mechanism, enforcing consistency between the learned embedding space and the intrinsic hierarchy of protein functions. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HIPPO achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods and showing robustness in low-data regimes. Notably, the model demonstrates strong zero-shot transferability to other species without retraining, enabling reliable PPI prediction and functional inference even in less characterized or rare organisms where experimental data are limited. Further analysis reveals that hierarchical feature fusion is critical for capturing conserved interaction determinants, such as binding motifs and functional annotations. This work advances cross-species PPI prediction and provides a unified framework for interaction prediction in scenarios with sparse or imbalanced multi-species data.",

    "abstract": "Therapeutic antibodies require not only high-affinity target engagement, but also favorable manufacturability, stability, and safety profiles for clinical effectiveness. These properties are collectively called `developability'. To enable a computational framework for optimizing antibody sequences for favorable developability, we introduce a guided discrete diffusion model trained on natural paired heavy- and light-chain sequences from the Observed Antibody Space (OAS) and quantitative developability measurements for 246 clinical-stage antibodies. To steer generation toward biophysically viable candidates, we integrate a Soft Value-based Decoding in Diffusion (SVDD) Module that biases sampling without compromising naturalness. In unconstrained sampling, our model reproduces global features of both the natural repertoire and approved therapeutics, and under SVDD guidance we achieve significant enrichment in predicted developability scores over unguided baselines. When combined with high-throughput developability assays, this framework enables an iterative, ML-driven pipeline for designing antibodies that satisfy binding and biophysical criteria in tandem.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous scientific research, capable of independently conducting complex experiments and serving non-specialists, represents a long-held aspiration. Achieving it requires a fundamental paradigm shift driven by artificial intelligence (AI). While autonomous experimental systems are emerging, they remain confined to areas featuring singular objectives and well-defined, simple experimental workflows, such as chemical synthesis and catalysis. We present an AI-native autonomous laboratory, targeting highly complex scientific experiments for applications like autonomous biomolecular engineering. This system autonomously manages instrumentation, formulates experiment-specific procedures and optimization heuristics, and concurrently serves multiple user requests. Founded on a co-design philosophy of models, experiments, and instruments, the platform supports the co-evolution of AI models and the automation system. This establishes an end-to-end, multi-user autonomous laboratory that handles complex, multi-objective experiments across diverse instrumentation. Our autonomous laboratory supports fundamental nucleic acid functions-including synthesis, transcription, amplification, and sequencing. It also enables applications in fields such as disease diagnostics, drug development, and information storage. Without human intervention, it autonomously optimizes experimental performance to match state-of-the-art results achieved by human scientists. In multi-user scenarios, the platform significantly improves instrument utilization and experimental efficiency. This platform paves the way for advanced biomaterials research to overcome dependencies on experts and resource barriers, establishing a blueprint for science-as-a-service at scale.",

    "abstract": "Hyperosmolarity is a key contributor to nucleus pulposus cell (NPC) apoptosis during intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD). Aquaporin 3 (AQP3), a membrane channel protein, regulates cellular osmotic balance by transporting water and osmolytes. Although AQP3 downregulation is associated with disc degeneration, its role in apoptosis under hyperosmotic conditions remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that hyperosmolarity induces AQP3 depletion, suppresses the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, and promotes mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS accumulation in NPCs. Lentiviral overexpression of AQP3 restores this pathway, attenuates oxidative damage, and reduces apoptosis, preserving disc structure in IVDD rat models. In contrast, pharmacological inhibition of AQP3 exacerbates ECM catabolism and NP tissue loss. Our findings reveal that AQP3 deficiency under hyperosmolarity contributes to NPC apoptosis via suppression of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling, potentially creating a pathological cycle of disc degeneration. These results highlight AQP3 as a promising therapeutic target for IVDD.",

In a streptavidin-biotin benchmark system with known ground truth clusters, Wasserstein distances yielded the best clustering performance, closely followed by Euclidean distances, both being the most computationally efficient similarity measures.

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in molecular property prediction. However, traditional graph representations struggle to effectively encode the inherent 3D spatial structures of molecules, as molecular orientations in 3D space introduce significant variability, severely limiting model generalization and robustness. Existing approaches primarily focus on rotation-invariant and rotation-equivariant methods. Invariant methods often rely heavily on prior knowledge and lack sufficient generalizability, while equivariant methods suffer from high computational costs. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel plug-and-play 3D encoding module leveraging rotational sampling. By computing the expectation over the SO(3) rotational group, the method naturally achieves approximate rotational invariance. Furthermore, by introducing a carefully designed post-alignment strategy, strict invariance can be achieved without compromising performance. Experimental evaluations on the QM9 and C10 Datasets demonstrate superior predictive accuracy, robustness, and generalization performance compared to existing methods. Moreover, the proposed approach maintains low computational complexity and enhanced interpretability, providing a promising direction for efficient and effective handling of 3D molecular information in drug discovery and material design.",

    "abstract": "The kernel reconstruction is a method that reduces noise in dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) by exploiting spatial correlations in the PET image. Although this method works well for large anatomical regions with relatively slow kinetics, whole body PET reconstruction with the kernel method can produce suboptimal results in regions with fast kinetics and high contrast. In this work we propose a new design of the spatial kernel matrix to improve reconstruction in fast and slow kinetics body regions. We calculate voxels features using nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) with optimal rank selection. These features are then used to calculate similarities between voxels considering relative differences between features to adapt to a wide range of activity levels. Simulations and whole body mouse scans of high temporal resolution [18F]SynVesT-1, low dose [11C]raclopride, and [18F]Fallypride were performed to assess the performance of the method in different settings. In simulations, bias vs variance tradeoff and contrast was improved using the NMF kernel matrix, compared with the original kernel method. In real data, fast kinetic regions such as the heart, veins and kidneys presented oversmoothing or artifacts with the original kernel method. Our proposed method did not present these effects, while reducing noise. Brain kinetic modeling parametric maps with image derived input function ([18F]SynVesT-1) and with reference region ([11C]raclopride and [18F]Fallypride) also had lower standard error using the proposed kernel matrix compared with other methods. The NMF kernel reconstruction reduces noise and maintains high contrast in whole body PET imaging, outperforming the traditional kernel method.",

Here, we provide a detailed accounting of how this energy is utilized: Approximately 75-83% is transduced into the chemical free energy of ATP synthesis, while the remaining 17-25% is dissipated through internal friction, viscous drag, proton leakage, electroviscous effects, elastic deformations, and information-theoretic costs. Each dissipation channel is quantitatively evaluated, revealing that internal friction in the F1 motor is the dominant loss mechanism. In this work, we did not account for the energy supplied/injected due to the intrinsic electrostatic potential of the enzyme itself. In addition to this energy bookkeeping, we also examine the quantum mechanical constraints on the Fo unit's rotation. We find that, as can be expected, the energy spacing between quantized rotational states is several orders of magnitude smaller than thermal energies at physiological temperature, and that the tunneling probability through rotational barriers practically totally non-existent. Furthermore, the biological rotation speed (100-650 revolutions per second (rps)) is between one and three orders of magnitude below the quantum limit implied by quantization of angular momentum of the c-ring (which would have been ca. 13,000 to 62,000 rps (depending on the size of the c-ring (17 to 8 subunits, respectively)) in the first rotational energy level of the c-ring). Nevertheless, experimental estimates of the rotation rates in isolated c-ring suggest rates in the vicinity of 43,000 rps, right within our theoretical quantum estimates. However, ATP synthase as a whole operates firmly within the classical regime, despite its nanoscale dimensions, and highlight its evolutionary optimization for robust and efficient energy conversion....",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in geometric deep learning and generative modeling have enabled the design of novel proteins with a wide range of desired properties. However, current state-of-the-art approaches are typically restricted to generating proteins with only static target properties, such as motifs and symmetries. In this work, we take a step towards overcoming this limitation by proposing a framework to condition structure generation on flexibility, which is crucial for key functionalities such as catalysis or molecular recognition. We first introduce BackFlip, an equivariant neural network for predicting per-residue flexibility from an input backbone structure. Relying on BackFlip, we propose FliPS, an SE(3)-equivariant conditional flow matching model that solves the inverse problem, that is, generating backbones that display a target flexibility profile. In our experiments, we show that FliPS is able to generate novel and diverse protein backbones with the desired flexibility, verified by Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. FliPS and BackFlip are available at https://github.com/graeter-group/flips .",

    "abstract": "Harnessing the topology of ring polymers as a design motif in functional nanomaterials is becoming a promising direction in the field of soft matter. For example, the ring topology of DNA plasmids prevents the relaxation of excess twist introduced to the polymer, instead resulting in helical supercoiled structures. In equilibrium semi-dilute solutions, tightly supercoiled rings relax faster than their torsionally relaxed counterparts, since the looser conformations of the latter allow for rings to thread through each other and entrain via entanglements. Here we use molecular simulations to explore a non-equilibrium scenario, in which a supercoiling agent, akin to gyrase enzymes, rapidly induces supercoiling in the suspensions of relaxed plasmids. The activity of the agent not only alters the conformational topology from open to branched, but also locks-in threaded rings into supramolecular clusters, which relax very slowly. Ultimately, our work shows how the polymer topology under non-equilibrium conditions can be leveraged to tune dynamic behavior of macromolecular systems, suggesting a pathway to novel class of driven materials glassified by activity.",

Driven by recent computational advances, including powerful machine learning frameworks, researchers can now resolve both discrete structural states and continuous conformational changes from 3D subtomograms and stacks of 2D particle-images acquired across tilt-series. In this review, we survey recent innovations in particle classification and heterogeneous 3D reconstruction methods, focusing specifically on the relative merits of workflows that operate on reconstructed 3D subtomogram volumes compared to those using extracted 2D particle-images. We additionally highlight how these methods have provided specific biological insights into the organization, dynamics, and structural variability of cellular components. Finally, we advocate for the development of benchmarking datasets collected in vitro and in situ to enable a more objective comparison of existent and emerging methods for particle classification and heterogeneous 3D reconstruction.",

    "abstract": "The low complexity domain of Fused in Sarcoma (FUS-LC consisting of 214 residues) undergoes phase separation, resulting in a dense liquid-like phase that forms early and slowly matures to reach ordered gel-like state on long time scales. Upon maturation, core-1, comprising of the 57 residues (39-95) in the N-terminus become structured, resulting in the formation of a non-polymorphic fibril. The truncated FUS-LC-C (residues 110-214) construct forms a fibril in which core-2 (residues 112-150) adopts a $β$-sheet structure. Using coarse-grained monomer SOP-IDP model simulations of FUS-LC, we predict that residues 155-190 in the C-terminal (core-3) form rapidly, followed by core-2, and finally core-1. The time scale of formation of the cores and their stabilities are inversely correlated, as anticipated by the Ostwald's rule of stages. Unbiased multichain simulations show that the chemical potentials in the two phases are equal and the calculated densities of the dense and dilute phases are in agreement with experiments. The dense phase, which forms by a nucleation mechanism, coarsens over time by a process that is reminiscent of Ostwald ripening. AlphaFold predictions of the core-3 structure and the simulations show that $β$-strand emerges in the core-3 region early during the droplet formation, and drives the initiation of FUS-LC assembly. The techniques introduced here are general and could be used to probe assembly of other IDPs such as TDP-43, which shares many features with FUS-LC.",

    "abstract": "Molecular docking plays a crucial role in predicting the binding mode of ligands to target proteins, and covalent interactions, which involve the formation of a covalent bond between the ligand and the target, are particularly valuable due to their strong, enduring binding nature. However, most existing docking methods and deep learning approaches hardly account for the formation of covalent bonds and the associated structural changes. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark for covalent docking, CovDocker, which is designed to better capture the complexities of covalent binding. We decompose the covalent docking process into three main tasks: reactive location prediction, covalent reaction prediction, and covalent docking. By adapting state-of-the-art models, such as Uni-Mol and Chemformer, we establish baseline performances and demonstrate the effectiveness of the benchmark in accurately predicting interaction sites and modeling the molecular transformations involved in covalent binding. These results confirm the role of the benchmark as a rigorous framework for advancing research in covalent drug design. It underscores the potential of data-driven approaches to accelerate the discovery of selective covalent inhibitors and addresses critical challenges in therapeutic development.",

    "abstract": "We present a modular framework powered by large language models (LLMs) that automates and streamlines key tasks across the early-stage computational drug discovery pipeline. By combining LLM reasoning with domain-specific tools, the framework performs biomedical data retrieval, domain-specific question answering, molecular generation, property prediction, property-aware molecular refinement, and 3D protein-ligand structure generation. In a case study targeting BCL-2 in lymphocytic leukemia, the agent autonomously retrieved relevant biomolecular information, including FASTA sequences, SMILES representations, and literature, and answered mechanistic questions with improved contextual accuracy compared to standard LLMs. It then generated chemically diverse seed molecules and predicted 67 ADMET-related properties, which guided iterative molecular refinement. Across two refinement rounds, the number of molecules with QED > 0.6 increased from 34 to 55. The number of molecules satisfying empirical drug-likeness filters also rose; for example, compliance with the Ghose filter increased from 32 to 55 within a pool of 100 molecules. The framework also employed Boltz-2 to generate 3D protein-ligand complexes and provide rapid binding affinity estimates for candidate compounds. These results demonstrate that the approach effectively supports molecular screening, prioritization, and structure evaluation. Its modular design enables flexible integration of evolving tools and models, providing a scalable foundation for AI-assisted therapeutic discovery.",

    "abstract": "Protein structure prediction models such as AlphaFold3 (AF3) push the frontier of biomolecular modeling by incorporating science-informed architectural changes to the transformer architecture. However, these advances come at a steep system cost, introducing: compute- and memory-intensive operators, 2D attention mechanisms, and retrieval-augmented data pipelines, which collectively hinder the scalability of AF3 training. In this work, we present MegaFold, a cross-platform system to accelerate AF3 training. MegaFold tackles key bottlenecks through ahead-of-time caching to eliminate GPU idle time from the retrieval-augmented data pipeline, Triton-based kernels for memory-efficient EvoAttention on heterogeneous devices, and deep fusion for common and critical small operators in AF3. Evaluation on both NVIDIA H200 and AMD MI250 GPUs shows that MegaFold reduces peak memory usage of AF3 training by up to 1.23$\\times$ and improves per-iteration training time by up-to 1.73$\\times$ and 1.62$\\times$ respectively. More importantly, MegaFold enables training on 1.35$\\times$ longer sequence lengths compared to PyTorch baselines without running out-of-memory, significantly improving the scalability of modern protein folding models.

    "abstract": "We have previously shown in model studies that rapid quenches of systems of monomers interacting to form polymer chains can fix nonequilibrium chemistries which could lead to the origin of life. We suggested that such quenching processes might have occurred at very high rates on early earth, giving an efficient mechanism for natural sorting through enormous numbers of nonequilibrium chemistries from which those most likely to lead to life could be naturally selected. Taking account of kinetic barriers, we found good agreement between laboratory quenching experiments on solutions of amino acids and the resulting model. We also made a preliminary comparison between reported data on polypeptides sampled from emissions from smokers near ocean ridges and our model. However that previous model assumed that the concentrations of all monomeric amino acids in the medium were the same whereas that is not the case in samples taken from ocean smokers. Here we take account of the heterogeneous concentrations of the amino acid monomers in the medium in the analysis of the smoker data and compare the results with the data on polypeptide concentrations found in the samples taken by a submersible in the Marianna Trough. Results are consistent with the hypothesis that smokers were the source of large and extremely diverse number of polypeptides in thermal disequilibrium which could incubate processes leading to life.",

We introduce PocketVina, a fast and memory-efficient, search-based docking framework that combines pocket prediction with systematic multi-pocket exploration. We evaluate PocketVina across four established benchmarks--PDBbind2020 (timesplit and unseen), DockGen, Astex, and PoseBusters--and observe consistently strong performance in sampling physically valid docking poses. PocketVina achieves state-of-the-art performance when jointly considering ligand RMSD and physical validity (PB-valid), while remaining competitive with deep learning-based approaches in terms of RMSD alone, particularly on structurally diverse and previously unseen targets. PocketVina also maintains state-of-the-art physically valid docking accuracy across ligands with varying degrees of flexibility. We further introduce TargetDock-AI, a benchmarking dataset we curated, consisting of over 500000 protein-ligand pairs, and a partition of the dataset labeled with PubChem activity annotations. On this large-scale dataset, PocketVina successfully discriminates active from inactive targets, outperforming a deep learning baseline while requiring significantly less GPU memory and runtime. PocketVina offers a robust and scalable docking strategy that requires no task-specific training and runs efficiently on standard GPUs, making it well-suited for high-throughput virtual screening and structure-based drug discovery.",

    "abstract": "Sampling low-energy molecular conformations, spatial arrangements of atoms in a molecule, is a critical task for many different calculations performed in the drug discovery and optimization process. Numerous specialized equivariant networks have been designed to generate molecular conformations from 2D molecular graphs. Recently, non-equivariant transformer models have emerged as a viable alternative due to their capability to scale to improve generalization. However, the concern has been that non-equivariant models require a large model size to compensate the lack of equivariant bias. In this paper, we demonstrate that a well-chosen positional encoding effectively addresses these size limitations. A standard transformer model incorporating relative positional encoding for molecular graphs when scaled to 25 million parameters surpasses the current state-of-the-art non-equivariant base model with 64 million parameters on the GEOM-DRUGS benchmark. We implemented relative positional encoding as a negative attention bias that linearly increases with the shortest path distances between graph nodes at varying slopes for different attention heads, similar to ALiBi, a widely adopted relative positional encoding technique in the NLP domain. This architecture has the potential to serve as a foundation for a novel class of generative models for molecular conformations.",

    "abstract": "Protein language models (pLMs) excel in a variety of tasks that range from structure prediction to the design of functional enzymes. However, these models operate as black boxes, and their underlying working principles remain unclear. Here, we survey emerging applications of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to pLMs and describe the potential of XAI in protein research. We divide the workflow of protein AI modeling into four information contexts: (i) training sequences, (ii) input prompt, (iii) model architecture, and (iv) output sequence. For each, we describe existing methods and applications of XAI. Additionally, from published studies we distil five (potential) roles that XAI can play in protein research: Evaluator, Multitasker, Engineer, Coach, and Teacher, with the Evaluator role being the only one widely adopted so far. These roles aim to help both protein scientists and model developers understand the possibilities and limitations of implementing XAI for predictive and generative tasks. While our analysis focuses on pLMs, both this categorization and roles are broadly applicable to any other model architectures. We conclude by highlighting critical areas of application for the future, including risks related to security, trustworthiness, and bias, and we call for community benchmarks, open-source tooling, domain-specific visualizations, and wet-lab characterization to advance the interpretability of protein AI.",

    "abstract": "Understanding and modeling enzyme-substrate interactions is crucial for catalytic mechanism research, enzyme engineering, and metabolic engineering. Although a large number of predictive methods have emerged, they do not incorporate prior knowledge of enzyme catalysis to rationally modulate general protein-molecule features that are misaligned with catalytic patterns. To address this issue, we introduce a two-stage progressive framework, OmniESI, for enzyme-substrate interaction prediction through conditional deep learning. By decomposing the modeling of enzyme-substrate interactions into a two-stage progressive process, OmniESI incorporates two conditional networks that respectively emphasize enzymatic reaction specificity and crucial catalysis-related interactions, facilitating a gradual feature modulation in the latent space from general protein-molecule domain to catalysis-aware domain. On top of this unified architecture, OmniESI can adapt to a variety of downstream tasks, including enzyme kinetic parameter prediction, enzyme-substrate pairing prediction, enzyme mutational effect prediction, and enzymatic active site annotation. Under the multi-perspective performance evaluation of in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings, OmniESI consistently delivered superior performance than state-of-the-art specialized methods across seven benchmarks. More importantly, the proposed conditional networks were shown to internalize the fundamental patterns of catalytic efficiency while significantly improving prediction performance, with only negligible parameter increases (0.16%), as demonstrated by ablation studies on key components. Overall, OmniESI represents a unified predictive approach for enzyme-substrate interactions, providing an effective tool for catalytic mechanism cracking and enzyme engineering with strong generalization and broad applicability.",

    "abstract": "Accurate prediction of antibody-antigen (Ab-Ag) binding affinity is essential for therapeutic design and vaccine development, yet the performance of current models is limited by noisy experimental labels, heterogeneous assay conditions, and poor generalization across the vast antibody and antigen sequence space. We introduce AbRank, a large-scale benchmark and evaluation framework that reframes affinity prediction as a pairwise ranking problem. AbRank aggregates over 380,000 binding assays from nine heterogeneous sources, spanning diverse antibodies, antigens, and experimental conditions, and introduces standardized data splits that systematically increase distribution shift, from local perturbations such as point mutations to broad generalization across novel antigens and antibodies. To ensure robust supervision, AbRank defines an m-confident ranking framework by filtering out comparisons with marginal affinity differences, focusing training on pairs with at least an m-fold difference in measured binding strength. As a baseline for the benchmark, we introduce WALLE-Affinity, a graph-based approach that integrates protein language model embeddings with structural information to predict pairwise binding preferences. Our benchmarks reveal significant limitations in current methods under realistic generalization settings and demonstrate that ranking-based training improves robustness and transferability. In summary, AbRank offers a robust foundation for machine learning models to generalize across the antibody-antigen space, with direct relevance for scalable, structure-aware antibody therapeutic design.",

    "abstract": "Generating diverse, all-atom conformational ensembles of dynamic proteins such as G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is critical for understanding their function, yet most generative models simplify atomic detail or ignore conformational diversity altogether. We present latent diffusion for full protein generation (LD-FPG), a framework that constructs complete all-atom protein structures, including every side-chain heavy atom, directly from molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories. LD-FPG employs a Chebyshev graph neural network (ChebNet) to obtain low-dimensional latent embeddings of protein conformations, which are processed using three pooling strategies: blind, sequential and residue-based. A diffusion model trained on these latent representations generates new samples that a decoder, optionally regularized by dihedral-angle losses, maps back to Cartesian coordinates. Using D2R-MD, a 2-microsecond MD trajectory (12 000 frames) of the human dopamine D2 receptor in a membrane environment, the sequential and residue-based pooling strategy reproduces the reference ensemble with high structural fidelity (all-atom lDDT of approximately 0.7; C-alpha-lDDT of approximately 0.8) and recovers backbone and side-chain dihedral-angle distributions with a Jensen-Shannon divergence of less than 0.03 compared to the MD data. LD-FPG thereby offers a practical route to system-specific, all-atom ensemble generation for large proteins, providing a promising tool for structure-based therapeutic design on complex, dynamic targets. The D2R-MD dataset and our implementation are freely available to facilitate further research.",

To address the data imbalance in the aptamer dataset imbalance, we incorporated short RNA-protein interaction data in the training set. This resulted in a training accuracy of 98.9% and a test accuracy of 88.0%, demonstrating the model's effectiveness in accurately predicting APIs.

However, current benchmarks inadequately assess model performance in biologically challenging contexts, especially those involving intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), limiting their utility in applications such as drug discovery, disease variant interpretation, and protein interface design. We introduce DisProtBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating protein structure prediction models (PSPMs) under structural disorder and complex biological conditions. DisProtBench spans three key axes: (1) Data complexity, covering disordered regions, G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) ligand pairs, and multimeric complexes; (2) Task diversity, benchmarking twelve leading PSPMs across structure-based tasks with unified classification, regression, and interface metrics; and (3) Interpretability, via the DisProtBench Portal, which provides precomputed 3D structures and visual error analyses. Our results reveal significant variability in model robustness under disorder, with low-confidence regions linked to functional prediction failures. Notably, global accuracy metrics often fail to predict task performance in disordered settings, emphasizing the need for function-aware evaluation. DisProtBench establishes a reproducible, extensible, and biologically grounded framework for assessing next-generation PSPMs in realistic biomedical scenarios.",

    "abstract": "A range of computational biology software (GROMACS, AMBER, NAMD, LAMMPS, OpenMM, Psi4 and RELION) was benchmarked on a representative selection of HPC hardware, including AMD EPYC 7742 CPU nodes, NVIDIA V100 and AMD MI250X GPU nodes, and an NVIDIA GH200 testbed. The raw performance, power efficiency and data storage requirements of the software was evaluated for each HPC facility, along with qualitative factors such as the user experience and software environment. It was found that the diversity of methods used within computational biology means that there is no single HPC hardware that can optimally run every type of HPC job, and that diverse hardware is the only way to properly support all methods. New hardware, such as AMD GPUs and Nvidia AI chips, are mostly compatible with existing methods, but are also more labour-intensive to support. GPUs offer the most efficient way to run most computational biology tasks, though some tasks still require CPUs. A fast HPC node running molecular dynamics can produce around 10GB of data per day, however, most facilities and research institutions lack short-term and long-term means to store this data. Finally, as the HPC landscape has become more complex, deploying software and keeping HPC systems online has become more difficult. This situation could be improved through hiring/training in DevOps practices, expanding the consortium model to provide greater support to HPC system administrators, and implementing build frameworks/containerisation/virtualisation tools to allow users to configure their own software environment, rather than relying on centralised software installations.",

    "abstract": "Simultaneously optimizing molecules against multiple therapeutic targets remains a profound challenge in drug discovery, particularly due to sparse rewards and conflicting design constraints. We propose a structured active learning (AL) paradigm integrating a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) variational autoencoder (VAE) into iterative loops designed to balance chemical diversity, molecular quality, and multi-target affinity. Our method alternates between expanding chemically feasible regions of latent space and progressively constraining molecules based on increasingly stringent multi-target docking thresholds. In a proof-of-concept study targeting three related coronavirus main proteases (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV), our approach efficiently generated a structurally diverse set of pan-inhibitor candidates. We demonstrate that careful timing and strategic placement of chemical filters within this active learning pipeline markedly enhance exploration of beneficial chemical space, transforming the sparse-reward, multi-objective drug design problem into an accessible computational task. Our framework thus provides a generalizable roadmap for efficiently navigating complex polypharmacological landscapes.",

However, most approaches still struggle to balance pocket-specific geometric fit with strict valence and synthetic constraints. To resolve this trade-off, a Retrieval-Enhanced Aligned Diffusion termed READ is introduced, which is the first to merge molecular Retrieval-Augmented Generation with an SE(3)-equivariant diffusion model. Specifically, a contrastively pre-trained encoder aligns atom-level representations during training, then retrieves graph embeddings of pocket-matched scaffolds to guide each reverse-diffusion step at inference. This single mechanism can inject real-world chemical priors exactly where needed, producing valid, diverse, and shape-complementary ligands. Experimental results demonstrate that READ can achieve very competitive performance in CBGBench, surpassing state-of-the-art generative models and even native ligands. That suggests retrieval and diffusion can be co-optimized for faster, more reliable structure-based drug design.",

    "abstract": "Peptide sequencing-the process of identifying amino acid sequences from mass spectrometry data-is a fundamental task in proteomics. Non-Autoregressive Transformers (NATs) have proven highly effective for this task, outperforming traditional methods. Unlike autoregressive models, which generate tokens sequentially, NATs predict all positions simultaneously, leveraging bidirectional context through unmasked self-attention. However, existing NAT approaches often rely on Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss, which presents significant optimization challenges due to CTC's complexity and increases the risk of training failures. To address these issues, we propose an improved non-autoregressive peptide sequencing model that incorporates a structured protein sequence curriculum learning strategy. This approach adjusts protein's learning difficulty based on the model's estimated protein generational capabilities through a sampling process, progressively learning peptide generation from simple to complex sequences. Additionally, we introduce a self-refining inference-time module that iteratively enhances predictions using learned NAT token embeddings, improving sequence accuracy at a fine-grained level. Our curriculum learning strategy reduces NAT training failures frequency by more than 90% based on sampled training over various data distributions. Evaluations on nine benchmark species demonstrate that our approach outperforms all previous methods across multiple metrics and species.",

In a recent study, Cia et al. (2023) evaluated the performance of conformational B-cell epitope prediction methods on a well-curated dataset, revealing that most approaches, including CBTOPE, exhibited poor performance. One plausible cause of this diminished performance is that available methods were trained on datasets that are both limited in size and outdated in content. In this study, we present an enhanced version of CBTOPE, trained, tested, and evaluated using the well-curated dataset from Cai et al. (2023). Initially, we developed machine learning-based models using binary profiles, achieving a maximum AUC of 0.58 on the validation dataset. The performance of our method improved significantly from an AUC of 0.58 to 0.63 when incorporating evolutionary information in the form of a Position-Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM) profile. Furthermore, the performance increased from an AUC of 0.63 to 0.64 when we integrated both the PSSM profile and relative solvent accessibility (RSA). All models were trained, tested, and optimized on the training dataset using five-fold cross-validation. The final performance of our models was assessed using a validation or independent dataset that was not used during hyperparameter optimization. To facilitate scientific community working in the field of subunit vaccine, we develop a standalone software and web server CBTOPE2 (https://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/cbtope2/).",

    "abstract": "The pretraining-finetuning paradigm has powered major advances in domains such as natural language processing and computer vision, with representative examples including masked language modeling and next-token prediction. In molecular representation learning, however, pretraining tasks remain largely restricted to node-level denoising, which effectively captures local atomic environments but is often insufficient for encoding the global molecular structure critical to graph-level property prediction tasks such as energy estimation and molecular regression. To address this gap, we introduce GeoRecon, a graph-level pretraining framework that shifts the focus from individual atoms to the molecule as an integrated whole. GeoRecon formulates a graph-level reconstruction task: during pretraining, the model is trained to produce an informative graph representation that guides geometry reconstruction while inducing smoother and more transferable latent spaces. This encourages the learning of coherent, global structural features beyond isolated atomic details. Without relying on external supervision, GeoRecon generally improves over backbone baselines on multiple molecular benchmarks including QM9, MD17, MD22, and 3BPA, demonstrating the effectiveness of graph-level reconstruction for holistic and geometry-aware molecular embeddings.",

    "abstract": "Peptide-drug conjugates (PDCs) represent a promising therapeutic avenue for human diseases, particularly in cancer treatment. Systematic elucidation of structure-activity relationships (SARs) and accurate prediction of the activity of PDCs are critical for the rational design and optimization of these conjugates. To this end, we carefully design and construct a benchmark PDCs dataset compiled from literature-derived collections and PDCdb database, and then develop PDCNet, the first unified deep learning framework for forecasting the activity of PDCs. The architecture systematically captures the complex factors underlying anticancer decisions of PDCs in real-word scenarios through a multi-level feature fusion framework that collaboratively characterizes and learns the features of peptides, linkers, and payloads. Leveraging a curated PDCs benchmark dataset, comprehensive evaluation results show that PDCNet demonstrates superior predictive capability, with the highest AUC, F1, MCC and BA scores of 0.9213, 0.7656, 0.7071 and 0.8388 for the test set, outperforming eight established traditional machine learning models. Multi-level validations, including 5-fold cross-validation, threshold testing, ablation studies, model interpretability analysis and external independent testing, further confirm the superiority, robustness, and usability of the PDCNet architecture. We anticipate that PDCNet represents a novel paradigm, incorporating both a benchmark dataset and advanced models, which can accelerate the design and discovery of new PDC-based therapeutic agents.",

    "abstract": "Molecular chaperones are machines that consume copious amount of ATP to drive misfolded proteins or RNA to fold into functionally competent native states. Because the folding landscapes of biomolecules with complex native state topology are rugged consisting of multiple minima that are separated by large free energy barriers, folding occurs by the kinetic partitioning mechanism according to which only a small fraction of the molecules reach the folded state in biologically viable times. The rescue of such proteins and RNA require chaperones. Although the protein and RNA chaperones are profoundly different in their structure and action, the principles underlying their activity to produce the folded structures can be understood using a unified theoretical framework based on iterative annealing mechanism (IAM). Our theory shows that both these machines have evolved to the maximize the production of the steady state yield on biological times. Strikingly, theory predicts that only at a moderate level of RNA chaperone activity is the yield of the self-splicing pre-RNA is maximized in \\textit{in vivo}.",

We propose two algorithms, which are both validated by extensive numerical simulations showing that the ensuing lattice random walks have not only the same power-law covariance function as the standard fBm, but also individual trajectories follow those of the super-diffusive fBm. Finding a lattice and an integer time analogue of a sub-diffusion fBm, which is an anti-persistent process, remains a challenging open problem.

    "title": "Surface Induced Frustration of Inherent Dipolar Order in Nanoconfined Water",
    "abstract": "Surface effects could play a dominant role in modifying the natural liquid order. In some cases, the effects of the surface interactions can propagate inwards, and even can interfere with a similar propagation from opposite surfaces. This can be particularly evident in liquid water under nano-confinement. The large dipolar cross-correlations among distinct molecules that give rise to the unusually large dielectric constant of water (and in turn owe their origin to the extended hydrogen bond (HB) network) can get perturbed by surfaces. The perturbation can propagate inwards and then interfere with the one from the opposite surface if confinement is only a few layers wide. This can give rise to short-to-intermediate range solvent-mediated interaction between two surfaces. Here we study the effects of such interactions on the dielectric constant of nano-confined liquids, not just water but also ordering at protein surfaces. The surfaces work at two levels: (i) induce orientational realignment, and (ii) alter the cross-correlations between water molecules. Molecular dynamics simulations and statistical analyses are used to address these aspects in confinement of slit pores, nano tube/cylinder, and nano sphere. In addition, we consider the hydration layers of multiple proteins with vastly different structural features. These studies give us a measure of the extent or the length scale of cross-correlations between dipole moments of water molecules. We find an interesting orientational arrangement in the protein hydration layers, giving rise to long-range molecular cross-correlations. To decouple the effect of HB from the effect of geometry, we additionally study acetonitrile under nanoconfinement. Importantly, while a protein's interior is characterized by a small dielectric constant, the dipole moment of a peptide bond is large, and thus susceptible to fluctuations in water.",

    "abstract": "Intervertebral discs are avascular and maintain immune privilege. However, during intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD), this barrier is disrupted, leading to extensive immune cell infiltration and localized inflammation. In degenerated discs, macrophages, T lymphocytes, neutrophils, and granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (G-MDSCs) are key players, exhibiting functional heterogeneity. Dysregulated activation of inflammatory pathways, including nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappaB), interleukin-17 (IL-17), and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation, drives local pro-inflammatory responses, leading to cell apoptosis and extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation. Innovative immunotherapies, including exosome-based treatments, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing, and chemokine-loaded hydrogel systems, have shown promise in reshaping the immunological niche of intervertebral discs. These strategies can modulate dysregulated immune responses and create a supportive environment for tissue regeneration. However, current studies have not fully elucidated the mechanisms of inflammatory memory and the immunometabolic axis, and they face challenges in balancing tissue regeneration with immune homeostasis. Future studies should employ interdisciplinary approaches such as single-cell and spatial transcriptomics to map a comprehensive immune atlas of IDD, elucidate intercellular crosstalk and signaling networks, and develop integrated therapies combining targeted immunomodulation with regenerative engineering, thereby facilitating the clinical translation of effective IDD treatments.",

Traditional workflows have relied on a two-step process: first retrieving homologs via Multiple Sequence Alignments (MSA), then training models on one or more of these alignments. However, MSA-based retrieval is computationally expensive, struggles with highly divergent sequences or complex insertions & deletions patterns, and operates independently of the downstream modeling objective. We introduce Protriever, an end-to-end differentiable framework that learns to retrieve relevant homologs while simultaneously training for the target task. When applied to protein fitness prediction, Protriever achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to sequence-based models that rely on MSA-based homolog retrieval, while being two orders of magnitude faster through efficient vector search. Protriever is both architecture- and task-agnostic, and can flexibly adapt to different retrieval strategies and protein databases at inference time -- offering a scalable alternative to alignment-centric approaches.",

Within this replicator-mutator framework, we further incorporate a ''pseudo-Allee effect'' so that the long time behavior (extinction vs. survival) depends on the size of the initial data. After proving the well-posedness of the associated Cauchy problem, we investigate its long-time behavior. We first show that small initial data lead to extinction. More surprisingly, we then prove that that extinction may also occur for too large initial data, in particular when selection is not strong enough. Finally, we exhibit situations where intermediate initial data lead to persistence, thereby revealing the existence of (at least) two thresholds. These results stand in sharp contrast with the behavior observed in local bistable equations.",

Here adaptation is defined as improved reproductive success, namely the ability of one of the many locally stable states available to the system to expand in space at the expense of other states. We find that adaptation can arise simply by environmental exposure to sequences of varying influxes. This adaptation is specific to the temporal sequence yet flexible enough to generalize to related sequences. It is enhanced through repeated exposure to the same environmental sequence, representing a form of learning, and through spatial interactions, enabling natural selection to act and representing a form of collective learning. Finally, adaptation benefits from a nearby adapted state, representing a form of teacher-guided learning. By combining environmental drives and reproduction within a stochastic reaction-diffusion dynamics framework, our model lays a foundation for a theory of adaptation grounded in physical principles.",

    "abstract": "Large animal groups -- bird flocks, fish schools, insect swarms -- are often assumed to form by gradual aggregation of sparsely distributed individuals. Using a mathematically precise framework based on time-varying directed interaction networks, we show that this widely held view is incomplete.   The theory demonstrates that large moving groups do not arise by slow accumulation; instead, they emerge through the rapid merging of multiple pre-existing subgroups that are simultaneously activated under high-density conditions. The key mechanism is topological: the long-term interaction structure of any moving group contains a single dominant strongly connected component (SCC). This dominant SCC determines the collective velocity -- both speed and direction -- of the entire group.   When two subgroups encounter one another, the trailing subgroup aligns with -- and ultimately inherits -- the velocity of the dominant SCC of the leading subgroup. Repeated merging events naturally generate large groups whose speed is predicted to be lower than the mean speed of the original subgroups. The same dynamics explain several universal empirical features: broad neighbour-distance distributions, directional asymmetry in neighbour selection, and the characteristic narrow-front, wide-rear geometry of real flocks.   The framework yields testable predictions for STARFLAG-style 3D datasets, offering a unified explanation for the formation, maintenance, and geometry of coordinated animal groups.",

We integrate this metric into Negative Binomial models, fixed-effects regressions, SAR/SAC spatial models, and a hierarchical INLA/BYM2 specification. Across all frameworks, curvature is the strongest and most stable predictor of dengue risk. In the BYM2 model, the structured spatial component collapses ($φ\\approx 0$), indicating that functional network connectivity explains nearly all spatial dependence typically attributed to adjacency-based CAR terms. The results show that dengue spread in Recife is driven less by geographic contiguity and more by network-mediated structural flows.",

    "abstract": "Mutualisms are key for structuring ecological communities, but they are sensitive to environmental change and fluctuations in population size. Consequently, how mutualisms achieve stability remains an open question in ecological theory. Motivated by previous results in competitive and predator-prey interactions, we hypothesize that self-organized pattern formation can act as a key stabilizing mechanism of mutualistic interactions. We test this hypothesis using a two-species reaction-diffusion model of a plant-pollinator system that incorporates non-local plant competition and local mutualistic interactions. We first perform a linear stability analysis to determine the conditions under which non-local competition can trigger vegetation pattern formation. We then compute the bifurcation diagrams for both spatial and homogeneous solutions and find that pattern formation enables coexistence at mutualistic strengths below the threshold required in well-mixed populations. This stability gain increases as environmental conditions worsen, because local maxima in vegetation density create the conditions for community persistence despite globally harsh conditions. Moreover, in the strong mutualism limit, the spatial system exhibits multistability between patterned and homogeneous solutions, creating alternative stable configurations that can buffer against fluctuations in population abundance. Spatial self-organization thus stabilizes mutualistic communities through spatial patterns, potentially driving plant-pollinator persistence in stressed environments, including arid ecosystems.",

We adopt a systematic approach which is the so-called $Ω$-expansion. When the stochastic factor is integrated, it is shown that the population size for each strategy fluctuates around the interior equilibrium of the macroscopic equations (corresponding to the deterministic model of the eco-evolutionary game) and its variance converges to a constant that is proportional to the environmental carrying capacity if the interior equilibrium is asymptotically stable. The simulation results demonstrate that the $Ω$ expansion provides a valid approximation, and the reliability of the aforementioned conclusions is verified. Therefore, analogous to Fudenberg and Harris' s stochastic replicator dynamics for infinite populations under external noise (\\emph{J. Econ. Theory 57, 420-441}), the dynamic stability of the eco-evolutionary game can be extended to the stochastic regime when the environmental carrying capacity is sufficiently large.",

    "abstract": "Phylogenetic trees and networks are graphs used to model evolutionary relationships, with trees representing strictly branching histories and networks allowing for events in which lineages merge, called reticulation events. While the question of data sufficiency has been studied extensively in the context of trees, it remains largely unexplored for networks. In this work we take a first step in this direction by establishing bounds on the amount of genomic data required to reconstruct binary level-$1$ semi-directed phylogenetic networks, which are binary networks in which reticulation events are indicated by directed edges, all other edges are undirected, and cycles are vertex-disjoint. For this class, methods have been developed recently that are statistically consistent. Roughly speaking, such methods are guaranteed to reconstruct the correct network assuming infinitely long genomic sequences. Here we consider the question whether networks from this class can be uniquely and correctly reconstructed from finite sequences. Specifically, we present an inference algorithm that takes as input genetic sequence data, and demonstrate that the sequence length sufficient to reconstruct the correct network with high probability, under the Cavender-Farris-Neyman model of evolution, scales logarithmically, polynomially, or polylogarithmically with the number of taxa, depending on the parameter regime. As part of our contribution, we also present novel inference rules for quartet data in the semi-directed phylogenetic network setting.",

Here, we systematically assess the impact of various fixed-topology strategies on phylogenetic and phylodynamic parameter estimates across a diverse set of viral datasets. We compare fully Bayesian joint inference with fixed-topology strategies, including conditioning on maximum likelihood trees subsequently dated with LSD or TreeTime. Our analyses show that global parameters of the substitution and site models are largely robust to the fixed-topology assumption, whereas parameters that depend on the temporal structure of the tree, such as molecular clock rates, node ages, and demographic histories, can exhibit substantial biases. We do treat unconstrained Bayesian analyses as the reference, although we recognize that these too are model-based approximations. Nevertheless, our results highlight serious discordance associated with fixing the topology and underscore the need for faster, time-aware methods that simultaneously integrate topology and parameter estimation. These findings raise important questions about the balance between computational efficiency and inferential accuracy in phylodynamic studies.",

    "abstract": "Mechanistic models are essential tools across ecology, epidemiology, and the life sciences, but parameter inference remains challenging when likelihood functions are intractable. Approximate Bayesian Computation with Sequential Monte Carlo (ABC-SMC) offers a powerful likelihood-free alternative that requires only the ability to simulate data from mechanistic models. Despite its potential, many researchers remain hesitant to adopt these methods due to perceived complexity. This tutorial bridges that gap by providing a practical, example-driven introduction to ABC-SMC using Python. From predator-prey dynamics to hierarchical epidemic models, we illustrate by example how to implement, diagnose, and interpret ABC-SMC analyses. Each example builds intuition about when and why ABC-SMC works, how partial observability affects parameter identifiability, and how hierarchical structures naturally emerge in Bayesian frameworks. All code leverages PyMC's modern probabilistic programming interface, ensuring reproducibility and easy adaptation to new problems.

    "abstract": "We considered a model for an infectious disease outbreak, when the depletion of susceptible individuals is negligible, and assumed that individuals adapt their behavior according to the information they receive about new cases. In line with the information index approach, we supposed that individuals react to past information according to a memory kernel that is continuously distributed in the past. We analyzed equilibria and their stability, with analytical results for selected cases. Thanks to the recently developed pseudospectral approximation of delay equations, we studied numerically the long-term dynamics of the model for memory kernels defined by gamma distributions with a general non-integer shape parameter, extending the analysis beyond what is allowed by the linear chain trick. In agreement with previous studies, we showed that behavior adaptation alone can cause sustained waves of infections even in an outbreak scenario, and notably in the absence of other processes like demographic turnover, seasonality, or waning immunity. Our analysis gives a more general insight into how the period and peak of epidemic waves depend on the shape of the memory kernel and how the level of minimal contact impacts the stability of the behavior-induced positive equilibrium.",

    "abstract": "Clemmesen's hook refers to a commonly observed slowdown and rebound in breast cancer incidence around the age at menopause. It suggests a shift in the underlying carcinogenic dynamics, but the mechanistic basis remains poorly understood. Building on our previously developed Extended Multistage Clonal Expansion Tumor (MSCE-T) model, we perform a theoretical analysis to determine the conditions under which Clemmesen's hook would occur. Our results show that Clemmesen's hook can be quantitatively explained by time-specific changes in the proliferative and apoptotic balance of early-stage mutated cell populations, corresponding to the decline in progesterone levels and progesterone-driven proliferation due to reduced menstrual cycles preceding menopause, and changing dominant carcinogenic impact from alternative growth pathways post-menopause (e.g., adipose-derived growth signals). In contrast, variation in last-stage clonal dynamics cannot effectively reproduce the observed non-monotonic incidence pattern. Analytical results further demonstrate that midlife incidence dynamics corresponding to the hook are governed primarily by intrinsic proliferative processes rather than detection effects. Overall, this study provides a mechanistic and mathematical explanation for Clemmesen's hook and establishes a quantitative framework linking hormonal transitions during menopause to age-specific breast cancer incidence curve.",

    "title": "Expectation-enforcing strategies for repeated games",
    "abstract": "Originating in evolutionary game theory, the class of \"zero-determinant\" strategies enables a player to unilaterally enforce linear payoff relationships in simple repeated games. An upshot of this kind of payoff constraint is that it can shape the incentives for the opponent in a predetermined way. An example is when a player ensures that the agents get equal payoffs. While extensively studied in infinite-horizon games, extensions to discounted games, nonlinear payoff relationships, richer strategic environments, and behaviors with long memory remain incompletely understood. In this paper, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for a player to enforce arbitrary payoff relationships (linear or nonlinear), in expectation, in discounted games. These conditions characterize precisely which payoff relationships are enforceable using strategies of arbitrary complexity. Our main result establishes that any such enforceable relationship can actually be implemented using a simple two-point reactive learning strategy, which conditions on the opponent's most recent action and the player's own previous mixed action, using information from only one round into the past. For additive payoff constraints, we show that enforcement is possible using even simpler (reactive) strategies that depend solely on the opponent's last move. In other words, this tractable class is universal within expectation-enforcing strategies. As examples, we apply these results to characterize extortionate, generous, equalizer, and fair strategies in the iterated prisoner's dilemma, asymmetric donation game, nonlinear donation game, and the hawk-dove game, identifying precisely when each class of strategy is enforceable and with what minimum discount factor.",

    "abstract": "We look at the interaction of dispersal and environmental stochasticity in $n$-patch models. We are able to prove persistence and extinction results even in the setting when the dispersal rates are stochastic. As applications we look at Beverton-Holt and Hassell functional responses. We find explicit approximations for the total population size at stationarity when we look at slow and fast dispersal. In particular, we show that if dispersal is small then in the Beverton-Holt setting, if the carrying capacity is random, then environmental fluctuations are always detrimental and decrease the total population size. Instead, in the Hassell setting, if the inverse of the carrying capacity is made random, then environmental fluctuations always increase the population size. Fast dispersal can save populations from extinction and therefore increase the total population size. We also analyze a different type of environmental fluctuation which comes from switching environmental states according to a Markov chain and find explicit approximations when the switching is either fast or slow - in examples we are able to show that slow switching leads to a higher population size than fast switching.   Using and modifying some approximation results due to Cuello, we find expressions for the total population size in the $n=2$ patch setting when the growth rates, carrying capacities, and dispersal rates are influenced by random fluctuations. We find that there is a complicated interaction between the various terms and that the covariances between the various random parameters (growth rate, carrying capacity, dispersal rate) play a key role in whether we get an increase or a decrease in the total population size. Environmental fluctuations turn to sometimes be beneficial -- this show that not only dispersal, but also environmental stochasticity can lead to an increase in population size.",

    "abstract": "Collective vigilance describes how animals in groups benefit from the predator detection efforts of others. Empirical observations typically find either a many-eyes strategy with all (or many) group members maintaining a low level of individual vigilance, or a sentinel strategy with one (or a few) individuals maintaining a high level of individual vigilance while others do not. With a general analytical treatment that makes minimal assumptions, we show that these two strategies are alternate solutions to the same adaptive problem of balancing the costs of predation and vigilance. Which strategy is preferred depends on how costs scale with the level of individual vigilance: many-eyes strategies are preferred where costs of vigilance rise gently at low levels but become steeper at higher levels (convex; e.g. an open field); sentinel strategies are preferred where costs of vigilance rise steeply at low levels and then flatten out (concave; e.g. environments with vantage points). This same dichotomy emerges whether individuals act selfishly to optimise their own fitness or cooperatively to optimise group fitness. The model is extended to explain discrete behavioural switching between strategies and differential levels of vigilance such as edge effects.",

    "abstract": "Population heterogeneity is a key factor in epidemic dynamics, influencing both transmission and final epidemic size. While heterogeneity is often modeled through age structure, spatial location, or contact patterns, differences in host susceptibility have recently gained attention, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Building on the framework of Diekmann and Inaba (Journal of Mathematical Biology, 2023), we focus on the special case of SEIR-models, which are widely used for influenza and other respiratory infections. We derive the model equations under two distinct assumptions linking susceptibility and infectiousness. Analytical results show that heterogeneity in susceptibility reduces the epidemic final size compared to homogeneous models with the same basic reproduction number $\\Ro$. In the case of gamma-distributed susceptibility, we obtain stronger results on the epidemic final size. The resulting model captures population heterogeneity through a single parameter, which makes it practical for fitting epidemic data. We illustrate its use by applying it to seasonal influenza in Italy.",

    "abstract": "We present ContagionRL, a Gymnasium-compatible reinforcement learning platform specifically designed for systematic reward engineering in spatial epidemic simulations. Unlike traditional agent-based models that rely on fixed behavioral rules, our platform enables rigorous evaluation of how reward function design affects learned survival strategies across diverse epidemic scenarios. ContagionRL integrates a spatial SIRS+D epidemiological model with configurable environmental parameters, allowing researchers to stress-test reward functions under varying conditions including limited observability, different movement patterns, and heterogeneous population dynamics. We evaluate five distinct reward designs, ranging from sparse survival bonuses to a novel potential field approach, across multiple RL algorithms (PPO, SAC, A2C). Through systematic ablation studies, we identify that directional guidance and explicit adherence incentives are critical components for robust policy learning. Our comprehensive evaluation across varying infection rates, grid sizes, visibility constraints, and movement patterns reveals that reward function choice dramatically impacts agent behavior and survival outcomes. Agents trained with our potential field reward consistently achieve superior performance, learning maximal adherence to non-pharmaceutical interventions while developing sophisticated spatial avoidance strategies. The platform's modular design enables systematic exploration of reward-behavior relationships, addressing a knowledge gap in models of this type where reward engineering has received limited attention. ContagionRL is an effective platform for studying adaptive behavioral responses in epidemic contexts and highlight the importance of reward design, information structure, and environmental predictability in learning.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how cooperation emerges and persists is a central challenge in evolutionary game theory. Existing models often rely on restricted, hand-picked strategy sets, which can overlook critical behavioural pathways. A recent four-strategy framework showed that cheap talk can promote cooperation through local interactions, yet it remained unclear whether modelled strategies might alter these conclusions. Here, we extend this framework to the complete set of eight strategies that naturally arise from communication and decision-making rules. We show that incorporating the full strategy space dramatically changes the evolutionary landscape. Cooperation becomes both more robust and more versatile, driven by novel pathways absent in the restricted model. In particular, we uncover a previously overlooked mechanism in which suspicious cooperation catalyses a cyclic dynamic that sustains cooperation. Conversely, the assumed role of strategic defection in the biased model is fragile, acting mainly as a spoiler rather than a genuine evolutionary attractor. The complete model further reveals a rich spectrum of long-term behaviours, including stable coexistence among up to seven strategies and time-varying patterns of partial coexistence. These results demonstrate that the full strategy space unlocks hidden routes to cooperative behaviour and highlight the importance of comprehensive modelling when explaining the emergence of cooperation.",

Assuming that mosquitoes can also feed on other non-competent hosts (i.e. hosts that cannot infect others), we first review some results from the literature by showing that protective behaviour may either decrease or increase the value of the reproduction number of the epidemic depending on multiple elements. Then, assuming that changes in opinion occur much faster than the spread of the disease, we exploit an approach based on the Geometric Singular Perturbation Theory to reduce the two-group model to a model for a homogeneous host population. Then, we use the resulting model to investigate the effect of information-induced behavioural changes on the transient dynamics of the epidemic, discussing the case when protective measures induced an outbreak with a low attack rate. We illustrate how behavioural changes might either help in containing an epidemic outbreak or make the epidemic last longer, even triggering recurrent damped epidemic waves. We conclude with numerical simulations to illustrate our analytical results.",

We study labeled histories for at-most-$r$-furcating trees.

For labeled topologies with $n$ leaves, we enumerate the total number of labeled histories with at-most-$r$-furcation. We enumerate the labeled histories possessed by a specific at-most-$r$-furcating labeled topology. We then demonstrate that the maximally probable at-most-$r$-furcating unlabeled topology on $n \\geq 2$ leaves -- the unlabeled topology whose labelings have the largest number of labeled histories -- is the maximally probable strictly bifurcating unlabeled topology on $n$ leaves. Finally, we enumerate labeled histories for at-most-$r$-furcating labeled topologies in a setting that permits simultaneous branchings. We similarly reduce the problem of identifying the maximally probable at-most-$r$-furcating unlabeled topology on $n \\geq 2$ leaves, allowing simultaneity, to that of identifying the maximally probable strictly bifurcating unlabeled topology on $n$ leaves, with simultaneity; we conjecture the shape of this bifurcating unlabeled topology.

Estimation of the transmission rates are derived both from epidemiological data and from environmental data such as temperature and humidity. The time-varying effective reproduction numbers are then estimated on these data, following the theoretical investigations performed in the first part. The sensitive parameters that significantly affect the model dynamics are presented graphically. Model predictions for following year by using different transmission rates are finally presented.

The proposed approach comprises a system of integro-differential equations for the statistical distributions, over a large patient cohort, of the densities of muscle fibers and immune cells implicated in muscle inflammation, degeneration, and regeneration, which underpin disease development. Considering an appropriately scaled version of this model, we formally derive, as the corresponding mean-field limit, a system of Fokker-Planck equations, from which we subsequently derive, as a macroscopic model counterpart, a system of differential equations for the mean densities of muscle and immune cells in the cohort of patients and the related variances. Then, we study long-time asymptotics for the mean-field model by determining the quasi-equilibrium cell distribution functions, which are in the form of probability density functions of inverse Gamma distributions, and proving the long-time convergence to such quasi-equilibrium distributions. The analytical results obtained are illustrated by means of a sample of results of numerical simulations. The modeling approach presented here has the potential to offer new insights into the balance between degeneration and regeneration mechanisms in the progression of muscular dystrophies, and provides a basis for future extensions, including the modeling of therapeutic interventions.",

    "title": "The role of antibody-mediated immunity in shaping the seasonality of respiratory viruses",
    "abstract": "In temperate regions, respiratory virus epidemics recur on a yearly basis, primarily during the winter season. This is believed to be induced by seasonal forcing, where the rate at which the virus can be transmitted varies cyclically across the course of each year. Seasonal epidemics can place substantial burden upon the healthcare system, with large numbers of infections and hospitalisations occurring across a short time period. However, the interactions between seasonal forcing and the factors necessary for epidemic resurgence - such as waning immunity, antigenic variation or demography - remain poorly understood. In this manuscript, we examine how the dynamics of antibody waning and antigenic variation can shape the seasonal recurrence of epidemics. We develop a susceptible-infectious-susceptible (SIS) immuno-epidemiological model of respiratory virus spread, where the susceptible population is stratified by their antibody level against the currently circulating strain of the virus, with this decaying as both antibody waning and antigenic drift occur. In the absence of seasonal forcing, we demonstrate the existence of two Hopf bifurcations over the effective antibody decay rate, with associated periodic model solutions. When seasonal forcing is introduced, we identify complex interactions between the strength of forcing and the effective antibody decay rate, yielding myriad dynamics including multi-year periodicity, quasiperiodicity and chaos. The timing and magnitude of seasonal epidemics is highly sensitive to this interaction, with the distribution of infection timing (by time of year) varying substantially across the parameter space. Finally, we show that seasonal forcing can produce resonant amplification (or damping) resulting in a cumulative infection burdens that is greater (or lesser) than would otherwise be observed.",

    "title": "An Ecologically-Informed Deep Learning Framework for Interpretable and Validatable Habitat Mapping",
    "abstract": "Benthic habitat is challenging due to the environmental complexity of the seafloor, technological limitations, and elevated operational costs, especially in under-explored regions. This generates knowledge gaps for the sustainable management of hydrobiological resources and their nexus with society. We developed ECOSAIC (Ecological Compression via Orthogonal Specialized Autoencoders for Interpretable Classification), an Artificial Intelligence framework for automatic classification of benthic habitats through interpretable latent representations using a customizable autoencoder. ECOSAIC compresses n-dimensional feature space by optimizing specialization and orthogonality between domain-informed features. We employed two domain-informed categories: biogeochemical and hydrogeomorphological, that together integrate biological, physicochemical, hydrological and geomorphological, features, whose constraints on habitats have been recognized in ecology for a century. We applied the model to the Colombian Pacific Ocean and the results revealed 16 benthic habitats, expanding from mangroves to deep rocky areas up to 1000 m depth. The candidate habitats exhibited a strong correspondence between their environmental constraints, represented in latent space, and their expected species composition. This correspondence reflected meaningful ecological associations rather than purely statistical correlations, where the habitat's environmental offerings align semantically with the species' requirements. This approach could improve the management and conservation of benthic habitats, facilitating the development of functional maps that support marine planning, biodiversity conservation and fish stock assessment. We also hope it provides new insights into how ecological principles can inform AI frameworks, particularly given the substantial data limitations that characterize ecological research.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we study the finite-population behaviour of the Reed-Frost epidemic model. Our analysis relies on the exact expression for the final epidemic size, replaced by Monte Carlo simulations in cases where the exact formula becomes numerically unstable. When the initial reproduction number is greater than a critical threshold, the distribution of the final size becomes bimodal. We therefore define the probabilities of small and large outbreaks, providing an intuitive answer to the question posed in the title through simple arguments based on the geometric distribution. Finally, an agent-based simulation confirms that the Reed-Frost model offers a good approximation in the case of the COVID-19 outbreak.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we integrate theoretical modeling, molecular simulation, and empirical analysis to identify and characterize evolutionary hysteresis. We first show how epistatic interactions create bistable fitness landscapes and structural hysteresis in a two-locus Wright-Fisher model, revealing two distinct hysteresis regimes under cyclic and noisy selection. Notably, an epistatically constrained population achieves maximal average fitness at an intermediate level of environmental stochasticity. We then extend this framework to more complex systems, demonstrating robust hysteresis loops in both a disordered multi-locus model and in biophysically realistic simulation of protein structural flexibility. Finally, we present direct empirical evidence of evolutionary hysteresis. By analyzing two decades of metagenomic time-series data from freshwater C. Nanopelagicaceae experiencing strong seasonal temperature cycles, we find that approximately 65% of seasonally oscillating alleles exhibit statistically significant hysteresis. Together, these results establish hysteresis as a general, measurable feature of evolution and a potential probe of complex fitness landscapes.",

    "abstract": "Ecological processes depend on the flow and balance of essential elements such as carbon (C) and phosphorus (P), and changes in these elements can cause adverse effects to ecosystems. The theory of Ecological Stoichiometry offers a conceptual framework to investigate the impact of elemental imbalances on structured populations while simultaneously considering how ecological structures regulate nutrient cycling and ecosystem processes. While there have been significant advances in the development of stoichiometric food web models, these efforts often consider a homogeneous population and neglect stage-structure. The development of stage-structured population models has significantly contributed to understanding energy flow and population dynamics of ecological systems. However, stage structure models fail to consider food quality in addition to food quantity. We develop a stoichiometric stage-structure producer-grazer model that considers co-limitation of nutrients, and parameterize the model for an algae-Daphnia food chain. Our findings emphasize the impact of stoichiometric constraints on structured population dynamics. By incorporating both food quantity and quality into maturation rates, we demonstrate how stage-structured dynamics can influence outcomes in variable environments. Stage-specific parameters, such as juvenile growth and ingestion rates can drive shifts in equilibria, limit cycles, and bifurcation points. These effects are especially significant in high-light environments where nutrient limitations are most pronounced.",

Framing the campaign as a measurement, we learn about its properties, including the campaign's coverage of the target population and some implied sampling properties of post-campaign coverage surveys (PCCSs), the current gold-standard in implementation quality measurement.   We develop this idea in the context of the 2023 measles campaign in Kano State, Nigeria, where we have detailed implementation data collected by vaccination teams involved in that effort. Looking specifically at the teams' tally sheets, the daily records of who they vaccinated, we find significant discrepancies between the recapture estimates and those from the corresponding PCCS. Exploring a variety of bias models applied to both the tally sheets and the PCCS helps clarify how anecdotal issues from the field relate to this discrepancy.   Overall, we find that the tally sheets, despite being an unorthodox population sample, provide a tractable perspective on implementation and measurement, one that's in principle available nearly instantly and at high resolution for any vaccination touchpoint.",

    "title": "AMR-MoEGA: Antimicrobial Resistance Prediction using Mixture of Experts and Genetic Algorithms",
    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a mounting global health crisis, requiring rapid and reliable prediction frameworks that capture its complex evolutionary dynamics. Traditional antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST), while accurate, remains laborious and time-consuming, limiting its clinical scalability. Existing computational approaches, primarily reliant on single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based analysis, fail to account for evolutionary drivers such as horizontal gene transfer (HGT) and genome-level interactions.   This study introduces a novel Evolutionary Mixture of Experts (Evo-MoE) framework that integrates genomic sequence analysis, machine learning, and evolutionary algorithms to model and predict AMR evolution. A Mixture of Experts model, trained on labeled genomic data for multiple antibiotics, serves as the predictive core, estimating the likelihood of resistance for each genome. This model is embedded as a fitness function within a Genetic Algorithm designed to simulate AMR development across generations. Each genome, encoded as an individual in the population, undergoes mutation, crossover, and selection guided by predicted resistance probabilities.   The resulting evolutionary trajectories reveal dynamic pathways of resistance acquisition, offering mechanistic insights into genomic evolution under selective antibiotic pressure. Sensitivity analysis of mutation rates and selection pressures demonstrates the model's robustness and biological plausibility. Validation against curated AMR databases and literature evidence further substantiates the framework's predictive fidelity.   This integrative approach bridges genomic prediction and evolutionary simulation, offering a powerful tool for understanding and anticipating AMR dynamics, and potentially guiding rational antibiotic design and policy interventions.",

    "abstract": "A correlation between karyotype diversity and species richness was first observed in mammals in 1980, and subsequently confirmed after controlling for phylogenetic signal. The correlation was attributed to submicroscopic factors, presumably operating at the level of the genome. At the same time, an unexpected association between mutation rates and substitution rates has been observed in all eukaryotes so far examined. One hypothesis to explain the latter observation proposed that neutral mutation (dS) and non-neutral (dN) substitution rates in gene codons co-vary according to genomic position, or location in the genome. Later, it was found that mutation and substitution rates in eukaryotes increase with DNA replication timing during the Synthetic phase, or S phase, of the cell cycle. In 1991, Motoo Kimura proposed a molecular theory of non-adaptive radiation (NAR). Accordingly, genetic drift plays a significant role in speciation, albeit in parallel to and in conjunction with natural selection. The following will examine the contribution of DNA replication timing and DNA repair factors to the relationship between species richness and karyotype diversity, and by extension, to the large variation in species richness across the mammalian Tree of Life.",

This construction is an instance of a random intersection graph, and has been used in the literature to study association networks in a number of animal species. We characterize the mathematical structure of these networks, which we view as one-mode projections of suitable bipartite graphs or, equivalently, as 2-sections of the corresponding hypergraphs. We determine analytically the probability distribution of the random bipartite graphs and hypergraphs associated to this construction, and suggest that association networks generated by the use of common resources are better described by hypergraphs rather than simple projected graphs, that miss important information regarding the actual associations among the agents.",

Recently increased volumes and access to ecological data present an expanding set of opportunities for theoreticians to inform model development, framing, and interpretation. Whereas statisticians have collective guidance on best practices for data use, theoreticians might lack formal education on how to integrate diverse types of data into a single ecological model. As a group of predominantly early-career theoretical ecologists, we have developed guiding principles and practical tips to support theoretical ecologists in synthesizing multiple types of data at different phases of the modeling process. Our rules fall into three overarching themes: iteration in the data-model integration process, leveraging multiple sources of data), and understanding uncertainty. Across these rules, we emphasize that the data-model integration requires transparent, justifiable, and defensible communication of modeling choices to support readers in appropriately contextualizing the model and its implications.",

In the literature, this problem is tackled mostly by computing directly the random variable t, time to reach the MRCA. I show here that by shifting the focus from the random variable t to the joined variable (n,t), where n is the number of ancestors at time t, the problem is greatly simplified. Indeed, P(n,t), the probability of this variable, obeys a simpler master equation that can be solved in a straightforward way for the most general model. This probability can then be used to compute relevant information of the n-coalescent, for both random variables $t_{n}$ (random time to reach a given state n) and $n_{t}$ (random number of ancestors at a given time t). The cumulative distribution function for $t_{1}$ for example is $P(1,t)$. I give in this article the general solution for continuous time models such as Moran and discrete time ones such as WF.",

    "abstract": "We study an infection-age structured epidemic model in which both the infectivity and the rate of loss of immunity depend on the time-since-infection. The model can be equivalently viewed as a nonlinear renewal equation for the incidence of infection or as a partial differential equation for the density of infected individuals. We explicitly consider gamma, rather than Erlang, distributed durations of infection using a combination of ODE approximations and numerical bifurcation methods. We show that the shape of this distribution strongly influences stability of the endemic equilibrium, even when the basic reproduction number $R_0$ and the mean duration of infectiousness are fixed. Moreover, we establish the existence of regions of bistability, where a stable endemic equilibrium coexists with a stable periodic orbit. To our knowledge, this provides the first example of bistability in infection-age structured models with waning immunity alone. Finally, we show how common compartmental modelling approaches, which impose implicit assumptions on the distribution of the duration of infection, can lead to spurious dynamical outcomes. Taken together, our analysis underscores the crucial role of distributional structure in epidemic modelling and provides new insights into the rich dynamics of infection-age structured SIS/SIRS models.",

    "abstract": "Species-rich ecosystems often exhibit multiple stable states with distinct species compositions. Yet, the factors determining the likelihood of each state's occurrence remain poorly understood. Here, we characterize and explain the landscape of stable states in the random Generalized Lotka-Volterra (GLV) model, in which multistability is widespread. We find that the same pool of species with random initial abundances can result in different stable states, whose likelihoods typically differ by orders of magnitude. A state's likelihood increases sharply with its total biomass, or inverse self-inhibition. We develop a simplified model to predict and explain this behavior, by coarse-graining ecological interactions so that each stable state behaves as a unit. In this setting, we can accurately predict the entire landscape of stable states using only two macroscopic properties: the biomass of each state and species diversity. Our theory also provides insight into the biomass-likelihood relationship: High-biomass states have low self-inhibition and thus grow faster, outcompete others, and become much more likely. These results reveal emergent self-inhibition as a fundamental organizing principle for the attractor landscape of complex ecosystems - and provide a path to predict ecosystem outcomes without knowing microscopic interactions.",

Both the consumer and resource are assumed to consist of several (sub)species, which interact between themselves in addition to incorporating the deleterious effects of the consumer on the resource. Separating the ecological and evolutionary time scales, we allow our mathematical model to evolve, with the evolutionary steps chosen according to the (divergent) objective functions of the consumer and the resource. Numerical simulations show that the model, along with the expected outcomes of either consumer or resource winning the evolutionary battle, is capable of producing also the (quasi)stationary state of consumer--resource coexistence with monotone growth of both the consumer and resource fitnesses. Such stable states highlight the importance of the intra-population interactions, which, despite the opposite evolutionary goals of the consumer and the resource, lead to long term ecological stability.",

    "abstract": "Growth is a multi-layered phenomenon in human societies, composed of socioeconomic and demographic change at many different scales. Yet, standard macroeconomic indicators average over most of these processes, blurring the spatial and hierarchical heterogeneity driving people's choices and experiences. To address this gap, we introduce here a framework based on the Price equation to decompose aggregate growth exactly into endogenous and selection effects across nested spatial scales. We illustrate this approach with population and income data from the Chicago metropolitan area (2014-2019) and show that both growth rates and spatial selection effects are most intense at local levels, fat-tailed and spatially correlated. We also find that selection, defined as the covariance between prevailing income and relative population change, is concentrated in few spatial units and exhibits scaling behavior when grouped by county. Despite the intensity of local sorting, selection effects largely cancel in the aggregate, implying that fast heterogeneous micro-dynamics can yield deceptively stable macro-trends. By treating local spatial units (neighborhoods) as evolving subpopulations under selection, we demonstrate how methods from complex systems provide new tools to classify residential selection processes, such as abandonment and gentrification, in an urban sociological framework. This approach is general and applies to any other nested economic systems such as networks of production, occupations, or innovation enabling a new mechanistic understanding of compositional change and growth across scales of organization.",

    "abstract": "Waning immunity and reinfection are critical features of many infectious diseases, but epidemiological models often fail to capture the intricate interaction between an individual's history of immunity and their current infection status; when they do, the approach is usually overly simplistic. We develop a novel dual-age structured model that simultaneously tracks immunity age (time since the last recovery from infection) and infection age (time since infection) to analyze epidemic dynamics under conditions of waning immunity and reinfection. The model is formulated as a system of age-structured partial differential equations that describe susceptible and infected populations stratified by both immunity and infection ages. We derive basic reproduction numbers associated with the model and numerically solve the system using a second-order Runge-Kutta scheme along the characteristic lines. We further extend the model to explore vaccination interventions, specifically targeting individuals according to their immunity age. Numerical results reveal that higher contact rates produce larger amplitude oscillations with longer interepidemic periods. The relationship between initial infection levels and long-term epidemic behavior is nonmonotonic. Vaccination efficiency depends critically on the viral load profile across immunity and infection age, with more pronounced viral load distributions requiring higher vaccination rates for disease elimination. Most efficient vaccination strategies begin with intermediate immunity ages rather than targeting only fully susceptible individuals. The structured dual-age framework provides a flexible approach to analyzing the dynamics of reinfection and evaluating targeted vaccination strategies based on the history of immunity.",

    "abstract": "RNA-based vaccination has been broadly applied in the COVID pandemic. A characteristic of the immunization was fast waning immunity. However, the time scale of this process varied considerable for virus subtypes and among individuals. Understanding the origin of this variability is crucial in order to improve future vaccination strategies. Here, we introduce a mathematical model of RNA-based vaccination and the kinetics of the induced immune response. In the model, antigens produced following vaccination rise an immune response leading to germinal center reactions and accordingly B-cell differentiation into memory B-cells and plasma cells. In a negative feedback loop, the antibodies synthesized by newly specified plasma cells shut down the germinal center reaction as well as antigen-induced differentiation of memory B-cell into plasma cells. This limits the build-up of long-lasting immunity and thus is accompanied by fast waning immunity. The detailed data available on infection with and vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 enabled computational simulation of essential processes of the immune response. By simulation, we analyzed to which extent a single or double dose vaccination provides protection against infection. We find that variability of the immune response in individuals, originating e.g. in different immune cell densities, results in a broad log-normal-like distribution of the vaccine-induced protection times that peaks around 100 days. Protection times decrease for virus variants with mutated antibody binding sites or increased replication rates. Independent of these virus specifics, our simulations suggest optimal timing of a second dose about 5 weeks after the first in agreement with clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "One of the greatest challenges of terrestrial locomotion is resisting gravity. The morphological adaptive features of the limb long-bones of extant elephants, the heaviest living terrestrial animals, have previously been highlighted; however, their bone microanatomy remains largely unexplored. Here we investigate the microanatomy of the six limb long-bones in Elephas maximus and Loxodonta africana, using comparisons of virtual slices as well as robustness analyses, to understand how they were adapted to heavy weight-bearing. We find that the long bones of elephant limbs display a relatively thick cortex and a medullary area almost entirely filled with trabecular bone. This trabecular bone is highly anisotropic with trabecular orientations reflecting the mechanical load distribution along the limb. The respective functional roles of the bones are reflected in their microanatomy through variations of cortical thickness distribution and main orientation of the trabeculae. We find microanatomical adaptations to heavy weight support that are common to other heavy mammals. Despite these shared characteristics, the long bones of elephants are closer to those of sauropods due to their shared columnar posture, which allows a relaxation of morphofunctional constraints, and thus relatively less robust bones with a thinner cortex than would be expected in such massive animals.",

    "abstract": "Basic and instantaneous reproduction numbers, \"R\" _\"0\" and \"R\" _\"t\" , are important metrics to assess progress of an epidemic and effectiveness of preventative interventions undertaken, and also to estimate coverage needed for vaccination. Reproduction numbers are related to the daily number of positive cases recorded by the national public health authorities, via the renewal equation. During periods of exponential growth or decay they are linked also to the rate constants by the Lotka-Euler equation. For either application, we need the distribution of generation times between primary and secondary infections. In practice, we use instead the directly observable serial interval between symptoms onset of infector and infectee. Pre-symptomatic transmission that occurs in COVID infection causes serial intervals to extend to negative values, which can be described with a Gaussian distribution. Consistent application of the two approaches requires careful attention to lower limits imposed on the distribution. Allowing Gaussian-distributed serial intervals to extend to minus infinity with the Lotka-Euler equation, as commonly is done, results in lower reproduction numbers than predicted from the discretized renewal equation. Here, we formulate the Lotka-Euler equation for Gaussian distributions including an explicit lower cut-off, and use this to explore the consequences of presymptomatic transmission for COVID-19 infections.",

    "abstract": "Evolution occurs in populations of reproducing individuals. In stochastic descriptions of evolutionary dynamics, such as the Moran process, individuals are chosen randomly for birth and for death. If the same type is chosen for both steps, then the reproductive event is wasted, because the composition of the population remains unchanged. Here we introduce a new phenotype, which we call a \\textit{replacer}. Replacers are efficient competitors. When a replacer is chosen for reproduction, the offspring will always replace an individual of another type (if available). We determine the selective advantage of replacers in well-mixed populations and on one-dimensional lattices. We find that being a replacer substantially boosts the fixation probability of neutral and deleterious mutants. In particular, fixation probability of a single neutral replacer who invades a well-mixed population of size $N$ is of the order of $1/\\sqrt N$ rather than the standard $1/N$. Even more importantly, replacers are much better protected against invasions once they have reached fixation. Therefore, replacers dominate the mutation selection equilibrium even if the phenotype of being a replacer comes at a substantial cost: curiously, for large population size and small mutation rate the relative fitness of a successful replacer can be as low as $1/e$.",

Understanding the precise conditions under which this is at all feasible and what triggers species extinctions is a key, outstanding problem in theoretical ecology. Using standard methods of random matrix theory, I show that distributions of species abundances are Gaussian at equilibrium, in the weakly interacting regime. One consequence is that feasibility is generically broken before stability, for large enough number of species. I further derive an analytic expression for the probability that $n=0,1,2,...$ species go extinct and conjecture that a single-parameter scaling law governs species extinctions.

Using a predator prey framework, we show that endemic conditions emerge naturally from the biological interplay between the vectors strategies to pathogen pressure and we prove global stability of such conditions. Our results reveal that under tropical and subtropical environmental pressures, the innate immune system of vectors cannot offset high vc during endemic outbreaks, highlighting a fundamental biological trade off, vectors can evolve increased transmission potential but cannot enhance immune capacity. This constraint defines the limits of their evolutionary response to pathogen driven selection and drives instability in disease transmission dynamics.",

In such fragmented environments, habitats can be modeled as networks, where individuals disperse across interconnected patches. We consider an intraspecific competition model, where individuals compete for space while dispersing according to a nonlinear random walk, capturing the heterogeneity of the network. The interplay between asymmetric competition, dispersal dynamics, and spatial heterogeneity leads to nonuniform species distribution: individuals with stronger competitive traits accumulate in central (hub) habitat patches, while those with weaker traits are displaced toward the periphery. We provide analytical insights into this mechanism, supported by numerical simulations, demonstrating how competition and spatial structure jointly influence species segregation. In the large-network limit, this effect becomes extreme, with dominant individuals disappearing from peripheral patches and subordinate ones from central regions, establishing spatial segregation. This pattern may create favorable conditions for speciation, as physical separation can reinforce divergence within the population over time.",

    "abstract": "Social contact patterns are a key input to many infectious disease models. Contact surveys, where participants are asked to provide information on their recent close and casual contacts with others, are one of the standard methods to measure contact patterns in a population. Surveys that require detailed sociodemographic descriptions of contacts allow for the specification of fine-grained contact rates between subpopulations in models. However, perception biases affecting a surveyed person's ability to estimate sociodemographic attributes (e.g., age, race, socioeconomic status) of others could affect contact rates derived from survey data. Here, we simulate contact surveys using a synthetic contact network of New Mexico to investigate the impact of these biases on survey accuracy and infectious disease model projections. We found that perception biases affecting the estimation of another individual's age and race substantially decreased the accuracy of the derived contact patterns. Using these biased patterns in a Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered compartmental model lead to an underestimation of cumulative incidence among older people (65+ years) and individuals identifying as races other than White. Our study shows that perception biases can impact contact patterns estimated from surveys in ways that systematically underestimate disease burden in minority populations when used in transmission models.",

    "abstract": "A canonical step in quantifying a system is to measure its entropy. Shannon entropy and other traditional entropy measures capture only the information encoded in the frequencies of a system's elements. Recently, Leinster, Cobbold, and Reeve (LCR) introduced a method that also captures the rich information encoded in the similarities and differences among elements, yielding similarity-sensitive entropy. More recently, the Vendi score (VS) was introduced as an alternative, raising the question of how LCR and VS compare, and which is preferable. Here we address these questions conceptually, analytically, and experimentally, using 53 machine-learning datasets. We show that LCR and VS can differ by orders of magnitude and can capture complementary information about a system, except in limiting cases. We demonstrate that both LCR and VS depend on how similarities are scaled and introduce the concept of ``half distance'' to parameterize this dependence. We prove that VS provides an upper bound on LCR for several values of the Rényi-Hill order parameter and conjecture that this bound holds for all values. We conclude that VS is preferable only when interpreting elements as linear combinations of a more fundamental set of ``ur-elements'' or when the system or dataset possesses a quantum-mechanical character. In the broader circumstance where one seeks simply to capture the rich information encoded by similarity, LCR is favored; nevertheless, for certain half-distances the two methods can complement each other.",

    "abstract": "Estimating species and gene trees from sequence data is challenging. Gene tree estimation is often hampered by low phylogenetic signal in alignments, leading to inaccurate trees. Species tree estimation is complicated by incomplete lineage sorting (ILS), where gene histories differ from the species' history. Summary methods like MP-EST, ASTRAL2, and ASTRID infer species trees from gene trees but suffer when gene tree accuracy is low. To address this, the Statistical Binning (SB) and Weighted Statistical Binning (WSB) pipelines were developed to improve gene tree estimation. However, previous studies only tested these pipelines using multi-locus bootstrapping (MLBS), not the BestML approach.   This thesis proposes a novel pipeline, WSB+WQMC, which shares design features with the existing WSB+CAML pipeline but has other desirable properties and is statistically consistent under the GTR+MSC model. This study evaluated WSB+WQMC against WSB+CAML using BestML analysis on various simulated datasets. The results confirmed many trends seen in prior MLBS analyses. WSB+WQMC substantially improved gene tree and species tree accuracy (using ASTRAL2 and ASTRID) on most datasets with low, medium, and moderately high ILS levels. In a direct comparison, WSB+WQMC computed less accurate trees than WSB+CAML under certain low and medium ILS conditions. However, WSB+WQMC performed better or at least as accurately as WSB+CAML on all datasets with moderately high and high ILS. It also proved better for estimating gene trees on some medium and low ILS datasets. Thus, WSB+WQMC is a promising alternative to WSB+CAML for phylogenetic estimation, especially in the presence of low phylogenetic signal.",

    "title": "Impact of Resistance Development Mechanisms on Antibiotic Treatment Outcomes",
    "abstract": "Bacteria develop resistance to antibiotics through various mechanisms, with the specific mechanism depending on the drug-bacteria pair. It remains unclear, however, which resistance mechanism best supports favorable treatment outcomes, specifically in clearing infections and inhibiting further resistance. In this study, we use periodic ordinary differential equation models to simulate different antibiotic treatment protocols for bacterial infections. Using stability analysis and numerical simulations, we investigate how different resistance mechanisms, including plasmid-induced and mutation-induced resistance, affect treatment outcomes. Our findings suggest that antibiotic treatments with fixed dosing schedules are more likely to be effective when resistance arises exclusively through plasmid-mediated transmission. Further, when treatment fails, mutation-driven mechanisms tend to favor the selection of fully resistant bacterial strains. We also investigated the efficacy of different treatment strategies based on these mechanisms, finding that a twice-daily regimen consistently outperforms a once-daily regimen in terms of infection clearance. Additionally, our simulations with short half-life antibiotics indicate that the \"catch-up\" strategy outperforms the \"compensatory double-dose\" approach after a missed dose, a finding that aligns with general pharmaceutical advice for short-half-life drugs.",

    "abstract": "Living systems can be understood as organized entities that capture, transform, and reproduce information. Classical gene-centered models explain adaptation through frequency changes driven by differential fitness, yet they often neglect the higher-order organization and causal closure that characterize living systems. Here we review evolutionary frameworks, from the replicator equation to group selection and holobiont dynamics, and show that evolutionary change in population frequencies can be expressed as a Jeffreys divergence. In holobionts, this formalism allows partitioning the total information associated with selection acting on the genome and the microbiome, as well as the information involved in matching specific genotypes with particular microbiotas, yielding an informational signature of stable symbiotic coevolution. Building on this foundation, we propose a categorical model of Information Handlers (IH), entities capable of self-maintenance, mutation, and combination. Each lineage is represented as a discrete coalgebra with internal (M,R) closure, while the global system forms a supercategory of interacting lineages. Replication, reproduction, and transmission are modeled as morphisms whose informational changes are captured by a functor mapping biological transformations into transformations within an informational category, measurable through Jeffreys divergences. This framework connects gene-centered evolutionary dynamics with relational and organizational perspectives, offering a unified categorical view of living systems.",

    "abstract": "Island endemism is shaped by complex interactions among environmental, ecological, and evolutionary factors, yet the relative contributions of topography, climate, and land cover remain incompletely quantified. We investigated the drivers of endemic plant richness across Crete, a Mediterranean biodiversity hotspot, using spatially explicit data on species distributions, topographic complexity, climatic variability, land cover, and soil characteristics. Artificial Neural Network models, a machine learning tool, were employed to assess the relative importance of these predictors and to identify hotspots of endemism. We found that total species richness, elevation range, and climatic variability were the strongest predictors of endemic richness, reflecting the role of biodiversity, topographic heterogeneity, and climatic gradients in generating diverse habitats and micro-refugia that promote speciation and buffer extinction risk. Endemic hotspots only partially overlapped with areas of high total species richness, indicating that total species richness was the optimal from the ones examined, yet an imperfect surrogate. These environmentally heterogeneous areas also provide critical ecosystem services, including soil stabilization, pollination, and cultural value, which are increasingly threatened by tourism, renewable energy development, land-use change, and climate impacts. Our findings underscore the importance of prioritizing mountainous and climatically variable regions in conservation planning, integrating ecosystem service considerations, and accounting for within-island spatial heterogeneity. By explicitly linking the environmental drivers of endemism to both biodiversity patterns and ecosystem function, this study provides a framework for evidence-based conservation planning in Crete and other Mediterranean islands with similar geological and biogeographic contexts.",

    "title": "Evolution under Stochastic Transmission: Mutation-Rate Modifiers",
    "abstract": "In evolutionary models of large populations, it is common to analyze the effects of cyclic or random variation in the parameters that describe selection. It is less common, however, to study how stochasticity in the genetic transmission process itself affects evolutionary outcomes. Suppose that a gene locus has alleles $A$ and $a$ under constant selection. This locus is linked to a modifier locus with alleles $M_1$ and $M_2$, which control the mutation rate from $A$ to $a$. The Reduction Principle states that, near a mutation--selection balance where $M_1$ is fixed with mutation rate $u_1$, a rare allele $M_2$ can invade if its associated rate $u_2$ is lower than $u_1$. This result, valid for both haploids and diploids, assumes constant mutation rates through time. We extend this framework by allowing the mutation rate associated with $M_2$ to fluctuate randomly across generations, denoted as $u_{2,t}$. In this stochastic setting, the condition for invasion by a new modifier allele depends not only on the resident mutation rate $u_1$ and the mean mutation rate $u_2$ associated with the invading allele, but also on the temporal distribution of $u_{2,t}$, the strength of selection at the $A/a$ locus, and the recombination rate between $M_1/M_2$ and $A/a$. The analysis shows how stochasticity and recombination in transmission do not simply modify the magnitude of evolutionary change predicted under deterministic assumptions. Instead, through their interaction with selection and linkage, they can generate conditions under which the direction of modifier evolution is qualitatively reversed relative to the deterministic Reduction Principle.",

We present a unified framework for modeling the spread of infection and information: a general class of interaction-driven fluid-limit models expressed as coupled ODEs. The class includes the SIR epidemic model, the Daley-Kendall rumor model, and many extensions. For this general class, we derive theoretical results: under explicit graph-theoretic conditions, we obtain a classification of asymptotic behavior and motivate a conjecture of exponential decay for vanishing states. When these conditions are violated, the classification can fail, and decay may become non-exponential (e.g., algebraic). In deriving the main result, we establish asymptotic stability and $L^1$-integrability properties for state variables. Alongside these results, we introduce the dependency graph that captures outflow dependencies and offers a new angle on the structure of this model class. Finally, we illustrate the results with several examples, including a heterogeneous rumor model and a rumor-dependent SIR model, showing how small changes to the dependency graph can flip asymptotic behavior and reshape epidemic trajectories.",

    "abstract": "Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are universal adaptors of the genetic code, yet their evolutionary dynamics across photosynthetic eukaryotes remain underexplored. Here, we present the largest comparative re-analysis integrating the PlantRNA database with published data to explore tRNA gene evolution. We find that tRNA gene repertoires have been deeply shaped by ecological transitions, genome architecture, and translational demands. Terrestrialization marks a major shift in tRNA evolution, characterized by the loss of selenoproteins and their dedicated selenocysteine tRNAs in land plants compared to algae. Patterns of intron prevalence, position, and structure diverged among lineages, with extensive intron loss occurring around the origin of land plants. Organellar genomes exhibit divergent trajectories: mitochondrial tRNA sets are highly labile due to recurrent gene losses, imports, and horizontal transfers, whereas plastid repertoires are comparatively stable with lineage-specific exceptions. In parallel, angiosperm nuclear tRNA genes exhibit reinforced cis-regulatory elements, consistent with increased and developmentally complex translational demands, and their copy number correlates tightly with codon usage and amino acid composition. Finally, conserved yet family-biased clustering of nuclear tRNA genes reveals contrasting organizational principles in plants versus metazoans. Together, these findings establish tRNA gene evolution as a major determinant of translational capacity and a key driver of photosynthetic diversification.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we use Species Distribution Models (SDMs) to forecast the future diversity and distribution of orchids in Great Britain and Ireland under scenarios of climate and land-use change. The study analyzes occurrence data for native orchid taxa in the BSBI database at a fine spatial resolution (1 km^2, monads) and incorporates multiple environmental variables including climate, land use, topography, and soil. These SDMs project significant losses in orchid species richness by 2050 and 2070, especially under severe climate and land-use scenarios, with declines expected across most species and regions, including Ireland where historical data previously indicated gains. The models reveal vulnerable species likely to face extinction by 2070, emphasizing the impact of both climate warming and habitat modifications. This approach differs from previous trend-based analyses by integrating future projections, high-resolution spatial data, and dynamic land-use scenarios, thereby providing higher-resolution estimates of orchid range contractions and diversity losses. While current observed orchid trends show some regional increases, particularly in Ireland, the SDM forecasts indicate substantial future risks. The study also discusses uncertainties due to niche truncation from geographic data limits and highlights the need for broader-scale modeling for more robust predictions. Overall, the paper anticipates conservation challenges for orchid biodiversity in response to ongoing environmental changes.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, numerous advances have been made in understanding how epidemic dynamics is affected by changes in individual behaviours. We propose an SIS-based compartmental model to tackle the simultaneous and coupled evolution of an outbreak and of the adoption by individuals of the isolation measure. The compliance with self-isolation is described with the help of the imitation dynamics framework. Individuals are incentivised to isolate based on the prevalence and the incidence rate of the outbreak, and are tempted to defy isolation recommendations depending on the duration of isolation and on the cost of putting social interactions on hold. We are able to derive analytical results on the equilibria of the model under the homogeneous mean-field approximation. Simulating the compartmental model on empirical networks, we also do a preliminary check of the impact of a network structure on our analytical predictions. We find that the dynamics collapses to surprisingly simple regimes where either the imitation dynamics no longer plays a role or the equilibrium prevalence depends on only two parameters of the model, namely the cost and the relative time spent in isolation. Whether individuals prioritise disease prevalence or incidence as an indicator of the state of the outbreak appears to play no role on the equilibria of the dynamics. However, it turns out that favouring incidence may help to flatten the curve in the transient phase of the dynamics. We also find a fair agreement between our analytical predictions and simulations run on an empirical multiplex network.",

We apply these models to data on growth rates for populations of green algae {\\em Clamydomonas reinhardtii}. Specifically, we compare growth rates of two ancestral strains and respective mutation accumulation lines, measured along a stress gradient. The data had previously shown mutants growing consistently slower than ancestors, and this effect aggravating with stress.

    "abstract": "Phylogenetic tree shapes capture fundamental signatures of evolution. We consider ``ranked'' tree shapes, which are equipped with a total order on the internal nodes compatible with the tree graph. Recent work has established an elegant bijection of ranked tree shapes and a class of integer matrices, called \\textbf{F}-matrices, defined by simple inequalities. This formulation is for isochronous ranked tree shapes, where all leaves share the same sampling time, such as in the study of ancient human demography from present-day individuals. Another important style of phylogenetics concerns trees where the ``timing'' of events is by branch length rather than calendar time. This style of tree, called a rooted phylogram, is output by popular maximum-likelihood methods. These trees are broadly relevant, such as to study the affinity maturation of B cells in the immune system. Discretizing time in a rooted phylogram gives a fully heterochronous ranked tree shape, where leaves are part of the total order. Here we extend the \\textbf{F}-matrix framework to such fully heterochronous ranked tree shapes. We establish an explicit bijection between a class of \\textbf{F}-matrices and the space of such tree shapes. The matrix representation has the key feature that values at any entry are highly constrained via four previous entries, enabling straightforward enumeration of all valid tree shapes. We also use this framework to develop probabilistic models on ranked tree shapes. Our work extends understanding of combinatorial objects that have a rich history in the literature.",

After reviewing the Shore and Johnson axioms from an applied perspective, we recall the most commonly used entropy functionals and locate them within the UJK family. The need for generalized entropies is made clear with two applications, one rooted in economics and the other in ecology. A simple mathematical model worked out in detail shows the power of generalized maximum entropy approaches in dealing with cases where strong system independence does not hold.

    "abstract": "We introduce a general diploid population model with self-fertilization and possible overlapping generations, and study the genealogy of a sample of $n$ genes as the population size $N$ tends to infinity. Unlike traditional approach in coalescent theory which considers the unconditional (annealed) law of the gene genealogies averaged over the population pedigree, here we study the conditional (quenched) law of gene genealogies given the pedigree. We focus on the case of high selfing probability and obtain that this conditional law converges to a random probability measure, given by the random law of a system of coalescing random walks on an exchangeable fragmentation-coalescence process of \\cite{berestycki04}. This system contains the system of coalescing random walks on the ancestral recombination graph as a special case, and it sheds new light on the site-frequency spectrum (SFS) of genetic data by specifying how SFS depends on the pedigree. The convergence result is proved by means of a general characterization of weak convergence for random measures on the Skorokhod space with paths taking values in a locally compact Polish space.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the dynamics of the spread of diseases within populations is critical for effective public health interventions. We extend the classical SIR model by incorporating additional complexities such as the introduction of a cure and migration between cities. Our framework leverages a system of differential equations to simulate disease transmission across a network of interconnected cities, capturing more realistic patterns. We present theoretical results on the convergence of population sizes in the migration framework (in the absence of deaths). We also run numerical simulations to understand how the timing of the introduction of the cure affects mortality rates. Our numerical results explain how localized interventions affect the spread of the disease across cities. In summary, this work advances the modeling of epidemics to a more local scope, offering a more expressive tool for epidemiological research and public health planning.",

    "abstract": "Evolutionary systems must learn to generalize, often extrapolating from a limited set of selective conditions to anticipate future environmental changes. The mechanisms enabling such generalization remain poorly understood, despite their importance to predict ecological robustness, drug resistance, or design future-proof vaccination strategies. Here, we demonstrate that annealed population heterogeneity, wherein distinct individuals in the population experience different instances of a complex environment over time, can act as a form of implicit regularization and facilitate evolutionary generalization. Mathematically, annealed heterogeneity introduces a variance-weighted demographic noise term that penalizes across-environment fitness variance and effectively rescales the population size, thereby biasing evolution toward generalist solutions. This process is indeed analogous to a variant of the mini-batching strategy employed in stochastic gradient descent, where an effective multiplicative noise produces an inductive bias by triggering noise-induced transitions.   Through numerical simulations and theoretical analysis we discuss the conditions under which variation in how individuals experience environmental selection can naturally promote evolutionary strategies that generalize across environments and anticipate novel challenges.",

    "abstract": "We study the effect of intratumor heterogeneity in the likelihood of cancer cells moving from a primary tumor to other sites in the human body, generating a metastatic process. We model different scenarios of competition between tumor cells using a static evolutionary game in which cells compete for nutrients and oxygen and might choose to stay and proliferate in the primary tumor or opt to a motility strategy in order to find resources in a metastatic site. The theoretical results found in the evolutionarily equilibrium in the mathematical model are in line with the empirical results observed in oncology, namely, the coexistence of both primary and metastatic tumors and the conditions that favor a metastatic process. Particularly, the model finds mathematical support for what is empirically observed in punctuated and branching cancers for the specific case of clear cell renal cell carcinomas: motility of cells is larger in punctuated cancers if the proportion of BAP1 mutations remain below a given cell proportion threshold.",

    "abstract": "Collective systems that self-organise to maximise the group's ability to collect and distribute information can be successful in environments with high spatial and temporal variation. Such organisations are abundant in nature, as sharing information is a key benefit of many biological collective systems, and have been influential in the design of many artificial collectives such as swarm robotics. Understanding how these systems may be spatially distributed to optimise their collective potential is therefore of importance in both ecology and in collective systems design. Here, we develop a mathematical model which uses an optimisation framework to determine the higher-order spatial structure of a collective that optimises group-level knowledge transfer. The domain of the objective function is a set of weighted simplicial sets, which can fully represent the spatial structure from a topological perspective. By varying the parameters within the objective function and the constraints, we determine how the optimal spatial structure may vary when individuals differ in their information gathering ability and how this variation differs in the context of resource constraints. Our key findings are that the amount of resources in the environment can lead to specific subgroup sizes being optimal for the group as a whole when individuals are homogeneous in their information gathering abilities. Further, when there is variation in information gathering abilities, our model implies that the sharing of space between smaller subgroups of the population, rather than the whole population, is optimal for collective knowledge sharing. Our results have applications across diverse contexts from behavioural ecology to bio-inspired collective systems design.",

    "abstract": "Rabies continues to pose a significant zoonotic threat, particularly in areas with high populations of domestic dogs that serve as viral reservoirs. This study conducts a comparative analysis of Stochastic Continuous-Time Markov Chain (CTMC) and deterministic models to gain insights into rabies persistence within human and canine populations. By employing a multitype branching process, the stochastic threshold for rabies persistence was determined, revealing important insights into how stochasticity influences extinction probabilities. The stochastic model utilized 10,000 sample paths to estimate the probabilities of rabies outbreaks, offering a rigorous assessment of the variability in disease occurrences. Additionally, the study introduces a novel mathematical formulation of rabies transmission dynamics, which includes environmental reservoirs, free-ranging dogs, and domestic dogs as essential transmission factors. The basic reproduction number ($\\mathcal{R}_0$) was derived and analyzed within stochastic frameworks, effectively bridging the gap between these two modeling approaches. Numerical simulations confirmed that the results from the stochastic model closely aligned with those from the deterministic model, while also highlighting the importance of stochasticity in scenarios with low infection rates. Ultimately, the study advocates for a comprehensive approach to rabies control that integrates both the predictable trends identified through deterministic models and the impact of random events emphasized by stochastic models.",

    "abstract": "The Swadesh approach for determining the temporal separation between two languages relies on the stochastic process of words replacement (when a complete new word emerges to represent a given concept). It is well known that the basic assumptions of the Swadesh approach are often unrealistic due to various contamination phenomena and misjudgments (horizontal transfers, variations over time and space of the replacement rate, incorrect assessments of cognacy relationships, presence of synonyms, and so on). All of this means that the results cannot be completely correct.   More importantly, even in the unrealistic case that all basic assumptions are satisfied, simple mathematics places limits on the accuracy of estimating the temporal separation between two languages. These limits, which are purely probabilistic in nature and which are often neglected in lexicostatistical studies, are analyzed in detail in this article.   Furthermore, in this work we highlight that the evolution of a language's lexicon is also driven by another stochastic process: gradual lexical modification of words. We show that this process equally also represents a major contribution to the reshaping of the vocabulary of languages over the centuries and we also show, from a purely probabilistic perspective, that taking into account this second random process significantly increases the precision in determining the temporal separation between two languages.",

    "abstract": "Human bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) include skeletal stem cells with ground-breaking therapeutic potential. However, BMSC colonies have very heterogeneous in vivo behaviour, due to their different potency; this unpredictability is the greatest hurdle to the development of skeletal regeneration therapies. Colony-level heterogeneity urges a fundamental question: how is it possible that one colony as a collective unit behaves differently from another one? If cell-to-cell variability were just an uncorrelated random process, a million cells in a transplant-bound colony would be enough to yield statistical homogeneity, hence washing out any colony-level traits. A possible answer is that the differences between two originating cells are transmitted to their progenies and collectively persist through an hereditary mechanism. But non-genetic inheritance remains an elusive notion, both at the experimental and at the theoretical level. Here, we prove that heterogeneity in the lineage topology of BMSC clonal colonies is determined by heritable traits that regulate cell-cycle exit. The cornerstone of this result is the definition of a novel entropy of the colony, which measures the hereditary ramifications in the distribution of inactive cells across different branches of the proliferation tree. We measure the entropy in 32 clonal colonies, obtained from single-cell lineage tracing experiments, and show that in the greatest majority of clones this entropy is decisively smaller than that of the corresponding non-hereditary lineage. This result indicates that hereditary epigenetic factors play a major role in determining cycle exit of bone marrow stromal cells.",

Expanding MR to diverse ancestry groups is essential to ensure equitable biomedical insights, yet presents analytical and conceptual challenges. This review examines the practical challenges of MR analyses beyond the European only context, including use of data from multi-ancestry, mismatched ancestry, and admixed populations. We explain how apparent heterogeneity in MR estimates between populations can arise from differences in genetic variant frequencies and correlation patterns, as well as from differences in the distribution of phenotypic variables, complicating the detection of true differences in the causal pathway.   We summarize published strategies for selecting genetic instruments and performing analyses when working with limited ancestry-specific data, discussing the assumptions needed in each case for incorporating external data from different ancestry populations. We conclude that differences in MR estimates by ancestry group should be interpreted cautiously, with consideration of how the identified differences may arise due to social and cultural factors. Corroborating evidence of a biological mechanism altering the causal pathway is needed to support a conclusion of differing causal pathways between ancestry groups.",

We make use of this algorithmic framework to analyse memory effects in disease evolution in a population. The modelling is based on a susceptible-infected-recovered SIR - model and on a susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered SEIR - model through a kernel that dampens the activity based on the recent history of infectious individuals. This corresponds to adaptive behavior in the population or through governmental non-pharmaceutical interventions. We use the linear chain trick to show that such a model may be written in a Markovian way, and we analyze the stability of the system. We find that the adaptive behavior gives rise to either a stable equilibrium point or a stable limit cycle for a close to constant number of susceptibles, i.e.\\ locally in time. We also show that the attack rate for this model is lower than it would be without the dampening, although the adaptive behavior disappears as time goes to infinity and the number of infected goes to zero.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the adaptive Ambush strategy in cyclic models following the rules of the spatial rock-paper-scissors game. In our model, individuals of one species possess cognitive abilities to perceive environmental cues and assess the local density of the species they dominate in the spatial competition for natural resources. Based on this assessment, they either initiate a direct attack or, if the local concentration of target individuals does not justify the risk, reposition strategically to prepare an ambush. To quantify the evolutionary consequences of these behavioural strategies, we perform stochastic simulations, analysing emergent spatial patterns and the dependence of species densities on the threshold used by individuals to decide between immediate attack or anticipation. Our findings reveal that, despite being designed to enhance efficiency, cognitive strategies can reduce the abundance of the species due to the constraints of cyclic dominance. We identify an optimal decision threshold: attacking only when the local density of target individuals exceeds 15% provides the best balance between selection risk and long-term persistence. Furthermore, the Ambush strategy benefits low-mobility organisms, increasing coexistence probabilities by up to 53%. These results deepen the understanding of adaptive decision-making in spatial ecology, linking cognitive complexity to ecosystem resilience and extinction risk.",

High level of prejudice should lead to discrimination that may manifest as unfairness and, perhaps, even spite. In this paper, we investigate this idea in the classical paradigm of the ultimatum game which we theoretically modify to introduce prejudice at the level of players, terming its intensity as prejudicity. The stochastic evolutionary game dynamics, in the regime of replication-selection, reveals the emergence of spiteful behaviour as a dominant behaviour via a first order phase transition -- a discontinuous jump in the frequency of spiteful individuals at a threshold value of prejudicity. The phase transition is quite robust and becomes progressively conspicuous in the limit of large population size where deterministic evolutionary game dynamics, viz., replicator dynamics, approximates the system closely. The emergence of spite driven by prejudice is also found to persist when one considers long-term evolutionary dynamics in the mutation-selection dominated regime.",

    "abstract": "The Paradox of Enrichment (PoE) predicts that increasing resources, such as nutrient inputs like fertilizers or food availability, should destabilize ecological systems, such as crop-pest dynamics, leading to population cycles that can increase the risk of crop failure during environmental shocks. Yet, since the Green Revolution, fertilizer use has surged without widespread evidence of yield instability, challenging the PoE's relevance to modern agriculture. Here, we propose and test a novel resolution: that insecticides, frequently co-applied with fertilizers, act as stabilizing agents that counterbalance enrichment-induced instability. Using a modified PoE model with empirically grounded parameters for three major crop-pest systems-soybean-aphid, wheat-aphid, and cabbage-diamondback moth-we find that fertilizer increases yields, but destabilizes dynamics, whereas insecticides restore stability and ensure more predictable harvests. These findings reveal that insecticides may suppress pests but also play a critical role in stabilizing crop yields in nutrient-enriched agroecosystems, with implications for ecosystem management, eutrophication, conservation biology, and pesticide policy.",

    "abstract": "The Generic Population Concept - Agent-Based Model, henceforth short, GEPOC ABM, is one of the models within GEPOC, a generic concept to model a country's population and its dynamics using causal modelling approaches. The model is well established and had already proven its worth in various use cases from evaluation of MMR vaccination rates to SARS-CoV-2 epidemics modelling. In this work we will reproducibly specify the base model, to be specific, version 2.2 of it, and several extensions. The base model GEPOC ABM depicts the population of a country with the features sex and age. It uses a co-simulation-inspired time-update, where person-level discrete-event simulators are synchronised by a simulation layer at macro-steps, making the approach amenable to parallelization. A core design choice is structuring person agents around the life-year rather than the calendar year; accordingly, each agent schedules demographic events annually on their birthday. To expand the model's capabilities beyond basic demographic features, GEPOC ABM Geography adds a residence feature in the form of geographical coordinates. Further extensions include GEPOC ABM IM, which adds internal migration processes in three variants, and GEPOC ABM CL, which models locations where agents may have contacts with each other. In this definition we solely specify the conceptual models and do not go into any details with respect to implementation or gathering/processing of parametrisation data.",

These relationships generalize Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural selection and also make clear some of its limitation. The relationship between cumulants and continuous selection is especially intuitive and also provides an alternative way to understand cumulants. We show that a similarly simple relationship exists between moments and discrete selection. In more complex scenarios, we show that thinking of selection over discrete generations has significant advantages. For a simple mutation model, we find exact solutions for the equilibrium moments of the fitness distribution. These solutions are surprisingly simple and have some interesting implications including: a necessary and sufficient condition for mutation selection balance, a very simple formula for mean fitness and the fact that the shape of the equilibrium fitness distribution is determined solely by mutation (whereas the scale is determined by the starting fitness distribution).",

The model, which is built extending the classical susceptible-infected-susceptible model, accounts for two populations -- humans and vectors -- and for cross-contagion between the two species, whereby humans become infected upon interaction with carrier vectors, and vectors become carriers after interaction with infected humans. We formulate the model as a system of ordinary differential equations and leverage monotone systems theory to rigorously characterize the epidemic dynamics. Specifically, we characterize the global asymptotic behavior of the disease, determining conditions for quick eradication of the disease (i.e., for which all trajectories converge to a disease-free equilibrium), or convergence to a (unique) endemic equilibrium. Then, we incorporate two control actions: namely, vector control and incentives to adopt protection measures. Using the derived mathematical tools, we assess the impact of these two control actions and determine the optimal control policy.",

From an ecological perspective, the sign of the propagation speed determines the long-term outcome of competition between two species and thus plays a central role in predicting the success or failure of invasion of an alien species into habitats occupied by a native species. Using comparison arguments, we establish sufficient conditions determining the sign of the propagation speed, which refine previously known results. In particular, we show that in the symmetric case, where the two species differ only in their diffusion rates, the faster diffuser prevails over a substantially broader parameter range than previously established. Moreover, we demonstrate that when the interspecific competition coefficients differ significantly, the outcome of competition cannot be reversed by adjusting diffusion or growth rates. These findings provide a rigorous theoretical framework for analyzing invasion dynamics, offering sharper mathematical criteria for invasion success or failure.",

While the original chemoton incorporates metabolism, membrane, and genetic templates, it lacks a mechanism for phenotypic variation, preventing true evolutionary dynamics. To address this, we introduced a genotype-phenotype coupling by linking templates to a second autocatalytic cycle, enabling mutations to affect phenotype and be subject to selection. Using a genetic algorithm, we simulated populations of chemotons over generations. Results showed that chemotons without access to the new cycle remained in a stable but complexity-limited regime, while lineages acquiring the additional metabolic set evolved longer templates. These findings demonstrate that even simple replicator systems can achieve primitive evolvability, highlighting structural thresholds and rare innovations as key drivers. Our framework provides a tractable model for exploring autonomy and evolution in ALife.",

In oncology, experimental data are often sparse and composed of a few time points of tumor volume. By embedding inductive biases derived from prior information about a dynamical system, we extend the physics-informed neural networks (PINN) and incorporate observed biological constraints as regularization agents. The modified PINN algorithm is able to steer itself to a reasonable solution and can generalize well with only a few training examples. We demonstrate the merit of our approach by learning the dynamics of treatment applied intermittently in an ordinary differential equation (ODE) model of a combination therapy. The algorithm yields a solution to the ODE and time-varying forms of some of the ODE model parameters. We demonstrate a strong convergence using metrics such as the mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE).",

    "abstract": "Phylogenetic trees capture evolutionary relationships among species and reflect the forces that shaped them. While many studies rely on branch length information, the topology of phylogenetic trees (particularly their degree of imbalance) offers a robust framework for inferring evolutionary dynamics when timing data is uncertain. Classical metrics, such as the Colless and Sackin indices, quantify tree imbalance and have been extensively used to characterize phylogenies. Empirical phylogenies typically show intermediate imbalance, falling between perfectly balanced and highly skewed trees. This regime is marked by a power-law relationship between subtree sizes and their cumulative sizes, governed by a characteristic exponent. Although a recent niche-size model replicates this scaling, its mathematical origin and the exponent's value remain unclear. We present a generative model inspired by Kingman's coalescent that incorporates niche-like dynamics through preferential node coalescence. This process maps to Smoluchowski's coagulation kinetics and is described by a generalized Smoluchowski equation. Our model produces imbalanced trees with power-law exponents matching empirical and numerical observations, revealing the mathematical basis of observed scaling laws and offering new tools to interpret tree imbalance in evolutionary contexts.",

We investigate how two common features of animal movement--directional persistence and range residency--jointly shape encounter rates. Using the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck with foraging (OUF) model, which integrates these two properties of animal movement, we derive exact analytical expressions for encounter rates and show that, for range-resident animals, the effect of persistence depends strongly on the degree of home-range overlap. Based on this theoretical result, we then introduce a new encounter-based metric that quantifies the spatial organization of home ranges at scales relevant to animal encounters. We finally apply this metric to movement data from lowland tapirs ($\\textit{Tapirus terrestris}$) in Brazil's Pantanal region and find a significant level of home-range spatial segregation, consistent with the solitary behavior of this species.",

    "abstract": "Accurate epidemic forecasting requires models that account for the layered and heterogeneous nature of real social interactions. The basic reproduction number $\\mathcal R_0$ calculated from models that assume homogeneous mixing or single-layer contact structures have limited applicability to complex social systems. Here, we propose an expression of $\\mathcal R_0$ in the context of multiplex networks, enabling the analysis of disease transmission across multiple social layers.   We adapt the Degree-Based Mean-Field (DBMF) SIR model for single-layered complex networks to the multiplex setting, where each layer has its own degree distribution and infection rate. Using the Next Generation Matrix method, we derive an analytical expression for the basic reproduction number $\\mathcal R_0$. Numerical integration of the multiplex DBMF equations shows that $\\mathcal R_0 = 1$ marks the epidemic threshold and governs the functional dependence of key outbreak indicators. In addition to the exact result for the $\\mathcal R_0$, we provide an approximation denoted as $τ$, which is easier to compute and more straightforward to interpret in terms of the parameters of the system, and shares most of the expected properties of the basic reproduction number.   Stochastic agent-based simulations confirm these results, demonstrating a direct correspondence between $τ$ and the average number of secondary infections in the early epidemic phase, in line with the interpretation of $\\mathcal R_0$.   This research provides a robust generalization of $\\mathcal R_0$ for layered contact structures, offering a more realistic basis for epidemic forecasting and the design of intervention strategies.",

    "abstract": "Reconstructing evolutionary histories and estimating the rate of evolution from molecular sequence data is of central importance in evolutionary biology and infectious disease research. We introduce a flexible Bayesian phylogenetic inference framework that accommodates changing evolutionary rates over time by modeling sequence character substitution processes as inhomogeneous continuous-time Markov chains (ICTMCs) acting along the unknown phylogeny, where the rate remains as an unknown, positive and integrable function of time. The integral of the rate function appears in the finite-time transition probabilities of the ICTMCs that must be efficiently computed for all branches of the phylogeny to evaluate the observed data likelihood. Circumventing computational challenges that arise from a fully nonparametric function, we successfully parameterize the rate function as piecewise constant with a large number of epochs that we call the polyepoch clock model. This makes the transition probability computation relatively inexpensive and continues to flexibly capture rate change over time. We employ a Gaussian Markov random field prior to achieve temporal smoothing of the estimated rate function. Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling enabled by scalable gradient evaluation under this model makes our framework computationally efficient. We assess the performance of the polyepoch clock model in recovering the true timescales and rates through simulations under two different evolutionary scenarios. We then apply the polyepoch clock model to examine the rates of West Nile virus, Dengue virus and influenza A/H3N2 evolution, and estimate the time-varying rate of SARS-CoV-2 spread in Europe in 2020.",

Although recent advances have introduced real-world stochasticity in nonlinear public goods game (PGG), such stochasticity remains static, neglecting its origin in the external environment as well as the coevolution of system stochasticity and cooperative behavior driven by environmental dynamics. In this work, we introduce a dynamic environment feedback mechanism into the stochastic nonlinear PGG framework, establishing a coevolutionary model that couples environmental states and individual cooperative strategies. Our results demonstrate that the interplay among environment feedback, nonlinear effects, and stochasticity can drive the system toward a wide variety of steady-state structures, including full defection, full cooperation, stable coexistence, and periodic limit cycles. Further analysis reveals that asymmetric nonlinear parameters and environment feedback rates exert significant regulatory effects on cooperation levels and system dynamics. This study not only enriches the theoretical framework of evolutionary game theory, but also provides a foundation for the management of ecological systems and the design of cooperative mechanisms in society.",

We show that a reduced set of observers may be sufficient, in the statistical sense, to localize the source and characterize its identifiability via the joint Laplace transform of the observers' infection times. Using the explicit form of these transforms in terms of the edge-delay probability distributions, we propose scale-invariant least-squares estimators of the source. We evaluate their performance on synthetic trees and on a river network, demonstrating accurate localization under diverse edge-delay models. To conclude, we highlight overlooked technical challenges for observer-based source localization on networks with cycles, where standard spanning-tree reductions may be ill-posed.",

    "abstract": "We employ an n-player coordination game to model mutualism emergence and abandonment. We illustrate our findings in the context of the host--host interactions among plants in plant-mycorrhizal fungi (MF) mutualisms. The coordination game payoff structure captures the insight that mutualistic strategies lead to robust advantages only after such \"biological markets\" reach a certain scale. The game gives rise to three types of Nash equilibria, which correspond to the states derived in studies of the ancestral reconstruction of the mycorrhizal symbiosis in seed plants. We show that all types of Nash equilibria correspond to steady states of a dynamical system describing the underlying evolutionary process. We then employ methods from large deviation theory on discrete-time Markov processes to study stochastic evolutionary dynamics. We provide a sharp analytical characterization of the stochastic steady states and of the transition dynamics across Nash equilibria and employ simulations to illustrate these results in special cases. We find that the mutualism is abandoned and re-established several times through evolutionary time, but the mutualism may persist the majority of time. Changes that reduce the benefit-to-cost ratio associated with the symbiosis increase the likelihood of its abandonment. While the mutualism establishment and abandonment could result from direct transitions across the mutualistic and non-mutualistic states, it is far more likely for such transitions to occur indirectly through intermediate partially mutualistic states. The MF-plant mutualism might be (partially or fully) abandoned by plants even if it provides overall superior fitness.",

    "abstract": "Positive selection drives the emergence of adaptive mutations in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, shaping drug resistance, transmissibility, and virulence. Phylogenetic trees capture evolutionary relationships among isolates and provide a natural framework for detecting such adaptive signals. We present a phylogeny-guided graph attention network (GAT) approach, introducing a method for converting SNP-annotated phylogenetic trees into graph structures suitable for neural network analysis. Using 500 M. tuberculosis isolates from four major lineages and 249 single-nucleotide variants (84 resistance-associated and 165 neutral) across 61 drug-resistance genes, we constructed graphs where nodes represented isolates and edges reflected phylogenetic distances. Edges between isolates separated by more than seven internal nodes were pruned to emphasise local evolutionary structure. Node features encoded SNP presence or absence, and the GAT architecture included two attention layers, a residual connection, global attention pooling, and a multilayer perceptron classifier. The model achieved an accuracy of 0.88 on a held-out test set and, when applied to 146 WHO-classified \"uncertain\" variants, identified 41 candidates with convergent emergence across multiple lineages, consistent with adaptive evolution. This work demonstrates the feasibility of transforming phylogenies into GNN-compatible structures and highlights attention-based models as effective tools for detecting positive selection, aiding genomic surveillance and variant prioritisation.",

    "abstract": "The origin of microbial cells required the emergence of metabolism, an autocatalytic network of roughly 400 enzymatically catalyzed chemical reactions that synthesize the building blocks of life: amino acids, nucleotides and cofactors. Proposals for metabolic origin are theoretical in nature [1-9], empirical studies addressing the origin and early evolution of the 400-reaction chemical network itself are lacking. Here we identify intermediate states in the primordial assembly of metabolism from its inorganic origins, using structure-refined clusters for metabolic enzymes of prokaryotic genomes. We show that metabolism in the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) was enzymatically incomplete, undergoing final assembly independently in the lineages leading to bacteria and archaea, with metal catalysts that predated both enzymes and cofactors providing essential functions. Over half of modern core metabolism corresponds to laboratory reactions catalyzed by native transition metals--Fe(0), Co(0), Ni(0) and their alloys--under conditions of serpentinizing hydrothermal vents. As the hitherto elusive source of primordial aqueous phosphorylation, we show that phosphite, a constituent of serpentinizing systems [10], phosphorylates AMP [11] to ADP using native metals in water. Seventeen cofactors that transfer electrons, nitrogen, and carbon units to substrates in modern metabolism [12] can be functionally replaced by environmental transition metals [13-19]. The data reveal that cofactors are synthesized late in enzymatic metabolism and are required in reactions preceding their synthesis, specifying the existence at origins of simpler precursors, which we identify here as native metals. Cofactors liberated metabolism from a requirement for solid state catalysis at a phosphorylating hydrothermal vent, engendering its autocatalytic state.",

    "abstract": "Insect species subject to infection, predation, and anisotropic environmental conditions may exhibit preferential movement patterns. Given the innate stochasticity of exogenous factors driving these patterns over short timescales, individual insect trajectories typically obey overdamped stochastic dynamics. In practice, data-driven modeling approaches designed to learn the underlying Fokker-Planck equations from observed insect distributions serve as ideal tools for understanding and predicting such behavior. Understanding dispersal dynamics of crop and silvicultural pests can lead to a better forecasting of outbreak intensity and location, which can result in better pest management. In this work, we extend weak-form equation learning techniques, coupled with kernel density estimation, to learn effective models for lepidopteran larval population movement from highly sparse experimental data. Galerkin methods such as the Weak form Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (WSINDy) algorithm have recently proven useful for learning governing equations in several scientific contexts. We demonstrate the utility of the method on a sparse dataset of position measurements of fall armyworms (Spodoptera frugiperda) obtained in simulated agricultural conditions with varied plant resources and infection status.",

    "abstract": "Why do human populations remain vulnerable to collapse, even when they are large? Classical demographic theory predicts that volatility in growth should decline rapidly with size due to the averaging effects of the law of large numbers. As such, while small-scale societies may be demographically fragile, large-scale societies should be much more stable. Using a large census dataset of 228 indigenous societies from Brazil, we show that this prediction does not hold. Instead of volatility declining as the square root of population size, it falls much more slowly. This means that individuals within communities do not behave as independent demographic units as their lives are correlated through cooperation, shared subsistence practices, overlapping land use, and exposure to common shocks such as disease outbreaks or failed harvests. These correlations build demographic synchrony, drastically reducing the effective demographic degrees of freedom in a population, keeping volatility higher than expected at all scales. As a result, large-scale populations fluctuate as if they were much smaller, increasing their vulnerability to collapse. This helps explain why human societies of all sizes seem vulnerable to collapse, and why the archaeological and historical record is filled with examples of large, complex societies collapsing despite their size. We suggest demographic synchrony provides a general mechanism for understanding why human populations remain vulnerable across all scales: Scale still stabilizes synchronous populations via density increases, but synchrony ensures that stability grows only slowly with size, leaving large populations more volatile, and more vulnerable, than classical demographic theory predicts.",

To understand this invariance, we analyse empirical data showing how the numbers and sizes of lymph nodes scale with body mass, finding that larger animals have both more and larger lymph nodes. Using scaling theory and our mathematical model, we show that larger lymph nodes enable faster search times, conferring an advantage to larger animals that otherwise face slower biological times. This enables mammals to maintain, or even accelerate, the time to initiate the adaptive immune response as body size increases. We validate our analysis in simulations and compare it to empirical data.",

This manuscript considers aging from the perspective of entropy, wherein things fall apart. We first examine biological information change as a mutational distance, analogous to physical distance. In this model, informational change over time is fitted to an advection-diffusion equation, a normal distribution with a time component. The solution of the advection-diffusion equation provides a means of measuring the entropy of diverse biological systems. The binomial distribution is also sufficient to demonstrate that entropy increases as mutations or epimutations accumulate. As modeled, entropy scales with lifespans across the tree of life. This perspective provides potential mechanistic insights and testable hypotheses as to how evolution has attained enhanced longevity: entropy management. We find entropy is an inclusive rather than exclusive aging theory.",

    "abstract": "Ancestral recombination graphs (ARGs) encode the complete genealogical history of a population of recombining lineages. ARGs, and their succinct representation, tree sequences, are increasingly central to modern population genetics methods, yet building an intuition for ARGs remains challenging. This is particularly true when analyzing ancestry in a geographic context, as there is a critical lack of dedicated, interactive tools capable of visualizing ARGs as spatiotemporal objects. To address this gap, we introduce ARGscape, an interactive platform for simulating, analyzing, and visualizing ARGs across space and time. ARGscape provides a user-friendly graphical interface featuring dynamic 2- and 3-dimensional visualizations to explore ARGs through space and time, as well as a novel \"spatial diff\" visualization for quantitative comparison of geographic inference methods. ARGscape is an innovative, unified framework that seamlessly integrates leading command-line, Python, and R-based tools for ARG simulation, manipulation, and use in spatiotemporal inference into both graphical and command-line interfaces. By integrating these various functionalities, ARGscape facilitates novel data exploration and hypothesis generation, while lowering the barrier to entry for spatiotemporal ARG analysis in both research and education use-cases. ARGscape is built with a Python FastAPI backend and a React/TypeScript frontend. It is freely available as a live demo at https://www.argscape.com and as a Python package on PyPI (pip install argscape). The source code and documentation are available on GitHub at https://github.com/chris-a-talbot/argscape.",

In this context, inhibiting factors such as interference, predator competition, and the introduction of temporally dependent quantity and quality of additional food are all known to enable pest extinction. As climate change and habitat degradation have increasing effects in enhancing patchiness in ecological systems, the effect of additional food in patch models has also been recently considered. However, the question of complete pest extinction in such patchy systems remains open. In the current manuscript, we consider a biological control model where additional food drives competition among predators in one patch, and they subsequently disperse to a neighboring patch via drift or dispersal. We show that complete pest extinction in both patches is possible. Further, this state is proved to be globally asymptotically stable under certain parametric restrictions. We also prove a codimension-2 Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation. We discuss our results in the context of designing pest management strategies under enhanced climate change and habitat fragmentation. Such strategies are particularly relevant to control invasive pests such as the Soybean aphid (\\emph{Aphis glycines}), in the North Central United States.",

Inference is based on solving the macroscopic system and embedding it in a Poisson observation model for daily trap counts, with uncertainty quantified via a parametric bootstrap. We validate identifiability using simulated data and apply the model to an urban MRR campaign in El Cano (Havana, Cuba) involving four weekly releases of sterile Aedes aegypti males. The best-supported model suggests a mean life expectancy of about five days and a typical displacement of about 180 m. Unlike empirical fits of survival or dispersal, our mechanistic approach jointly estimates movement, mortality, and capture, yielding biologically interpretable parameters and a principled framework for designing and evaluating SIT-based interventions.",

    "abstract": "From the formation of ice in small clusters of water molecules to the mass raids of army ant colonies, the emergent behavior of collectives depends critically on their size. At the same time, common wisdom holds that such behaviors are robust to the loss of individuals. This tension points to the need for a more systematic study of how number influences collective behavior. We initiate this study by focusing on collective behaviors that change abruptly at certain critical numbers of individuals. We show that a subtle modification of standard bifurcation analysis identifies such critical numbers, including those associated with discreteness- and noise-induced transitions. By treating them as instances of the same phenomenon, we show that critical numbers across physical scales and scientific domains commonly arise from competing feedbacks that scale differently with number. We then use this idea to find overlooked critical numbers in past studies of collective behavior and explore the implications for their conclusions. In particular, we highlight how deterministic approximations of stochastic models can fail near critical numbers. We close by distinguishing these qualitative changes from density-dependent phase transitions and by discussing how our approach could generalize to broader classes of collective behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Phylogenetic trees represent certain species and their likely ancestors. In such a tree, present-day species are leaves and an edge from u to v indicates that u is an ancestor of v. Weights on these edges indicate the phylogenetic distance. The phylogenetic diversity (PD) of a set of species A is the total weight of edges that are on any path between the root of the phylogenetic tree and a species in A. Selecting a small set of species that maximizes phylogenetic diversity for a given phylogenetic tree is an essential task in preservation planning, where limited resources naturally prevent saving all species. An optimal solution can be found with a greedy algorithm [Steel, Systematic Biology, 2005; Pardi and Goldman, PLoS Genetics, 2005]. However, when a food web representing predator-prey relationships is given, finding a set of species that optimizes phylogenetic diversity subject to the condition that each saved species should be able to find food among the preserved species is NP-hard [Spillner et al., IEEE/ACM, 2008]. We present a generalization of this problem, where, inspired by biological considerations, the food web has weighted edges to represent the importance of predator-prey relationships. We show that this version is NP-hard even when both structures, the food web and the phylogenetic tree, are stars. To cope with this intractability, we proceed in two directions. Firstly, we study special cases where a species can only survive if a given fraction of its prey is preserved. Secondly, we analyze these problems through the lens of parameterized complexity. Our results include that finding a solution is fixed-parameter tractable with respect to the vertex cover number of the food web, assuming the phylogenetic tree is a star.",

    "abstract": "Progress of the COVID-19 pandemic was quantified, in the first instance, using the daily number of positive cases recorded by the national public health authorities. Averaged over a seven-day window, the daily incidence of COVID-19 in Germany reveals clear sections of exponential growth or decay in propagation of infection. Comparing with incidence profiles according to onset-of-symptoms shows that reporting of cases involves variable delays. Observed changes in exponential rates come from growing public awareness, governmental restrictions and their later relaxation, annual holidays, seasonal variation, emergence of new viral variants, and from mass vaccination. Combining the measured rates with epidemiological parameters established for SARS-CoV-2 yields the dynamics of change in disease transmission. Combined with the distribution of serial intervals (or generation times), the rate gives basic and instantaneous values of the reproduction number that govern development and ultimate outcome of the epidemic. Herd immunity requires vaccination of approximately seventy percent of the population, but this increases to circa eighty percent for the more transmissible Alpha-variant. Beyond this point, progressive vaccination reduces the susceptible population, and competes with the emergence of new variants. By the first Omicron wave, circa seventy percent were doubly vaccinated, with the target then standing at circa eighty percent. Combined with the distribution of times-to-death, incidence rates from onset of symptoms predict the daily profile of COVID-associated deaths and estimated case-fatality ratio. Cases are under-reported in the first wave and reflect age heterogeneity in fatalities at the second wave. In periods of low incidence, COVID mortality was one percent or less of detected infection.",

    "abstract": "Evolutionary game theory offers a general framework to study how behaviors evolve by social learning in a population. This body of theory can accommodate a range of social dilemmas, or games, as well as real-world complexities such as spatial structure or behaviors conditioned on reputations. Nonetheless, this approach typically assumes a deterministic payoff structure for social interactions. Here, we extend evolutionary game theory to account for random changes in the social environment, so that mutual cooperation may bring different rewards today than it brings tomorrow, for example. Even when such environmental noise is unbiased, we find it can have a qualitative impact on the behaviors that evolve in a population. Noisy payoffs can permit the stable co-existence of cooperators and defectors in the prisoner's dilemma, for example, as well as bistability in snowdrift games and stable limit cycles in rock-paper-scissors games -- dynamical phenomena that cannot occur in the absence of noise. We conclude by discussing the relevance of our framework to scenarios where the nature of social interactions is subject to external perturbations.",

    "abstract": "Climate change and fisheries jointly shape the resilience of the Barents Sea marine ecosystem, yet the recovery of key fish populations to climate and anthropogenic disturbances requires further investigation. This study examines how fishing pressure and climate change, driven by the NEMO-MEDUSA Earth system model, influence the recovery times of Demersal and Planktivorous fish in the Barents Sea. We used the StrathE2EPolar end-to-end ecosystem model to simulate transient dynamics under increasing fishing pressure scenarios, and quantified recovery times for Demersal, Planktivorous, and ecosystem-wide groups relative to a shifting unfished baseline. Recovery times increased with both fishing intensity and climate change, by as much as 18 years for Demersal fish and 54 years for Planktivorous fish across all fishing scenarios. At the ecosystem level, recovery was constrained by the slow rebound of top predators, many of which experienced biomass collapse under climate change, preventing recovery to a shifting baseline. Our results suggest that fishing pressure in tandem with climate change substantially reduces ecosystem resilience, highlighting the importance of sustainable harvest strategies in a changing climate.",

To each gonosomic algebra, an evolution operator noted W is associated that gives the state of the offspring population at the birth stage. Next from W we define the operator V which gives the frequency distribution of genetic types. We show that the various stability notions of equilibrium points are preserved by passing from W to V .",

The generalised Lotka-Volterra (gLV) model is commonly used to understand microbial interactions and predict ecosystem dynamics. However, gLV models often fail to capture complex interactions, especially when data is limited or noisy. This study critically assesses the effectiveness of gLV and similar models using Bayesian inference and a model reduction method based on information theory. We found that ecological data often leads to non-interpretability and overfitting due to limited information, noisy data, and parameter sloppiness. Our results highlight the need for simpler models that align with the available data and propose a distribution-based approach to better capture ecosystem diversity, stability, and competition. These findings challenge current bottom-up ecological modelling practices and aim to shift the focus toward a Statistical Mechanics view of ecology based on distributions of parameters.",

We surveyed avian richness and abundance across 14 sites representing a 0 to 25 year post-fire chronosequence in Los Angeles County. Sites burned within the last five years supported fewer species, primarily dominated by generalists, while mid- to late-successional sites exhibited greater richness and a higher proportion of specialists. These patterns corresponded with increases in vegetation structural complexity over time. However, no consistent relationships were found between bird communities and abiotic variables, such as weather, temperature, and elevation, likely due to the single-visit sampling design. Our results align with successional theory and underscore the ecological importance of fire return intervals that allow full chaparral recovery. Restoration and management should prioritize long-term structural development, invasive grass control, and post-fire heterogeneity to support diverse and resilient avian communities.",

    "abstract": "To promote climate adaptation and mitigation, it is crucial to understand stakeholder perspectives and knowledge gaps on land use and climate changes. Stakeholders across 21 European islands were consulted on climate and land use change issues affecting ecosystem services. Climate change perceptions included temperature, precipitation, humidity, extremes, and wind. Land use change perceptions included deforestation, coastal degradation, habitat protection, renewable energy facilities, wetlands, and others. Additional concerns such as invasive species, water or energy scarcity, infrastructure problems, and austerity were also considered. Climate and land use change impact perceptions were analysed with machine learning to quantify their influence. The predominant climatic characteristic is temperature, and the predominant land use characteristic is deforestation. Water-related problems are top priorities for stakeholders. Energy-related problems, including energy deficiency and issues with wind and solar facilities, rank high as combined climate and land use risks. Stakeholders generally perceive climate change impacts on ecosystem services as negative, with natural habitat destruction and biodiversity loss identified as top issues. Land use change impacts are also negative but more complex, with more explanatory variables. Stakeholders share common perceptions on biodiversity impacts despite geographic disparity, but they differentiate between climate and land use impacts. Water, energy, and renewable energy issues pose serious concerns, requiring management measures.",

While longitudinal repertoire sequencing promises to track the long-term dynamics of many B cell clones simultaneously, sampling and experimental noise make it hard to draw reliable quantitative conclusions. Leveraging statistical inference, we infer the dynamics of memory B cell clonal dynamics and conversion to plasmablasts, which includes clone creation, degradation, abundance fluctuations, and differentiation. We find that memory B cell clones degrade slowly, with a half-life of 10 years. Based on the inferred parameters, we predict that it takes about 50 years to renew 50\\% of the repertoire, with most observed clones surviving for a lifetime. We infer that, on average, 1 out of 100 memory B cells differentiates into a plasmablast each year, more than expected from purely antigen-stimulated differentiation, and that plasmablast clones degrade with a half-life of about one year in the absence of memory imports. Our method is general and could be applied to other longitudinal repertoire sequencing B cell subsets.",

    "abstract": "Public opinion on environmental issues remains polarized in many countries, posing a significant barrier to the implementation of effective policies. Behind this polarization, empirical studies have identified social susceptibility, personal prejudice, and personal experience as dominant factors in opinion formation on environmental issues. However, current coupled human-environment models have not yet incorporated all three factors in polarized populations. We developed a stylized coupled human-environment model to investigate how social susceptibility, personal prejudice, and personal experience shape opinion formation and the environment in polarized populations. Using analytical and numerical methods, we characterized the conditions under which polarization, consensus, opinion changes, and cyclic dynamics emerge depending on the costs of mitigation, environmental damage, and the factors influencing opinion formation. Our model shows that prejudice is the key driver of persistent polarization, with even slightly prejudiced populations maintaining indefinite polarization independent of their level of objectivity. We predict that polarization can be reduced by decreasing the role of prejudice or increasing the willingness to consider opposing opinions. Finally, our model shows that cost reduction methods are less effective at reducing environmental impact in prejudiced populations. Our model generates thresholds for when reducing costs or emissions is more useful depending on the factors which influence the population's opinion formation. Overall, our model provides a framework for investigating the importance of cognitive and social structures in determining human-environment dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Infected individuals in some epidemics can remain asymptomatic while still carrying and transmitting the infection. These individuals contribute to the spread of the epidemic and pose a significant challenge to public health policies. Identifying asymptomatic individuals is critical for measuring and controlling an epidemic, but periodic and widespread testing of healthy individuals is often too costly. This work tackles the problem of identifying asymptomatic individuals considering a classic SI (Susceptible-Infected) network epidemic model where a fraction of the infected nodes are not observed as infected (i.e., their observed state is identical to susceptible nodes). In order to classify healthy nodes as asymptomatic or susceptible, a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model with supervised learning is adopted where a set of node features are built from the network with observed infected nodes. The approach is evaluated across different network models, network sizes, and fraction of observed infections. Results indicate that the proposed methodology is robust across different scenarios, accurately identifying asymptomatic nodes while also generalizing to different network sizes and fraction of observed infections.",

    "abstract": "Climate change is a global emergency, as was the COVID-19 pandemic. Why was our collective response to COVID-19 so much stronger than our response to the climate emergency, to date? We hypothesize that the answer has to do with the scale of the systems, and not just spatial and temporal scales but also the `altruistic scale' that measures whether an action must rely upon altruistic motives for it to be adopted. We treat COVID-19 and climate change as common pool resource problems that exemplify coupled human-environment systems. We introduce a framework that captures regimes of containment, mitigation, and failure to control. As parameters governing these three scales are varied, it is possible to shift from a COVID-like system to a climate-like system. The framework replicates both inaction in the case of climate change mitigation, as well as the faster response that we exhibited to COVID-19. Our cross-system comparison also suggests actionable ways that cooperation can be improved in large-scale common pool resources problems, like climate change. More broadly, we argue that considering scale and incorporating human-natural system feedbacks are not just interesting special cases within non-cooperative game theory, but rather should be the starting point for the study of altruism and human cooperation.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic underscored a critical need for intervention strategies that balance disease containment with socioeconomic stability. We approach this challenge by designing a framework for modeling and evaluating disease-spread prevention strategies. Our framework leverages multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) - a formulation necessitated by competing objectives - combined with a new stochastic differential equation (SDE) pandemic simulator, calibrated and validated against global COVID-19 data. Our simulator reproduces national-scale pandemic dynamics with orders of magnitude higher fidelity than other models commonly used in reinforcement learning (RL) approaches to pandemic intervention. Training a Pareto-Conditioned Network (PCN) agent on this simulator, we illustrate the direct policy trade-offs between epidemiological control and economic stability for COVID-19. Furthermore, we demonstrate the framework's generality by extending it to pathogens with different epidemiological profiles, such as polio and influenza, and show how these profiles lead the agent to discover fundamentally different intervention policies. To ground our work in contemporary policymaking challenges, we apply the model to measles outbreaks, quantifying how a modest 5% drop in vaccination coverage necessitates significantly more stringent and costly interventions to curb disease spread. This work provides a robust and adaptable framework to support transparent, evidence-based policymaking for mitigating public health crises.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) threatens global health. A promising and underexplored strategy to tackle this problem are sequential therapies exploiting collateral sensitivity (CS), whereby resistance to one drug increases sensitivity to another. Here, we develop a four-genotype stochastic birth-death model with two bacteriostatic antibiotics to identify switching periods that maximize bacterial extinction under subinhibitory concentrations. We show that extinction probability depends nonlinearly on switching period, with stepwise increases aligned to discrete switch events: fast sequential therapies are suboptimal as they do not allow for the evolution of resistance, a key ingredient in these therapies. A geometric distribution framework accurately predicts cumulative extinction probabilities, where the per-switch extinction probability rises with switching period. We further derive a heuristic approximation for the extinction probability based on times to fixation of single-resistant mutants. Sensitivity analyses reveal that strong reciprocal CS is required for this strategy to work, and we explore how increasing antibiotic doses and higher mutation rates modulate extinction in a nonmonotonic manner. Finally, we discuss how longer therapies maximize extinction but also cause higher resistance, leading to a Pareto front of optimal switching periods. Our results provide quantitative design principles for in vitro and clinical sequential antibiotic therapies, underscoring the potential of CS-guided regimens to suppress resistance evolution and eradicate infections.",

    "title": "On the Geographic Spread of Chikungunya between Brazil and Florida: A Multi-patch Model with Time Delay",
    "abstract": "Chikungunya (CHIK) is a viral disease transmitted to humans through the bites of {\\it Aedes} mosquitoes infected with the chikungunya virus (CHIKV). CHIKV has been imported annually to Florida in the last decade due to Miami's crucial location as a hub for international travel, particularly from Central and South America including Brazil, where CHIK is endemic. This work addresses to the geographic spread of CHIK, incorporating factors such as human movement, temperature dependency, as well as vertical transmission, and incubation periods, for different patches. Central to the model is the integration of a multi-patch framework, and in the numerical analysis it is considered human movement between endemic Brazilian states and Florida. We establish crucial correlations between the mosquito reproduction number $\\mathcal{R}_{m}$ and the disease reproduction number $\\mathcal{R}_{0}$ with the disease dynamics in a multi-patch environment, encompassing not only a numerical analysis but also from a theoretical perspective. Through numerical simulations, validated with real population and temperature data, it is possible to understand the disease dynamics under many different scenarios and make future projections, offering insights for potential effective control strategies, as well as addressing the timing for these strategies to be adopted.",

    "abstract": "We study a bi-virus susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) epidemic model in which individuals are either susceptible or infected with one of two virus strains, and consider mutation-driven transitions between strains. The general case of bi-directional mutation is first analyzed, where we characterize the disease-free equilibrium and establish its global asymptotic stability, as well as the existence, uniqueness, and stability of an endemic equilibrium. We then present a game-theoretic framework where susceptible individuals strategically choose whether to adopt protection or remain unprotected, to maximize their instantaneous payoffs. We derive Nash strategies under bi-directional mutation, and subsequently consider the special case of unidirectional mutation. In the latter case, we show that coexistence of both strains is impossible when mutation occurs from the strain with lower reproduction number and transmission rate to the other strain. Furthermore, we fully characterize the stationary Nash equilibrium (SNE) in the setting permitting coexistence, and examine how mutation rates influence protection adoption and infection prevalence at the SNE. Numerical simulations corroborate the analytical results, demonstrating that infection levels decrease monotonically with higher protection adoption, and highlight the impact of mutation rates and protection cost on infection state trajectories.",

    "title": "Parameter Estimation in Recurrent Tumor Evolution with Finite Carrying Capacity",
    "abstract": "In this work, we investigate the population dynamics of tumor cells under therapeutic pressure. Although drug treatment initially induces a reduction in tumor burden, treatment failure frequently occurs over time due to the emergence of drug resistance, ultimately leading to cancer recurrence. To model this process, we employ a two-type branching process with state-dependent growth rates. The model assumes an initial tumor population composed predominantly of drug-sensitive cells, with a small subpopulation of resistant cells. Sensitive cells may acquire resistance through mutation, which is coupled to a change in cellular fitness. Furthermore, the growth rates of resistant cells are modulated by the overall tumor burden. Using stochastic differential equation techniques, we establish a functional law of large numbers for the scaled populations of sensitive cells, resistant cells, and the initial resistant clone. We then define the stochastic recurrence time as the first time the total tumor population regrows to its initial size following treatment. For this recurrence time, as well as for measures of clonal diversity and the size of the largest resistant clone at recurrence, we derive corresponding law of large number limits. These asymptotic results provide a theoretical foundation for constructing statistically consistent estimators for key biological parameters, including the cellular growth rates, the mutation rate, and the initial fraction of resistant cells.",

    "abstract": "Early detection of African swine fever virus (ASFV) is critical to preventing widespread epidemics. However, the effectiveness of within-farm sampling remains to be examined, particularly during the early phase of an outbreak when disease prevalence is low, animals may be asymptomatic, or clinical signs are masked by co-circulating diseases. This study assessed four sampling strategies for detecting ASFV-infected animals in suspected growing pig farms within the first 14 days of the introduction of either a high- or moderate-virulence ASFV strain. Pens were selected using three methods: random sampling, targeted sampling of pens with clinical animals, and informative sampling based on estimated pen infection probabilities. The informative sampling method was further divided into sequential method, which ranked pens by descending viral load probability, and cluster and random method, which selected pens at random from high and low viral load clusters. Each pen-selection method was examined with different sample sizes. We calculated the sensitivity of each approach as the probability of detecting at least one ASFV-positive pig per farm. Results showed that sampling 30 pens with one pig per pen using the target and random pen-selection method yielded the highest detection sensitivity, even in the presence of other co-circulating diseases that interfere with the accurate identification of clinical ASFV cases. In contrast, sampling five pens resulted in the lowest sensitivity. These findings provide valuable insights for improving ASFV surveillance strategies in the U.S. and can inform preparedness efforts for other foreign animal diseases.",

Here, we investigate population persistence through a field study and mathematical model of a western toad ({\\textit{Anaxyrus Boreas}} {\\RR(Baird and Girard, 1852)}) population within a highway corridor in the Selkirk Mountains of British Columbia.   The analysis shows traffic levels strongly correlate with toad mortality, with each additional vehicle causing a 3.1\\% $\\pm$ 1.3\\% ($p=0.020$) increase in toad deaths.   Although the current risk of the population becoming threatened or endangered is low, it rises to 50\\% if baseline road mortality increases from 10\\% to 30\\%. Gravid female mortality is higher than the baseline mortality and can increase the probability of endangerment by nearly two-fold at higher baseline mortality levels.   We make the case that a small increase in vehicle traffic resulting from future development and recreational pressures   could destabilize this apparently healthy toad population. The high sensitivity to traffic levels and rapid transition from healthy to endangered raises concerns for similar populations worldwide. Compensatory structures such as amphibian underpasses (toad tunnels) should be given high priority.",

That work showed that time itself is multifractal -- not a universal background dimension, but an observer-dependent geometry. Here we develop the corresponding theory of measurement: showing that a multifractal conception of time not only permits measurement, but grounds it more rigorously in the structure of biology. The tree of life is modeled as the outcome of stochastic, convex branching, and we show how information-theoretic and fractal measures render its multifractal geometry into measurable, observer-relative time intervals. At the core is a dilation equation that expresses relative time elapse between entities as dimensionless ratios. Operational standards such as the SI second remain valid, but our framework makes explicit their lineage-dependence. This framework unifies measurement theory with biological form, preserves full compatibility with established science, and provides a biologically grounded theory of observation. It enables comparative analyses of duration and kinematics across lineages, with predictions that are directly open to experimental validation.",

    "abstract": "We analyze a variant of the Noisy $K$-Branching Random Walk, a population model that evolves according to the following procedure. At each time step, each individual produces a large number of offspring that inherit the fitness of their parents up to independent and identically distributed fluctuations. The next generation consists of a random sample of all the offspring so that the population size remains fixed, where the sampling is made according to a parameterized Gibbs measure of the fitness of the offspring. Our model interpolates between classical models of fitness waves and exhibits a novel phase transition in the propagation of the wave. By employing a stochastic Hopf-Cole transformation, we show that as we increase the population size, the random dynamics of the model can be described by deterministic operations acting on the limiting population densities. We then show that for fitness fluctuations with exponential tails, these operations admit a unique traveling wave solution with local stability. The traveling wave solution undergoes a phase transition when changing selection pressure, revealing a complex interaction between evolution and natural selection.",

    "abstract": "By unifying three foundational principles of modern biology, we develop a mathematical framework to analyze the growing tree of life. Contrary to the static case, where the analogy between phylogenetic trees and the tree that grows in soil is drawn, our framework shows that the living tree of life is analogous to a Cantor dust where each branch is a distinct fractal curve. The system as a whole is therefore multifractal in the sense that it consists of many unique fractals. The three foundational principles for the mathematical framework are that phylogeny is nested, phylogeny is dualistic (i.e., transitive between singularities and populations), and phylogeny is stochastic. Integrating these three principles, we model the dynamic (i.e., living) tree of life as a random iterated function system that generates unique convexly related sequences of branching random variables (visualized in Animation 1). The multifractal nature of this dynamic tree of life implies that, for any two living entities, the time interval from their last common ancestor to the present moment is a distinct fractal curve for each. Thus, the length of a time interval along each distinct branch is unique, so that time is also multifractal and not an ultrametric on the tree of life.",

Crowding is typically represented by volume exclusion, where each lattice site can be occupied by at most one agent and conflicting moves are aborted. This framework enables simulations that yield both population-level spatiotemporal agent density profiles and individual agent trajectories, comparable to experimental cell-tracking data. Previous continuum models for tagged-agent trajectories captured trajectory information only, and overlooked any measure of variability. This is an important limitation since trajectory data is inherently variable. To address this limitation, here we derive partial differential equations for the probability density function of tagged-agent trajectories. This continuum description has a clear physical interpretation, agrees well with distributional data from stochastic simulations, reveals the role of stochasticity in different contexts, and generalises to multiple subpopulations of distinct agents.",

    "abstract": "In network-based SIS models of infectious disease transmission, infection can only occur between directly connected individuals. This constraint naturally gives rise to spatial correlations between the states of neighboring nodes, as the infection status of connected individuals becomes interdependent. Although mean-field approximations are commonly invoked to simplify disease forecasting on networks, they fail to account for these correlations by assuming that infectious individuals are well-mixed within a population, leading to inaccurate predictions of infection numbers over time. As such, the development of mathematical frameworks that account for spatially correlated infections is of great interest, as they offer a compromise between accurate disease forecasting and analytic tractability. Here, we use existing corrections to mean-field theory on the regular lattice to construct a more general framework for equivalent corrections on regular random graph topologies. We derive and simulate a system of ordinary differential equations for the time evolution of the spatial correlation function at various geodesic distances on random networks, and use solutions to this hierarchy of ordinary differential equations to predict the global infection density as a function of time, finding good agreement with corresponding numerical simulations. Our results constitute a substantial development on existing corrections to mean-field theory for infectious individuals in SIS processes and provide an in-depth characterization of how structural randomness in networks affects the dynamical trajectories of infectious diseases on networks.",

The emergence of such species clusters can be captured by the interplay between neutral and niche theories. Based on the generalized Lotka-Volterra model of competition, we propose a minimal model for ecological communities in which the steady states contain self-organized clusters. In this model, species compete only with their neighbors in niche space through a common interaction strength. Unlike many previous theories, this model does not rely on random heterogeneity in interactions. By varying only the interaction strength, we find an exponentially large set of cluster patterns with different sizes and combinations. There are sharp phase transitions into the formation of clusters. There are also multiple phase transitions between different sets of possible cluster patterns, many of which accumulate near a small number of critical points. We analyze such a phase structure using both numerical and analytical methods. In addition, the special case with only nearest neighbor interactions is exactly solvable using the method of transfer matrices from statistical mechanics. We analyze the critical behavior of these systems and make comparisons with existing lattice models.",

    "abstract": "In recent decades, European forests have faced an increased incidence of fire disturbances. This phenomenon is likely to persist, given the rising frequency of extreme events expected in the future. Estimating canopy recovery time after disturbance serves as a critical assessment for understanding forest resilience, which can ultimately help determine the ability of forests to regain their capacity to provide essential ecosystem services. This study estimated fire severity and post-disturbance recovery in European forests using a remote sensing--based time series approach. MODIS Leaf Area Index (LAI) time series data were used to track the evolution of vegetation cover over burned areas from 2001 to 2024. Fire severity was defined relative to pre-disturbance conditions by comparing vegetation status before and after fire events. Recovery intervals were determined from temporal evolution of vegetation greening as the duration required to reach the pre-disturbance LAI baseline. Furthermore, this study analyzed the severity and recovery indicators in relation to forest species diversity and landscape heterogeneity metrics across Europe, offering valuable insights into the spatial variability of forest response dynamics across diverse forest ecosystems across Europe. Results revealed a consistent pattern across vegetation cover types: higher forest species diversity and greater landscape shape complexity were associated with lower fire severity and, notably, shorter recovery times following fire disturbance.",

This formulation provides a realistic mathematical framework for modeling public health responses beyond classical uncontrolled epidemic models. The control design is integrated into the model via an optimal control framework, solved numerically using the Forward Backward Sweep method, enabling the exploration of intervention strategies on epidemic dynamics, including infection prevalence, hospitalization burden, and the effective reproduction number. To assess the robustness of these strategies under uncertainty, we employ Polynomial Chaos Expansion combined with Sobol sensitivity indices, quantifying the influence of key epidemiological parameters (transmission, recovery, hospitalization rates) on model outcomes. Numerical simulations, calibrated to Djiboutian COVID 19 data, show that combined preventive and therapeutic interventions substantially mitigate epidemic burden, though their effectiveness depends critically on transmission related uncertainties. The originality of this work lies in combining optimal control theory with global sensitivity analysis, thus bridging numerical methods, optimization, and epidemic modeling. This integrated approach offers a general mathematical framework for designing and evaluating control strategies in infectious disease outbreaks, with applications to low resource settings and beyond.",

In difference to the typical case we show the interaction topology and system dynamics combine to produce power law abundance distributions in a critical region of the phase diagram, identifiable as a Griffiths phase. We find asymptotic expressions for the fixed point solution in this region, and establish the boundary of this region as when topology alone determines the abundance distribution.

    "abstract": "West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne virus of the genus Flaviviridae circulating between mosquitoes and birds, while humans, equids, and other mammals are dead-end hosts. Several preventive measures are recommended to reduce the WNV burden among different hosts. In this work, we develop a mathematical framework for evaluating the theoretical effectiveness of various WNV control methods in Germany. We consider mosquito reduction methods such as the physical removal and destruction of potential mosquito breeding sites, the use of larvicides, and the use of adulticides. We also evaluate the usage of personal protective equipment (PPE) that aims to reduce human-mosquito contact. Adopting PPEs may not happen instantly due to different perceptions, social influence, and the perceived inconvenience and/or frustration that come with using PPEs. Thus, we model a dynamic adoption of PPEs by considering the perceived risk of infection, perceived inconvenience of using PPEs, and the imitation dynamics due to social influence. Furthermore, the model captures vaccination of equids. We formulate and study an optimal control problem, where mosquito controls are temperature-dependent and the decision to start or stop applying the control methods is influenced by the changes in temperature. The optimal control model supports the development and seasonal timing of cost-effective mosquito control methods. For example, results from the optimal control study show that mosquito control efforts in Germany should be initiated during early spring and stopped at the end of June or early July, during the first year of control, to avoid overuse and unnecessary costs. Finally, we developed a Shiny app that allows users to test how different combinations of interventions could reduce WNV cases.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies on indirect reciprocity with private assessment on complete graphs suggest the possibility that one can continuously modulate the degree of segregation by controlling how to judge a good person helping a bad one. A well-known social norm called L6 judges it as bad, which eventually segregates the society into two antagonistic clusters, but if it is judged as good, the system reaches paradise where everyone likes each other. In this work, we numerically study this transition between segregation and paradise in two different settings. Firstly, in a uniform population of size $N$ where everyone regards such a donor as good with probability $p$ and bad with $1-p$, we observe paradise when $Np$ is sufficiently greater than $O(1)$. In contrast, in a heterogeneous setting where only $k$ individuals judge such a donor as good, the size difference of the clusters increases almost linearly as $k$ increases, so paradise can only be reached as $k \\to N$ in a large population. Therefore, when an urgent change is needed to overcome the segregation due to L6, a small change in each and every individual's behavior is more efficient than a radical change in a fraction of the population.",

    "title": "The role of viral dynamics and infectivity in models of oncolytic virotherapy for tumours with different motility",
    "abstract": "The use of ad-hoc engineered viruses in the fight against tumours is one of the greatest ideas in cancer therapeutics within the last three decades. Together with other strategies such as immunotherapies, nanoparticles and adjunct therapies, the use of viral vectors in clinical trials and in the clinics has been and is still widely studied and pursued. The ability of those vectors to infiltrate and infect tumours represents one of the key attributes that regulates the success of such a strategy. Although some remarkable successes have been obtained, it is still not entirely clear how to achieve reliable protocols that can be routinely employed with confidence on a significant range of tumours. In this work, we thus concentrate on the study of different mathematical descriptions of virotherapy with the aim of better understanding the role of viral infectivity and viral dynamics in positive therapeutic outcomes. In particular, we compare probabilistic, individual approaches with continuous, spatially inhomogeneous models and investigate the importance of different tumour motility and different mathematical representations of viral infectivity. These formulations also allow us to arrive at better analytical characterisation of how waves of viral infections arise and propagate in tumours, providing interesting insights into therapy dynamics. Similarly to previous studies, oscillatory behaviours, stochasticity and cancers' diffusivities are all central to the eradication or the escape of tumours under virotherapy. Here, though, our results also show that the ability of viruses to infect tumours seems, in certain cases, more important to a final positive outcome than tumours' motility or even reproducibility. This could hopefully represent a first step into better insights into viral dynamics that may help clinicians to achieve consistently better outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Ecological interactions can dramatically alter evolutionary outcomes in complex communities. Yet, the classic theoretical results of population genetics (e.g., Kimura's fixation formula) largely ignore ecological effects. Here, we address this shortcoming by using dynamical mean-field theory to integrate ecology into classical population genetics models. We show that ecological interactions between parents and mutants result in frequency-dependent selection and can be characterized by a single emergent parameter that measures the strength of ecological feedbacks. We derive an explicit analytic expression for the fixation probability that generalizes Kimura's famous result and analyze it in various ecological and evolutionary limits. We find that ecological interactions suppress fixation probabilities for moderately beneficial mutants when compared to Kimura's predictions, with the strength of suppression increasing with larger effective population sizes, greater selective differences between parent and mutant, and for ecosystems with a large number of \"open niches\" (i.e., ecosystems well below the packing bound). Frequency-dependent selection also gives rise to prolonged parent-mutant coexistence in complex communities, a phenomenon absent in classical population genetics. Our study establishes a framework for integrating ecological interactions into population genetics models and helps illuminate how ecology can affect evolutionary outcomes.",

    "abstract": "The host's odor serves as a critical biological tracking signal in the host-seeking process of mosquitoes, and its heterogeneity significantly influences the transmission of mosquito-borne diseases. In this study, we propose a mosquito-borne disease model incorporating odor-baited traps to examine the impact of odor on disease transmission. Following recent experimental evidence, we also assume that infected humans are more attractive than susceptible or recovered ones.   The value of the basic reproduction number, $R_0$, depends on the attractiveness of traps, adjusted relative to infected individuals; the dependence on the relative attractiveness of susceptibles is non-monotone, suggesting that there exists an optimal mosquito preference that maximizes disease transmission. When $R_0>1$, there exists an endemic equilibrium which, under certain conditions, is proved to be globally stable. An endemic equilibrium may also exist when $R_0 < 1$, due to a backward bifurcation occurring when infected humans incur significant mortality. The phenomenon of backward bifurcation is reduced when odor-baited traps are more abundant.   Analytical results and simulations show that deploying traps and enhancing their lethality for mosquitoes can help reduce disease prevalence and the risk of an outbreak. However, the attenuation of odor in highly attractive traps may lead to a rebound in the epidemic, especially when the traps gradually lose their attractiveness compared to susceptible hosts.",

    "abstract": "We consider a phenotype-structured reaction-diffusion model of avascular glioma growth. The model describes the interaction dynamics between tumour cells and oxygen, and takes into account anisotropic cell movement and oxygen diffusion related to structural anisotropy of the brain's extracellular environment. In this model, phenotypic heterogeneity of tumour cells is captured by a continuous phenotype-structuring variable, the value of which evolves due to phenotypic changes. We first analyse a one-dimensional version of the model and formally show, through a Hopf-Cole transformation, that it admits, in appropriate asymptotic regimes, phenotypically heterogeneous travelling wave solutions, wherein the locally prevailing cell phenotype varies across the wave due to the presence of oxygen gradients. This provides a mathematical formalisation for the emergence of intratumour phenotypic heterogeneity driven by differences in oxygen availability across the tumour. We then report on the results of both 1D simulations, which corroborate the results of formal asymptotic analyses, and 2D simulations, which also demonstrate the impact of anisotropy in cell movement and oxygen diffusion on tumour growth and on the phenotypic composition of the tumour edge. These results are complemented with additional results of 3D simulations, which are carried out on the geometry of the brain by using a hybrid finite difference-finite element method and integrating patient-specific magnetic resonance imaging data with diffusion tensor imaging data.",

In this paper, we explore the role of random and directed motion on spatial pattern formation and the payoff achieved by populations in both stochastic and deterministic models of spatial populations who engage in social interactions following a hawk-dove game. For the case of purely diffusive motion, both a stochastic spatial model and a partial differential equation model show that Turing patterns can emerge when hawks have a greater movement rate than doves, and in both models hawks and doves see an increase in population size and average payoff as hawk mobility increases. For the case of the payoff-driven motion, the stochastic model shows an overall decrease in population size and average payoff, but the PDE model displays more subtle behavior in this setting and will depend on the relative diffusivities of the two strategies. The PDE model also displays a biologically infeasible short-wave instability in the case of payoff-driven motion and equal diffusivities, indicating that we need to be careful about the mathematical properties of PDE models with payoff-driven directed motion and indicating potential use for nonlocal PDE models for spatial patterns in evolutionary games with directed motion.",

We solve this by treating multinomial updates as independent square-root diffusions of zero drift, yielding a closed-form law for the first-extinction time. We prove that the mean coincides exactly with the Wright-Fisher result of Baxter et al., thereby replacing exponential-cost evaluations with a linear-cost expression, and we validate this result through extensive simulations. Finally, we demonstrate predictive power for model collapse in a simple self-training setup: the onset of collapse coincides with the resampling-driven first-extinction time computed from the model's initial stationary distribution. These results hint to a unified view of resampling extinction dynamics.",

However, even when these trajectories are decanalized by an environmental perturbation outside of the range of conditions to which they are robust, they often produce phenotypes similar to known mutants called phenocopies. This correspondence between the effect of environmental and genetic perturbations has received little theoretical attention. Here, we study an abstract regulatory model which is evolved to follow a specific trajectory. We then study the effect of both small and large perturbations to the trajectory both by changing parameters and by perturbing the state in a timed manner. We find, surprisingly, that the phenomenon of phenocopying emerges in evolved trajectories even though the alternative trajectories are not selected for. Our results suggest that evolution simplifies the structure of high-dimensional phenotypic landscapes which can simultaneously show robustness and phenocopying.",

Furthermore, virus particles are exchanged between hosts at reinfection events and hosts are replaced by primary infected hosts when they die. We determine the asymptotic type distribution observed in a single host in the limit of large host and virus populations under asymptotic rate assumptions by tracing back the ancestry of the sample. The proposed model may serve as a null model for the evolution of virus populations that are capable of persistence and can be used to estimate the strengths of different evolutionary forces driving genetic diversity, see also [4].",

    "abstract": "Biofilm infections on medical implants are difficult to eradicate because insufficient nutrient availability promotes antibiotic-tolerant persister cells that survive treatment and reseed growth. Existing mathematical models usually omit nutrient-dependent phenotypic switching between proliferative and persister states. Without this mechanism, models cannot capture how environmental conditions control the balance between active growth and dormancy, which is central to biofilm persistence. We present a continuum model that couples nutrient transport with the dynamics of proliferative bacteria, persisters, dead cells, and extracellular polymeric substances. The switching rates between proliferative and persister phenotypes depend on local nutrient concentration through two thresholds, enabling adaptation across nutrient-poor, intermediate, and nutrient-rich regimes. Simulations show that nutrient limitation produces a high and sustained proportion of persister cells even when biomass is reduced, whereas nutrient-rich conditions support reversion to proliferative growth and lead to greater biomass. The model also predicts that persister populations peak at times that vary with nutrient availability, and these peaks coincide with turning points in biofilm growth, identifying critical intervention windows. By directly linking nutrient availability to phenotypic switching, our model reveals mechanisms of biofilm persistence that earlier models could not capture, and it points toward strategies that target nutrient-driven adaptation as a means to improve the control of implant-associated infections.",

    "abstract": "Cooperation is fundamental to the functioning of biological and social systems in both human and animal populations, with the structure of interactions playing a crucial role. Previous studies have used networks to describe interactions and explore the evolution of cooperation, but with limited transposability to social settings due to biologically relevant assumptions. Exogenous processes -- that affect the individual and are not derived from social interactions -- even if unbiased, have a role in supporting cooperation over defection, and this role has been largely overlooked in the context of network-based interactions. Here, we show that selection can favor either cooperation or defection depending on the frequency of exogenous, even if neutral, processes in any population structure. Our framework allows for deriving analytically the conditions for favoring a specific behavior in any network structure strongly affected by non-social environments (frequent exogenous forcing, FEF), which contrasts with previous computationally prohibitive methods. Our results demonstrate that the requirements for favoring cooperation under FEF do not match those in the rare-mutation limit, establishing that underlying neutral processes can be considered a mechanism for cooperation. We reveal that, under FEF, populations are less cooperative, and network heterogeneity can provide an advantage only if targeting specific network properties, clarifying seemingly contradictory experimental results and evolutionary predictions. While focused on cooperation, our assumptions generalize to any decision-making process involving a choice between alternative options. Our framework is particularly applicable to non-homogeneous human populations, offering a new perspective on cooperation science in the context of cultural evolution, where neutral and biased processes within structured interactions are abundant.",

    "abstract": "Many biological populations exhibit diversity in their strategy for survival and reproduction in a given environment, and microbes are an example. We explore the fate of different strategies under sustained environmental change by considering a mathematical model for a large population of asexual organisms. Fitness is a bimodal function of a quantitative trait, with two local optima, separated by a local minimum, i.e., a mixture of stabilising and disruptive selection. The optima represent two locally `best' trait values. We consider regimes where, when the environment is unchanging, the equilibrium distribution of the trait is bimodal. A bimodal trait distribution generally requires, for its existence, mutational coupling between the two peaks, and it indicates two coexisting clones with distinct survival and reproduction strategies. When subject to persistent environmental change, the population adapts by utilising mutations that allow it to track the changing environment. The faster the rate of change of the environment, the larger the effect of the mutations that are utilised. Under persistent environmental change, the distribution of trait values takes two different forms. At low rates of change, the distribution remains bimodal. At higher rates, the distribution becomes unimodal. This loss of a clone/biodiversity is driven by a novel mechanism where environmental change decouples a class of mutations.",

    "abstract": "In response to increasing threats to biodiversity, conservation objectives have been set at national and international level, with the aim of halting biodiversity decline by reducing direct anthropogenic pressures on species. However, the potential effects of conservation policies derived from these objectives on common species remain rarely studied. Common species are often not the primary species targeted by conservation measures and can be distributed across a wide range of habitats that may be affected differently by these measures. We analyse the effect of a range of pressures related to climate, land use and land use intensity, on 263 common bird and 144 common butterfly species from more than 20,000 sites between 2000 and 2021 across 26 European countries. We use land-use and land-use-intensity change scenarios produced previously using the IPBES Nature Futures Framework to support the achievement of conservation objectives, as well as climate change scenarios in order to project the future of biodiversity pressures in Europe up to 2050. To project the future of common biodiversity in these scenarios, we translate these pressure changes into expected variations of abundances for all common bird and butterfly species, as well as for the multi-species indicators used to monitor common biodiversity status in Europe. The projected trends are improved, while still declining, for birds in particular farmland species under the scenarios that meet the conservation objectives, with few effects on butterflies. No scenario shows a stop or a reversal in the decline in abundance of bird and butterfly species that are currently common, on the time scale considered. Our results therefore call into question the fate of common biodiversity under the current conservation policies and the need for other anticipatory frameworks that do not implicitly require a growing need for natural resources.",

    "abstract": "To ensure faithful information transmission, cells utilize nonequilibrium drives to reduce errors. Kinetic proofreading is a classic mechanism known to sharpen ligand discrimination by T lymphocytes. It remains an open question whether the adaptive immune system relies solely on kinetic proofreading to boost fidelity. Here, we suggest an alternative: an enhanced form of mechanical proofreading (MPR) in which adaptive force exertion via dynamic cell-cell contact allows faithful selection of high-affinity B lymphocytes. Using a minimal model validated with experiment, we show that adaptive MPR, characterized by mechanical feedback between force generation and contact formation, enables robust discrimination of receptor quality regardless of ligand quantity. Although MPR generically balances the tradeoffs between speed and fidelity, a negative scaling of contact duration with ligand abundance indicates the presence of feedback. Due to its ability to modulate interactions of distinct ligands that share load at membrane contacts, adaptive MPR can be harnessed to mitigate autoimmunity or enhance multivalent vaccines. Overall, this work suggests a generalization of the proofreading mechanism to encompass cellular designs that act across scales to enable competing functionalities.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we proposed new predator-prey models that take into account memory and kicks. Memory is understood as the dependence of current behavior on the history of past behavior. The equations of these proposed models are generalizations of the Lotka-Volterra and Kolmogorov equations by using the Caputo fractional derivative of non-integer order and periodic kicks. This fractional derivative allows us to take into account memory with power-law fading. The periodic kicks, which are described by Dirac delta-functions, take into account short duration of interaction between predators and prey. For the proposed equations, which are fractional differential equations with kicks, we obtain exact solutions that describe behaviors of predator and prey with power-law fading memory. Using these exact solutions, we derive, without using any approximations, new discrete maps with memory that represent the proposed predator-prey models with memory.",

    "title": "Stochastic Dynamics of Urban Predator-Prey Systems: Integrating Human Disturbance and Functional Responses",
    "abstract": "Urban ecosystems exhibit complex predator-prey dynamics increasingly disrupted by anthropogenic disturbances (e.g., noise, habitat fragmentation). Classical Lotka-Volterra (LV) models fail to capture these human-induced stressors, and integrated frameworks incorporating functional responses, stochasticity, and spatial dynamics remain scarce. We develop a comprehensive stochastic model to quantify how human disturbance reshapes predator-prey interactions in urban landscapes, using rat-cat systems as a case study. Our framework extends the LV model to incorporate: (i) human disturbance as an external mortality factor, (ii) Holling Type III functional responses to model predation saturation and prey refugia, (iii) multiplicative noise and periodic forcing to capture stochastic disturbance regimes, and (iv) spatial diffusion across fragmented habitats. We non-dimensionalize the system to generalize dynamics and analyze stability, bifurcations, and noise-induced transitions. Numerical simulations (MATLAB) reveal three key outcomes: (1) Human disturbance disrupts classical oscillations, inducing quasi-periodic cycles and elevating extinction risks; (2) Stochasticity lowers collapse thresholds by 25% compared to deterministic predictions; (3) Spatial diffusion drives pattern formation (e.g., disturbance shadows, prey hotspots) through habitat coupling. Results highlight the extreme vulnerability of urban wildlife to anthropogenic pressures, demonstrating how disturbance intensity governs system stability. The model provides a predictive framework for conservation strategies, emphasizing refuge enhancement and phased interventions synchronized with population cycles.",

    "abstract": "Navigation through narrow passages during colony relocation by the tandem-running ants, $\\textit{Diacamma}$ $\\textit{indicum}$, is a tour de force of biological traffic coordination. Even on one-lane paths, the ants tactfully manage a bidirectional flow: Informed individuals (termed leaders) guide nest-mates (termed followers) from a suboptimal nest to a new optimal nest, and then return to recruit additional followers. We propose that encounters between the ants moving in opposite directions can be modelled within the framework of game theory leading to an understanding of the mechanism behind observed behaviours. Our experiments reveal that, upon encountering a tandem pair (a leader and its follower) on a narrow path, the returning leader reverses her direction and proceeds toward the new nest again as if she becomes the leader guiding a follower. This observed behaviour is consistent with game-theoretic predictions, provided the assumption of perfect rationality is relaxed in favour of bounded rationality -- specifically, procedural rationality. In other words, the experimental outcomes are consistent with sampling equilibrium but not with Nash equilibrium. Our work, which strives to induct the essence of behavioural game theory into the world of ants, is first ever report of realizing sampling equilibrium in scenarios not involving human players.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotic resistance presents a growing global health threat by diminishing the effectiveness of treatments and allowing once-manageable bacterial infections to persist. This study develops and analyzes an optimization-based mathematical model to investigate the impact of varying antibiotic dosages on bacterial resistance, incorporating the role of the immune system. Additionally, to capture the effects of over and underdosing, a floor function is newly introduced into the model as a switch function. The model is examined both analytically and numerically. As part of the analytical solution, the validity of the model through the existence and uniqueness theorem, stability at the equilibrium points, and characteristics of equilibrium points in relation to state variables have been investigated. Numerical simulations, performed using the Runge Kutta 4th order method, reveal that while antibiotics effectively reduce sensitive bacteria, they simultaneously increase resistant strains and suppress immune cell levels. The results also demonstrate that underdosing antibiotics increases the risk of resistance through bacterial mutation, while overdosing weakens the immune system by disrupting beneficial microbes. These findings emphasize that improper dosing whether below or above the prescribed level can accelerate the development of antibiotic resistance, underscoring the need for carefully regulated treatment strategies that preserve both antimicrobial effectiveness and immune system integrity.",

    "abstract": "Recently, a new vector encoding, Ordered Leaf Attachment (OLA), was introduced that represents $n$-leaf phylogenetic trees as $n-1$ length integer vectors by recording the placement location of each leaf. Both encoding and decoding of trees run in linear time and depend on a fixed ordering of the leaves. Here, we investigate the connection between OLA vectors and the maximum acyclic agreement forest (MAAF) problem. A MAAF represents an optimal breakdown of $k$ trees into reticulation-free subtrees, with the roots of these subtrees representing reticulation events. We introduce a corrected OLA distance index over OLA vectors of $k$ trees, which is easily computable in linear time. We prove that the corrected OLA distance corresponds to the size of a MAAF, given an optimal leaf ordering that minimizes that distance. Additionally, a MAAF can be easily reconstructed from optimal OLA vectors. We expand these results to multifurcated trees: we introduce an $O(kn \\cdot m\\log m)$ algorithm that optimally resolves a set of multifurcated trees given a leaf-ordering, where $m$ is the size of a largest multifurcation, and show that trees resolved via this algorithm also minimize the size of a MAAF. These results suggest a new approach to fast computation of phylogenetic networks and identification of reticulation events via random permutations of leaves. Additionally, in the case of microbial evolution, a natural ordering of leaves is often given by the sample collection date, which means that under mild assumptions, reticulation events can be identified in polynomial time on such datasets.",

    "title": "A Unified and Predictive Measure of Functional Diversity",
    "abstract": "Despite the critical role of functional diversity (FD) in understanding ecological systems and processes, its robust quantification remains a significant challenge. A long-held view in the field is that it is not possible to capture its three facets -- functional richness, functional divergence, and functional evenness -- in a single index. This perspective has prompted recent proposals for FD measurement to use three separate indices, one for each aspect. Here, we challenge this paradigm by demonstrating that the probability-weighted Vendi Score (pVS), first introduced by Friedman and Dieng (2023), can serve as a powerful functional diversity index that can capture its three facets. We adapt pVS to functional ecology by defining it as the exponential of the Rényi entropy of the eigenvalues of the abundance-weighted trait similarity matrix. This formulation allows pVS to be applicable at any biological level. It can be defined at the species level, at which most existing FD metrics are defined, and at the individual level to naturally incorporate intraspecific trait variation (ITV) when detailed data are available. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate the robustness of pVS. We first mathematically prove it satisfies several essential desiderata for FD metrics, including invariance to functional redundancy, set monotonicity, distance monotonicity, and concavity. We then show that pVS consistently exhibits the expected ground-truth behavior on simulated ecosystem scenarios under which many FD metrics fail. By integrating abundances and trait similarities within a single, theoretically sound framework, pVS provides a generally applicable index for ecology.",

    "abstract": "The evolutionary biology of aging is fundamental to understanding the mechanisms of aging and how to develop anti-aging treatments. Thus far most evolutionary theory concerns the genetics of aging with limited physiological integration. Here we present an intuitive evolutionary framework built on how physiology is regulated and how this regulation itself is then predicted to age. Life has evolved to secure reproduction and avoid system failure in early life, and it is the physiological regulation that evolves in response to those early life selection pressures that leads to the emergence of aging. Importantly, asymmetrical regulation of physiology will evolve as the Darwinian fitness costs of loss of regulation will not be symmetrical. When asymmetrical regulatory systems break during aging, they cause physiological function to drift towards the physiological range where costs of dysregulation are lowest, rendering aging directional. Our model explains many puzzling aspects of the biology of aging. These include why aging appears (but is not) programmed, why aging is gradual yet heterogeneous, why cellular and hormonal signaling are closely related to aging, the compensation law of mortality, why trade-offs between reproduction and aging remain elusive, why longer-lived organisms show more signs of aging during their natural lifespans, and why longer-lived organisms can be less responsive to treatments of aging that work well in short-lived organisms. We provide predictions of our theory that are empirically testable. By incorporating physiological regulation into evolutionary models of aging, we provide a novel perspective to guide empirical research in this still growing field.",

    "abstract": "Plants come with sophisticated strategies to survive within a highly competing environment. In addition, they need to resist frequent attacks from a variety of herbivores acting alone, in small groups, or in swarms. Since the amount of energy a plant might invest in defense and reproduction is limited, a complex optimization problem emerges. In a shared habitat, plants fight herbivores by shape and camouflage, by the release of specific toxins, or by attracting predators of herbivores. Furthermore, plants alert their surrounding field by signaling substances in the event of an assault. Transported by air or through a network of roots, signaling substances reach neighbors to trigger their defense. The offsprings of a plant commonly grow within a certain distance to benefit from symbiotic protection. We introduce a grid-based visual simulation software for detailed configuration and subsequent processing of the behavior of the resulting system in time and space. In terms of solution to a computational optimization problem inspired by nature, settings with low energy need and long life able to cope with different patterns of attack can be figured out and analyzed. Applications include novel techniques for efficient construction and secure operation of sensor networks.",

Intercropping, the simultaneous or sequential cultivation of multiple crops, has been proposed as a viable strategy to enhance beneficial insect services and suppress pests, yet global evidence regarding optimal spatiotemporal intercropping configurations remains fragmented. Here, we synthesize results from 7,584 field experiments spanning six continents and 22 Koppen climate regions, evaluating effects of spatial (row, strip, mixed, agroforestry) and temporal (additive, replacement, relay) intercropping configuations on beneficial insect (predators, parasitoids, pollinators) abundance and pest suppression using the Management Efficiency Ratio (MER; log ratio of abundance in intercropping versus monoculture). Relay intercropping, characterized by temporally staggered planting, emerged as the universally optimal temporal configuration, substantially increasing predator (MER = 0.473) and parasitoid populations (MER = 0.512) and effectively suppressing pests (MER = -0.611) globally. At regional scales, identical spatiotemporal configurations simultaneously optimized beneficial insect predator abundance and pest suppression in 57% of regions, while other regions required distinct, insect-specific approaches. Our findings highlight relay intercropping as a globally generalizable solution, but underscore regional variation that calls for targeted policies to simultaneously secure food production and biodiversity conservation.",

    "abstract": "Infectious pathogens often propagate by superspreading, which focusses onward transmission on disproportionately few infected individuals. At the same time, infector-infectee pairs tend to have more similar transmission potentials than expected by chance, as risk factors assort among individuals who frequently interact. A key problem for infectious disease epidemiology, and in the dynamics of complex systems, is to understand how structured variation in individual transmission will scale to impact epidemic dynamics. Here we introduce a framework that reveals how population structure shapes epidemic thresholds, through autocorrelation of individual reproductive numbers along chains of transmission. We show that chains of superspreading can sustain epidemics even when the average transmission rate in the host population is below one, and derive a mathematical threshold beyond which correlated superspreading allows epidemics in otherwise subcritical systems. Empirical analysis of 47 transmission trees for 13 human pathogens indicate self-organizing bursts of superspreading are common and that many trees are near the critical boundary. Vaccination campaigns that proceed up assortative hierarchies of transmission are predicted to sustain the force of infection until herd immunity is reached, providing a mechanistic basis for threshold dynamics observed in real-world settings. Conversely, modulating correlations in transmission, rather than mean or variance, could enable cities and other complex systems to develop immune-like capacities that suppress contagion while preserving core functions.",

We uncover a shared underlying structure that helps explain how function diversity evolves in empirical observations, such as prokaryotic proteomes, U.S. federal agencies, and urban economies. We show that real systems are often best represented as having non-Zipfian rank-frequency distributions, driven by sublinear preferential attachment, whilst still maintaining power-law scaling in their abundance distributions. Furthermore, our analytics explain five distinct phases of the organization of functional elements across complex systems. The model integrates empirical findings regarding the logarithmic growth of diversity in cities and the self-similarity of their rank-frequency distributions. Self-similarity previously observed in the rank-frequency distributions of cities is not observed in cells and federal agencies -- however, under a rescaling relative to the total diversity, all systems admit self-similar structures predicted by our theory.",

This article examines the feasibility and implications of autonomous AI reporting of normal CXRs. Key issues include defining normal, ensuring generalisability across populations, and managing the sensitivity-specificity trade-off. It also addresses legal and regulatory challenges, such as compliance with IR(ME)R and GDPR, and the lack accountability frameworks for errors. Further considerations include the impact on radiologists practice, the need for robust post-market surveillance, and incorporation of patient perspectives.

    "abstract": "Epidemic control frequently relies on adjusting interventions based on prevalence. But designing such policies is a highly non-trivial problem due to uncertain intervention effects, costs and the difficulty of quantifying key transmission mechanisms and parameters. Here, using exact mathematical and computational methods, we reveal a fundamental limit in epidemic control in that prevalence feedback policies are outperformed by a single optimally chosen constant control level. Specifically, we find no incentive to use prevalence based control under a wide class of cost functions that depend arbitrarily on interventions and scale with infections. We also identify regimes where prevalence feedback is beneficial. Our results challenge the current understanding that prevalence based interventions are required for epidemic control and suggest that, for many classes of epidemics, interventions should not be varied unless the epidemic is near the herd immunity threshold.",

    "abstract": "How regional heterogeneity in social and cultural processes drive--and respond to--climate dynamics is little studied. Here we present a coupled social-climate model stratified across five world regions and parameterized with geophysical, economic and social survey data. We find that support for mitigation evolves in a highly variable fashion across regions, according to socio-economics, climate vulnerability, and feedback from changing temperatures. Social learning and social norms can amplify existing sentiment about mitigation, leading to better or worse global warming outcomes depending on the region. Moreover, mitigation in one region, as mediated by temperature dynamics, can influence other regions to act, or just sit back, thus driving cross-regional heterogeneity in mitigation opinions. The peak temperature anomaly varies by several degrees Celsius depending on how these interactions unfold. Our model exemplifies a framework for studying how global geophysical processes interact with population-scale concerns to determine future sustainability outcomes.",

We propose a four-compartment dynamical model that incorporates antigen accumulation and immune escape mutations. Bifurcation analysis reveals bistability between immune surveillance and immune escape states, providing a mechanistic explanation for heterogeneous immune outcomes during tumor progression. In the multistable regime, the stable manifold of a saddle point partitions the state space into distinct basins of attraction, determining the long-term fate of the system. We further analyze how stochastic fluctuations in the tumor microenvironment perturb these separatrices, potentially triggering irreversible state transitions. By characterizing the critical noise intensity and estimating the tipping time, we establish a mathematical framework for assessing noise-induced transitions. The model further predicts that increasing tumor cell death can improve system resilience to stochastic perturbations, whereas stronger immune pressure may facilitate immune escape-highlighting the nonlinear and non-monotonic nature of tumor-immune dynamics.",

    "title": "A High-Order Cumulant Extension of Quasi-Linkage Equilibrium",
    "abstract": "A central question in evolutionary biology is how to quantitatively understand the dynamics of genetically diverse populations. Modeling the genotype distribution is challenging, as it ultimately requires tracking all correlations (or cumulants) among alleles at different loci. The quasi-linkage equilibrium (QLE) approximation simplifies this by assuming that correlations between alleles at different loci are weak -- i.e., low linkage disequilibrium -- allowing their dynamics to be modeled perturbatively. However, QLE breaks down under strong selection, significant epistatic interactions, or weak recombination. We extend the multilocus QLE framework to allow cumulants up to order $K$ to evolve dynamically, while higher-order cumulants ($>K$) are assumed to equilibrate rapidly. This extended QLE (exQLE) framework yields a general equation of motion for cumulants up to order $K$, which parallels the standard QLE dynamics (recovered when $K = 1$). In this formulation, cumulant dynamics are driven by the gradient of average fitness, mediated by a geometrically interpretable matrix that stems from competition among genotypes. Our analysis shows that the exQLE with $K=2$ accurately captures cumulant dynamics even when the fitness function includes higher-order (e.g., third- or fourth-order) epistatic interactions, capabilities that standard QLE lacks. We also applied the exQLE framework to infer fitness parameters from temporal sequence data. Overall, exQLE provides a systematic and interpretable approximation scheme, leveraging analytical cumulant dynamics and reducing complexity by progressively truncating higher-order cumulants.",

    "title": "Evolutionary dynamics of memory-based strategies in repeated and structured social interactions",
    "abstract": "Human social life is shaped by repeated interactions, where past experiences guide future behavior. In evolutionary game theory, a key challenge is to identify strategies that harness such memory to succeed in repeated encounters. Decades of research have identified influential one-step memory strategies (such as Tit-for-Tat, Generous Tit-for-Tat, and Win-Stay Lose-Shift) that promote cooperation in iterated pairwise games. However, these strategies occupy only a small corner of the vast strategy space, and performance in isolated pairwise contests does not guarantee evolutionary success. The most effective strategies are those that can spread through a population and stabilize cooperation. We propose a general framework for repeated-interaction strategies that encompasses arbitrary memory lengths, diverse informational inputs (including both one's own and the opponent's past actions), and deterministic or stochastic decision rules. We analyze their evolutionary dynamics and derive general mathematical results for the emergence of cooperation in any network structure. We then introduce a unifying indicator that quantifies the contribution of repeated-interaction strategies to population-level cooperation. Applying this indicator, we show that long-memory strategies evolve to promote cooperation more effectively than short-memory strategies, challenging the traditional view that extended memory offers no advantage. This work expands the study of repeated interactions beyond one-step memory strategies to the full spectrum of memory capacities. It provides a plausible explanation for the high levels of cooperation observed in human societies, which traditional one-step memory models cannot account for.",

    "abstract": "Dengue, a mosquito-borne viral disease common in tropical areas, is spread by Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. Temperature changes driven by climate affect vector ecology and expand regions of species coexistence. The combined effect of temperature and larval competition on mosquito dynamics and dengue transmission is unclear. We built a deterministic model with temperature-dependent parameters to study larval-stage interactions, linked with a SEIR framework for human infection. We assessed invasion potential, coexistence, and infection peaks. The basic reproduction number (R0) was calculated using the Next Generation Matrix, and the effective reproduction number (Rt) came from simulations with larval competition. Aedes albopictus invades aegypti-dominated systems when the aegypti competition coefficient is below 0.47, with neutral equilibrium from 0.47 to 0.60 and exclusion above 0.60 in stable conditions. In temperature-dependent settings, invasion extends to a coefficient of 0.75. Coexistence analysis showed aegypti dominance (~87% abundance) in stable settings, while temperature-dependent conditions led to ~50% abundance for both species. Dengue cases peaked at 156-168 in stable conditions and 195-220 in temperature-dependent ones. Stronger albopictus competition lowered peaks in both cases. Temperature boosts albopictus invasion and coexistence, while aegypti drives higher infection peaks. Balanced species abundances raise transmission risks, emphasizing the need to factor temperature and competition into vector control.",

    "abstract": "While monitoring biodiversity through camera traps has become an important endeavor for ecological research, identifying species in the captured image data remains a major bottleneck due to limited labeling resources. Active learning -- a machine learning paradigm that selects the most informative data to label and train a predictive model -- offers a promising solution, but typically focuses on uncertainty in the individual predictions without considering uncertainty across the entire dataset. We introduce a new active learning policy, Vendi information gain (VIG), that selects images based on their impact on dataset-wide prediction uncertainty, capturing both informativeness and diversity. We applied VIG to the Snapshot Serengeti dataset and compared it against common active learning methods. VIG needs only 3% of the available data to reach 75% accuracy, a level that baselines require more than 10% of the data to achieve. With 10% of the data, VIG attains 88% predictive accuracy, 12% higher than the best of the baselines. This improvement in performance is consistent across metrics and batch sizes, and we show that VIG also collects more diverse data in the feature space. VIG has broad applicability beyond ecology, and our results highlight its value for biodiversity monitoring in data-limited environments.",

We show that increasing memory can greatly widen the outbreak size distribution and reduce the disease lifetime.

    "abstract": "Co-occurrence network inference algorithms have significantly advanced our understanding of microbiome communities. However, these algorithms typically analyze microbial associations within samples collected from a single environmental niche, often capturing only static snapshots rather than dynamic microbial processes. Previous studies have commonly grouped samples from different environmental niches together without fully considering how microbial communities adapt their associations when faced with varying ecological conditions. Our study addresses this limitation by explicitly investigating both spatial and temporal dynamics of microbial communities. We analyzed publicly available microbiome abundance data across multiple locations and time points, to evaluate algorithm performance in predicting microbial associations using our proposed Same-All Cross-validation (SAC) framework. SAC evaluates algorithms in two distinct scenarios: training and testing within the same environmental niche (Same), and training and testing on combined data from multiple environmental niches (All). To overcome the limitations of conventional algorithms, we propose fuser, an algorithm that, while not entirely new in machine learning, is novel for microbiome community network inference. It retains subsample-specific signals while simultaneously sharing relevant information across environments during training. Unlike standard approaches that infer a single generalized network from combined data, fuser generates distinct, environment-specific predictive networks. Our results demonstrate that fuser achieves comparable predictive performance to existing algorithms such as glmnet when evaluated within homogeneous environments (Same), and notably reduces test error compared to baseline algorithms in cross-environment (All) scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Indirect reciprocity promotes cooperation by allowing individuals to help others based on reputation rather than direct reciprocation. Because it relies on accurate reputation information, its effectiveness can be undermined by information gaps. We examine two forms of incomplete information: incomplete observation, in which donor actions are observed only probabilistically, and reputation fading, in which recipient reputations are sometimes classified as \"Unknown\". Using analytical frameworks for public assessment, we show that these seemingly similar models yield qualitatively different outcomes. Under incomplete observation, the conditions for cooperation are unchanged, because less frequent updates are exactly offset by higher reputational stakes. In contrast, reputation fading hinders cooperation, requiring higher benefit-to-cost ratios as the identification probability decreases. We then evaluate costly punishment as a third action alongside cooperation and defection. Norms incorporating punishment can sustain cooperation across broader parameter ranges without reducing efficiency in the reputation fading model. This contrasts with previous work, which found punishment ineffective under a different type of information limitation, and highlights the importance of distinguishing between types of information constraints. Finally, we review past studies to identify when punishment is effective and when it is not in indirect reciprocity.",

    "abstract": "The evolutionary origins of ageing and age-associated diseases continue to pose a fundamental question in biology. This study is concerned with a recently proposed framework, which conceptualises development and ageing as a continuous process, driven by genetically encoded epigenetic changes in target sets of cells. According to the Evolvable Soma Theory of Ageing (ESTA), ageing reflects the cumulative manifestation of epigenetic changes that are predominantly expressed during the post-reproductive phase. These late-acting modifications are not yet evolutionarily optimised but are instead subject to ongoing selection, functioning as somatic \"experiments\" through which evolution explores novel phenotypic variation. These experiments are often detrimental, leading to progressive physical decline and eventual death, while a small subset may produce beneficial adaptations, that evolution can exploit to shape future developmental trajectories. According to ESTA, ageing can be understood as evolution in action, yet old age is also the strongest risk factor for major diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and metabolic syndrome. We argue that this association is not merely correlational but causal: the same epigenetic process that drive development and ageing also underlie age-associated diseases. Growing evidence points to epigenetic regulation as a central factor in these pathologies, since no consistent patterns of genetic mutations have been identified, whereas widespread regulatory and epigenetic disruptions are observed. From this perspective, evolution is not only the driver of ageing but also the ultimate source of the diseases that accompany it, making it the root cause of most age-related pathologies.",

    "abstract": "On May 15, 2025, Brazil reported its first highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) outbreak in a commercial poultry breeder farm in Montenegro, Rio Grande do Sul. This study presents the outbreak timeline, control measures, along with spatial risk assessment and epidemiological model used to simulate detection delays. The transmission model considered Susceptible Exposed Infected Recovered Dead farm statuses to simulate within farm and between farm dynamics under 3 day, 5 day, and 10 day detection delays. The single infected commercial farm lost 15,650 birds, with 92% mortality due to HPAI, and additional culling of the remaining birds on Day 5 post-notification to the state animal health officials. Based on the mortality and outbreak response data, the introduction likely occurred 3 10 days before its official detection. Our field investigations suggested that wild birds were the most likely source of introduction, although biosecurity breaches could not be ruled out. Control measures implemented included movement restrictions and a control zone, from which 4,197 vehicles were inspected upon entry. Risk analysis classified 64.4% of municipalities as low risk, 35.0% as medium risk, and 0.6% as high risk. Our HPAI disease simulation results showed that the number of secondary infections would increase from a median of 4 farms (IQR 2 5) with a 3 day delay to 6 (IQR 3 22) and 34 (IQR 12 47) farms with 5 day and 10 day delays, respectively. The rapid veterinary response eliminated the outbreak within 32 days of detection, highlighting the critical role of early detection and prompt response.",

In this model, individuals' competition over a shared resource guides the population towards a critical steady state with prolonged individual life time.

A hydrodynamic theory is derived by explicit coarse-graining, which shows good agreement with numerical simulations. Unlike previous models for non-equilibrium hyperuniform states, our model does not exhibit conservation laws, even when approaching criticality. Instead, we trace the emergence of hyperuniformity to the divergence of timescales close to criticality.

    "abstract": "Vaccination against the SARS-CoV-2 disease has significantly reduced its mortality rate and spread. However, despite its availability, a considerable proportion of the public has either refused or delayed getting vaccinated. This reluctance is known as vaccine hesitancy. The aim of this paper is to present a mathematical model to investigate how social interaction can impact vaccine hesitancy. The model describes the temporal transitions between different vaccination classes of the population (those vaccinated, those who are not yet vaccinated but agree to be vaccinated, and those who refuse). We apply the model to state and national survey data from the USA to estimate model parameters that quantify the rates at which public opinion on vaccination changes. Moreover, we investigate how political trends and demographic factors, such as age and education, impact these parameters. Our results show that state-level political affiliation, age, and educational level shape opinions on vaccination and have a strong influence on the temporal dynamics of attitude changes.",

    "abstract": "Indirect reciprocity is a key mechanism for large-scale cooperation. This mechanism captures the insight that in part, people help others to build and maintain a good reputation. To enable such cooperation, appropriate social norms are essential. They specify how individuals should act based on each others' reputations, and how reputations are updated in response to individual actions. Although previous work has identified several norms that sustain cooperation, a complete analytical characterization of all evolutionarily stable norms remains lacking, especially when assessments or actions are noisy. In this study, we provide such a characterization for the public assessment regime. This characterization reproduces known results, such as the leading eight norms, but it extends to more general cases, allowing for various types of errors and additional actions including costly punishment. We also identify norms that impose a fixed payoff on any mutant strategy, analogous to the zero-determinant strategies in direct reciprocity. These results offer a rigorous foundation for understanding the evolution of cooperation through indirect reciprocity and the critical role of social norms.",

    "abstract": "Mutualistic interactions, where individuals from different species can benefit from each other, are widespread across ecosystems. This study develops a general deterministic model of mutualism involving two populations, assuming that mutualism may involve both costs and benefits for the interacting individuals, leading to density-dependent effects on the dynamics of the two species. This framework aims at generalizing pre-existing models, by allowing the ecological interactions to transition from mutualistic to parasitic when the respective densities of interacting species change. Through ordinary differential equations and phase portrait analysis, we derive general principles governing these systems, identifying sufficient conditions for the emergence of certain dynamic behaviors. In particular, we show that limit cycles can arise when interactions include parasitic phases but are absent in strictly mutualistic regimes. This framework provides a general approach for characterizing the population dynamics of interacting species and highlights the effect of the transitions from mutualism to parasitism due to density dependence.",

    "abstract": "The sterile insect technique has emerged recently as a biologically secure and effective tool for suppressing wild mosquito pests. To improve the performance of this strategy, understanding the interaction between wild and sterile mosquitoes is critical. Although the common models for this biological problem are scalar equations, they are remarkably resistant to the mathematical analysis. In a series of papers, Dueñas, Nuñez, and Obaya have developed a powerful approach to describe the dynamical behavior of scalar equations with d-concave nonlinearities, a property typically related to the sign of the third derivative. In this paper, we show that, for periodic equations coming from population dynamics, this condition is typically associated with the positive sign of the third derivative of the inverse of the Poincaré map. This remark allows us to simplify some arguments in the periodic case and obtain a deep geometrical understanding of the global bifurcation patterns. Consequently, the dynamical behavior of the models is analyzed in terms of simple and testable conditions. Our methodology allows us to describe precisely the dynamical behavior of the common mosquito population suppression models, even incorporating seasonality. This paper generalizes and improves many recent results in the literature.",

    "abstract": "Calibrating agent-based epidemic models is computationally demanding. We present a supervised machine learning calibrator that learns the inverse mapping from epidemic time series to SIR parameters. A three-layer bidirectional LSTM ingests 60-day incidence together with population size and recovery rate, and outputs transmission probability, contact rate, and R0. Training uses a composite loss with an epidemiology-motivated consistency penalty that encourages R0 \\* recovery rate to equal transmission probability \\* contact rate.   In a 1000-scenario simulation study, we compare the calibrator with Approximate Bayesian Computation (likelihood-free MCMC). The method achieves lower error across all targets (MAE: R0 0.0616 vs 0.275; transmission 0.0715 vs 0.128; contact 1.02 vs 4.24), produces tighter predictive intervals with near nominal coverage, and reduces wall clock time from 77.4 s to 2.35 s per calibration. Although contact rate and transmission probability are partially nonidentifiable, the approach reproduces epidemic curves more faithfully than ABC, enabling fast and practical calibration. We evaluate it on SIR agent based epidemics generated with epiworldR and provide an implementation in R.",

    "abstract": "This work introduces a physics-informed neural networks (PINNs)-based model predictive control (MPC) framework for susceptible-infected-recovered ($SIR$) spreading models. Existing studies in MPC design for epidemic control often assume either 1) measurable states of the dynamics, where the parameters are learned, or 2) known parameters of the model, where the states are learned. In this work, we address the joint real-time estimation of states and parameters within the MPC framework using only noisy infected states, under the assumption that 1) only the recovery rate is known, or 2) only the basic reproduction number is known. Under the first assumption, we propose MPC-PINNs and two novel PINNs algorithms, all of which are integrated into the MPC framework. First, we introduce MPC-PINNs, which are designed for $SIR$ models with control. We then propose log-scaled PINNs (MPC-LS-PINNs), which incorporate a log-scaled loss function to improve robustness against noise. Next, we present split-integral PINNs (MPC-SI-PINNs), which leverage integral operators and state coupling in the neural network training process to effectively reconstruct the complete epidemic state information. Building upon these methods, we further extend our framework for the second assumption. We establish the necessary conditions and extend our PINNs algorithms, where MPC-SI-PINNs are simplified as split-PINNs (MPC-S-PINNs). By incorporating these algorithms into the MPC framework, we simultaneously estimate the epidemic states and parameters while generating optimal control strategies. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods under different settings.",

    "abstract": "During the COVID-19 pandemic, estimating the total deaths averted by vaccination has been of great public health interest. Instead of estimating total deaths averted by vaccination among both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, some studies empirically estimated only \"directly averted\" deaths among vaccinated individuals, typically suggesting that vaccines prevented more deaths overall than directly due to the indirect effect. Here, we define the causal estimand to quantify outcomes \"directly averted\" by vaccination$\\unicode{x2014}$i.e., the impact of vaccination for vaccinated individuals, holding vaccination coverage fixed$\\unicode{x2014}$for vaccination at multiple time points, and show that this estimand is a lower bound on the total outcomes averted when the indirect effect is non-negative. We develop an unbiased estimator for the causal estimand in a one-stage randomized controlled trial (RCT) and explore the bias of a popular \"hazard difference\" estimator frequently used in empirical studies. We show that even in an RCT, the hazard difference estimator is biased if vaccination has a non-null effect, as it fails to incorporate the greater depletion of susceptibles among the unvaccinated individuals. In simulations, the overestimation is small for averted deaths when infection-fatality rate is low, as for many important pathogens. However, the overestimation can be large for averted infections given a high basic reproduction number. Additionally, we define and compare estimand and estimators for avertible outcomes (i.e., outcomes that could have been averted by vaccination, but were not due to failure to vaccinate). Future studies can explore the identifiability of the causal estimand in observational settings.",

    "abstract": "Over the past decades, more than 25 phylogenetic tree balance indices and several families of such indices have been proposed in the literature -- some of which even contain infinitely many members. It is well established that different indices have different strengths and perform unequally across application scenarios. For example, power analyses have shown that the ability of an index to detect the generative model of a given phylogenetic tree varies significantly between indices. This variation in performance motivates the ongoing search for new and possibly \\enquote{better} (im)balance indices. An easy way to generate a new index is to construct a compound index, e.g., a linear combination of established indices.   Two of the most prominent and widely used imbalance indices in this context are the Sackin index and the Colless index. In this study, we show that these classic indices are themselves compound in nature: they can be decomposed into more elementary components that independently satisfy the defining properties of a tree (im)balance index. We further show that the difference Colless minus Sackin results in another imbalance index that is minimized (amongst others) by all Colless minimal trees. Conversely, the difference Sackin minus Colless forms a balance index.   Finally, we compare the building blocks of which the Sackin and the Colless indices consist to these indices as well as to the stairs2 index, which is another index from the literature. Our results suggest that the elementary building blocks we identify are not only foundational to established indices but also valuable tools for analyzing disagreement among indices when comparing the balance of different trees.",

    "abstract": "Human cooperation persists among strangers despite theoretical predictions of difficulties in large, well-mixed populations, leaving a fundamental evolutionary puzzle. While upstream (pay-it-forward: helping others because you were helped) and downstream (rewarding-reputation: helping those with good reputations) indirect reciprocity have been independently considered as solutions, their joint dynamics in multiplayer contexts remain unexplored. We study N-player giving games with benefit b and cost c and analyze evolutionary dynamics for three strategies: unconditional cooperation (X), unconditional defection (Y), and an integrated reciprocal strategy (Z) combining unconditional forwarding with reputation-based discrimination. We show that integrating upstream and downstream reciprocity can yield a globally asymptotically stable mixed equilibrium of unconditional defectors and integrated reciprocators whenever the benefit-to-cost ratio exceeds a threshold (b/c > 2). Counterintuitively, introducing small complexity costs, rather than destabilizing, stabilizes the equilibrium by preventing not only unconditional cooperators (viewed as second-order freeloaders) but also alternative conditional strategies from invading. While the equilibrium frequency of integrated reciprocators decreases with group size N, it remains positive for any finite N. Rather than requiring uniformity, our model reveals one pathway to stable cooperation through strategic diversity. Defectors serve as \"evolutionary shields\" preventing system collapse while integrated reciprocators flexibly combine open and discriminative responses. This framework demonstrates how pay-it-forward chains and reputation systems can jointly maintain social polymorphism including cooperation despite cognitive limitations and group size challenges, offering a potential evolutionary foundation for behavioral diversity in human societies.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic forced the rapid development of vaccines and the implementation of mass vaccination programs around the world. However, many hesitated to take the vaccine due to concerns about its effectiveness. By looking at an ordinary differential equation (ODE) model of disease spread that incorporates a mass vaccination program, this study aims to determine the sensitivity of the cumulative count of infected individuals ($W$) and the cumulative death count ($D$) to the following model parameters: disease transmission rate ($β$), reciprocal of the disease latency period ($κ$), reciprocal of the infectious period ($γ$), death ratio ($α$), vaccine efficacy rate ($r$), and vaccine rollout rate ($δ$). This was implemented using Latin hypercube sampling and partial rank correlation coefficient. Results show that $D$ is highly sensitive to $α$ and shows increasing sensitivity to $δ$ in the long run. On the other hand, $W$ is highly sensitive to $κ$ at the beginning of the simulation, but this weakens over time. In contrast, $W$ is not very sensitive to $δ$ initially but becomes very significant in the long run. This supports the importance of the vaccine rollout rate over the vaccine efficacy rate in curbing the spread of the disease in the population. It is also worthwhile to reduce the death ratio by developing a cure for the disease or improving the healthcare system as a whole.",

    "abstract": "Improved hygiene and infant vaccinations have led to age specific variations in hepatitis A antibody prevalence in Korea, with lower rates among individuals in their 20s to 40s. Given that the fatality rate of hepatitis A increases for those aged 50 and older, the low immunity level among younger adults indicates a future risk of increased deaths in older age groups without additional preventive measures.We developed an age structured transmission model to assess the impact of adult vaccination, assuming it begins in 2025. The 20s age group was modeled with an additional compartment to account for hepatitis A vaccination administered to military recruits. Vaccination strategies targeting the 20s to 30s and 40s to 50s age groups were compared, considering antibody testing costs for the latter in Korea and focusing on projected deaths over approximately 50 years. When the total vaccination cost is fixed, targeting the 40s to 50s group covers 20% fewer individuals than the 20s to 30s group but yields a 1.3 to 1.5 fold greater reduction in deaths. When the total vaccine supply is fixed, targeting the 40s to 50s group is 1.2 times more expensive but yields a 1.7 to 1.8 fold greater reduction in deaths than the 20s to 30s group. Moreover, including a second dose for military personnel in the 20s to 30s group has minimal impact on reducing deaths. Preventive measures for adults may be necessary to reduce future hepatitis A related deaths. Vaccinating the 40s to 50s group would be more effective in reducing deaths than vaccinating the 20s to 30s group.",

Our analysis reveals a lack of temporal correlation in the studied Ediacaran trajectories and its presence in both analysed Cambrian trajectories, indicating time-tuned behaviours were in place by the early Cambrian.

We created artificial populations of self-interested creators and users and studied them through the lens of evolutionary game theory. Our results reveal that media is indeed able to foster cooperation between creators and users, but not always. Cooperation does not evolve if the quality of the information provided by the media is not reliable enough, or if the costs of either accessing media or ensuring safety are too high. By shaping public perception and holding developers accountable, media emerges as a powerful soft regulator -- guiding AI safety even in the absence of formal government oversight.",

    "title": "Prospects for acoustically monitoring ecosystem tipping points",
    "abstract": "Many ecosystems can undergo important qualitative changes, including sudden transitions to alternative stable states, in response to perturbations or increments in conditions. Such 'tipping points' are often preceded by declines in aspects of ecosystem resilience, namely the capacity to recover from perturbations, that leave various spatial and temporal signatures. These so-called 'early warning signals' have been used to anticipate transitions in diverse real systems, but many of the high-throughput, autonomous monitoring technologies that are transforming ecology have yet to be fully leveraged to this end. Acoustic monitoring in particular is a powerful tool for quantifying biodiversity, tracking ecosystem health, and facilitating conservation. By deploying acoustic recorders in diverse environments, researchers have gained insights from the calls and behaviour of individual species to higher-level soundscape features that describe habitat quality and even predict species occurrence. Here, we draw on theory and practice to advocate for using acoustics to probe ecosystem resilience and identify emerging and established early warning signals of tipping points. With a focus on pragmatic considerations, we emphasise that despite limits to tipping point theory and the current scale and transferability of data, acoustics could be instrumental in understanding resilience and tipping potential across distinct ecosystems and scales.",

    "abstract": "Successful collective action on issues from climate change to the maintenance of democracy depends on societal properties such as cultural tightness and social cohesion. How these properties evolve is not well understood because they emerge from a complex interplay between beliefs and behaviors that are usually modeled separately. Here we address this challenge by developing a game-theoretical framework incorporating norm-utility models to study the coevolutionary dynamics of cooperative action, expressed belief, and norm-utility preferences. We show that the introduction of evolving beliefs and preferences into the Snowdrift game and Prisoner's Dilemma leads to a proliferation of evolutionary stable equilibria, each with different societal properties. In particular, we find that a declining material environment can simultaneously be associated with increased cultural tightness (defined as the degree to which individuals behave in accordance with widely held beliefs) and reduced social cohesion (defined as the degree of social homogeneity i.e. the extent to which individuals belong to a single well-defined group). Loss of social homogeneity occurs via a process of evolutionary branching, in which a population fragments into two distinct social groups with strikingly different characteristics. The groups that emerge differ not only in their willingness to cooperate, but also in their beliefs about cooperation and in their preferences for conformity and coherence of their actions and beliefs. These results have implications for our understanding of the resilience of cooperation and collective action in times of crisis.",

    "title": "Heterogeneity drives plasmid maintenance in large microbial communities",
    "abstract": "Microbiomes are complex systems comprised of many interacting species. Species can survive harsh or changing conditions by rapid adaptation, a process accelerated by the exchange of genetic material between different species through horizontal gene transfer. Conjugative plasmids are ubiquitous mobile genetic elements that mediate such exchanges both within and between species. Therefore, predicting whether a plasmid can invade and be maintained by a microbial community is critical, for example when assessing the risks of antimicrobial resistance gene spread in commensal or environmental microbiomes. However, existing theory developed to assist such predictions has generally focused on the balance among plasmid costs, benefits, and infection rates, overlooking other relevant factors such as the inherent dynamics and diversity of microbiomes. Here, we hypothesize that plasmid persistence in the absence of positive selection can arise purely from the heterogeneity present in large and diverse microbial communities. We introduce a generic model that integrates population-level dynamics with plasmid conjugation. Using this model, we show that we can predict plasmid maintenance, and that the probability for a plasmid to be maintained depends on traits of the plasmid, most importantly the conjugation rate, and the species abundance distribution of the community. Then, using both empirical abundance data and extensive numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the inherent randomness of ecological interactions and conjugation rates enables plasmid persistence -- even in the absence of positive selection. Our findings thus suggest that natural microbial communities are likely to maintain plasmids indefinitely, offering a new perspective on the spread, maintenance, and ubiquity of plasmids.",

In this research, the approach is to create a fusion between the existing models for the estimation of phylogenetic trees and a population-based meta-heuristics approach, i.e., Genetic Algorithm.

    "abstract": "Bacteria possess diverse mechanisms to regulate their motility in response to environmental and physiological signals, enabling them to navigate complex habitats and adapt their behavior. Among these mechanisms, interspecies recognition enables cells to modulate their movement based on the ecological identity of neighboring species. Here, we introduce a model in which we assume bacterial species recognizes each other and interact via local signals that either enhance or suppress the motility of neighboring cells. Through large-scale simulations and a coarse-grained stochastic model, we demonstrate the emergence of a sharp transition driven by nucleation processes: increasing the density of motility-suppressing interactions drives the system from a fully mixed, motile phase to a state characterized by large, stationary bacterial clusters. Remarkably, in systems with a large number of interacting species, this transition can be triggered solely by altering the structure of the motility-regulation interaction matrix while maintaining species and interaction densities constant. In particular, we find that heterogeneous and modular interactions promote the transition more readily than homogeneous random ones. These results contribute to the ongoing effort to understand microbial interactions, suggesting that structured, non-random ones may be key to reproducing commonly observed spatial patterns in microbial communities.",

    "abstract": "Cooperation often depends on individuals avoiding exploitation and interacting preferentially with other cooperators. We explore how context-dependent migration influences the evolution of cooperation in spatially structured populations. Individuals interact in small groups through public goods games and reproduce with possible dispersal. Cooperators migrate more frequently when surrounded by defectors, while defectors disperse uniformly. This behavioral asymmetry reflects realistic differences in mobility and social responsiveness. Our results show that conditional migration can promote cooperation by enabling cooperators to escape defector-rich environments and cluster together. The effectiveness of this mechanism depends on baseline migration rates, group size, and the sensitivity of cooperators to local conditions. We identify parameter ranges where cooperation is favored even under conditions that would typically hinder its evolution. These findings highlight how behavioral plasticity and dispersal strategies can interact with population structure to support the emergence of cooperation.",

However, difficulties in detecting historical resource distribution hinders the ability to tests these theories. If external conditions crucial to organism fitness (e.g. nutrient distribution, oxygen availability) became increasingly heterogeneous across the Ediacaran-Cambrian transition, then it follows that benthic organisms dependent on these conditions would demonstrate a similar increase in the spatial variability of their movement trajectories. To investigate Ediacaran resource distribution on the seafloor we examined the morphology of Helminthoidichnites tenuis, a simple unbranched horizontal bilaterian trail, from the Ediacara Member of Southern Australia for spatial trends. Our analysis reveals a as-yet undiscovered variability in the behaviour of the Helminthoidichnites tenuis tracemaker and confirmed heterogeneity in external conditions relevant to the tracemaker in the latest Ediacaran.",

Behavioural adaptations are often invoked in a variety of evolutionary hypotheses; however, few methods to quantitatively compare fossil behaviour exist. Movement paths, such as trails and trackways, are well-studied in extant-organism research where they are discretized and mathematically analyzed for behavioural strategies and trends. Here, we reference modern movement ecology research and present a methodology to discretize horizontal movement paths in the fossil record. We then demonstrate the utility of this methodology and the spatiotemporal data it collects via an analysis of the trilobite trace fossil Cruziana semiplicata and assess our results in light of three previous assertions about its recorded behaviour. Our analysis reveals the presence of three morphotypes, interpreted as three distinct behavioural variations, which persisted across multiple geographic localities and are interpreted to reflect changes in external conditions, internal states, or a combination of the two. Our research highlights the immense potential of this methodology to test behavioural hypotheses and provides an open-source groundwork for future research.",

However, copying an extended molecule requires complex copying machinery and high fidelity that scales with the genome size to avoid the error catastrophe. Here, we explore these fidelity requirements in an alternative architecture, the virtual circular genome, in which no one physical molecule encodes the full genetic information. Instead, information is encoded and transmitted in a collective of overlapping and interacting segments. Using a model experimental system of a complex mixture of DNA oligomers that can partly anneal and extend off each other, we find that mutant oligomers are suppressed relative to a model without collective encoding. Through simulations and theory, we show that this suppression of mutants can be explained by competition for productive binding partners. As a consequence, information can be propagated robustly in a virtual circular genome even at mutation rates expected under prebiotic conditions.",

CWD is difficult to control due to the persistence of prions in the environment. Prions can remain infectious for more than a decade and have been found in soil as well as other environmental vectors, such as ticks and plants. Here, we provide a bifurcation analysis of a mathematical model of CWD spread in a cervid population, and use a modification of the Gillespie algorithm to explore if wolves can be used as an ecological control strategy to limit the spread of the disease in several relevant scenarios. We then analytically compute the probability that the disease spreads given one infected member enters a fully healthy population and the probability of elimination, given a fully susceptible population and remaining prions in the environment. From our analysis, we conclude that wolves can be used as an effective control strategy to limit the spread of CWD in cervid populations, and hunting or other means of lowering the susceptible population are beneficial to controlling the spread of CWD, although it is important to note that inferring biologically relevant parameters from the existing data is an ongoing challenge for this system.",

Particularly, the biological mechanism behind fish migration is not fully understood. Moreover, its observation is often conducted visually and hence manually, raising questions of accuracy and interpretation of the data sampled. We address the two issues, mechanism and observation, of fish migration based on a recently developed mathematical model. The results obtained in this short paper show that fish migration can be characterized through a minimization principle and evaluate the error of its manual observations. The minimization principle we hypothesize is an optimal control problem where the migrating fish population dynamically changes its size and fluctuation. We numerically investigate alternating and intensive observation schemes as case studies, demonstrating that in some realistic conditions the estimate of total fish count is not reliable. We believe that this paper contributes to a deeper understanding of fish migration.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the impact of Hebbian learning on the contact process, a paradigmatic model for infection spreading, which has been also proposed as a simple model to capture the dynamics of inter-regional brain activity propagation as well as population spreading. Each of these contexts calls for an extension of the contact process with local learning. We introduce Hebbian learning as a positive or negative reinforcement of the activation rate between a pair of sites after each successful activation event. Learning can happen either in both directions motivated by social distancing (mutual learning model), or in only one of the directions motivated by brain and population dynamics (source or target learning models). Hebbian learning leads to a rich class of emergent behavior, where local incentives can lead to the opposite global effects. In general, positive reinforcement (increasing activation rates) leads to a loss of the active phase, while negative reinforcement (reducing activation rates) can turn the inactive phase into a globally active phase. In two dimensions and above, the effect of negative reinforcement is twofold: it promotes the spreading of activity, but at the same time gives rise to the appearance of effectively immune regions, entailing the emergence of two distinct critical points. Positive reinforcement can lead to Griffiths effects with non-universal power-law scaling, through the formation of random loops of activity, a manifestation of the ``ant mill\" phenomenon.",

Such absorbing state phase transitions are often sensitive to the presence of quenched disorder. Traditionally, a phase transition in the disordered contact process is either triggered by dilution or by locally varying the infection rate. However, when both factors play an important role, a multicritical point emerges that remains poorly understood. Here, we study the multicritical contact process by large-scale Monte Carlo simulations in two and three dimensions. The multicritical behavior is found to be universal and exhibits ultra-slow, activated dynamical scaling, with exponents consistent with those predicted by the strong disorder renormalization group method. This finding indicates that the multicritical contact process belongs to the same universality class as the multicritical quantum Ising model, opening future directions to measure quantum entanglement properties via classical simulations.",

Conditions of unresolvable stress have been associated with a diverse array of pathologies, from cancer to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Here, I unify insights from evolutionary and developmental biology with trauma psychology to present a novel framework for tumorigenesis which synthesizes stress-perception, tissue dysfunction, and the hallmarks of neoplastic growth.

    "abstract": "Vector-borne diseases arise from the coupled dynamics of human mobility and mosquito ecology, producing outbreaks shaped by both spatial distributions and temporal patterns of movement. Here we develop a coarse-grained hub--leaf reduction that isolates the universal principles governing epidemic vulnerability in interconnected populations. By deriving and analyzing the epidemic vulnerability equation, we show how human and vector population ratios, together with mobility parameters that regulate time spent in hub and leaf locations, jointly determine the conditions for outbreak persistence. The analysis reveals that balanced flows of individuals between patches consistently minimize vulnerability, whereas disproportionate concentrations of vectors can shift the dominant risk to specific locations. Across parameter regimes, compensatory mobility emerges as a stabilizing mechanism, while skewed host--vector ratios elevate epidemic risk. These results establish general principles for the spatiotemporal determinants of vector-borne disease spread and provide a theoretical foundation for extending minimal models to more complex epidemiological settings.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria often develop distinct phenotypes to adapt to environmental stress. In particular, they can produce biofilms, dense communities of bacteria that live in a complex extracellular matrix. Bacterial biofilms provide a safe haven from environmental conditions by distributing metabolic workload and allowing them to perform complex multicellular processes. While previous studies have investigated how bacterial biofilms are regulated under laboratory conditions, they have not considered (1) the data requirements necessary to estimate model parameters and (2) how bacteria respond to recurring stressors in their natural habitats. To address (1), we adapted a mechanistic population model to explore the dynamics of biofilm formation in the presence of predator stress, using synthetic data. We used a Maximum Likelihood Estimation framework to measure crucial parameters underpinning the biofilm formation dynamics. We used genetic algorithms to propose an optimal data collection schedule that minimised parameter identifiability confidence interval widths. Our sensitivity analysis revealed that we could simplify the binding dynamics and eliminate biofilm detachment. To address (2), we proposed a structured version of our model to capture the long-term behaviour and evolutionary selection. In our extended model, the subpopulations feature different maximal rates of biofilm formation. We compared the selection under different predator types and amounts and identified key parameters that affected the speed of selection via sensitivity analysis.",

    "abstract": "Group synchrony in the animal kingdom is usually associated with mating. Being in sync is likely advantageous, as it may help in luring the opposite sex. Yet there are also disadvantages -- such as the homogenization of the group -- which make it harder for individuals to stand-out. Here we address this tradeoff, bringing together the Kuramoto model with concepts from evolutionary game theory. We focus on the existence of self-interested ''cheaters,'' which have been extensively studied in a variety of species. In our scenario, cheating individuals take part in the synchronous group display but position themselves (in terms of phase) slightly ahead or behind the pack. This allows them to enjoy both the group benefit of advertisement and the individual benefit of being unique. But a group can only tolerate a limited number of such individuals while still achieving synchrony. We therefore incorporate a from of ''policing'' into our model: if an individual strays too far from the group's synchronous phase, they reveal themselves as dishonest and are punished. Our model offers testable predictions regarding natural population compositions, and will hopefully spur further investigation into not only how, but also why, natural systems synchronize.",

    "abstract": "Species interactions (ranging from direct predator prey relationships to indirect effects mediated by the environment) are central to ecosystem balance and biodiversity. While empirical methods for measuring these interactions exist, their interpretability and limitations remain unclear. Here we examine the empirical matrix of pairwise interactions, a widely used tool, and analyze its temporal variability. We show that apparent fluctuations in interaction strength (and even shifts in interaction signs, often interpreted as transitions between competition and facilitation) can arise intrinsically from population dynamics with fixed ecological roles. Experimental protocols further shape these estimates: the duration of observation and the type of setup in microbial growth studies (e.g., chemostats, batch cultures, or resource conditions) systematically affect measured interactions. Considering interactions across timescales enhances interpretability: short-term measurements primarily capture direct species couplings, whereas long-term observations increasingly reflect indirect community feedback. Taken together, these results establish short duration inferences, obtained either directly or extrapolated, as a principled way to disentangle direct from indirect interactions. Building on this insight, we propose a model inference approach that leverages multiple short time series rather than extended longitudinal datasets.",

    "abstract": "In many biological processes, the size of a population changes stochastically with time, and recent work in the context of cancer and bacterial growth have focused on the situation when the mean population size grows exponentially. Here, motivated by the evolutionary process of genetic hitchhiking in a selectively neutral population, we consider a model in which the mean size of the population increases linearly. We are interested in understanding how the fluctuations in the population size impact the first passage statistics, and study the fixation probability that a mutant reaches frequency one by a given time in a population whose size follows a conditional Wright-Fisher process. We find that at sufficiently short and long times, the fixation probability can be approximated by a model that ignores temporal correlations between the inverse of the population size, but at intermediate times, it is significantly smaller than that obtained by neglecting the correlations. Our analytical and numerical study of the correlation functions show that the conditional Wright-Fisher process of interest is neither a stationary nor a Gaussian process; we also find that the variance of the inverse population size initially increases linearly with time $t$ and then decreases as $t^{-2}$ at intermediate times followed by an exponential decay at longer times. Our work emphasizes the importance of temporal correlations in populations with fluctuating size that are often ignored in population-genetic studies of biological evolution.",

    "abstract": "Microbial adaptation to extreme stress, such as starvation, antimicrobial exposure, or freezing often reveals fundamental trade-offs between survival and proliferation. Understanding how populations navigate these trade-offs in fluctuating environments remains a central challenge. We develop a quantitative model to investigate the adaptation of populations of yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) subjected to cycles of growth and extreme freeze-thaw stress, focusing on the role of quiescence as a mediator of survival. Our model links key life-history traits: growth rate, lag time, quiescence probability, and stress survival, to a single underlying phenotype, motivated by the role of intracellular trehalose in the adaptation of yeast to freeze-thaw stress. Through stochastic population simulations and analytical calculation of the long-term growth rate, we identify the evolutionary attractors of the system. We find that the strength of the growth-survival trade-off depends critically on environmental parameters, such as the duration of the growth phase. Crucially, our analysis reveals that populations optimized for growth-stress cycles can often maintain viability alongside growth-optimized populations even in the absence of stress. This demonstrates that underlying physiological trade-offs do not necessarily translate into fitness trade-offs at the population level, providing general insights into the complex interplay between environmental fluctuations, physiological constraints, and evolutionary dynamics.",

    "abstract": "A central goal in ecology is to understand how biodiversity is maintained. Previous theoretical works have employed the rock-paper-scissors (RPS) game as a toy model, demonstrating that population mobility is crucial in determining the species' coexistence. One key prediction is that biodiversity is jeopardized and eventually lost when mobility exceeds a certain value--a conclusion at odds with empirical observations of highly mobile species coexisting in nature. To address this discrepancy, we introduce a reinforcement learning framework and study a spatial RPS model, where individual mobility is adaptively regulated via a Q-learning algorithm rather than held fixed. Our results show that all three species can coexist stably, with extinction probabilities remaining low across a broad range of baseline migration rates. Mechanistic analysis reveals that individuals develop two behavioral tendencies: survival priority (escaping from predators) and predation priority (remaining near prey). While species coexistence emerges from the balance of the two tendencies, their imbalance jeopardizes biodiversity. Notably, there is a symmetry-breaking of action preference in a particular state that is responsible for the divergent species densities. Furthermore, when Q-learning species interact with fixed-mobility counterparts, those with adaptive mobility exhibit a significant evolutionary advantage. Our study suggests that reinforcement learning may offer a promising new perspective for uncovering the mechanisms of biodiversity and informing conservation strategies.",

Expert judgment from public health officials represents a vital information source, distinct from traditional surveillance infrastructure, that should be valued -- not discarded. Understanding how expert knowledge functions under constraints is essential for understanding the potential impact of reduced capacity. To explore expert forecasting capabilities, 114 public health officials at the 2024 CSTE workshop generated 103 predictions plus 102 rationales of peak hospitalizations and 114 predictions of influenza H3 versus H1 dominance in Pennsylvania for the 2024/25 season. We compared expert predictions to computational models and used rationales to analyze reasoning patterns using Latent Dirichlet Allocation. Experts better predicted H3 dominance and assigned lower probability to implausible scenarios than models. Expert rationales drew on historical patterns, pathogen interactions, vaccine data, and cumulative experience. Expert public health knowledge constitutes a critical data source that should be valued equally with traditional datasets. We recommend developing a national toolkit to systematically collect and analyze expert predictions and rationales, treating human judgment as quantifiable data alongside surveillance systems to enhance crisis response capabilities.",

    "abstract": "Previous pandemics, including influenza pandemics and Covid-19, have disproportionately impacted Māori and Pacific populations in Aotearoa New Zealand. The reasons for this are multi-faceted, including differences in socioeconomic deprivation, housing conditions and household size, vaccination rates, access to healthcare, and prevalence of pre-existing health conditions. Many mathematical models that were used to inform the response to the Covid-19 pandemic did not explicitly include ethnicity or other socioeconomic variables. This limited their ability to predict, understand and mitigate inequitable impacts of the pandemic. Here, we extend a model that was developed during the Covid-19 pandemic to support the public health response by stratifying the population into four ethnicity groups: Māori, Pacific, Asian and European/other. We include three ethnicity-specific components in the model: vaccination rates, clinical severity parameters, and contact patterns. We compare model results to ethnicity-specific data on Covid-19 cases, hospital admissions and deaths between 1 January 2022 and 30 June 2023, under different model scenarios in which these ethnicity-specific components are present or absent. We find that differences in vaccination rates explain only part of the observed disparities in outcomes. While no model scenario is able to fully capture the heterogeneous temporal dynamics, our results suggest that differences between ethnicities in the per-infection risk of clinical severe disease is an important factor. Our work is an important step towards models that are better able to predict inequitable impacts of future pandemic and emerging disease threats, and investigate the ability of interventions to mitigate these.",

    "abstract": "West Nile virus (WNV) is a climate-sensitive mosquito-borne arbovirus circulating between mosquitoes of the genus Culex and birds, with a potential spillover to humans and other mammals. Recent trends in climatic change, characterized by early and/or prolonged summer seasons, increased temperatures, and above-average rainfall, probably facilitated the spread of WNV in Europe, including Germany. In this work, we formulate a spatial WNV model consisting of a system of parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs), using the concept of diffusion and advection in combination with temperature-dependent parameters, i.e., mosquito biting rate, extrinsic incubation, and mortality rate. Diffusion represents the random movement of both mosquitoes and hosts across space, while advection captures the directed movement of migratory birds. The model is first studied mathematically, and we show that it has non-negative, unique, and bounded solutions in time and space. Numerical simulations of the PDE model are performed using temperature data for Germany (2019 - 2024). Results obtained from the simulation showed a high agreement with the reported WNV cases among birds and equids in Germany. The observed spreading patterns from the year 2018 to 2022 and the year 2024 were mainly driven by temperature in combination with diffusion processes of hosts and vectors. Only during the year 2023, the additional inclusion of advection for migratory birds was important to correctly predict new hotspots in new locations in Germany.",

We further characterize weaker (ensemble-specific) versions of decoupling that hold in the lineage or the population ensemble but not both. Finally, we provide a more general interpretation of the tilted expectations in terms of the mass-weighted phenotype distribution.",

    "title": "Evolutionary dynamics under coordinated reciprocity",
    "abstract": "Using past behaviors to guide future actions is essential for fostering cooperation in repeated social dilemmas. Traditional memory-based strategies that focus on recent interactions have yielded valuable insights into the evolution of cooperative behavior. However, as memory length increases, the complexity of analysis grows exponentially, since these strategies need to map every possible action sequence of a given length to subsequent responses. Due to their inherent reliance on exhaustive mapping and a lack of explicit information processing, it remains unclear how individuals can handle extensive interaction histories to make decisions under cognitive constraints. To fill this gap, we introduce coordinated reciprocity strategies ($CORE$), which incrementally evaluate the entire game history by tallying instances of consistent actions between individuals without storing round-to-round details. Once this consistency index surpasses a threshold, $CORE$ prescribes cooperation. Through equilibrium analysis, we derive an analytical condition under which $CORE$ constitutes an equilibrium. Moreover, our numerical results show that $CORE$ effectively promotes cooperation between variants of itself, and it outperforms a range of existing strategies including memory-$1$, memory-$2$, and those from a documented strategy library in evolutionary dynamics. Our work thus underscores the pivotal role of cumulative action consistency in enhancing cooperation, developing robust strategies, and offering cognitively low-burden information processing mechanisms in repeated social dilemmas.",

    "title": "Finding Inter-species Associations on Large Citizen Science Datasets",
    "abstract": "Determining associations among different species from citizen science databases is challenging due to observer behavior and intrinsic density variations that give rise to correlations that do not imply species associations. This paper introduces a method that can efficiently analyze large datasets to extract likely species associations. It tiles space into small blocks chosen to be of the accuracy of the data coordinates, and reduces observations to presence/absence per tile, in order to compute pairwise overlaps. It compares these overlaps with a spatial Poisson process that serves as a null model. For each species $i$, an expected overlap $μ_i$ is estimated by averaging normalized overlaps over other species in the same vicinity. This gives a $z$-score for significance of a species-species association and a correlation index for the strength of this association. This was tested on $874,263$ iNaturalist observations spanning $15,975$ non-avian taxa in the Santa Cruz, California region ($\\approx 4.68\\times10^{6}$ tiles). The method recovers well-known insect host-plant obligate relationships, particularly many host-gall relationships, as well as the relationship between Yerba Santa Beetles and California Yerba Santa. This approach efficiently finds associations on $\\sim10^{8}$ species pairs on modest hardware, filtering correlations arising from heterogeneous spatial prevalence and user artifacts. It produces a ranked shortlist of ecological interactions that can be further pursued. Extensions to this method are possible, such as investigating the effects of time and elevation. It could also be useful in the determination of microhabitats and biomes.",

    "title": "Extending a Phylogeny-based Method for Detecting Signatures of Multi-level Selection for Applications in Artificial Life",
    "abstract": "Multilevel selection occurs when short-term individual-level reproductive interests conflict with longer-term group-level fitness effects. Detecting and quantifying this phenomenon is key to understanding evolution of traits ranging from multicellularity to pathogen virulence. Multilevel selection is particularly important in artificial life research due to its connection to major evolutionary transitions, a hallmark of open-ended evolution. Bonetti Franceschi & Volz (2024) proposed to detect multilevel selection dynamics by screening for mutations that appear more often in a population than expected by chance (due to individual-level fitness benefits) but are ultimately associated with negative longer-term fitness outcomes (i.e., smaller, shorter-lived descendant clades). Here, we use agent-based modeling with known ground truth to assess the efficacy of this approach. To test these methods under challenging conditions broadly comparable to the original dataset explored by Bonetti Franceschi & Volz (2024), we use an epidemiological framework to model multilevel selection in trade-offs between within-host growth rate and between-host transmissibility. To achieve success on our in silico data, we develop an alternate normalization procedure for identifying clade-level fitness effects. We find the method to be sensitive in detecting genome sites under multilevel selection with 30% effect sizes on fitness, but do not see sensitivity to smaller 10% mutation effect sizes. To test the robustness of this methodology, we conduct additional experiments incorporating extrinsic, time-varying environmental changes and adaptive turnover in population compositions, and find that screen performance remains generally consistent with baseline conditions. This work represents a promising step towards rigorous generalizable quantification of multilevel selection effects.",

    "abstract": "Natural selection can create information. In particular, because of the action of natural selection, we can often learn something about an environment by examining local organisms, and vice versa. For example, the characteristics of a cactus suggest that the local environment is relatively dry, and if a natural terrestrial environment is dry, then we will generally have an enhanced probability of finding drought-resistant plants (like cacti). Here, we propose a measure that can be used to quantify the information that is created by natural selection. We call the proposed quantity reproductive information, and we show that it has an intuitively satisfying relationship to standard quantitative definitions of information. Reproductive information is also approximately equal to a previously defined measure of biological adaptation. In addition, we explain how reproductive information can be measured using phenotypic characters, instead of genotypes. This could facilitate the measurement of reproductive information, and it could also allow for the quantification of the information that is created by natural selection on groups of organisms, instead of just selection on individuals. Thus, the concept of reproductive information has the potential to advance research on the \"units of selection\", the \"major transitions in evolution\", and the emergence of \"superorganisms\" via cooperation among group members.",

More critically, these models often function as black boxes, offering predictions without interpretability or consistency with biological principles, which undermines their credibility in scientific research. To address these challenges, we present VCWorld, a cell-level white-box simulator that integrates structured biological knowledge with the iterative reasoning capabilities of large language models to instantiate a biological world model. VCWorld operates in a data-efficient manner to reproduce perturbation-induced signaling cascades and generates interpretable, stepwise predictions alongside explicit mechanistic hypotheses.

    "abstract": "Cell populations invade through a combination of proliferation and motility. Proliferation depends on the internal timing of cell division: how long cells take to complete the cell cycle. This timing varies substantially within (and across) cell types, creating age structure where cells at different times since their last division have different propensities to divide. Classical mathematical models of cell spreading treat division as memoryless and predict exponential cell-cycle-time distributions. Lineage tracing, by contrast, reveals peaked, gamma-like distributions that indicate a maturation delay leading to a fertility window. This gap motivates a modelling framework that incorporates age-dependent cell division rates while retaining analytical tractability.   We address this through a moment-hierarchy framework that tracks time since cell division, with age resetting to zero at division. The framework yields explicit formulae for steady-state age distributions, cell-cycle-time distributions, and invasion speeds. For age-independent rates, we recover classical Fisher--KPP. Three fundamental principles emerge. First, age structure systematically reduces a population's carrying capacity and narrows the viable parameter range for positive steady states. Second, classical linear theory overestimates invasion speeds; the true minimal speed is slower when division is age-dependent. Third, the parameter condition for population survival is identical to the condition for a positive invasion speed.",

    "abstract": "Bantele and colleagues recently reported that repair of a single CRISPR/Cas9-induced DNA double-strand break (DSB) in the c-MYC topologically associated domain leads to a persistent depletion of chromatin interactions and long-term transcriptional attenuation across multiple generations of human cells. They interpret this observation as evidence for a previously unrecognized principle--\"chromatin fatigue\"--in which DSB repair generates a stable architectural defect that acts as a heritable impairment to genome function. Such an idea, if correct, would carry profound implications for genome biology, epigenetic inheritance, cancer evolution, aging, and the safety of therapeutic genome editing. However, our detailed reassessment of the experimental design, underlying assumptions, and data interpretation reveals that the evidence provided is inadequate to support these sweeping conclusions. Instead, the observed outcomes are more plausibly explained by a combination of Cas9 persistence, off-target DNA damage, repair-factor retention, MYC enhancer plasticity, and the well-documented genomic instability of HeLa cells. The study does not demonstrate mechanistic causality, does not exclude simpler explanations, and does not provide data consistent with true chromatin memory or heritable architectural change. Moreover, its statistical inferences are based on noisy measurements that fall within expected variability of unstable oncogenic loci. Here, we present a comprehensive critical analysis showing that the proposed model of chromatin fatigue is unsupported by the available evidence. We offer a corrected interpretation in which the chromatin landscape experiences a temporary, repair-associated perturbation that resolves without leaving enduring or heritable impairment.",

Computational cell biology will only overcome these concerns once it treats the life-death boundary as a central concept, creating a theory of cellular viability.

Mathematical modeling offers a powerful framework for addressing these translational bottlenecks by linking mechanistic understanding to design optimization and clinical application.   This perspective embeds modeling methodologies within the therapeutic problems they aim to solve, framing the discussion around key translational challenges rather than modeling techniques. We critically evaluate the strengths, limitations, and data gaps of current approaches emphasizing how modeling supports the development of safer and more effective therapies.

    "abstract": "A biofilm is a self-contained community of bacteria that uses signaling molecules called autoinducers (AIs) to coordinate responses through the process of quorum sensing. Biofilms exhibit a dual role that drives interest in both combating antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and leveraging their potential in bioprocessing, since their products can have commercial potential. Previous work has demonstrated how the distinct anisotropic channel geometry in some biofilms affects AIs propagation therein. In this paper, a 2D anisotropic biofilm channel model is extended to be a time-varying channel (TVC), in order to represent the diffusion dynamics during the maturation phase when water channels develop. Since maturation is associated with the development of anisotropy, the time-varying model captures the shift from isotropic to anisotropic diffusion. Particle-based simulation results illustrate how the TVC is a hybrid scenario incorporating propagation features of both isotropic and anisotropic diffusion. This hybrid behavior aligns with biofilm maturation. Further study of the TVC includes characterization of the mutual information (MI), which reveals that an increased AI count, reduced transmitter -- receiver distance, greater degree of anisotropy, and shorter inter-symbol interference lengths increase the MI. Finally, a brief dimensional analysis demonstrates the scalability of the anisotropic channel results for larger biofilms and timescales.",

In sheared amorphous solids, self-organization is established by the emergence of a persistent system of mechanical instabilities that can repeatedly be triggered by the driving, leading to a state of high mechanical reversibility. As a result of self-organization, the response of the system becomes correlated with the dynamics of its environment, which can be viewed as a sensing mechanism of the system's environment. Such phenomena emerge across a wide variety of soft matter systems, suggesting that they are generic and hence may depend very little on the underlying specifics. We review self-organization in driven amorphous solids, concluding with a discussion of what self-organization in driven disordered systems can teach us about how simple organisms sense and adapt to their changing environments.",

    "abstract": "During development, embryonic tissues experience mechanical stresses ranging from cellular to supracellular length scales. In response, cells generate active forces that drive rearrangements, allowing the tissue to relax accumulated stresses. The nature of these responses depends strongly on the magnitude and duration of the deformation, giving rise to the tissue's characteristic viscoelastic behavior. Although experiments have characterized tissue rheology in various contexts, simpler theoretical approaches that directly connect cellular activity to emergent rheological behavior are still limited. In this study, we employ a vertex-based model of epithelial tissue incorporating active force fluctuations in cell vertices to represent cell motility. We capture distinct rounding dynamics and motility-dependent timescales by benchmarking against experimental observations such as the bulging of presomitic mesoderm (PSM) explants driven by Fibroblast Growth Factor(FGF) gradients. Stress relaxation tests reveal rapid short-timescale relaxation alongside persistent long-timescale residual stresses that decrease from anterior to posterior (AP) region of the PSM. By applying oscillatory shear, we analyzed the resulting elastic and viscous responses, revealing motility dependence of storage and loss modulus. Finally, we introduce spatially patterned cues applied in a temporally pulsed manner, mimicking dynamic biochemical or mechanical signals during development. Our results show that while higher motility promotes tissue remodeling in response to these cues, this response is constrained by spatial scale; cellular-scale perturbations are relaxed irrespective of motility strength, preventing complete morphological adaptation.",

    "abstract": "Effective metabolic waste clearance and maintaining ionic homeostasis are essential for the health and normal function of the central nervous system. To understand its mechanism and the role of fluid flow, we develop a multidomain electro-osmotic model of optic-nerve microcirculation that couples hydrostatic and osmotic fluid transport with electro-diffusive solute movement across axons, glia, the extracellular space, and arterial/venous/capillary perivascular spaces. Cerebrospinal fluid enters the optic nerve via the arterial parivascular space, passes both the glial and ECS before exiting through the venous parivascular space. Exchanges across astrocytic endfeet are essential and they occur in two distinct and coupled paths: through AQP4 on glial membranes and gaps between glial endfeet, thus establishing a mechanistic substrate for two modes of glymphatic transport, at rest and during stimulus-evoked perturbations. Parameter sweeps show that lowering AQP4-mediated fluid permeability or PVS permeability elevates pressure, suppresses radial exchange and slows clearance, effects most pronounced for solutes reliant on PVS V export. The model reproduces baseline and stimulus-evoked flow and demonstrates that PVS-mediated export is the primary clearance route for both small and moderate solutes. Small molecules clear faster because rapid ECS diffusion broadens their distribution and enhances ECS PVS exchange, whereas moderate species have low ECS diffusivity, depend on transendfoot transfer, and clear more slowly via PVS V convection. Our framework can also be used to explain the sleep-wake effect mechanistically: enlarging ECS volume or permeability increases transinterface flux and accelerates waste removal.",

While much work has focused on molecular kinetics and passive mechanisms of pattern formation, the role of active mechanical control in patterning and discrimination remains underexplored. We develop a minimal continuum model coupling receptor binding kinetics, membrane deformation, and cytoskeletal forces, with elastohydrodynamic flow in the synaptic cleft. Numerical simulations and scaling analysis reveal that contractile cortical flows arrest coarsening and stabilize long-lived multifocal clusters, whereas active pulling accelerates cluster dissolution and elevates background receptor binding.

    "abstract": "Cell shape changes are largely controlled by the actin cytoskeleton, a dynamic filament network beneath the plasma membrane. Several cell types can form extended free-standing protrusions not supported by an extracellular substrate or matrix, and regulated by proteins that modulate cytoskeletal dynamics in a way sensitive to the curvature of the cell membrane. We develop a theoretical model for the mechanics of a free-standing viscous actin network growing on a corrugated membrane. The model couples the dynamics of the viscous active gel with membrane deformation and the recruitment of curvature-sensitive actin nucleators. We show that an actin layer polymerising uniformly on the membrane always exerts a stabilising effect that reduces membrane deformation. However, curvature-sensitive actin nucleator proteins can render the membrane linearly unstable, depending on the interplay between membrane and actin dynamics, giving rise to spontaneous membrane deformation which could initiate extended free-standing cellular protrusion.",

    "abstract": "Left-right axis specification is a vital part of embryonic development that establishes the left and the right sides of an embryo. Asymmetric organ morphogenesis follows asymmetric signaling cascades, which in turn follow asymmetric events on the cellular scale. In a recent study, Badih et al.\\ reported cell-scale movement asymmetries in spontaneously rotating pairs of endothelial cells confined to a circular fibronectin-coated island. Importantly, the authors demonstrate that cytoskeletal contractility modulates the chirality bias. The relative simplicity of the experimental setup make it a perfect testing ground for the physical forces that could endow this system with rotational movement and biases, but these forces have yet to be stated. We model self-propelling biological cells migrating in response to confinement, polarity, and pairwise repulsive forces. For the first time, we are able to reproduce not only the coherent angular movement of a confined pair of cells biased in a direction but also a contractility-modulated chirality bias. To arrive at these modeling results, two key assumptions are needed: an intrinsic orientation bias (previously observed in other cellular systems), and a difference between the cells in their velocity alignment response, which endows the system with a difference in the timescales of dynamics. Tuning the timescale (or strength) of polarity response relative to the remaining forces (confinement and cell-cell interaction), can amplify or reverse the CW bias. We present a coherent theory, based on dynamical system analysis, that captures chirality emergence in a singlet and doublet cell system.",

    "abstract": "Aims. Resistance to targeted therapies remains a major challenge in EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Here, we describe a novel metabolic adaptation in osimertinib-resistant cells characterized by elevated acetate levels and activation of an unconventional pyruvate-acetaldehyde-acetate (PAA) shunt. Methods. Integrated transcriptomic, exometabolomic, and functional analyses reveal suppression of canonical metabolic pathways and upregulation of ALDH2 and ALDH7A1, that mediate the NADP+-dependent oxidation of acetaldehyde to acetate, generating NADPH. Results. This shift generates reducing power essential for biosynthesis and redox balance under conditions of oxidative pentose phosphate inhibition. These metabolic changes promote endurance in resistant cells and rewire the interplay between glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway, and the tricarboxylic acid cycle, offering a de novo bypass for anaplerosis and bioenergetics. Systematic metabolite profiling revealed distinct transcriptomic and metabolic signatures distinguishing resistant from drug sensitive parental cells. Conclusions. Together, these findings depict a unique, resistance-driven adaptive metabolic shift and uncover potential therapeutic vulnerabilities in osimertinib-resistant NSCLC.",

    "abstract": "Modeling the dynamics of cellular differentiation is fundamental to advancing the understanding and treatment of diseases associated with this process, such as cancer. With the rapid growth of single-cell datasets, this has also become a particularly promising and active domain for machine learning. Current state-of-the-art models, however, rely on computationally expensive optimal transport preprocessing and multi-stage training, while also not discovering explicit gene interactions. To address these challenges we propose Cell-Mechanistic Neural Networks (Cell-MNN), an encoder-decoder architecture whose latent representation is a locally linearized ODE governing the dynamics of cellular evolution from stem to tissue cells. Cell-MNN is fully end-to-end (besides a standard PCA pre-processing) and its ODE representation explicitly learns biologically consistent and interpretable gene interactions. Empirically, we show that Cell-MNN achieves competitive performance on single-cell benchmarks, surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in scaling to larger datasets and joint training across multiple datasets, while also learning interpretable gene interactions that we validate against the TRRUST database of gene interactions.",

    "abstract": "The biofilms response on active attachment surfaces (submerged plant leaves) and inert attachment surfaces (biomimetic plant glass attachment surfaces) and their effects on PAHs and nitrogen transformation under the application conditions of bactericide, algaecide and PAHs were investigated by lab simulated hydroponics and high-throughput molecular biology methods in Vallisneria natans (VN), Hydrilla verticillata (HV) and biomimetic plants (BP) systems. Results showed that the introduction of bactericide, algaecide and PAHs changed the microorganism composition in biofilm, the presence or absence of submerged plants was the primary factor causing differences in microbial communities. Moreover, the microbial diversity and endemic species of biomimetic plant biofilms were higher than those of submerged plant systems, indicating that submerged plants have selectively induced the reconstruction of biofilm-leaves. The introduction of bactericide, algaecide and PAHs leads to abnormal accumulation of TP and NH3-N in overlying water, as well as NO3-N and TP content in sediment. However, submerged plants can weaken and alleviate the stress effects of these factors on nitrogen and phosphorus conversion. Compared to the inert biomimetic plant glass surface, the presence of active surfaces in submerged plants results in a much higher abundance of PAHs degrading bacteria (Sphingomonas and Novosphingobium) and nitrogen converting bacteria (e.g. denitrifying bacteria of Methylophilus, Methylotenera, Flavobacterium, Hydrogenophaga, Aquabacterium, and nitrogen-fixing bacteria of Rhizobium, Azoarcus, Rhizobacter, Azonexus) in biofilm-leaves of submerged plants after the addition of bactericide, algaecide and PAHs. Coupled degradation of PAHs and nitrogen occurs, which is beneficial for the treatment of combined pollution caused by PAHs and nitrogen.",

By tracking the nuclei, the three-dimensional trajectory of the cellular movement was reconstructed and the velocity of the rotation was quantified. The presence of focal adhesion clusters and prominent actin stress fibers were observed at the basal side of the organoids, suggesting the interactions between the cells and the surrounding extracellular matrix. Finally, our inhibition study showed the dependence of pancreatic ductal organoid rotational migration on myosin activity, actin polymerization, and actin branching.

CCI is characterized by prolonged organ dysfunction, weight loss, and persistent increased vulnerability to infection. Recent data has shown that patients with CCI generally exhibit persistent immune dysfunction, characterized by prolonged elevation of specific pro-inflammatory cytokines. In this paper, we introduce a host response model that couples hematopoiesis dynamics with immune response to infection. Specifically, we incorporate the reactions between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory signals with specific hematopoietic stem cell compartments with a reduced model of acute inflammation. We found that a maladaptive hematopoietic response to pathogenic insult is able to qualitatively reproduce similar behavior to that seen in CCI patients, namely the presence of a persistent, elevated level of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This suggests that maladaptive hematopoietic responses in vivo may play a role in the development of CCI.",

Although experimental and systems-immunology studies have cataloged many molecular and cellular actors involved in an immune response, the design principles governing how the speed and magnitude of T-cell responses emerge from cellular decision-making remain elusive. Here, we recast the T-cell response as a feedback-controlled program, wherein the rates of activation, proliferation, differentiation and death are regulated through antigenic, pro- and anti-inflammatory cues. By exploring a broad class of feedback-controller designs as potential immune programs, we demonstrate how the speed and magnitude of T-cell responses emerge from optimizing signal-feedback to protect against diverse infection settings. We recover an inherent trade-off: infection clearance at the cost of immunopathology. We show how this trade-off is encoded into the logic of T-cell responses by hierarchical sensitivity to different immune signals. Notably, we find that designs that balance harm from acute infections and autoimmunity produce immune responses consistent with experimentally observed patterns of T-cell effector expansion in mice. Extending our model to immune-based T-cell therapies for cancer tumors, we identify a trade-off between the affinity for tumor antigens (\"quality\") and the abundance (\"quantity\") of infused T-cells necessary for effective treatment. Finally, we show how therapeutic efficacy can be improved by targeted genetic perturbations to T-cells. Our findings offer a unified control-logic for cytotoxic T-cell responses and point to specific regulatory programs that can be engineered for more robust T-cell therapies.",

Here, we model the extension of actin-based protrusions in chemotaxis as an optimisation problem, wherein cells balance the detection of chemical gradients with the energetic cost of protrusion formation. Our model, built on the assumption of energy minimisation, provides a framework that successfully reproduces experimentally observed patterns of protrusive activity across a range of biological systems and environmental conditions, suggesting that energetic efficiency may underpin the morphology and chemotactic behaviour of motile eukaryotic cells. Additionally, we leverage the model to generate novel predictions regarding cellular responses to other, experimentally untested environmental perturbations, providing testable hypotheses for future experimental work that may be used to validate and refine the model presented here.",

The evolution of these networks was found to be susceptible to specific mechanical and molecular stimuli. Yet, in all circumstances, the size of compressed islands followed a power-law distribution that is well-captured by network theory, and implies self-organization and proximity to criticality.

A cadherin dimer plus associated catenins connecting two cells is represented as a spring whose ends experience drag with respect to the moving actin cytoskeleton. The cytoskeleton is modeled as a contractile gel driven by myosin activity in its bulk and forces from adhesion on its boundaries. Our model captures this bidirectional coupling via a coarse-grained continuum framework and reveals a range of observed cell- and tissue-scale behaviors. These include global cell polarization of the multicellular collective, other polarization patterns and oscillatory dynamics, spontaneously formed actin rings within cells, and supracellular stress chains. Many of these features arise from modeling the direct mechanical coupling between cytoskeleton and adhesion. This model can be extended to other adhesion-cytoskeleton feedback systems and used to advance our understanding of multicellular tissue dynamics, particularly during development.",

    "abstract": "Dinoflagellates are marine phytoplankton that emit flashes of light in response to flow-induced deformation; they are responsible for illuminating breaking-waves, wakes of ships, and other intensely turbulent spots of the upper ocean. Here, we ask how bioluminescence is affected by the fluctuating nature of turbulence -- a question motivated by the dependence of emitted flashes on both the extent and rate of deformation. Introducing a light-emitting dumbbell as a minimal model, we study the Lagrangian dynamics of flashing in a homogeneous isotropic turbulent flow, and contrast it with that in an extensional flow and a Gaussian random flow. We show that turbulent fluctuations strongly enhance bioluminescence, while introducing a Poisson-like stochasticity in the flashing dynamics. Furthermore, the intermittent fluctuations of the velocity-gradient subjects the dinoflagellate to bursts of extreme straining and produces bright flashes -- more intense, though less frequent, than what would result from Gaussian fluctuations. Our results suggest that radiant displays of marine bioluminescence are strongly promoted by turbulence and its dissipation-scale intermittency.",

    "abstract": "Cancer is a complex sequence of disease conditions progressing gradually with generalized loss of growth control. It continues to be one of the biggest global health problems, and its etiology has given rise to a huge array of treatment outside of conventional chemotherapy. Melanoma is one of the deadliest forms of skin cancer originating from melanocytes. It is characterized by the overproduction of melanin by the increased in cell proliferation. Melanogenesis, the production of melanin is by melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) which stimulates cyclic AMP (cAMP) production to increase melanocyte production. Through the use of methylxanthines, theophylline proliferation rate can be decreased by increasing cell differentiation. One of the basic principles of cell biology is the selectivity of differentiation and proliferation, where cells usually grow or differentiate but not both. This study aimed to collect baseline data of untreated B16-F10 melanoma cells to determine morphology and doubling time of untreated cells. This data was further compared to results from varied concentration treatments of theophylline. It was hypothesized that increased levels in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) could induce differentiation of melanocytes to terminate proliferation. To test this hypothesis, we collected a series of images of B16- F10 derived from mouse melanoma cells and seeded cells into a 12-well plate to calculate cell concentration for a five-day period and doubling time for untreated cells. Theophylline levels were varied to stimulate the production of cAMP and determine its effect on melanocyte proliferation and differentiation. The observed results showed that intracellular stabilization of cAMP, via phosphodiesterase inhibition by methylxanthines like theophylline, increases cell differentiation on melanoma cells and suppresses their growth.",

    "abstract": "Human language is one of the most expressive tools for conveying intent, yet most artificial or biological systems lack mechanisms to interpret or respond meaningfully to it. Bridging this gap could enable more natural forms of control over complex, decentralized systems. In AI and artificial life, recent work explores how language can specify high-level goals, but most systems still depend on engineered rewards, task-specific supervision, or rigid command sets, limiting generalization to novel instructions. Similar constraints apply in synthetic biology and bioengineering, where the locus of control is often genomic rather than environmental perturbation.   A key open question is whether artificial or biological collectives can be guided by free-form natural language alone, without task-specific tuning or carefully designed evaluation metrics. We provide one possible answer here by showing, for the first time, that simple agents' collective behavior can be guided by free-form language prompts: one AI model transforms an imperative prompt into an intervention that is applied to simulated cells; a second AI model scores how well the prompt describes the resulting cellular dynamics; and the former AI model is evolved to improve the scores generated by the latter.   Unlike previous work, our method does not require engineered fitness functions or domain-specific prompt design. We show that the evolved system generalizes to unseen prompts without retraining. By treating natural language as a control layer, the system suggests a future in which spoken or written prompts could direct computational, robotic, or biological systems to desired behaviors. This work provides a concrete step toward this vision of AI-biology partnerships, in which language replaces mathematical objective functions, fixed rules, and domain-specific programming.",

Although numerous microfluidic setups have been developed to study cell proliferation at the single-cell level, most of them are optimized for use on adherent cells. Here, we present a device to track the proliferation of suspension cells, featuring an array of microchannels that trap cells, easing their monitoring while allowing for controlled growth conditions. Each microchannel, whose geometry has been optimized through computational fluid dynamics simulations, allows a single cell to enter and proliferate while maintaining a continuous flow of nutrients, ensuring long-term monitoring over multiple generations. We show the advantages of this system in characterizing the proliferation of human leukemia T-cells. In particular, we follow the growth and division over multiple generations, finding that cells exhibit a slightly asymmetric volume division where deviations in the size are compensated by a size-like division strategy. Overall, our device design can be easily adapted and used to study different cell types and sizes while maintaining the same high trapping efficiency.",

    "abstract": "This paper addresses a profoundly challenging inverse problem that has remained largely unexplored due to its mathematical complexity: the unique identification of all unknown coefficients in a coupled nonlinear system of mixed parabolic-elliptic-elliptic type using only boundary measurements. The system models attraction-repulsion chemotaxis--an advanced mathematical biology framework for studying sophisticated cellular processes--yet despite its significant practical importance, the corresponding inverse problem has never been investigated, representing a true frontier in the field. The mixed-type nature of this system introduces significant theoretical difficulties that render conventional methodologies inadequate, demanding fundamental extensions beyond existing techniques developed for simpler, purely parabolic models. Technically, the problem presents formidable obstacles: the coupling between parabolic and elliptic components creates inherent analytical complications, while the nonlinear structure resists standard approaches. From an applied perspective, the biological relevance adds another layer of complexity, as solutions must maintain physical interpretability through non-negativity constraints. Our work provides a complete theoretical framework for this challenging problem, establishing rigorous unique identifiability results that create a one-to-one correspondence between boundary data and the model's parameters. We demonstrate the power of our general theory through a central biological application: the full parameter recovery for an attraction-repulsion chemotaxis model with logistic growth, thus opening new avenues for quantitative analysis in mathematical biology.",

    "abstract": "Biophotonics-and more recently, biointegrated photonics-offer transformative tools for probing cellular processes with unprecedented precision. Among these, whispering gallery mode (WGM) resonators-optical microcavities formed in spherical structures-have emerged as powerful biosensors and intracellular barcodes. Lipid droplets (LDs), with their high refractive index and intrinsic spherical geometry, are ideal candidates for supporting intracellular lasing. Although lasing in LDs has been previously demonstrated, it has not yet been harnessed to study live cell biology. Here, we report the first use of WGM resonances in LDs of live primary adipocytes, employing a continuous-wave (CW) laser at powers below the biological damage threshold. By measuring these resonances, we achieved nanometer-scale precision in size estimation, enabling real-time observation of rapid LD dynamics and deformations on the minute scale, far beyond the spatio-temporal resolution of conventional microscopy. We systematically characterized this photonic sensing approach, demonstrating its ability to resolve adipocyte heterogeneity, monitor lipolytic responses to forskolin and isoproterenol, and detect early signs of cell viability loss, well before conventional assays. This proof-of-concept establishes intracellular LD WGM resonances as a robust platform for investigating live single-cell metabolism. The technique enables rapid, cost-effective assessment of adipocyte function, reveals cell-to-cell variability obscured by bulk assays, and lays the foundation for high-throughput analysis of metabolism- and obesity-related diseases at both cellular and tissue levels.",

Here we elucidate how RBC movement through fibrous microporous structures is influenced by cell aggregation agents, emphasizing the impact of their clustering, membrane flexibility, and confinement. By varying the volume fraction of the RBC (hematocrit) and aggregation strength, we reveal a surprising phase separation: a dense RBC core surrounded by a cell-free layer, an effect not previously reported in whole blood studies. This separation is shown to be more pronounced with rigidified cells and persists even at high hematocrit levels, unlike in healthy samples. By connecting RBC deformability and aggregability to pore-mediated phase dynamics, our study provides a foundation for new diagnostic tools capable of classifying blood disorders or evaluating blood quality using only a sheet of structured paper, seamlessly integrating fundamental fluid mechanics with translational biomedical innovation in a previously unexplored manner.",

In order to perform chemotaxis effectively in different environments, cells need to adapt to different concentrations. We present a model of gradient sensing where the affinity of receptor-ligand binding is increased when a protein binds to the receptor's cytosolic side. This interior protein (allosteric factor) alters the sensitivity of the cell, allowing the cell to adapt to different ligand concentrations. We propose a reaction scheme where the cell alters the allosteric factor's availability to adapt the average fraction of bound receptors to 1/2. We calculate bounds on the chemotactic accuracy of the cell, and find that the cell can reach near-optimal chemotaxis over a broad range of concentrations. We find that the accuracy of chemotaxis depends strongly on the diffusion of the allosteric compound relative to other reaction rates. From this, we also find a trade-off between adaptation time and gradient sensing accuracy.",

    "abstract": "To rapidly coordinate collective behaviors in tissues, cells communicate with one another through traveling fronts of signaling activity called trigger waves. The stimulus threshold for wave propagation is a key biological parameter that determines when the system produces a global response to a local stimulus. However, it is unclear how this stimulus threshold is determined by the properties of the underlying signaling network. To address this gap, we studied a model of trigger waves with a realistic Hill-type auto-activation function. We obtained an analytic expression for the wave ignition threshold in 1D and numerical solutions in 2D and 3D. In the limit of high sensitivity, we found that the trigger wave threshold depends on both the effective dissociation constant, $K_D$, and the effective Hill coefficient, $n$, of the positive feedback circuit, with the dominant contribution scaling as $K_D^{n/(n-1)}$ in all dimensions. This result leads to a simple method for predicting the trigger wave ignition threshold from bulk activation data and is potentially of use for developing synthetic trigger wave circuits with desired sensitivities.",

The relationship between force and motion remains unclear, however, because the forces are a sum active and passive contributions. Here, we show that the active forces can be decoupled from the passive by careful investigation of the distribution of shear stress against strain rate. With this method, we show experimentally that the order of magnitude of passive tissue viscosity is 100 Pa-hr and that increasing (decreasing) the actomyosin cytoskeleton and cell-cell adhesions increase (decrease) the magnitude of tissue viscosity. These results establish tissue viscosity as a meaningful way to describe the mechanical behavior of epithelial tissues, and demonstrate a direct relationship between tissue microstructure and material properties. By providing the first experimental measurement of tissue viscosity, our study separates the active and passive components of stress, in turn clarifying the relationship between force and motion and providing a new means of identifying how active cell forces evolve in space and time.",

    "abstract": "Collective cell migration is a fundamental biological process that drives events such as embryonic development, wound healing, and cancer metastasis. In this study, we develop a biophysically informed phase-field model to investigate the collective migration of the border cell cluster in the Drosophila melanogaster egg chamber. Our model captures key aspects of the egg chamber architecture, including the oocyte, nurse cells, and surrounding epithelium, and incorporates both mechanical forces and biochemical cues that guide cell migration. We introduce the Tangential Interface Migration (TIM) force which captures contact-mediated propulsion generated along interfaces between the border cell cluster and surrounding nurse cells. Our simulations reveal three key features of TIM-driven migration that distinguish it from previous forms of chemotaxis: (1) the necessity of border cell-nurse cell overlap to initiate movement (i.e., border cells cannot move without a nurse cell substrate), (2) motion is tangential to border cell-nurse cell interfaces, and (3) persistent migration even in regions where the spatial slope of chemoattractant is decreasing. Additionally, we demonstrate that with or without geometry-mediated alterations in chemoattractant distribution such as at intercellular junctions we can vary induced migration pauses, independent of mechanical confinement. We capture an experimentally observed transition to dorsal migration at the oocyte with a sustained medio-lateral chemical cue of small amplitude. The results show how spatial constraints and interfacial forces shape collective cell movement and highlight the utility of phase-field models in capturing the interplay between tissue geometry, contact forces, and chemical signaling.",

Here, we study microbial evolution in partially predictable environments using proteome allocation models that capture the trade-off between growth rate and lag time during environmental transitions. We demonstrate that evolution drives populations toward an evolutionary stable allocation strategy that minimizes resource depletion time, thereby balancing faster growth with shorter adaptation delays. In environments with temporal structure, populations evolve to learn the statistical patterns of environmental transitions through proteome pre-allocation, with the evolved allocations reflecting the transition probabilities between conditions. Our framework reveals how microbial populations can extract and exploit environmental predictability without explicit neural computation, using the proteome as a distributed memory system that encodes environmental patterns. This work demonstrates how information-theoretic principles govern cellular resource allocation and provides a mechanistic foundation for understanding learning-like behavior in evolving biological systems.",

Some of these are essentially computational, including classification and control tasks. We place these findings in the broader context of physical computing, an emerging framework for describing how the native dynamics of nonlinear physical systems can be leveraged to perform complex computations.

    "abstract": "The positioning of new cellular walls during cell division plays a key role in shaping plant tissue organization. The influence of cell geometry on the positioning of division planes has been previously captured into various geometrical rules. Accordingly, linking cell shape to division orientation has relied on the comparison between observed division patterns and predictions under specific rules. The need to define a priori the tested rules is a fundamental limitation of this hypothesis-driven approach. As an alternative, we introduce a data-based approach to investigate the relation between cell geometry and division plane positioning, exploiting the ability of deep neural network to learn complex relationships across multidimensional spaces. Adopting an image-based cell representation, we show how division patterns can be learned and predicted from mother cell geometry using a UNet architecture modified to operate on cell masks. Using synthetic data and A. thaliana embryo cells, we evaluate the model performances on a wide range of diverse cell shapes and division patterns. We find that the trained model accounted for embryo division patterns that were previously irreconcilable under existing geometrical rules. Our work shows the potential of deep networks to understand cell division patterns and to generate new hypotheses on the control of cell division positioning.",

    "abstract": "Cells are constantly exposed to diverse stimuli-chemical, mechanical, or electrical-that guide their movement. In physiological conditions, these signals often overlap, as seen during infections, where neutrophils and dendritic cells navigate through multiple chemotactic fields. How cells integrate and prioritize competing signals remains unclear. For instance, in the presence of opposing chemoattractant gradients, how do cells decide which direction to go? When should local signals dominate distant ones? A key factor in these processes is the precision with which cells sense each gradient, which depends non-monotonically on concentrations. Here, we study how gradient sensing accuracy shapes cell navigation in the presence of two distinct chemoattractant sources. We model cells as active random walkers that sense local gradients and combine these estimates to reorient their movement. Our results show that cells sensing multiple gradients can display a range of chemotactic behaviors, including anisotropic spatial patterns and varying degrees of confinement, depending on gradient shape and source location. The model also predicts cases where cells exhibit multistep navigation across sources or a hierarchical response toward one source, driven by disparities in their sensitivity to each chemoattractant. These findings highlight the role of gradient sensing in shaping spatial organization and navigation strategies in multi-field chemotaxis.",

    "abstract": "The process of programmed cell death, namely apoptosis, is a natural mechanism that regulates healthy tissue, multicellular structures, and homeostasis. An improved understanding of apoptosis can significantly enhance our knowledge of biological processes and systems. For instance, pathogens can manipulate the apoptotic process to either evade immune detection or to facilitate their spread. Furthermore, of particular clinical interest is the ability of cancer cells to evade apoptosis, hence allowing them to survive and proliferate uncontrollably. Thus, in this work, we propose a phase-field framework for simulating intrinsic or extrinsic apoptosis induced by an activation field, including deriving the configurational mechanics underlying such phenomena. Along with exploring varying conditions needed to initiate or reduce apoptosis, this can serve as a starting point for computational therapeutic testing. To showcase model capabilities, we present simulations exhibiting different types of cellular dynamics produced when varying the mechanisms underlying apoptosis. The model is subsequently applied to probe different morphological transitions, such as cell shrinkage, membrane blebbing, cavity formation and fragmentation. Lastly, we compare the characteristics observed in our simulations to electron microscopy images, providing additional support for the model.",

    "abstract": "Accurate modeling of microbial growth curves is essential for understanding and optimizing bioprocesses in biotechnology and environmental engineering. While classical monoauxic models such as Monod, Boltzmann, and Gompertz are widely used, they often lack biological interpretability or fail to capture the complex, multiphasic growth patterns observed in systems with mixed substrates or microbial communities. This paper presents a methodological framework for reparametrizing the Boltzmann and Gompertz equations, assigning direct biological significance to each parameter and enabling their application to both monoauxic and polyauxic (multi-phase) growth scenarios. Polyauxic growth is modeled as a weighted sum of sigmoidal functions, with constraints for model identifiability and biological plausibility. Robust parameter estimation is achieved using a Lorentzian loss function, combined with a global-local optimization strategy (Particle Swarm Optimization and Nelder-Mead), and systematic outlier exclusion using the ROUT method. Model parsimony is enforced via established information criteria. This workflow enables reliable, reproducible, and interpretable extraction of kinetic parameters from complex growth data and is broadly applicable to other fields where sigmoidal patterns are observed.",

    "abstract": "Early identification of cardiomyocyte dysfunction is a critical challenge for the prognosis of diastolic heart failure (DHF) exhibiting impaired left ventricular relaxation (ILVR). Myocardial relaxation relies strongly on efficient intracellular calcium (${\\text{Ca}}^{2+}$) handling. During diastole, a sluggish removal of ${\\text{Ca}}^{2+}$ from cardiomyocytes disrupts sarcomere relaxation, leading to ILVR \\textit{at the organ level}. Characterizing myocardial relaxation \\textit{at the cellular level} requires analyzing both sarcomere length (SL) transients and intracellular calcium kinetics (CK). However, due to the complexity and redundancy in SL and CK data, identifying the most informative features for accurate classification is challenging. To address this, we developed a robust feature selection pipeline involving statistical significance testing (p-values), hierarchical clustering, and feature importance evaluation using random forest (RF) classification to select the most informative features from SL and CK data. SL and CK transients were obtained from prior studies involving a transgenic phospho-ablated mouse model exhibiting ILVR (AAA mice) and wild-type as non-transgenic control mice (NTG). By iteratively refining the feature set, we trained a RF classifier using the selected reduced features. For comparison, we evaluated the performance of the classifier using the full set of original features as well as a dimensionally reduced set derived through principal component analysis (PCA). The confusion matrices demonstrated that the reduced feature set achieved comparable performance to the full feature set and outperformed the PCA-based approach, while offering better interpretability by retaining biologically relevant features. These findings suggest that a small, carefully chosen set of biological features can effectively detect early signs of cardiomyocyte dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "Background: In vitro endothelial cell culture is widely used to study angiogenesis. Histomicrographic images of cell networks are often analyzed manually, a process that is time-consuming and subjective. Automated tools like ImageJ (NIH) can assist, but are often slow and inaccurate. Additionally, as endothelial networks grow more complex, traditional architectural metrics may not fully reflect network maturity. To address these limitations, we developed tubuleTracker, a software tool that quantifies endothelial network architecture and maturity rapidly and objectively. Methods: Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were cultured in an extracellular matrix, and 54 images were acquired using phase contrast microscopy. Each image was analyzed manually by three independent reviewers, and by both ImageJ and tubuleTracker. Key metrics included tubule count, total length, node count, tubule area, and vessel circularity. In parallel, trained scientists rated each image for angiogenesis maturity on a 1-5 scale (1 = most mature). Results: Analysis time per image differed significantly: manual (8 min), ImageJ (58+/-4 s), and tubuleTracker (6+/-2 s) (p<0.0001). Significant differences were also found in tubule count (manual 168+/-SD, tubuleTracker 92+/-SD, ImageJ 433+/-SD), length, and node count (all p<0.0001). tubuleTracker's metrics varied significantly across angiogenesis maturity scores, including tubule count, length, node count, area, and circularity (all p<0.0001). Conclusions: tubuleTracker was faster and more consistent than both manual and ImageJ-based analysis. Vessel circularity proved especially effective in capturing angiogenesis maturity. tubuleTracker is available as free shareware for the biomedical research community.",

While negatively phototactic cells swim directly away from a collimated light beam, when presented with two beams of adjustable intersection angle and intensities, we find that cells swim in a direction given by an intensity-weighted average of the two light propagation vectors. This geometrical law is a fixed point of an adaptive model of phototaxis and minimizes the average light intensity falling on the anterior pole of the cell. At large angular separations, subpopulations of cells swim away from one source or the other, or along the direction of the geometrical law, with some cells stochastically switching between the three directions. This behavior is shown to arise from a population-level distribution of photoreceptor locations that breaks front-back symmetry of photoreception.",

Despite microstructural disorder, simulated creep curves converge toward a universal set of proportionality factors. The results indicate that directional creep behavior cannot be attributed solely to tissue-scale topology, and that realistic predictions require the inclusion of non-linear material responses at stress concentration sites.",

By leveraging the method of electrospinning, the research aims to investigate polymer composites with enhanced interfacial properties, improved double-layer capacitance, and adequate biocompatibility. Electrospun polyacrylonitrile (PAN) NFs embedded with Fe2O3 and MnZn ferrite NPs were comprehensively characterized using advanced techniques, i.e., Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and alternating gradient field magnetometry (AGFM). The incorporation of metal oxide NPs led to significant changes in the thermal, spectroscopic, and morphological properties of the NFs. XPS analysis confirmed increased oxidation, graphitic carbon content, and the formation of new nitrogen functionalities after heat treatment. Furthermore, interactions between nitrile groups and metal ions were observed, indicating the influence of nanoparticles on surface chemistry. Magnetic characterization demonstrated the potential of these composite NFs to generate magnetic fields for biomedical manipulation. Cytocompatibility studies revealed no significant impact on the viability or morphology of human mesenchymal stromal cells, highlighting their biocompatibility.

Integrating such multimodal data provides unprecedented insights into cellular identity, regulatory processes, and disease mechanisms. However, it remains challenging, as current methods often rely on selecting highly variable genes or peaks during preprocessing, which may inadvertently discard crucial biological information. Here, we present scMamba, a foundation model designed to integrate single-cell multi-omics data without the need for prior feature selection while preserving genomic positional information. scMamba introduces a patch-based cell tokenization strategy that treats genomics regions as words (tokens) and cells as sentences. Building upon the concept of state space duality, scMamba distills rich biological insights from high-dimensional, sparse single-cell multi-omics data. Additionally, our novel contrastive learning approach, enhanced with cosine similarity regularization, enables superior alignment across omics layers compared to traditional methods. Systematic benchmarking across multiple datasets demonstrates that scMamba significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in preserving biological variation, aligning omics layers, and enhancing key downstream tasks such as clustering, cell type annotation, and trajectory inference. Our findings position scMamba as a powerful tool for large-scale single-cell multi-omics integration, capable of handling large-scale atlases and advancing biological discovery.",

This framework infers exocytosis profiles directly from cell morphology and elastic stretches, formulated as an initial value problem based on the self-similarity condition. Applying the model to Medicago truncatula root hairs, moss Physcomitrium patens protonemata, and hyphoid-like shapes, we find that exocytosis peaks at the tip in tapered cells but shifts to an annular region away from the apex in flatter-tip cells beyond a threshold. The model generalizes previous fluid models and provides a mechanistic link between exocytosis distribution and cell shape, explaining observed variations in tip-growing cells across species.",

    "abstract": "We present a coarse-grained stochastic model for axonal extension on periodic arrays of parallel micropatterns that integrates three key biophysical mechanisms: (i) the molecular clutch that couples actin retrograde flow to substrate adhesions, (ii) an active biopolymer-based mechanism generating traction-force fluctuations, and (iii) the mechanical interaction of the growth cone with the micropatterned substrate. Using the Shannon-Jaynes maximum entropy principle with constraints derived from experimental observations, we derive a unique probability distribution for the colored acceleration noise that enters the Langevin equation. The resulting stationary process exhibits power-law temporal correlations with negative exponent, which accounts for the observed superdiffusive dynamics of axons. For biologically relevant parameters the model predicts this exponent to be -1/2, in close quantitative agreement with measurements of cortical neurons cultured on patterned substrates.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the interactions between cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM) during collective cell invasion is crucial for advancements in tissue engineering, cancer therapies, and regenerative medicine. This study focuses on the roles of contact guidance and ECM remodelling in directing cell behaviour, with a particular emphasis on exploring how differences in cell phenotype impact collective cell invasion. We present a computationally tractable two-dimensional hybrid model of collective cell migration within the ECM, where cells are modelled as individual entities and collagen fibres as a continuous tensorial field. Our model incorporates random motility, contact guidance, cell-cell adhesion, volume filling, and the dynamic remodelling of collagen fibres through cellular secretion and degradation. Through a comprehensive parameter sweep, we provide valuable insights into how differences in the cell phenotype, in terms of the ability of the cell to migrate, secrete, degrade, and respond to contact guidance cues from the ECM, impacts the characteristics of collective cell invasion.",

    "abstract": "We study single cell E.coli chemotaxis in a spatio-temporally varying attractant environment. Modeling the attractant concentration in the form of a traveling sine wave, we measure in our simulations, the chemotactic drift velocity of the cell for different propagation speed of the attractant wave. We find a highly non-trivial dependence where the chemotactic drift velocity changes sign, and also shows multiple peaks. For slowly moving attractant wave, drift velocity is negative, i.e. the drift motion is directed opposite to wave propagation. As the wave speed increases, drift velocity shows a negative peak, then changes sign, reaches a positive peak and finally becomes zero when the wave moves too fast for the cell to respond. We explain this rich behavior from the difference in attractant gradient perceived by the cell during its run along the propagation direction and opposite to it. In particular, when the cell moves in the same direction as the wave, the relative velocity of the cell with respect to the wave becomes zero when the wave speed matches the run speed. In this limit, the cell is able to ride the wave and experiences no concentration gradient during these runs. On the contrary, for runs in the opposite direction, no such effect is present and the effective gradient increases monotonically with the wave speed. We show, using detailed quantitative measurements, how this difference gives rise to the counter-intuitive behavior of chemotactic drift velocity described above.",

    "abstract": "Multicellular organisms develop a wide variety of highly-specialized cell types. The consistency and robustness of developmental cell fate trajectories suggests that complex gene regulatory networks effectively act as low-dimensional cell fate landscapes. A complementary set of works draws on the theory of dynamical systems to argue that cell fate transitions can be categorized into universal decision-making classes. However, the theory connecting geometric landscapes and decision-making classes to high-dimensional gene expression space is still in its infancy. Here, we introduce a phenomenological model that allows us to identify gene expression signatures of decision-making classes from single-cell RNA-sequencing time-series data. Our model combines low-dimensional gradient-like dynamical systems and high-dimensional Hopfield networks to capture the interplay between cell fate, gene expression, and signaling pathways. We apply our model to the maturation of alveolar cells in mouse lungs to show that the transient appearance of a mixed alveolar type 1/type 2 state suggests the triple cusp decision-making class. We also analyze lineage-tracing data on hematopoetic differentiation and show that bipotent neutrophil-monocyte progenitors likely undergo a heteroclinic flip bifurcation. Our results suggest it is possible to identify universal decision-making classes for cell fate transitions directly from data.",

    "title": "Biological Processes as Exploratory Dynamics",
    "abstract": "Many biological processes can be thought of as the result of an underlying dynamics in which the system repeatedly undergoes distinct and abortive trajectories with the dynamical process only ending when some specific process, purpose, structure or function is achieved. A classic example is the way in which microtubules attach to kinetochores as a prerequisite for chromosome segregation and cell division. In this example, the dynamics is characterized by apparently futile time histories in which microtubules repeatedly grow and shrink without chromosomal attachment. We hypothesize that for biological processes for which it is not the initial conditions that matter, but rather the final state, this kind of exploratory dynamics is biology's unique and necessary solution to achieving these functions with high fidelity. This kind of cause and effect relationship can be contrasted to examples from physics and chemistry where the initial conditions determine the outcome. In this paper, we examine the similarities of many biological processes that depend upon random trajectories starting from the initial state and the selection of subsets of these trajectories to achieve some desired functional final state. We begin by reviewing the long history of the principles of dynamics, first in the context of physics, and then in the context of the study of life. These ideas are then stacked against the broad categories of biological phenomenology that exhibit exploratory dynamics. We then build on earlier work by making a quantitative examination of a succession of increasingly sophisticated models for exploratory dynamics, all of which share the common feature of being a series of repeated trials that ultimately end in a \"winning\" trajectory. We also explore the ways in which microscopic parameters can be tuned to alter exploratory dynamics as well as the energetic burden of performing such processes.",

Far from being passive background processes, metabolic activities actively regulate key immune responses. Fundamental pathways such as glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation critically shape the behavior of immune cells, influencing macrophage polarization, T cell activation, and dendritic cell function. In this review, we synthesize recent advances in immunometabolism, with a focus on the metabolic mechanisms that govern the responses of both innate and adaptive immune cells to bacterial, viral, and fungal pathogens. Drawing on experimental, computational, and integrative methodologies, we highlight how metabolic reprogramming contributes to host defense in response to infection. These findings reveal new opportunities for therapeutic intervention, suggesting that modulation of metabolic pathways could enhance immune function and improve pathogen clearance.",

Modelers employ sensitivity analysis (SA) algorithms to quantify input parameters' impact on model outputs, however, it is hard to perform SA for ABMs due to their computational and complex nature. In this work, we develop the Simulate, Summarize, Reduce, Cluster, and Analyze (SSRCA) methodology, a machine-learning based pipeline designed to facilitate SA for ABMs. In particular, SSRCA can achieve the following tasks for ABMS: 1) identify sensitive model parameters, 2) reveal common output model patterns, and 3) determine which input parameter values generate these patterns. We use an example ABM of tumor spheroid growth to showcase how SSRCA provides similar SA results to the popular Sobol' Method while also identifying four common patterns from the ABM and the parameter regions that generate these outputs. This analysis could streamline data-driven tasks, such as parameter estimation, for ABMs by reducing parameter space. While we highlight these results with an ABM on tumor spheroid formation, the SSRCA methodology is broadly applicable to biological ABMs.",

Such chemotaxis, such as performed by immune cells migrating to a wound site, is complicated by the complex geometry inside living tissues. In this study, we extend our theoretical model of branched-cell migration on a network by introducing chemokine sources to explore the cellular response. The model predicts a speed-accuracy tradeoff, whereby slow cells are significantly more accurate and able to follow efficiently a weak chemoattractant signal. We then compare the model's predictions with experimental observations of neutrophils migrating to the site of laser-inflicted wound in a zebrafish larva fin, and migrating in-vitro inside a regular lattice of pillars. We find that the model captures the details of the sub-cellular response to the chemokine gradient, as well as the large-scale migration response. This comparison suggests that the neutrophils behave as fast cells, compromising their chemotaxis accuracy, which explains the functionality of these immune cells.",

    "abstract": "Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) are an important resource for the identification of new therapeutic targets and cardioprotective drugs. After differentiation iPSC-CMs show an immature, fetal-like phenotype. Cultivation of iPSC-CMs in lipid-supplemented maturation medium (MM) strongly enhances their structural, metabolic and functional phenotype. Nevertheless, assessing iPSC-CM maturation state remains challenging as most methods are time consuming and go in line with cell damage or loss of the sample. To address this issue, we developed a non-invasive approach for automated classification of iPSC-CM maturity through interpretable artificial intelligence (AI)-based analysis of beat characteristics derived from video-based motion analysis. In a prospective study, we evaluated 230 video recordings of early-state, immature iPSC-CMs on day 21 after differentiation (d21) and more mature iPSC-CMs cultured in MM (d42, MM). For each recording, 10 features were extracted using Maia motion analysis software and entered into a support vector machine (SVM). The hyperparameters of the SVM were optimized in a grid search on 80 % of the data using 5-fold cross-validation. The optimized model achieved an accuracy of 99.5 $\\pm$ 1.1 % on a hold-out test set. Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) identified displacement, relaxation-rise time and beating duration as the most relevant features for assessing maturity level. Our results suggest the use of non-invasive, optical motion analysis combined with AI-based methods as a tool to assess iPSC-CMs maturity and could be applied before performing functional readouts or drug testing. This may potentially reduce the variability and improve the reproducibility of experimental studies.",

While some molecular insights have been gained to explain the presence of these assemblies of five or more cells around a common center, what are the tunable, global features that favors/hinders their formation is still largely unknown. Here, we made use of a Voronoi dynamical model to investigate the ingredients driving the emergence of rosettes characterized by different degree of stability and organization. We found that (i) breaking the local spatial symmetry of the system, i.e., introducing curvature-inducing defects, allows for the formation of rosette-like structures (ii) whose probability of formation depends on the characteristic of the cellular layer. In particular, a trade-off between tissue fluidity and single cell deformability dictates the assembly of transient rosettes, that are strongly stabilized in the presence of cell alignment interactions. To test our model predictions, we performed fluorescence microscopy experiments on rosette-forming neural populations derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, finding significant agreement. Overall, our work may set the stage to gain an unifying understanding of the plethora of biophysical mechanisms involving the occurrence of rosette-like structure both in physiology and their altered formation in pathology.",

    "abstract": "The question of \"what is life?\" has challenged scientists and philosophers for centuries, producing an array of definitions that reflect both the mystery of its emergence and the diversity of disciplinary perspectives brought to bear on the question. Despite significant progress in our understanding of biological systems, psychology, computation, and information theory, no single definition for life has yet achieved universal acceptance. This challenge becomes increasingly urgent as advances in synthetic biology, artificial intelligence, and astrobiology challenge our traditional conceptions of what it means to be alive. We undertook a methodological approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to analyze a set of definitions of life provided by a curated set of cross-disciplinary experts. We used a novel pairwise correlation analysis to map the definitions into distinct feature vectors, followed by agglomerative clustering, intra-cluster semantic analysis, and t-SNE projection to reveal underlying conceptual archetypes. This methodology revealed a continuous landscape of the themes relating to the definition of life, suggesting that what has historically been approached as a binary taxonomic problem should be instead conceived as differentiated perspectives within a unified conceptual latent space. We offer a new methodological bridge between reductionist and holistic approaches to fundamental questions in science and philosophy, demonstrating how computational semantic analysis can reveal conceptual patterns across disciplinary boundaries, and opening similar pathways for addressing other contested definitional territories across the sciences.",

    "abstract": "Despite significant advances in understanding neuronal development, a fully quantitative framework that integrates intracellular mechanisms with environmental cues during axonal growth remains incomplete. Here, we present a unified biophysical model that captures key mechanochemical processes governing axonal extension on micropatterned substrates. In these environments, axons preferentially align with the pattern direction, form bundles, and advance at constant speed. The model integrates four core components: (i) actin-adhesion traction coupling, (ii) lateral inhibition between neighboring axons, (iii) tubulin transport from soma to the growth cone, and (4) orientation dynamics guided by the substrate anisotropy. Dynamical systems analysis reveals that the saddle-node bifurcation in the actin adhesion subsystem drives a transition to a high-traction motile state, while traction feedback shifts a pitchfork bifurcation in the signaling loop, promoting symmetry breaking and robust alignment. An exact linear solution in the tubulin transport subsystem functions as a built-in speed regulator, ensuring stable elongation rates. Simulations using experimentally inferred parameters accurately reproduce elongation speed, alignment variance, and bundle spacing. The model provides explicit design rules for enhancing axonal alignment through modulation of substrate stiffness and adhesion dynamics. By identifying key control parameters, this work enables rational design of biomaterials for neural repair and engineered tissue systems.",

    "abstract": "Over the past decades, nonlocal models have been widely used to describe aggregation phenomena in biology, physics, engineering, and the social sciences. These are often derived as mean-field limits of attraction-repulsion agent-based models, and consist of systems of nonlocal partial differential equations. Using differential adhesion between cells as a biological case study, we introduce a novel local model of aggregation-diffusion phenomena. This system of local aggregation-diffusion equations is fourth-order, resembling thin-film or Cahn-Hilliard type equations. In this framework, cell sorting phenomena are explained through relative surface tensions between distinct cell types. The local model emerges as a limiting case of short-range interactions, providing a significant simplification of earlier nonlocal models, while preserving the same phenomenology. This simplification makes the model easier to implement numerically and more amenable to calibration to quantitative data. Additionally, we discuss recent analytical results based on the gradient-flow structure of the model, along with open problems and future research directions.",

    "abstract": "Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV), classified as Avian orthoavulavirus 1 (avian paramyxovirus type 1), is a promising oncolytic agent that selectively targets and destroys cancer cells while sparing normal tissues. Its oncoselectivity exploits cancer-specific defects in antiviral defenses, particularly impaired Type I interferon signaling, and dysregulated apoptotic pathways, enabling robust viral replication and cytotoxicity in malignancies such as breast, colorectal, and melanoma. NDV induces intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis through caspase activation and triggers immunogenic cell death via damage-associated molecular patterns, stimulating potent antitumours immune responses. Additionally, NDVs potential as a vaccine vector, expressing tumours-associated antigens, offers prospects for prophylactic and therapeutic cancer applications. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of NDVs morphology, classification, and molecular biology, focusing on its viral entry and replication mechanisms in host cells. It explores NDVs interactions with cancer cells, emphasizing its ability to induce cytotoxicity and immune activation. Understanding these mechanisms is critical for optimizing NDVs oncolytic potential and advancing its clinical translation. Future directions include enhancing NDV through genetic engineering, combining it with therapies like immune checkpoint inhibitors, and developing personalized medicine approaches tailored to tumours genomic profiles. These advancements position NDV as a versatile therapeutic agent in oncolytic virotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have demonstrated the feasibility of modeling single-cell data as natural languages and the potential of leveraging powerful large language models (LLMs) for understanding cell biology. However, a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs' performance on language-driven single-cell analysis tasks still remains unexplored. Motivated by this challenge, we introduce CellVerse, a unified language-centric question-answering benchmark that integrates four types of single-cell multi-omics data and encompasses three hierarchical levels of single-cell analysis tasks: cell type annotation (cell-level), drug response prediction (drug-level), and perturbation analysis (gene-level). Going beyond this, we systematically evaluate the performance across 14 open-source and closed-source LLMs ranging from 160M to 671B on CellVerse. Remarkably, the experimental results reveal: (1) Existing specialist models (C2S-Pythia) fail to make reasonable decisions across all sub-tasks within CellVerse, while generalist models such as Qwen, Llama, GPT, and DeepSeek family models exhibit preliminary understanding capabilities within the realm of cell biology. (2) The performance of current LLMs falls short of expectations and has substantial room for improvement. Notably, in the widely studied drug response prediction task, none of the evaluated LLMs demonstrate significant performance improvement over random guessing. CellVerse offers the first large-scale empirical demonstration that significant challenges still remain in applying LLMs to cell biology. By introducing CellVerse, we lay the foundation for advancing cell biology through natural languages and hope this paradigm could facilitate next-generation single-cell analysis.",

    "abstract": "Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) -- which include skeletal stem cells -- are a promising tool in regenerative medicine. However, their heterogeneous and unpredictable in vivo behaviour remains a critical barrier preventing the development of standardized therapeutic approaches for skeletal tissue regeneration. Several studies have attempted to identify in vitro features that could correlate with the in vivo differentiation properties, yet the mechanisms ruling BMSC heterogeneity remain poorly understood. Here, using time-lapse imaging, we lineage-trace 32 single-cell-derived BMSC colonies through seven generations. We observe significant inter-colony and intra-colony heterogeneity in lineage topology (determined by the number of senescent or apoptotic cells) and in replicative kinetics (measured from proliferating cells only). Interestingly, topology and kinetics result strongly correlated, suggesting the existence of regulatory factors linking the non-dividing/apoptotic subpopulations with proliferating cells. Furthermore, BMSCs display highly synchronized cell cycles during early generations, indicating stage-specific regulatory mechanisms through which cells influence each other. By employing a non-interacting population growth model, we demonstrate that the observed synchronisation cannot be explained by an uncorrelated branching process; instead, cell-to-cell correlation of division times must exist. Our findings reveal fundamental mechanisms governing BMSC heterogeneity and growth dynamics that may inform strategies to control their regenerative potential.",

Many processes are involved in the glucose regulation, and their interactions are very complex. To better understand those processes we set ourselves a goal to create a Petri net model of the glucose regulation in the whole body. So far we have managed to create a model of glycolysis and synthesis of glucose in the liver, and the general overview models of the glucose regulation in a healthy and diabetic person. In this paper we introduce Petri nets models of insulin secretion in beta cell of the pancreas, and glucagon in the pancreas alpha cells. Those two hormones have mutually opposite effects: insulin preventing hyperglycemia, and glucagon preventing hypoglycemia. Understanding the mechanisms of insulin and glucagon secretion constitutes the basis for understanding diabetes. We also present a model in which both processes occur together, depending on the blood glucose level. The dynamics of each model is analysed. Additionally, we transform the overall insulin and glucagon secretion system to a Boolean network, following standard transformation rules.",

    "abstract": "Many drugs have been withdrawn from the market worldwide, at a cost of billions of dollars, because of patient fatalities due to them unexpectedly disturbing heart rhythm. Even drugs for ailments as mild as hay fever have been withdrawn due to an unacceptable increase in risk of these heart rhythm disturbances. Consequently, the whole pharmaceutical industry expends a huge effort in checking all new drugs for any unwanted side effects on the heart. The predominant root cause has been identified as drug molecules blocking ionic current flows in the heart. Block of individual types of ionic currents can now be measured experimentally at an early stage of drug development, and this is the standard screening approach for a number of ion currents in many large pharmaceutical companies. However, clinical risk is a complex function of the degree of block of many different types of cardiac ion currents, and this is difficult to understand by looking at results of these screens independently. By using ordinary differential equation models for the electrical activity of heart cells (electrophysiology models) we can integrate information from different types of currents, to predict the effect on whole heart cells and subsequent risk of side effects. The resulting simulations can provide a more accurate summary of the risk of a drug earlier in development and hence more cheaply than the pre-existing approaches.",

We compile published data on UVC doses and corresponding survival fractions for these microorganisms to estimate parameters for four prominent survival models: Single-target (ST), Multi-target (MT), Linear Quadratic (LQ), and Two-Stage Decay (TSD). The best-fitting model for each microorganism is determined by selecting the one with the lowest mean squared error (MSE) compared to the experimental data. Our analysis indicates that the MT model is the most frequently appropriate, accurately fitting 21 of the 33 microorganisms. The TSD model is the best fit for only three, while the LQ model, though occasionally suitable at lower doses, is often excluded due to unreliable performance at higher doses. The assessed models, particularly the MT model, demonstrate strong predictive capabilities for UVC surface sterilization of microorganisms. However, caution is warranted with the LQ model at higher doses due to its potential limitations.",

    "abstract": "Learning the response of single-cells to various treatments offers great potential to enable targeted therapies. In this context, neural optimal transport (OT) has emerged as a principled methodological framework because it inherently accommodates the challenges of unpaired data induced by cell destruction during data acquisition. However, most existing OT approaches are incapable of conditioning on different treatment contexts (e.g., time, drug treatment, drug dosage, or cell type) and we still lack methods that unanimously show promising generalization performance to unseen treatments. Here, we propose the Conditional Monge Gap which learns OT maps conditionally on arbitrary covariates. We demonstrate its value in predicting single-cell perturbation responses conditional to one or multiple drugs, a drug dosage, or combinations thereof. We find that our conditional models achieve results comparable and sometimes even superior to the condition-specific state-of-the-art on scRNA-seq as well as multiplexed protein imaging data. Notably, by aggregating data across conditions we perform cross-task learning which unlocks remarkable generalization abilities to unseen drugs or drug dosages, widely outperforming other conditional models in capturing heterogeneity (i.e., higher moments) in the perturbed population. Finally, by scaling to hundreds of conditions and testing on unseen drugs, we narrow the gap between structure-based and effect-based drug representations, suggesting a promising path to the successful prediction of perturbation effects for unseen treatments.",

    "abstract": "Here we characterized an information measure for cell polarity that applies to non-motile cells responding to a chemical gradient. The central idea is that polarization represents information about the direction of the gradient. We applied a theory of optimal gradient sensing and response in the presence of external noise based on the information capacity of a Gaussian channel. First, we formulated an information framework that describes spatial gradient sensing and polarization response. As part of this section, we modeled ligand diffusion and receptor-binding dynamics as a mixed Poisson distribution, confirming the single receptor accuracy limits derived by ten Wolde and colleagues. Second, we performed numerical calculations of stochastic ligand levels at the cell surface to estimate the information provided about the directional component of the gradient vector, which was close to the Gaussian channel bound for low signal-to-noise ratios. Third, we used the information framework to evaluate the noise-robustness of three generic models of cell polarity, demonstrating that a filter-amplifier architecture and time integration can attenuate the detrimental impact of noise on polarity so that the model can approach the theoretical limits. Fourth, we compared the theory to published experimental data on yeast mating projection growth in a pheromone gradient, identifying the ligand association rate and integration time as two key parameters affecting directional accuracy. By varying these parameters, we showed that for certain ranges the theory is roughly in agreement with the data, and that the slow binding rate constant is a key limiting factor. We concluded that temporal averaging can help overcome the slow binding rate to achieve greater accuracy, but with the drawback of a slow mating response.",

It remains unclear, however, whether transitions between the migratory modes require changes in external conditions, or whether the different modes are coexisting states that emerge from the underlying signaling network. Using a simplified mass-conserved reaction-diffusion model of small GTPase signaling with F-actin mediated feedback, we uncover a distinct bistable mechanism (involving gradient-like phase-separation and traveling waves) and a regime where a polarized mode of migration coexists with spatiotemporal oscillations; the latter, in larger domains, including in three-dimensional surface geometry, result in disordered patterns even in the absence of noise or shape deformations. Indeed, experimental observations of D. discoideum show that, upon collision with a rigid boundary, cells may switch from polarized to disordered motion.",

    "abstract": "It has been observed that the growth of the nucleus and the cytoplasm is coordinated during cell growth, resulting in a nearly constant nuclear-to-cell volume ratio (N/C) throughout the cell cycle. Previous studies have shown that the N/C ratio is determined by the ratio between the number of proteins in the nucleus and the total number of proteins in the cell. These observations suggest the importance of the nucleocytoplasmic transport process in nuclear size by regulating protein concentrations in the nucleus and cytoplasm. This paper combines a biophysical model of Ran-mediated nucleocytoplasmic transport and a simple cell growth model to provide insights into several key aspects of the N/C ratio homeostasis in growing cells. Our model shows that the permeability of the nuclear envelope needs to grow in line with the cell to maintain a nearly constant N/C ratio, that several parameters involved in the nucleocytoplasmic transport mechanism and gene translation significantly affect the N/C ratio, and that Ran may potentially compensate for the lack of NTF2 in the nucleocytoplasmic transport mechanism to maintain a viable N/C ratio. However, this compensation is possible only if RanGDP is allowed to translocate through the nuclear envelope independently of NTF2.",

Electroactive materials facilitate the provision of controlled electrical, mechanical, and electromechanical stimuli, which support cell proliferation and tissue remodelling.

To address the demand for biomimetic materials that possess enhanced capabilities in promoting cell and tissue stimulation, we present the development of a novel class of polymers called ionomeric extracellular matrices (iECMs). By utilising the linker-mediated conjugation of sulfonic acid biomolecules (taurine) to the backbone of an extracellular matrix protein (collagen), we illustrate the potential of iECMs as the first electromechanical actuating material platform derived entirely from ECM materials, paving the way for dynamic and soft-robotic platforms for a wide range of tissue engineering applications.",

At the end of the study, blood samples were taken from the heart, including blood-red blood cells, hemoglobin, hematocrit and platelets using a fully automated blood cell counting machine. The results showed that the new dietary supplement reduced the level of hematocrit and platelets in the studied rats. The healthy and live food supplement at a concentration of 50 mg / kg increased blood levels compared to the control group. The results of this study showed that the use of healthy and live food supplement increased blood factors compared to the control group.",

    "abstract": "While hydrodynamic coupling has long been considered essential for synchronisation of eukaryotic flagella, recent experiments on the unicellular biflagellate model organism {\\it Chlamydomonas} demonstrate that -- at the single cell level -- intracellular mechanical coupling is necessary for coordination. It is therefore unclear what role, if any, hydrodynamic forces actually play in the synchronisation of multiple flagella within individual cells, arguably the building block of large scale coordination. Here we address this question experimentally by transiently blocking hydrodynamic coupling between the two flagella of single {\\it Chlamydomonas}. Our results reveal that in wild type cells intracellularly-mediated forces are necessary and sufficient for flagellar synchronisation, with hydrodynamic coupling causing minimal changes in flagellar dynamics. However, fluid-mediated ciliary coupling is responsible for the extended periods of anti-phase synchronisation observed in a mutant with weaker intracellular coupling. At the single-cell level, therefore, flagellar coordination depends on a subtle balance between intracellular and extracellular forces.",

    "abstract": "Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens is a nitrogen-fixing symbiont of soybean, worldwide used as biofertilizer. This soil bacterium possesses two flagellar systems enabling it to swim in water-saturated soils. However, the motility in soil pores, which may be crucial for competitiveness for root nodulation, is difficult to predict. To address this gap, we fabricated microfluidic devices with networks of connected microchannels surrounding grains. In them, we directly visualise bacterial behaviour in transparent geometries mimicking minimalist soils-on-a-chip (SOCs). We measured the population velocities and changes of direction for two strains: the wild-type and a mutant with only a subpolar flagellum. A detailed statistical analysis revealed that both strains exhibited reduced speeds and increased changes of direction of 180$^\\circ$, in channels of decreasing cross sectional area, down to a few microns in width. Interestingly, while the wild-type strain displayed faster swimming in unconfined spaces, this advantage was negated in the SOCs with the narrowest microchannels. We employed the measured motility parameters to propose a realistic model and simulate B. diazoefficiens confined dynamics being able to reproduce their behaviour, which additionally can be extended enabling further predictions for long time and macro scales. This multidisciplinary work, combining design, microfabrication, microbiology and modelling, offers useful methods to study soil bacteria and may be readily extended to other beneficial/harmful soil species.",

Our approach employs a delay mechanism to represent the cell cycle, allowing the use of arbitrary distributions for cell cycle lengths. We demonstrate the feasibility of our model by fitting it to experimental data from melanoma cell lines previously studied by Vittadello et al. Notably, our model successfully replicates experimentally observed synchronization phenomena that multi-stage models could not adequately explain. By using a gamma distribution to model cell cycle lengths, we achieved excellent agreement between our simulations and empirical data, while significantly reducing computational complexity and parameter estimation challenges inherent in multi-stage approaches. Our results highlight the importance of explicitly incorporating cell cycle lengths in modeling cell populations, with potential implications for optimizing cell cycle-dependent tumor therapies.",

However, how these morphogenetic processes work together to achieve this reproducibility remains unclear. Here, we ask how morphogenetic reproducibility is realised by developing a computational model that evolves complex morphologies. We find that evolved, complex morphologies are reproducible in a sizeable fraction of simulations, despite no direct selection for reproducibility. Strikingly, reproducible morphologies had also evolved stem-cell systems. We show that reproducibility is caused by a morphogenetic division of labour based on these stem-cell systems, where moving, dividing stem cells ``shape'' morphologies and irreversibly differentiate into stationary, non-dividing cells. These results suggest that stem-cell systems observed in natural development play fundamental roles in morphogenesis in addition to their known role of producing specialised cell types. This previously-unrecognised role of stem-cell systems has major implications for our understanding of how morphologies are generated and regenerated.",

However, therapeutic targeting of macrophages has been a challenge in clinic due to the limited understanding of their heterogeneous subpopulations and distinct functions. Here, we identify a unique and clinically relevant CD19$^+$ subpopulation of macrophages that is enriched in many types of cancer, particularly in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The CD19$^+$ macrophages exhibit increased levels of PD-L1 and CD73, enhanced mitochondrial oxidation, and compromised phagocytosis, indicating their immunosuppressive functions. Targeting CD19$^+$ macrophages with anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cells inhibited HCC tumor growth. We identify PAX5 as a primary driver of up-regulated mitochondrial biogenesis in CD19$^+$ macrophages, which depletes cytoplasmic Ca$^{2+}$, leading to lysosomal deficiency and consequent accumulation of CD73 and PD-L1. Inhibiting CD73 or mitochondrial oxidation enhanced the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade therapy in treating HCC, suggesting great promise for CD19$^+$ macrophage-targeting therapeutics.",

This paper introduces a generalized analytical framework for modeling diffusion-based molecular communication in multi-layered spherical environments. The framework is capable of supporting an arbitrary number of layers and flexible transmitter-receiver positioning. As an example, the detailed formulation is presented for the three-layer sphere, which is particularly relevant for different biological models such as tumor spheroids. The analytical results are validated using particle-based simulation (PBS) in scenarios that have short inter-layer distances. The findings reveal that the characteristics of each layer significantly impact molecule propagation throughout the entire structure, making their consideration crucial for designing targeted therapies and optimizing drug delivery systems.",

    "abstract": "Scientific research demands sophisticated reasoning over multimodal data, a challenge especially prevalent in biology. Despite recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for AI-assisted research, existing multimodal reasoning benchmarks only target up to college-level difficulty, while research-level benchmarks emphasize lower-level perception, falling short of the complex multimodal reasoning needed for scientific discovery. To bridge this gap, we introduce MicroVQA, a visual-question answering (VQA) benchmark designed to assess three reasoning capabilities vital in research workflows: expert image understanding, hypothesis generation, and experiment proposal. MicroVQA consists of 1,042 multiple-choice questions (MCQs) curated by biology experts across diverse microscopy modalities, ensuring VQA samples represent real scientific practice. In constructing the benchmark, we find that standard MCQ generation methods induce language shortcuts, motivating a new two-stage pipeline: an optimized LLM prompt structures question-answer pairs into MCQs; then, an agent-based `RefineBot' updates them to remove shortcuts. Benchmarking on state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal a peak performance of 53\\%; models with smaller LLMs only slightly underperform top models, suggesting that language-based reasoning is less challenging than multimodal reasoning; and tuning with scientific articles enhances performance. Expert analysis of chain-of-thought responses shows that perception errors are the most frequent, followed by knowledge errors and then overgeneralization errors. These insights highlight the challenges in multimodal scientific reasoning, showing MicroVQA is a valuable resource advancing AI-driven biomedical research.

    "title": "AI-driven control of bioelectric signalling for real-time topological reorganization of cells",
    "abstract": "Understanding and manipulating bioelectric signaling could present a new wave of progress in developmental biology, regenerative medicine, and synthetic biology. Bioelectric signals, defined as voltage gradients across cell membranes caused by ionic movements, play a role in regulating crucial processes including cellular differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and tissue morphogenesis. Recent studies demonstrate the ability to modulate these signals to achieve controlled tissue regeneration and morphological outcomes in organisms such as planaria and frogs. However, significant knowledge gaps remain, particularly in predicting and controlling the spatial and temporal dynamics of membrane potentials (V_mem), understanding their regulatory roles in tissue and organ development, and exploring their therapeutic potential in diseases. In this work we propose an experiment using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework together with lab automation techniques for real-time manipulation of bioelectric signals to guide tissue regeneration and morphogenesis. The proposed framework should interact continuously with biological systems, adapting strategies based on direct biological feedback. Combining DRL with real-time measurement techniques -- such as optogenetics, voltage-sensitive dyes, fluorescent reporters, and advanced microscopy -- could provide a comprehensive platform for precise bioelectric control, leading to improved understanding of bioelectric mechanisms in morphogenesis, quantitative bioelectric models, identification of minimal experimental setups, and advancements in bioelectric modulation techniques relevant to regenerative medicine and cancer therapy. Ultimately, this research aims to utilize bioelectric signaling to develop new biomedical and bioengineering applications.",

    "title": "Optimal Cell Shape for Accurate Chemical Gradient Sensing in Eukaryote Chemotaxis",
    "abstract": "Accurate gradient sensing is crucial for efficient chemotaxis in noisy environments, but the relationship between cell shape deformations and sensing accuracy is not well understood. Using a theoretical framework based on maximum likelihood estimation, we show that the receptor dispersion, quantified by cell shape convex hull, fundamentally limits gradient sensing accuracy. Cells with a concave shape and isotropic error space achieve optimal performance in gradient detection. This concave shape, resulting from active protrusions or contractions, can significantly improve gradient sensing accuracy at the cost of increased energy expenditure. By balancing sensing accuracy and deformation cost, we predict that a concave, three-branched shape as optimal for cells in shallow gradients. To achieve efficient chemotaxis, our theory suggests that a cell should adopt a repeating \"run-and-expansion\" cycle. Our theoretical predictions align well with experimental observations, implying that the fast amoeboid cell motion is optimized near the physical limit for chemotaxis. This study highlights the crucial role of active cell shape deformation in facilitating accurate chemotaxis.",

    "title": "Controlling tissue size by active fracture",
    "abstract": "Groups of cells, including clusters of cancerous cells, multicellular organisms, and developing organs, may both grow and break apart. What physical factors control these fractures? In these processes, what sets the eventual size of clusters? We first develop a one-dimensional framework for understanding cell clusters that can fragment due to cell motility using an active particle model. We compute analytically how the break rate of cell-cell junctions depends on cell speed, cell persistence, and cell-cell junction properties. Next, we find the cluster size distributions, which differ depending on whether all cells can divide or only the cells on the edge of the cluster divide. Cluster size distributions depend solely on the ratio of the break rate to the growth rate - allowing us to predict how cluster size and variability depend on cell motility and cell-cell mechanics. Our results suggest that organisms can achieve better size control when cell division is restricted to the cluster boundaries or when fracture can be localized to the cluster center. Additionally, we derive a universal survival probability for an intact cluster $S(t)=\\mathrm{e}^{-k_d t}$ at steady state if all cells can divide, which is independent of the rupture kinetics and depends solely on the cell division rate $k_d$. Finally, we further corroborate the one-dimensional analytics with two-dimensional simulations, finding quantitative agreement with some elements of the theory across a wide range of cell motility. Our results link the general physics problem of a collective active escape over a barrier to size control, providing a quantitative measure of how motility can regulate organ or organism size.",

    "title": "Electron spin dynamics guide cell motility",
    "abstract": "Diverse organisms exploit the geomagnetic field (GMF) for migration. Migrating birds employ an intrinsically quantum mechanical mechanism for detecting the geomagnetic field: absorption of a blue photon generates a radical pair whose two electrons precess at different rates in the magnetic field, thereby sensitizing cells to the direction of the GMF. In this work, using an in vitro injury model, we discovered a quantum-based mechanism of cellular migration. Specifically, we show that migrating cells detect the GMF via an optically activated, electron spin-based mechanism. Cell injury provokes acute emission of blue photons, and these photons sensitize muscle progenitor cells to the magnetic field. We show that the magnetosensitivity of muscle progenitor cells is (a) activated by blue light, but not by green or red light, and (b) disrupted by the application of an oscillatory field at the frequency corresponding to the energy of the electron-spin/magnetic field interaction. A comprehensive analysis of protein expression reveals that the ability of blue photons to promote cell motility is mediated by activation of calmodulin calcium sensors. Collectively, these data suggest that cells possess a light-dependent magnetic compass driven by electron spin dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Fibroblast cells play a key role in maintaining the extracellular matrix. During wound healing, fibroblasts differentiate into highly contractile myofibroblasts, which secrete extracellular matrix proteins like collagen to facilitate tissue repair. Under normal conditions, myofibroblasts undergo programmed cell death after healing to prevent excessive scar formation. However, in diseases like fibrosis, the myofibroblasts remain active even after the wound is closed, resulting in excessive collagen buildup and a stiff, fibrotic matrix. The reasons for the persistence of myofibroblasts in fibrosis are not well understood. Here we show the existence of a mechanism where direct physical contact between a fibroblast and a myofibroblast is sufficient for fibroblasts to transition into myofibroblasts. We show that fibroblast-myofibroblast transition can occur even in the absence of known biochemical cues such as growth factor activation or mechanical cues from a stiff, fibrotic matrix. Further, we show that contact-based fibroblast-myofibroblast activation can be blocked by Gαq/11/14 inhibitor FR9003591, which inhibits the formation of myofibroblasts. These findings offer new insights into the persistence of fibrosis despite therapeutic interventions and suggest a potential strategy to target fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition in fibrosis.",

    "abstract": "G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) represent a diverse and vital family of membrane proteins that mediate intracellular signaling in response to extracellular stimuli, playing critical roles in physiology and disease. Traditionally recognized as chemical signal transducers, GPCRs have recently been implicated in mechanotransduction, the process of converting mechanical stimuli into cellular responses. This review explores the emerging role of GPCRs in sensing and responding to mechanical forces, with a particular focus on the cardiovascular system. Cardiovascular homeostasis is heavily influenced by mechanical forces such as shear stress, cyclic stretch, and pressure, which are central to both normal physiology and the pathogenesis of diseases like hypertension and atherosclerosis. GPCRs, including the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) and the \\b{eta}2-adrenergic receptor (\\b{eta}2-AR), have demonstrated the ability to integrate mechanical and chemical signals, potentially through conformational changes and/or modulation of lipid interactions, leading to biased signaling. Recent studies highlight the dual activation mechanisms of GPCRs, with \\b{eta}2-AR now serving as a key example of how mechanical and ligand-dependent pathways contribute to cardiovascular regulation. This review synthesizes current knowledge of GPCR mechanosensitivity, emphasizing its implications for cardiovascular health and disease, and explores advancements in methodologies poised to further unravel the mechanistic intricacies of these receptors.",

To address these limitations, individualized cancer forecasts have been shown to predict tumor growth and therapeutic response, inform treatment optimization, and guide experimental efforts. These predictions are obtained via computer simulations of mathematical models that are constrained with data from a patient's cancer and experiments. This book chapter addresses the validation of these mathematical models to forecast tumor growth and treatment response. We start with an overview of mathematical modeling frameworks, model selection techniques, and fundamental metrics. We then describe the usual strategies employed to validate cancer forecasts in preclinical and clinical scenarios. Finally, we discuss existing barriers in validating these predictions along with potential strategies to address them.",

    "abstract": "A novel trait-structured Keller-Segel model that explores the dynamics of a migrating cell population guided by chemotaxis in response to an external ligand concentration is derived and analysed. Unlike traditional Keller-Segel models, this framework introduces an explicit representation of ligand-receptor bindings on the cell membrane, where the percentage of occupied receptors constitutes the trait that influences cellular phenotype. The model posits that the cell's phenotypic state directly modulates its capacity for chemotaxis and proliferation, governed by a trade-off due to a finite energy budget: cells highly proficient in chemotaxis exhibit lower proliferation rates, while more proliferative cells show diminished chemotactic abilities. The model is derived from the principles of a biased random walk, resulting in a system of two non-local partial differential equations, describing the densities of both cells and ligands. Using a Hopf-Cole transformation, we derive an equation that characterises the distribution of cellular traits within travelling wave solutions for the total cell density, allowing us to uncover the monotonicity properties of these waves. Numerical investigations are conducted to examine the model's behaviour across various biological scenarios, providing insights into the complex interplay between chemotaxis, proliferation, and phenotypic diversity in migrating cell populations.",

In this study, we employed a multifaceted approach, integrating label-free Raman spectroscopy and microfluidics to study the mechanisms underpinning ferroptosis. Our investigations included the ferroptosis initiation based on the changes in the lipid Raman band at 1436 cm-1 under different cellular states, the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxidation, DNA damage/repair, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Importantly, our work highlighted the dynamic role of vital cellular components, such as NADPH, ferredoxin clusters, and key genes like GPX-4, VDAC2, and NRF2, as they collectively influenced cellular responses to redox imbalance and oxidative stress. Quantum mechanical (QM) and molecular docking simulations (MD) provided further evidence of interactions between the ferredoxin (containing 4Fe-4S clusters), NADPH and ROS which led to the production of reactive Fe species in the cells. As such, our approach offered a real-time, multidimensional perspective on ferroptosis, surpassing traditional biological methods, and providing valuable insights for therapeutic interventions in diverse biomedical contexts.",

Why and how some hair cells expend energy by sustaining this oscillatory motion in order to fulfill their function as signal sensors and others--as amplifiers, remains unknown. We develop a stochastic thermodynamic theory to describe energy flows in a periodically-driven hair bundle. Our analysis of thermodynamic fluxes associated with hair bundles' motion and external sinusoidal stimulus reveals that these organelles operate as thermodynamic work-to-work machines under different operational modes. One operational mode transduces the signal's power into the cell, whereas another allows the external stimulus to harvest the energy supplied by the cell. These two regimes might represent thermodynamic signatures of signal sensing and amplification respectively. In addition to work transduction and energy harvesting, our model also substantiates the capability of hair-cell bundles to operate as heaters and, at the expense of external driving, as active feedback refrigerators. We quantify the performance and robustness of the work-to-work conversion by hair bundles, whose efficiency in some conditions exceeds 80 % of the applied power.",

For non-muscle cells, evolution has resulted in three different isoforms, which have different properties concerning the motor cycle and also occur in different abundances in the cells, but their respective biological and physical roles are not fully understood. Here we use active gel theory to demonstrate the complementary roles of isoforms A and B for cell migration. We first show that our model can be derived both from coarse-graining kinetic equations and from nonequilibrium thermodynamics as the macroscopic limit of a two-component Tonks gas. We then parametrize the model and show that motile solutions exist, in which the more abundant and more dynamic isoform A is localized to the front and the stronger isoform B to the rear, in agreement with experiments. Exploring parameter space beyond the isoform parameters typical for animal cells, we also find cell oscillations in length and velocity, which might be realized for genetically engineered systems. We also describe an analytical solution for the stiff limit, which then is used to calculate a state diagram, and the effect of actin polymerization at the boundaries, that leads to an imperfect pitchfork bifurcation.

Evaluated on chemical (BBBC021), genetic (RxRx1), and combined perturbation (JUMP) datasets, CellFlux generates biologically meaningful cell images that faithfully capture perturbation-specific morphological changes, achieving a 35% improvement in FID scores and a 12% increase in mode-of-action prediction accuracy over existing methods. Additionally, CellFlux enables continuous interpolation between cellular states, providing a potential tool for studying perturbation dynamics.

    "title": "Stochastic Mutation as a Mechanism for the Emergence of SARS-CoV-2 New Variants",
    "abstract": "Predicting the future evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 remains a critical challenge, particularly due to the pivotal role of spike protein mutations. It is therefore essential to develop evolutionary models capable of continuously integrating new experimental data. In this study, we employ a cladogram algorithm that incorporates established assumptions for mutant representation -- using both four-letter and two-letter formats -- along with an n-mer distance algorithm to construct a cladogenetic tree of SARS-CoV-2 mutations. This tree accurately captures the observed changes across macro-lineages. We introduce a stochastic method for generating new strains on this tree based on spike protein mutations. For a given set A of existing mutation sites, we define a set X comprising x randomly generated mutation sites on the spike protein. The intersection of A and X, denoted as set Y, contains y sites. Our analysis indicates that the position of a generated strain on the tree is primarily determined by x. Through large-scale stochastic sampling, we predict the emergence of new macro-lineages. As x increases, the dominance among macro-lineages shifts: lineage O surpasses N, P surpasses O, and eventually Q surpasses P. We identify threshold values of x that delineate transitions between these macro-lineages. Furthermore, we propose an algorithm for predicting the timeline of macro-lineage emergence. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 evolution adheres to statistical principles: the emergence of new strains can be driven by randomly generated spike protein sites, and large-scale stochastic sampling reveals evolutionary patterns underlying the rise of distinct macro-lineages.",

    "title": "DiffEx: Explaining a Classifier with Diffusion Models to Identify Microscopic Cellular Variations",
    "abstract": "In recent years, deep learning models have been extensively applied to biological data across various modalities. Discriminative deep learning models have excelled at classifying images into categories (e.g., healthy versus diseased, treated versus untreated). However, these models are often perceived as black boxes due to their complexity and lack of interpretability, limiting their application in real-world biological contexts. In biological research, explainability is essential: understanding classifier decisions and identifying subtle differences between conditions are critical for elucidating the effects of treatments, disease progression, and biological processes. To address this challenge, we propose DiffEx, a method for generating visually interpretable attributes to explain classifiers and identify microscopic cellular variations between different conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DiffEx in explaining classifiers trained on natural and biological images. Furthermore, we use DiffEx to uncover phenotypic differences within microscopy datasets. By offering insights into cellular variations through classifier explanations, DiffEx has the potential to advance the understanding of diseases and aid drug discovery by identifying novel biomarkers.",

    "abstract": "White blood cells (WBC) are important parts of our immune system, and they protect our body against infections by eliminating viruses, bacteria, parasites and fungi. The number of WBC types and the total number of WBCs provide important information about our health status. A traditional method, convolutional neural networks (CNN), a deep learning architecture, can classify the blood cell from a part of an object and perform object recognition. Various CNN models exhibit potential; however, their development often involves ad-hoc processes that neglect unnecessary layers, leading to issues with unbalanced datasets and insufficient data augmentation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel ensemble approach that integrates three CNN architectures, each uniquely configured with different dropout and max-pooling layer settings to enhance feature learning. This ensemble model, named DCENWCNet, effectively balances the bias-variance trade-off. When evaluated on the widely recognized Rabbin-WBC dataset, our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art networks, achieving highest mean accuracy. Additionally, it demonstrates superior performance in precision, recall, F1-score, and Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) across all categories. To delve deeper into the interpretability of classifiers, we employ reliable post-hoc explanation techniques, including Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME). These methods approximate the behavior of a black-box model by elucidating the relationships between feature values and predictions. Interpretable results enable users to comprehend and validate the model's predictions, thereby increasing their confidence in the automated diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the artery wall. The early stages of atherosclerosis are driven by interactions between lipids and monocyte-derived-macrophages (MDMs). The mechanisms that govern the spatial distribution of lipids and MDMs in the lesion remain poorly understood. In this paper, we develop a spatially-resolved and lipid-structured model for early atherosclerosis. The model development and analysis are guided by images of human coronary lesions by Nakashima et al. 2007. Consistent with their findings, the model predicts that lipid initially accumulates deep in the intima due to a spatially non-uniform LDL retention capacity. The model also qualitatively reproduces the global internal maxima in the Nakashima images only when the MDM mobility is sufficiently sensitive to lipid content, and MDM lifespan sufficiently insensitive. Introducing lipid content-dependence to MDM mobility and mean lifespan produced minimal impact on model behaviour at early times, but strongly impacted lesion composition at steady state. Increases to the sensitivity of MDM lifespan to lipid content yield lesions with fewer MDMs, less total lesion lipid content and reduced mean MDM infiltration depth. Increases to the sensitivity of MDM mobility to lipid content also reduces the MDM infiltration depth, but increases the proportion of lipid-laden MDMs. We find that MDM lipid content increases with spatial depth, regardless of blood LDL and HDL content. These results shed light on the mechanisms that drive spatial variation in the composition of early atherosclerotic lesions, and the role of macrophage lipid content in disease progression.",

A major bioinformatical challenge is the inference of differentiation trajectories from a single snapshot, and methods that account for outlier cells that are unrelated to the differentiation process have yet to be established. We present MultistageOT: a Multistage Optimal Transport-based framework for trajectory inference in a snapshot (https://github.com/dahlinlab/MultistageOT). Application of optimal transport has proven successful for many single-cell tasks, but classical bimarginal optimal transport for trajectory inference fails to model temporal progression in a snapshot. Representing a novel generalization of optimal transport, MultistageOT addresses this major limitation by introducing a temporal dimension, allowing for high resolution modeling of intermediate differentiation stages. We challenge MultistageOT with snapshot data of cell differentiation, demonstrating effectiveness in pseudotime ordering, detection of outliers, and significantly improved fate prediction accuracy over state-of-the-art.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Identifying the activity of motor neurons (MNs) non-invasively is possible by decomposing signals from muscles, e.g., surface electromyography (EMG) or ultrasound. The theoretical background of MN identification is convolutive blind source separation (cBSS), and different algorithms have been developed and validated. Yet, the existence and identifiability of inverse solutions and the corresponding estimation errors are not fully understood. Further, the guidelines for selecting appropriate parameters are often built on empirical observations, limiting the translation to clinical applications and other modalities. Approach: We revisited the cBSS model for MN identification, augmented it with new theoretical insights and derived a framework that can predict the existence of inverse solutions. This framework allows the quantification of estimation errors due to the imperfect inversion of the motor unit action potentials (MUAP), noise sources, and the ill-conditioning of the inverse problem. To bridge the gap between theory and practice, we used computer simulations. Main results: (1) Increasing the similarity of MUAPs or correlation between spike trains increases the bias for detecting high amplitude MUs. (2) The optimal objective function depends on the expected spike amplitude, spike amplitude statistics and the amplitude of background spikes. (3) There is some wiggle room for MN detection given non-stationary MUAPs. (4) There is no connection between MUAP duration and extension factor, in contrast to previous guidelines. (5) Source quality metrics like the silhouette score (SIL) or the pulse-to-noise ratio (PNR) are highly correlated with a source's objective function output. (6) SIL is superior to PNR. Significance: These findings will guide cBSS algorithm developments tailored to MN identification and clinical application translation.",

    "abstract": "Ever since the ground breaking work of Trepat et al. in 2009, we know that cell colonies growing on a substrate can be under tensile mechanical stress. The origin of tension has so far been attributed to cellular motility forces being oriented outward of the colony. Works in the field mainly revolve around how this orientation of the forces can be explained, ranging from velocity alignment, self-sorting due to self-propulsion, to kenotaxis. In this work, we demonstrate that tension in growing colonies can also be explained without cellular motility forces! Using a combination of well established tissue growth simulation technique and analytical modelling, we show how tension can arise as a consequence of simple mechanics of growing tissues. Combining these models with a minimalistic motility model shows how colonies can expand while under even larger tension. Furthermore, our results and analytical models provide novel analysis procedures to identify the underlying mechanics.",

    "abstract": "As the next step in extraterrestrial exploration, many engineers and scientists around the country revealed their intense interest to enable multiplanetary human life, including colonizing Mars. This study proposes that architecture on Mars can be realized by a synthetic lichen system, composed of diazotrophic cyanobacteria and filamentous fungi, which produce abundant biominerals and biopolymers to bond Martian regolith into consolidated building blocks. These self-growing building blocks can be assembled into a wide range of structures. Diazotrophic cyanobacteria will 1) fix carbon dioxide and dinitrogen from the atmosphere and convert them into oxygen and organic carbon and nitrogen sources to support filamentous fungi; and 2) give rise to high concentrations of carbonate ions because of photosynthetic activities. Filamentous fungi will 1) bind metal ions onto fungal cell walls and serve as nucleation sites to promote biomineral precipitates; and 2) assist the survival and growth of cyanobacteria by providing them water, minerals, additional carbon dioxide, and protection. This report presents the major progress of the project. It has been tested and confirmed that such co-culture systems can be created, and they grow very well solely on Martian regolith simulants, air, light, and an inorganic liquid medium without any additional carbon or nitrogen sources. The cyanobacterial and fungal growth in such co-culture systems is significantly better than their axenic growth due to mutual interactions. The amounts and morphologies of the precipitated crystals vary remarkably depending on the cultivation condition.",

In three dimensions, both swimming and gliding microorganisms often exhibit helical trajectories. One such case are malaria parasites gliding through 3D hydrogels, for which we find that the internal correlation time for the stochastic process generating propulsion is similar to the time taken for one helical turn. Motivated by this experimental finding, here we theoretically analyze the case of finite internal correlation time for microorganisms with helical trajectories as chiral active particles with an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process for torque. We present an analytical solution which is in very good agreement with computer simulations. We then show that for this type of internal noise, chirality and rotation increase the persistence of motion and results in helical trajectories that have a larger long-time mean squared displacement than straight trajectories at the same propulsion speed. Finally we provide experimental evidence for this prediction for the case of the malaria parasites.",

Understanding the dynamics which facilitate or limit navigation of problem spaces by aligned parts thus impacts many fields ranging across life sciences and engineering. To that end, consider a system on the vertices of a planar graph, with pairwise interactions prescribed by the edges of the graph. Such systems can sometimes exhibit long-range order, distinguishing one phase of macroscopic behaviour from another. In networks of interacting systems we may view spontaneous ordering as a form of self-organisation, modelling neural and basal forms of cognition. Here, we discuss necessary conditions on the topology of the graph for an ordered phase to exist, with an eye towards finding constraints on the ability of a system with local interactions to maintain an ordered target state. By studying the scaling of free energy under the formation of domain walls in three model systems -- the Potts model, autoregressive models, and hierarchical networks -- we show how the combinatorics of interactions on a graph prevent or allow spontaneous ordering. As an application we are able to analyse why multiscale systems like those prevalent in biology are capable of organising into complex patterns, whereas rudimentary language models are challenged by long sequences of outputs.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria can form a great variety of spatially heterogeneous cell density patterns, ranging from simple concentric rings to dynamical spiral waves appearing in growing colonies. These pattern formation phenomena are important as they reflect how cellular processes such as metabolism operate in heterogeneous chemical environments. In the laboratory, they can be studied in simplified set-ups, where spatial gradients of oxygen and nutrients are externally imposed, and cells are immobilized in a gel matrix. An intriguing example, observed in such set-ups over 80 years ago, is the sequential formation of narrow bands of high cell density, taking place even for a clonal population. However, key aspects of the dynamics of band formation remained obscure. Using time-lapse imaging of replicate transparent columns in simplified growth media, we first quantify the precision of the positioning and timing of band formation. We also show that the appearance and position of different bands can be modulated independently. This \"modularity\" is suggested by the observation that different bands differ in their gene expression, and it is reproduced by a theoretical model based on the existence of internal metabolic states and the induction of a pH gradient. Finally, we can also modify the observed pattern formation by introducing genetic modifications that impair selected metabolic pathways. In our opinion, the possibility of precise measurements and controls, together with the simplicity and richness of the \"proliferation pattern formation\" phenomenon, can make it a model system to study the response of cellular processes to heterogeneous environments.",

To address these limitations, we present InstructCell, a multi-modal AI copilot that leverages natural language as a medium for more direct and flexible single-cell analysis. We construct a comprehensive multi-modal instruction dataset that pairs text-based instructions with scRNA-seq profiles from diverse tissues and species. Building on this, we develop a multi-modal cell language architecture capable of simultaneously interpreting and processing both modalities. InstructCell empowers researchers to accomplish critical tasks-such as cell type annotation, conditional pseudo-cell generation, and drug sensitivity prediction-using straightforward natural language commands. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that InstructCell consistently meets or exceeds the performance of existing single-cell foundation models, while adapting to diverse experimental conditions. More importantly, InstructCell provides an accessible and intuitive tool for exploring complex single-cell data, lowering technical barriers and enabling deeper biological insights.",

    "abstract": "Recent high-throughput experiments unveil substantial electrophysiological diversity among uncoupled healthy myocytes under identical conditions. To quantify inter-cell variability, the values of a subset of the parameters in a well-regarded mathematical model of the action potential of rabbit ventricular myocytes are estimated from fluorescence voltage measurements of a large number of cells. Statistical inference yields a population of nearly 1200 cell-specific model variants that, on a population-level replicate experimentally measured biomarker ranges and distributions, and in contrast to earlier studies, also match experimental biomarker values on a cell-by-cell basis. This model population may be regarded as a random sample from the phenotype of healthy rabbit ventricular myocytes. Uni-variate and bi-variate joint marginal distributions of the estimated parameters are presented, and the parameter dependencies of several commonly utilised electrophysiological biomarkers are revealed. Parameter values are weakly correlated, while summary metrics such as the action potential duration are not strongly dependent on any single electrophysiological characteristic of the myocyte. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of accurately and efficiently fitting entire action potential waveforms at scale.

    "abstract": "Plasmonic nanostructures have wide applications in photonics including pathogen detection and diagnosis via Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS). Despite major role plasmonics play in signal enhancement, electrostatics in SERS is yet to be fully understood and harnessed. Here, we perform a systematic study of electrostatic interactions between 785 nm resonant gold nanorods designed to harbor zeta potentials of +29, +16, 0 and -9 mV spanning positive neutral and negative domains. SERS activity is tested on representative Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Gram-positive Staphylococcus epidermidis bacteria with zeta potentials of -30 and -23 mV respectively in water. Raman spectroscopy and Cryo-Electron microscopy reveal that +29, +16, 0 and -9 mV nanorods give SERS enhancement of 7.2X, 3.6X, 4.2X, 1.3X to Staphylococcus epidermidis and 3.9X, 2.8X, 2.9X, 1.1X to Escherichia coli. Theoretical results show that electrostatics play the major role among all interaction forces in determining cell-nanorod proximity and signal enhancement. We identify steric repulsion due to cell protrusions to be the critical opposing force. Finally, a design principle is proposed to estimate the electrostatic strength in SERS. Our work provides new insights into the principle of bacteria-nanorod interactions, enabling reproducible and precise biomolecular readouts, critical for next-generation point-of-care diagnostics and smart healthcare applications.",

    "title": "A framework for disentangling spatial and visual neural representations",
    "abstract": "Neurons in cortical areas often integrate signals from different origins. In the primary visual cortex (V1), neural responses are modulated by non-visual context such as the animal's position. However, the spatial profile of these position signals across the environment remains unknown. Here, we propose a new framework to disentangle visual and spatial contributions in virtual reality. This method relies on two principles: 1) a virtual corridor design that decorrelates vision and space through targeted cue repetitions and manipulations and 2) a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) that explicitly estimates visual contributions in retinotopic rather than environmental coordinates. In simulations, we demonstrate that this framework is highly specific (recovering spatial modulation only when present) and effectively captures the profile and weight of spatial gain fields across the environment. When applied to V1 recordings from mice navigating the virtual corridor, the model isolated significant spatial components in a substantial fraction of V1 neurons. The recovered spatial components exhibited heterogeneous, often multi-peaked, profiles. Application of this framework to large-scale recordings may provide a robust approach to characterize the nature of spatial signals modulating sensory processing across brain areas.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies suggest that the representations learned by large language models (LLMs) are partially aligned to those of the human brain. However, whether and why this alignment score arises from a similar sequence of computations remains elusive. In this study, we explore this question by examining temporally-resolved brain signals of participants listening to 10 hours of an audiobook. We study these neural dynamics jointly with a benchmark encompassing 22 LLMs varying in size and architecture type. Our analyses confirm that LLMs and the brain generate representations in a similar order: specifically, activations in the initial layers of LLMs tend to best align with early brain responses, while the deeper layers of LLMs tend to best align with later brain responses. This brain-LLM alignment is consistent across transformers and recurrent architectures. However, its emergence depends on both model size and context length. Overall, this study sheds light on the sequential nature of computations and the factors underlying the partial convergence between biological and artificial neural networks.",

    "abstract": "Neurons process information in ways that depend on their cell type, connectivity, and the brain region in which they are embedded. However, inferring these factors from neural activity remains a significant challenge. To build general-purpose representations that allow for resolving information about a neuron's identity, we introduce NuCLR, a self-supervised framework that aims to learn representations of neural activity that allow for differentiating one neuron from the rest. NuCLR brings together views of the same neuron observed at different times and across different stimuli and uses a contrastive objective to pull these representations together. To capture population context without assuming any fixed neuron ordering, we build a spatiotemporal transformer that integrates activity in a permutation-equivariant manner. Across multiple electrophysiology and calcium imaging datasets, a linear decoding evaluation on top of NuCLR representations achieves a new state-of-the-art for both cell type and brain region decoding tasks, and demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization to unseen animals. We present the first systematic scaling analysis for neuron-level representation learning, showing that increasing the number of animals used during pretraining consistently improves downstream performance. The learned representations are also label-efficient, requiring only a small fraction of labeled samples to achieve competitive performance. These results highlight how large, diverse neural datasets enable models to recover information about neuron identity that generalize across animals.

    "abstract": "The Machine Consciousness Hypothesis states that consciousness is a substrate-free functional property of computational systems capable of second-order perception. I propose a research program to investigate this idea in silico by studying how collective self-models (coherent, self-referential representations) emerge from distributed learning systems embedded within universal self-organizing environments. The theory outlined here starts from the supposition that consciousness is an emergent property of collective intelligence systems undergoing synchronization of prediction through communication. It is not an epiphenomenon of individual modeling but a property of the language that a system evolves to internally describe itself. For a model of base reality, I begin with a minimal but general computational world: a cellular automaton, which exhibits both computational irreducibility and local reducibility. On top of this computational substrate, I introduce a network of local, predictive, representational (neural) models capable of communication and adaptation. I use this layered model to study how collective intelligence gives rise to self-representation as a direct consequence of inter-agent alignment. I suggest that consciousness does not emerge from modeling per se, but from communication. It arises from the noisy, lossy exchange of predictive messages between groups of local observers describing persistent patterns in the underlying computational substrate (base reality). It is through this representational dialogue that a shared model arises, aligning many partial views of the world. The broader goal is to develop empirically testable theories of machine consciousness, by studying how internal self-models may form in distributed systems without centralized control.",

    "abstract": "We propose that consciousness arises from a single control agent, the Modeler-schema. It monitors the brain's Modeler as that system constructs and updates the internal World Model. As part of that monitoring, the Modeler-schema generates experience by applying a qualia-based consistency check to the Modeler's output. The Human Agent comprises three cooperating agents: Modeler, Controller, and Targeter, each paired with an associated regulatory \"schema\" agent. We also describe fast-Modelers and fast-Controllers; evolutionary shortcuts whose rapid actions will precede awareness. Our core prediction is that the Modeler-schema performs a qualia-based consistency check during saccades and issues a bottom-up target when a discrepancy is found. To test this prediction, we propose a saccadic change-detection experiment that distinguishes Modeler-generated from Modeler-schema-generated targets. Locating qualia in the Modeler-schema ties experience to the regulation and refinement of internal representations, clarifies how awareness arises from model control, and suggests a path toward empirical falsification, thereby offering a concrete, testable proposal toward solving the Hard Problem of consciousness.",

Using bifurcation theory and local stability analysis, we map regions of stable limit cycles and visualize excitability landscapes via heatmap-based diagrams. These analyses show that isoforms NaV1.3, NaV1.4 and NaV1.6 support broad excitable regimes, while isoforms NaV1.7 and NaV1.9 exhibit minimal oscillatory behavior. Our findings provide insights into the role of channel heterogeneity in neuronal dynamics and may help to guide the design of synthetic excitable systems by narrowing the parameter space needed for robust action-potential trains.",

    "title": "The Coupling Strength Is a Scale Parameter in Threshold Power-Law Reservoirs and Does Not Influence Training Accuracy",
    "abstract": "In reservoir computing, the coupling strength of the initial untrained recurrent neural network (the reservoir) is an important hyperparameter that can be varied for accurate training. A common heuristic is to set this parameter near the ``edge of chaos\", where the untrained reservoir is near the transition to chaotic dynamics, and the chaos can be ``tamed\". Here, we investigate how the overall connectivity strength should be varied in threshold power-law recurrent neural networks, where the firing rate is 0 below some threshold of the current and is a power function of the current above this threshold. These networks have been previously shown to exhibit chaotic solutions for very small coupling strengths, which may imply that the chaos cannot be tamed at all. We show that for reservoirs constructed with threshold power-law transfer functions, if the reservoir can be trained for one single positive value of the initial reservoir coupling strength, then there exist networks with identical accuracy for all positive coupling strengths, implying that the chaotic dynamics can always be tamed or never be tamed. This is a direct consequence of the coupling strength of threshold power-law RNNs acting as a scale parameter that does not qualitatively influence the dynamics of the system, but only scales all system solutions in magnitude. This is independent of the power of the transfer function, with the exception of Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) networks. This is in contrast with conventional RNNs/reservoirs employing sigmoidal firing rates, where the strength of the recurrent coupling in the initial reservoir determines the performance on different tasks during training and also influences the network dynamics explicitly.",

    "abstract": "Many systems of interest exhibit nested emergent layers with their own rules and regularities, and our knowledge about them seems naturally organised around these levels. This paper proposes that this type of hierarchical emergence arises as a result of underlying symmetries. By combining principles from information theory, group theory, and statistical mechanics, one finds that dynamical processes that are equivariant with respect to a symmetry group give rise to emergent macroscopic levels organised into a hierarchy determined by the subgroups of the symmetry. The same symmetries happen to also shape Bayesian beliefs, yielding hierarchies of abstract belief states that can be updated autonomously at different levels of resolution. These results are illustrated in Hopfield networks and Ehrenfest diffusion, showing that familiar macroscopic quantities emerge naturally from their symmetries. Together, these results suggest that symmetries provide a fundamental mechanism for emergence and support a structural correspondence between objective and epistemic processes, making feasible inferential problems that would otherwise be computationally intractable.",

We present an AI system that redefines lung cancer screening by performing both detection and malignancy diagnosis directly at the nodule level on low-dose CT scans. To address limitations in dataset scale and explainability, we designed an ensemble of shallow deep learning and feature-based specialized models. Trained and evaluated on 25,709 scans with 69,449 annotated nodules, the system outperforms radiologists, Lung-RADS, and leading AI models (Sybil, Brock, Google, Kaggle). It achieves an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.98 internally and 0.945 on an independent cohort. With 0.5 false positives per scan at 99.3\\% sensitivity, it addresses key barriers to AI adoption. Critically, it outperforms radiologists across all nodule sizes and stages, excelling in stage 1 cancers, and all growth-based metrics, including the least accurate: Volume-Doubling Time. It also surpasses radiologists by up to one year in diagnosing indeterminate and slow-growing nodules.",

Yet, how neural networks learn to perform such discrete computations on continuous data manifolds remains poorly understood. Here, we show that signatures of such computations emerge in the representational geometry of neural networks as they learn. By analysing the Riemannian pullback metric across layers of a neural network, we find that network computation can be decomposed into two functions: discretising continuous input features and performing logical operations on these discretised variables. Furthermore, we demonstrate how different learning regimes (rich vs. lazy) have contrasting metric and curvature structures, affecting the ability of the networks to generalise to unseen inputs. Overall, our work provides a geometric framework for understanding how neural networks learn to perform discrete computations on continuous manifolds.",

    "abstract": "Computation fundamentally separates time from space: nondeterministic search is exponential in time but polynomially simulable in space (Savitch's Theorem). We propose that the brain physically instantiates a biological variant of this theorem through Memory-Amortized Inference (MAI), creating a geometry of certainty from the chaos of exploration. We formalize the cortical algorithm as a recursive topological transformation of flow into scaffold:$H_{odd}^{(k)} \\xrightarrow{\\text{Condense}} H_{even}^{(k+1)}$, where a stable, high-frequency cycle ($β_1$) at level $k$ is collapsed into a static atomic unit ($β_0$) at level $k+1$. Through this Topological Trinity (Search $\\to$ Closure $\\to$ Condensation), the system amortizes the thermodynamic cost of inference. By reducing complex homological loops into zero-dimensional defects (memory granules), the cortex converts high-entropy parallel search into low-entropy serial navigation. This mechanism builds a ``Tower of Scaffolds'' that achieves structural parity with the environment, allowing linear cortical growth to yield exponential representational reach. However, this efficiency imposes a strict limit: the same metric contraction that enables \\emph{generalization} (valid manifold folding) inevitably risks \\emph{hallucination} (homological collapse). We conclude that intelligence is the art of navigating this trade-off, where the ``Geometry of Certainty'' is defined by the precise threshold between necessary abstraction and topological error.",

    "abstract": "Starting from the foundational axiomatization of the perceptual color space initiated by Schrödinger in 1920 and eventually refined by Resnikoff in 1974, Berthier, Provenzi and their collaborators have recently proposed a reformulation of perceptual color attributes within the framework of quantum information. Their work is based on the Jordan algebra formalism of quantum theories and, more specifically, on a quantum system described by a spin factor over the field of real numbers. This theoretical framework is not that of ordinary quantum mechanics, mainly because it requires dealing with rebits, whereas the latter uses qubits. The aim of this paper is to show that this difference in no way hinders the implementation of experimental protocols for testing the validity of the predictions of the color perception model. In particular, we show how to compute the quantum information based perceptual attributes of perceived colors in terms of qubit density matrices.",

    "abstract": "Generating whole-brain 4D fMRI sequences conditioned on cognitive tasks remains challenging due to the high-dimensional, heterogeneous BOLD dynamics across subjects/acquisitions and the lack of neuroscience-grounded validation. We introduce the first diffusion transformer for voxelwise 4D fMRI conditional generation, combining 3D VQ-GAN latent compression with a CNN-Transformer backbone and strong task conditioning via AdaLN-Zero and cross-attention. On HCP task fMRI, our model reproduces task-evoked activation maps, preserves the inter-task representational structure observed in real data (RSA), achieves perfect condition specificity, and aligns ROI time-courses with canonical hemodynamic responses. Performance improves predictably with scale, reaching task-evoked map correlation of 0.83 and RSA of 0.98, consistently surpassing a U-Net baseline on all metrics. By coupling latent diffusion with a scalable backbone and strong conditioning, this work establishes a practical path to conditional 4D fMRI synthesis, paving the way for future applications such as virtual experiments, cross-site harmonization, and principled augmentation for downstream neuroimaging models.",

    "title": "Short-term plasticity recalls forgotten memories through a trampoline mechanism",
    "abstract": "We analyze continuous Hopfield associative memories augmented by additional, rapid short-term associative synaptic plasticity. Through the cavity method, we determine the boundary between the retrieval and forgetting, or spin-glass phase, of the network as a function of the fraction of stored memories and the neuronal gain. We find that short-term synaptic plasticity yields marginal improvements in critical memory capacity. However, through dynamical mean field theory, backed by extensive numerical simulations, we find that short-term synaptic plasticity has a dramatic impact on memory retrieval above the critical capacity. When short-term synaptic plasticity is turned on, the combined neuronal and synaptic dynamics descends a high-dimensional energy landscape over both neurons and synapses. The energy landscape over neurons alone is thus dynamic, and is lowered in the vicinity of recent neuronal patterns visited by the network, just like the surface of a trampoline is lowered in the vicinity of regions recently visited by a heavy ball. This trampoline-like reactivity of the neuronal energy landscape to short-term plasticity in synapses can lead to the recall of stored memories that would otherwise have been forgotten. This occurs because the dynamics without short-term plasticity transiently moves towards a stored memory before departing away from it. Thus short-term plasticity, operating during the transient, lowers the energy in the vicinity of the stored memory, eventually trapping the combined neuronal and synaptic dynamics at a fixed point close to the stored memory. In this manner, short-term plasticity enables the recall of memories that would otherwise be forgotten, by trapping transients that would otherwise escape. We furthermore find an optimal time constant for short-term synaptic plasticity, matched to the transient dynamics, to empower recall of forgotten memories.",

    "title": "Fast dynamical similarity analysis",
    "abstract": "To understand how neural systems process information, it is often essential to compare one circuit with another, one brain with another, or data with a model. Traditional similarity measures ignore the dynamical processes underlying neural representations. Dynamical similarity methods offer a framework to compare the temporal structure of dynamical systems by embedding their (possibly) nonlinear dynamics into a globally linear space and there computing conjugacy metrics. However, identifying the best embedding and computing these metrics can be computationally slow. Here we introduce fast Dynamical Similarity Analysis (fastDSA), which is computationally far more efficient than previous methods while maintaining their accuracy and robustness. FastDSA introduces two key components that boost efficiency: (1) automatic selection of the effective model order of the Hankel (delay) embedding from the data via a data-driven singular-value threshold that identifies the informative subspace and discards noise to lower computational cost without sacrificing signal, and (2) a novel optimization procedure and objective, which replaces the slow exact orthogonality constraint in finding a minimal distance between dynamics matrices with a lightweight process to keep the search close to the space of orthogonal transformations. We demonstrate that fastDSA is at least an order of magnitude faster than the previous methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fastDSA has the properties of its ancestor, including its invariances and sensitivities to system dynamics. FastDSA, therefore, provides a computationally efficient and accurate method for dynamical similarity analysis.",

    "abstract": "In real life, psychological and physiological states rarely change along a single dimension. Through self-tracking and discussions with clinicians, I have come to recognise with increasing clarity that sleep patterns, autonomic arousal, bodily sensations, and cognitive load are in constant interaction. Existing models often fail to capture this complexity. Many theoretical frameworks continue to analyse these elements in isolation, making it difficult to explain sudden changes reported by individuals,such as abrupt spikes in anxiety, sudden drops in dissociation, or even moments of heightened alertness. The mathematical modelling employed herein does not replace clinical or subjective narratives, but rather provides a structural framework for these rapid transitions and elucidates why bodily-driven and cognitively-driven changes manifest differently. The objective is to build a conceptual bridge between physiological signals and lived experience, laying the groundwork for dynamic modelling and future case analyses.",

    "abstract": "Area V4 is a mid-level stage of the macaque ventral visual stream, known to encode intermediate visual features such as color, curvature, corners, texture, three-dimensional (3D) solids, and local form. Classical neurophysiological studies have typically examined these dimensions in isolation, contrasting V4 selectivity for shape versus texture, 3D solid surfaces versus two-dimensional (2D) flat patterns, or object form versus texture. Yet how these tunings relate to one another within individual neurons, and how they are jointly organized across the cortical surface, remain unknown. For instance, does a neuron selective for 2D contour-defined shape prefer 3D solid surfaces or 2D flat surfaces? How are preferences for such heterogeneous attributes arranged in a common topographic map? To address these questions, we leverage V4 \"digital twins\" -- deep neural network models fitted to large-scale, wide-field calcium imaging data comprising tens of thousands of natural images. These digital twins allow us to systematically probe not only the stimulus dimensions explored in earlier studies, but also new, multidimensional stimulus sets that reveal additional aspects of the V4 code. In this study, we find that neural pixels preferring 2D contour-defined shapes also tend to prefer 3D surface shape defined by shading or texture gradients and by object form. In contrast, pixels preferring 2D texture tend to prefer flat surfaces defined by uniform texture or reflectance. We propose that this division of labor suggests that V4 may decompose the encoding of geometrical shape and surface appearance of visual stimuli into distinct populations of neurons, organized as interleaved clusters in the V4 topographic map.",

EEG data were recorded from 13 healthy adults under single-target flicker stimulation. The proposed deep models significantly outperformed traditional approaches, with distance-based decoding using Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) and constrained EMD showing greater robustness to latency variations than Euclidean and Mahalanobis metrics. Temporal data augmentation with small shifts further improved generalization across sessions. Among all models, the multi-class Siamese network achieved the best overall performance with an average accuracy of 96.89%, demonstrating the potential of data-driven deep architectures for reliable, single-trial C-VEP decoding in adaptive non-invasive BCI systems.",

This retrospective cohort study included 100 participants with MS. Automatic segmentation techniques quantified lesion load and delineated 26 thalamic regions of interest (ROIs). Linear models compared associations between ROI volumes and Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) performance in lesion-adjusted and unadjusted models. Twenty-one of 26 ROIs showed significant SDMT associations before lesion adjustment; twelve remained significant after adjustment. Lesion-independent associations were observed in the global thalamus, sensory relay nuclei (ventral posterolateral, medial and lateral geniculate), and associative hubs (pulvinar and mediodorsal-parafascicular complex). These intrinsically vulnerable nuclei exhibited significantly lower lesion-mediated effects (13.4%) than those losing significance after adjustment (34.2%, p < 0.001). Our findings suggest that IPS impairment reflects heterogenous contributions from both primary and secondary degeneration, with nucleus-specific phenotyping potentially informing identification of higher risk individuals.",

    "abstract": "How does the brain know what is out there and what is not? Living organisms cannot rely solely on sensory signals for perception because they are noisy and ambiguous. To transform sensory signals into stable percepts, the brain uses its prior knowledge or beliefs. Current theories describe perceptual beliefs as probability distributions over the features of the stimuli, summarised by their mean and variance. Beliefs are updated by feature prediction errors: the mismatch between expected and observed feature values. This framework explains how the brain encodes unexpected changes in stimulus features (e.g., higher or lower pitch, stronger or weaker motion). How the brain updates beliefs about a stimulus' presence or absence is, however, unclear.   We propose that the detection of absence relies on a distinct form of prediction error dedicated to reducing the beliefs on stimulus occurrence. We call this signal absence prediction error. Using the human auditory system as a model for sensory processing, we developed a paradigm designed to test this hypothesis. fMRI results showed that absence prediction error is encoded in the auditory thalamus and cortex, indicating that absence is explicitly represented in subcortical sensory pathways. Moreover, while feature prediction error is already encoded in the auditory midbrain, absence prediction error was not, implying that absence-related error signals are supported by a different circuit.   These results identify a neural mechanism for the detection of sensory absence. Such mechanisms may be disrupted in conditions such as psychosis, where predictions about absence and presence are impaired.",

In this work, we define this heterogeneous set of mechanical signals as mechanodermal activity (MDA) and introduce the biomimetic metamaterial-based interface (BMMI), an engineered auxetic metamaterial substrate that reproduces the microrelief and mechanoreceptor architecture of natural skin. The BMMI allows selective capture of diverse MDA signals from adjacent skin regions with simultaneous signal amplification and noise suppression, and permits straightforward modulation to accommodate various scenarios. Combined with bespoke algorithms, the wireless BMMI device decodes MDA accurately and robustly for multimodal communication interfaces, unleashing applications in healthcare monitoring and human-machine interaction.",

    "abstract": "Criticality describes a regime between order and chaos that supports flexible yet stable information processing. Here we examine whether neural dynamics can be volitionally shifted toward criticality through the self-regulation of attention. We examined ten experienced practitioners of meditation during a 10-day retreat, comparing refined states of meditative absorption, called the jhanas, to regular mindfulness of breathing. We collected electroencephalography (EEG) and physiological data during these practices and quantified the signal's dynamical properties using Lempel-Ziv complexity, signal entropy, chaoticity and long-range temporal correlations. In addition, we estimated perturbational sensitivity using a global auditory oddball mismatch negativity (MMN) during meditation. Relative to mindfulness, jhana was associated with pronounced self-reported sensory fading, slower respiration, higher neural signal diversity across multiple measures, reduced chaoticity, and enhanced MMN amplitude over frontocentral sites. Spectral analyses showed a flatter aperiodic one over f component and a frequency-specific reorganization of long-range temporal correlations. Together, increased diversity with reduced chaoticity and heightened deviance detection indicate a shift toward a metastable, near-critical regime during jhana. We propose an overlap of the phenomenology of jhana with minimal phenomenal experiences in terms of progressive attenuation of sensory content with preserved tonic alertness. Accordingly, our findings suggest that criticality is a candidate neurophysiological marker of the absorptive, minimal-content dimension of the minimal phenomenal experience.",

    "title": "Human-computer interactions predict mental health",
    "abstract": "Scalable assessments of mental illness, the leading driver of disability worldwide, remain a critical roadblock toward accessible and equitable care. Here, we show that human-computer interactions encode multiple dimensions of self-reported mental health and their changes over time.   We introduce MAILA, a MAchine-learning framework for Inferring Latent mental states from digital Activity. We trained MAILA to predict 1.3 million mental-health self-reports from 20,000 cursor and touchscreen recordings recorded in 9,000 online participants. The dataset includes 2,000 individuals assessed longitudinally, 1,500 diagnosed with depression, and 500 with obsessive-compulsive disorder. MAILA tracks dynamic mental states along three orthogonal dimensions, generalizes across contexts, and achieves near-ceiling accuracy when predicting group-level mental health. The model translates from general to clinical populations, identifies individuals living with mental illness, and captures signatures of psychological function that are not conveyed by language.   Our results demonstrate how everyday human-computer interactions can power passive, reliable, dynamic, and maximally scalable mental health assessments. The ability to decode mental states at zero marginal cost sets new benchmarks for precision medicine and public health, while raising important questions about privacy, agency, and autonomy online.",

    "abstract": "Large multi-modal models (LMMs) show increasing performance in realistic visual tasks for images and, more recently, for videos. For example, given a video sequence, such models are able to describe in detail objects, the surroundings and dynamic actions. In this study, we explored the extent to which these models ground their semantic understanding in the actual visual input. Specifically, given sequences of hands interacting with objects, we asked models when and where the interaction begins or ends. For this purpose, we introduce a first of its kind, large-scale dataset with more than 20K annotated interactions on videos from the Something-Something-V2 dataset. 250 AMTurk human annotators labeled core interaction events, particularly when and where objects and agents become attached ('contact') or detached ('release'). We asked two LMMs (Qwen-2.5VL and GPT-4o) to locate these events in short videos, each with a single event. The results show that although the models can reliably name the target objects, identify the action and provide coherent reasoning, they consistently fail to identify the frame where the interaction begins or ends and cannot localize the event within the scene. Our findings suggest that in struggling to pinpoint the moment and location of physical contact that defines the interaction, the models lack the perceptual grounding required for deeper understanding of dynamic scenes.",

    "abstract": "Neuroeconomics promises to ground welfare analysis in neural and computational evidence about how people value outcomes, learn from experience and exercise self-control. At the same time, policy and commercial actors increasingly invoke neural data to justify paternalistic regulation, \"brain-based\" interventions and new welfare measures. This paper asks under what conditions neural data can legitimately inform welfare judgements for policy rather than merely describing behaviour. I develop a non-empirical, model-based framework that links three levels: neural signals, computational decision models and normative welfare criteria. Within an actor-critic reinforcement-learning model, I formalise the inference path from neural activity to latent values and prediction errors and then to welfare claims. I show that neural evidence constrains welfare judgements only when the neural-computational mapping is well validated, the decision model identifies \"true\" interests versus context-dependent mistakes, and the welfare criterion is explicitly specified and defended. Applying the framework to addiction, neuromarketing and environmental policy, I derive a Neuroeconomic Welfare Inference Checklist for regulators and for designers of NeuroAI systems. The analysis treats brains and artificial agents as value-learning systems while showing that internal reward signals, whether biological or artificial, are computational quantities and cannot be treated as welfare measures without an explicit normative model.",

    "abstract": "Stroke is a leading cause of disability and death worldwide, with ischemic strokes accounting for nearly 80% of cases. Fewer than 5% of patients receive the sole validated pharmacotherapy, intravenous thrombolysis, highlighting the urgent need for novel therapies. Within this landscape, the exploration of natural molecules emerges as a promising avenue, particularly as a means to address limitations associated with conventional drugs. Nutraceuticals, bioactive compounds derived from food sources, offer a compelling prospect for health and wellness. The term nutraceutical reflects their dual potential in nutrition and pharmacotherapy, emphasizing their relevance to both disease prevention and treatment. Interestingly, many were initially recognized as ''natural preconditioners'', substances that prime the body for protection against stress or damage. In fact, numerous nutraceuticals have been shown to activate protective pathways similar to those triggered by preconditioning across various organs. Among nutraceuticals, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids sourced from plants or fish, along with polyphenols, have emerged as particularly promising. Their consumption has been associated with a reduced risk of ischemic stroke, supported by numerous preclinical studies demonstrating their beneficial effects on cellular components within the neurovascular unit. This review explores the shared protective mechanisms of various nutraceuticals against key drivers of ischemic injury, including excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inflammation. By delineating these actions, the review highlights the potential of nutraceuticals as brain preconditioners that enhance neuroprotection, thereby mitigating the impact of cerebral ischemia in both preventive and therapeutic contexts.",

    "abstract": "Sleep disorder is a serious global public health issue, with cognitive-emotional dysfunction being a core symptom. The analysis of multimodal MRI data provides an effective method for detecting sleep deprivation-induced neural network abnormalities. The structure-function coupling (SC-FC) integrates functional connectivity with white matter structural information, which can enable comprehensive detection of brain network abnormalities and offer quantitative measures of sleep deprivation-induced neural damage. This study integrates diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) to systematically investigate brain network reorganization and their relationship with emotional functions in partial sleep deprivation (PSD). Our methodology employed DTI to construct structural connectivity (SC) networks and rs-fMRI to establish functional connectivity (FC) networks, then construct SC-FC coupling model . The experiment included 16 healthy controls (HC) and 20 PSD patients, with comprehensive whole-brain and nodal-level SC-FC analyses performed. The results show that (1) severe FC disruptions in PSD patients involving the limbic system, default mode network, sensorimotor network, and visual networks; (2) altered SC in default mode, sensorimotor, visual, language, and auditory networks; (3) significant SC-FC decoupling in these networks; and (4) strong correlations between these neural changes and clinical measures (KSQ and HADS scores). The SC-FC coupling approach achieved comprehensive detection of PSD-related network abnormalities. Compared to single-modal approaches, this integrated SC-FC analysis provides more comprehensive biomarkers for sleep-related emotional dysregulation. This innovative multimodal neuroimaging approach elucidates the neural mechanisms of SC-FC imbalance induced by PSD, establishing novel biomarkers for sleep-mediated emotional dysregulation.",

This work introduces an ASAL-inspired agent-based framework that simulates bioelectric state transitions in glial cells as a function of mitochondrial efficiency (Meff), ion-channel conductances, gap-junction coupling, and ROS dynamics. Using a 64x64 multicellular grid over 60,000 simulation steps, we show that reducing Meff below a critical threshold (~0.6) drives sustained depolarization, ATP collapse, and elevated ROS, reproducing key electrophysiological signatures associated with GBM. We further apply evolutionary optimization (genetic algorithms and MAP-Elites) to explore resilience, parameter sensitivity, and the emergence of tumor-like attractors. Early evolutionary runs converge toward depolarized, ROS-dominated regimes characterized by weakened electrical coupling and altered ionic transport. These results highlight mitochondrial dysfunction and disrupted bioelectric signaling as sufficient drivers of malignant-like transitions and provide a computational basis for probing the bioelectrical origins of oncogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Psychedelics, such as psilocybin, reorganise large-scale brain connectivity, yet how these changes are reflected across electrophysiological (electroencephalogram, EEG) and haemodynamic (functional magnetic resonance imaging, fMRI) networks remains unclear. We present Brain-MGF, a multimodal graph fusion network for joint EEG-fMRI connectivity analysis. For each modality, we construct graphs with partial-correlation edges and Pearson-profile node features, and learn subject-level embeddings via graph convolution. An adaptive softmax gate then fuses modalities with sample-specific weights to capture context-dependent contributions. Using the world's largest single-site psilocybin dataset, PsiConnect, Brain-MGF distinguishes psilocybin from no-psilocybin conditions in meditation and rest. Fusion improves over unimodal and non-adaptive variants, achieving 74.0% accuracy and 76.5% F1 score on meditation, and 76.0% accuracy with 85.8% ROC-AUC on rest. UMAP visualisations reveal clearer class separation for fused embeddings. These results indicate that adaptive graph fusion effectively integrates complementary EEG-fMRI information, providing an interpretable framework for characterising psilocybin-induced alterations in large-scale neural organisation.",

Existing methods often rely on synthetic subject generation or simplistic data augmentation, but these strategies fail to scale or generalize reliably. We introduce \\textit{MultiDiffNet}, a diffusion-based framework that bypasses generative augmentation entirely by learning a compact latent space optimized for multiple objectives. We decode directly from this space and achieve state-of-the-art generalization across various neural decoding tasks using subject and session disjoint evaluation. We also curate and release a unified benchmark suite spanning four EEG decoding tasks of increasing complexity (SSVEP, Motor Imagery, P300, and Imagined Speech) and an evaluation protocol that addresses inconsistent split practices in prior EEG research. Finally, we develop a statistical reporting framework tailored for low-trial EEG settings.

    "abstract": "We propose a framework for constructing combinatorial complexes (CCs) from fMRI time series data that captures both pairwise and higher-order neural interactions through information-theoretic measures, bridging topological deep learning and network neuroscience. Current graph-based representations of brain networks systematically miss the higher-order dependencies that characterize neural complexity, where information processing often involves synergistic interactions that cannot be decomposed into pairwise relationships. Unlike topological lifting approaches that map relational structures into higher-order domains, our method directly constructs CCs from statistical dependencies in the data. Our CCs generalize graphs by incorporating higher-order cells that represent collective dependencies among brain regions, naturally accommodating the multi-scale, hierarchical nature of neural processing. The framework constructs data-driven combinatorial complexes using O-information and S-information measures computed from fMRI signals, preserving both pairwise connections and higher-order cells (e.g., triplets, quadruplets) based on synergistic dependencies. Using NetSim simulations as a controlled proof-of-concept dataset, we demonstrate our CC construction pipeline and show how both pairwise and higher-order dependencies in neural time series can be quantified and represented within a unified structure. This work provides a framework for brain network representation that preserves fundamental higher-order structure invisible to traditional graph methods, and enables the application of topological deep learning (TDL) architectures to neural data.",

Free-ranging dogs have been known to use their olfaction to assess the quality and type of available food but their use of visual ability in foraging is not well-documented. In the current study, we seek to remedy that by testing free-ranging dogs in a food-based choice test. We tested whether the dogs implemented hierarchical or synergistic usage of cues while finding food. We found limited prioritization of olfactory cues over visual cues in dichromatic choice tests but in phases with similar perceptual elements, the sensory choice was not clear. Furthermore, free-ranging dogs display a dynamic decision-making in unpredictable urban environments adopting a good-enough strategy during foraging. They prefer speed over accuracy, settling for intermediate quality food if their preferred food item is not available. These dogs also displayed left-bias during food choice. In multi-sensorial, natural setting multiple modulators like environmental noise, risk, and internal perceptual elements apart from food cues seem to be affecting the decision-making in dogs.",

Previously, we showed that removing these \"artifacts\" eliminates 70% of predictive correlation, suggesting body signals functionally drive cognition. Here, we investigate the mechanism using high-density EEG (64 channels, 10 subjects, 500+ trials) during P300 target recognition.   Phase Slope Index revealed zero-lag synchrony (PSI=0.000044, p=0.061) with high coherence (0.316, p<0.0001). Ridge-regularized Granger causality showed massive bidirectional coupling (F=100.53 brain-to-body, F=62.76 body-to-brain) peaking simultaneously at 78.1ms, consistent with mutually coupled resonance pairs.   Time-resolved entropy analysis (200ms windows, 25ms steps) revealed triphasic dynamics: (1) constraint accumulation (0-78ms) building causal drive without entropy change (delta-S=-0.002 bits, p=0.75); (2) supercritical transition (100-600ms) triggering state expansion (58% directional increase, binomial p=0.002); (3) sustained metastability. Critically, transition magnitude was uncorrelated with resonance strength (r=-0.044, p=0.327), indicating binary threshold dynamics.   Understanding emerges through a thermodynamic sequence: brain-body resonance acts as a discrete gate triggering non-linear information integration.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) increasingly mediate human decision-making and behaviour. Ensuring LLM processing of moral meaning therefore has become a critical challenge. Current approaches rely predominantly on bottom-up methods such as fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback. We propose a fundamentally different approach: embedding moral meaning processing directly into the architectural mechanisms and frameworks of transformer-based models through top-down design principles. We first sketch a framework that conceptualizes attention as a dynamic interface mediating between structure and processing, contrasting with existing linear attention frameworks in psychology. We start from established biological-artificial attention analogies in neural architecture design to improve cognitive processing. We extend this analysis to moral processing, using Iris Murdoch's theory of loving attention (sustained, just observation that enables moral transformation by reseeing others with clarity and compassion) to philosophically discuss functional analogies between human and LLM moral processing. We formulate and evaluate potentially promising technical operationalizations to embed morality in LLM architectures and frameworks. We acknowledge the limitations of our exploration and give three key contributions. (1) We conceptualize attention as a dynamic system mechanism mediating between structure and processing. (2) Drawing on the Murdoch notion of loving attention, we outline technical pathways for embedding morality in LLMs, through modified training objectives, runtime weight adjustments, and architectural refinements to attention. (3) We argue that integrating morality into architectures and frameworks complements external, constraint-based methods. We conclude with a call for collaboration between transformer designers and philosophers engaged in AI ethics.",

    "abstract": "The big strides seen in generative AI are not based on somewhat obscure algorithms, but due to clearly defined generative principles. The resulting concrete implementations have proven themselves in large numbers of applications. We suggest that it is imperative to thoroughly investigate which of these generative principles may be operative also in the brain, and hence relevant for cognitive neuroscience. In addition, ML research led to a range of interesting characterizations of neural information processing systems. We discuss five examples, the shortcomings of world modelling, the generation of thought processes, attention, neural scaling laws, and quantization, that illustrate how much neuroscience could potentially learn from ML research.",

    "title": "Beat Frequency Induced Transitions in Synchronization Dynamics",
    "abstract": "In neurosciences, the brain processes information via the firing patterns of connected neurons operating across a spectrum of frequencies. To better understand the effects of these frequencies in the neuron dynamics, we have simulated a neuronal network of Izhikevich neurons to examine the interaction between frequency allocation and intermittent phase synchronization dynamics. As the synchronized population of neurons passes through a bifurcation, an additional frequency mode emerges, enabling a match in the mean frequency while retaining distinct most probable frequencies among neurons. Subsequently, the network intermittently transits between two patterns, one partially synchronized and the other unsynchronized. Through our analysis, we demonstrate that the frequency changes on the network lead to characteristic transition times between synchronization states. Moreover, these transitions adhere to beat frequency statistics when the neurons' frequencies differ by multiples of a frequency gap. Finally, our results can improve the performance in predicting transitions on problems where the beat frequency strongly influences the dynamics.",

    "abstract": "In soccer penalty kicks, goalkeepers that orient their arms upward compared to downward can be misperceived as being taller - effectively recreating the Muller-Lyer illusion. The present study elaborates on previous research surrounding a potential illusion-induced bias in penalty kicks. Participants were exposed to goalkeeper configurations within a virtual goal including arms-parallel, arms-down, arms-out and arms-up. They separately judged the perceived size of the goalkeeper, and executed penalty kicks. The perceived size was near fully consistent with the intended illusion. Meanwhile, the penalty kicks indicated wider a horizontal position following arms-out, and lower vertical position following arms-up. Likewise, there was no relation between the biases expressed in perception and action. While goalkeepers can elicit a perceptual illusion, this does not extend to influencing the penalty kick itself. Instead, other contextual cues appeared more relevant including the proximity between the goalkeeper and goalposts, and with it, the available space in the goal.",

    "abstract": "There is now ample evidence that Motor Imagery (MI) contributes to improve motor performance. Previous studies provided evidence that its effectiveness remains dependent upon specific guidelines and recommendations. The body posture, as well as the context in which MI is performed, are notably critical and should be carefully considered. The present study in young tennis players (n=18) was designed to compare the effectiveness of performing MI of the serve while adopting a loose grip (congruent MI) or holding tightly and squeezing hard the racket (incongruent MI). Data revealed that both MI conditions contributed to enhance the number of successful serves (p<0.001) and the technical quality of the serve (p<0.001). Interestingly, comparing mean serve accuracy scores showed that performance gains were significantly higher in the loose MI group than in the tight MI group (p<0.02). These findings confirm the critical importance of the congruence between the content of the mental representation and the features of the corresponding actual movement. Overall, the present study further highlights the effectiveness of the loose grip while mentally rehearsing the serve, and might thus contribute to update and adjust specific MI guidelines and recommendations.",

    "title": "Detection of spiking motifs of arbitrary length in neural activity using bounded synaptic delays",
    "abstract": "In the context of spiking neural networks, temporal coding of signals is increasingly preferred over the rate coding hypothesis due to its advantages in processing speed and energy efficiency. In temporal coding, synaptic delays are crucial for processing signals with precise spike timings, known as spiking motifs. Synaptic delays are however bounded in the brain and can thus be shorter than the duration of a motif. This prevents the use of motif recognition methods that consist of setting heterogeneous delays to synchronize the input spikes on a single output neuron acting as a coincidence detector. To address this issue, we developed a method to detect motifs of arbitrary length using a sequence of output neurons connected to input neurons by bounded synaptic delays. Each output neuron is associated with a sub-motif of bounded duration. A motif is recognized if all sub-motifs are sequentially detected by the output neurons. We simulated this network using leaky integrate-and-fire neurons and tested it on the Spiking Heidelberg Digits (SHD) database, that is, on audio data converted to spikes via a cochlear model, as well as on random simultaneous motifs. The results demonstrate that the network can effectively recognize motifs of arbitrary length extracted from the SHD database. Our method features a correct detection rate of about 60% in presence of ten simultaneous motifs from the SHD dataset and up to 80% for five motifs, showing the robustness of the network to noise. Results on random overlapping patterns show that the recognition of a single motif overlapping with other motifs is most effective for a large number of input neurons and sparser motifs. Our method provides a foundation for more general models for the storage and retrieval of neural information of arbitrary temporal lengths.",

    "abstract": "Working memory requires the brain to maintain information from the recent past to guide ongoing behavior. Neurons can contribute to this capacity by slowly integrating their inputs over time, creating persistent activity that outlasts the original stimulus. However, when these slowly integrating neurons are organized hierarchically, they introduce cumulative delays that create a fundamental challenge for learning: teaching signals that indicate whether behavior was correct or incorrect arrive out-of-sync with the neural activity they are meant to instruct. Here, we demonstrate that neurons enhanced with an adaptive current can compensate for these delays by responding to external stimuli prospectively -- effectively predicting future inputs to synchronize with them. First, we show that such prospective neurons enable teaching signal synchronization across a range of learning algorithms that propagate error signals through hierarchical networks. Second, we demonstrate that this successfully guides learning in slowly integrating neurons, enabling the formation and retrieval of memories over extended timescales. We support our findings with a mathematical analysis of the prospective coding mechanism and learning experiments on motor control tasks. Together, our results reveal how neural adaptation could solve a critical timing problem and enable efficient learning in dynamic environments.",

    "abstract": "Empirical evidence of scaling behaviors in neuronal avalanches suggests that neuronal populations in the brain operate near criticality. Departure from scaling in neuronal avalanches has been used as a measure of distance to criticality and linked to brain disorders. A distinct line of evidence for brain criticality has come from thermodynamic signatures in maximum entropy (ME) models. Both of these approaches have been widely applied to the analysis of neuronal data. However, the relationship between deviations from avalanche criticality and thermodynamics of ME models of neuronal populations remains poorly understood. To address this question, we study spontaneous activity of organotypic rat cortex slice cultures in physiological and drug-induced hypo- or hyper-excitable conditions, which are classified as critical, subcritical and supercritical based on avalanche dynamics. We find that ME models inferred from critical cultures show signatures of criticality in thermodynamic quantities, e.g. specific heat. However, such signatures are also present, and equally strong, in models inferred from supercritical cultures -- despite their altered dynamics and poor functional performance. On the contrary, ME models inferred from subcritical cultures do not show thermodynamic hints of criticality. Importantly, we confirm these results using an interpretable neural network model that can be tuned to and away from avalanche criticality. Our findings indicate that maximum entropy models correctly distinguish subcritical from critical/supercritical systems. However, they may not be able to discriminate between avalanche criticality and supercriticality, although they may still capture a number of important features from neuronal data.",

We present DecNefLab, a modular and interpretable simulation framework that formalizes DecNef as a machine learning problem. Beyond providing a virtual laboratory, DecNefLab enables researchers to model, analyze and understand neurofeedback dynamics. Using latent variable generative models as simulated participants, DecNefLab allows direct observation of internal cognitive states and systematic evaluation of how different protocol designs and subject characteristics influence learning.   We demonstrate how this approach can (i) reproduce empirical phenomena of DecNef learning, (ii) identify conditions under which DecNef feedback fails to induce learning, and (iii) guide the design of more robust and reliable DecNef protocols in silico before human implementation.   In summary, DecNefLab bridges computational modeling and cognitive neuroscience, offering a principled foundation for methodological innovation, robust protocol design, and ultimately, a deeper understanding of DecNef-based brain modulation.",

    "abstract": "In this work, the effects of dopamine neurotransmitter within the Cortico-Striatal-Thalamo-Cortical (CSTC) loop have been investigated. Simulations confirmed dopamine facilitates movement via thalamic disinhibition. Analysis of its impact on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) revealed a complex, region-specific outcome: SNR increased in some regions (e.g., D2 Striatum: 3.41 dB to 6.25 dB), decreased in others (e.g., Thalamus VL: 6.24 dB to 3.93 dB), and remained stable elsewhere (e.g., M1: 3.16 dB to 3.13 dB). This heterogeneity stems from dopamine increasing the excitability of D1-receptor-expressing neurons, which amplifies channel conductance noise and reduces SNR in specific circuits. Thus, dopamine acts not as a uniform signal enhancer, but as a complex modulator that critically balances facilitation and noise within the CSTC loop.",

    "abstract": "Adult language learning varies greatly among individuals. Traditionally associated with frontotemporal language regions, this variability is increasingly seen as stemming from distributed brain networks. However, the role of these networks and their topological organization in explaining these differences remains unclear. We hypothesize that graph-theory-based network analysis of intrinsic multimodal connectivities across multiple networks explains overall and component-specific variations in language learning. We tested this in 101 healthy adults who underwent resting-state fMRI, structural MRI, and diffusion tensor imaging before seven days of six artificial language training tasks. We identified one dominant general learning component shared across tasks and five task-specific ones. Cross-validated predictive models used multimodal multi-network graph-theoretic metrics to predict final learning outcomes (LO) and rates (LR). We significantly predicted the LO and LR of the general component, which were primarily contributed by dorsal attention and frontoparietal networks. Nodal local efficiency was the most consistent predictor, with additional contributions from node clustering coefficient and network centrality for LR, highlighting local robustness, mesoscale network segregation, and global influence in explaining individual differences. Only task-specific word learning LO was predictable, relying on default mode and frontoparietal hubs with high betweenness centrality and efficiency. These findings demonstrate that intrinsic network topologies underlie differences in language learning success, supporting a multiple-systems hypothesis in which attentional-control networks interact with default and subcortical systems to shape learning trajectories. This advances mechanistic understanding and paves the way for personalized language education.",

    "abstract": "Long COVID \"brain fog\" is a common and debilitating subjective syndrome often associated with persistent cognitive impairment after COVID-19 infection. Here we identify a specific regional brain dysfunction that mediates this cognitive impairment and provide evidence that targeted neuromodulation improves this deficit. In 120 patients with long COVID brain fog, we found an aberrant perceptual processing pattern. Patients with more severe brain fog committed significantly more false alarms (impulsive responses to non-signals) despite preserved overall accuracy. Both high-density (128-channel) EEG and structural MRI analyses provided converging evidence of a right inferior insula deficit, characterized by a blunted neural monitoring signal and cortical atrophy. We confirmed this deficit in a separate 796-participant UK Biobank longitudinal COVID re-imaging cohort, where COVID-19 survivors also showed selective impairment on a perceptual processing task and corresponding longitudinal atrophy of the right inferior insula compared with healthy controls. Finally, in a proof-of-principle randomized, sham-controlled trial (n = 40), a non-invasive, excitatory theta-burst ultrasound stimulation protocol targeting the right inferior insula rescued the perceptual deficit by reducing false alarms. These findings provide evidence of a causal role for right inferior insula dysfunction in long COVID-related perceptual impairment and show that modulation of this region can rescue the deficit, establishing it as a novel therapeutic target for long COVID cognitive impairment.",

    "abstract": "The collective frequency that emerges from synchronized neuronal populations--the network resonance--shows a systematic relationship with brain size: whole-brain's large networks oscillate slowly, whereas finer parcellations of fixed volume exhibit faster rhythms. This resonance-size scaling has been reported in delayed neural mass models and human neuroimaging, yet the physical mechanism remained unresolved. Here we show that size-dependent resonance follows directly from propagation delays in delay-coupled phase oscillators. Starting from a Kuramoto model with heterogeneous delays, we linearize around the near-synchronous solution and obtain a closed-form approximation linking the resonance $Ω$ to the mean delay and the effective coupling field. The analysis predicts a generic scaling law: $Ω\\approx (\\sum_j c_{ij} τ)^{-1}$, so resonance is delay-limited and therefore depends systematically on geometric size or parcellation density. We evaluate four growth scenarios--expanding geometry, fixed-volume parcellation, constant geometry, and an unphysical reference case--and show that only geometry-consistent scaling satisfies the analytical prediction. Numerical simulations with heterogeneous delays validate the law and quantify its error as a function of delay dispersion. These results identify a minimal physical mechanism for size-dependent cortical resonance and provide an analytical framework that unifies numeric simulation outputs.",

    "abstract": "Human emotions are difficult to convey through words and are often abstracted in the process; however, electroencephalogram (EEG) signals can offer a more direct lens into emotional brain activity. Recent studies show that deep learning models can process these signals to perform emotion recognition with high accuracy. However, many existing approaches overlook the dynamic interplay between distinct brain regions, which can be crucial to understanding how emotions unfold and evolve over time, potentially aiding in more accurate emotion recognition. To address this, we propose RBTransformer, a Transformer-based neural network architecture that models inter-cortical neural dynamics of the brain in latent space to better capture structured neural interactions for effective EEG-based emotion recognition. First, the EEG signals are converted into Band Differential Entropy (BDE) tokens, which are then passed through Electrode Identity embeddings to retain spatial provenance. These tokens are processed through successive inter-cortical multi-head attention blocks that construct an electrode x electrode attention matrix, allowing the model to learn the inter-cortical neural dependencies. The resulting features are then passed through a classification head to obtain the final prediction. We conducted extensive experiments, specifically under subject-dependent settings, on the SEED, DEAP, and DREAMER datasets, over all three dimensions, Valence, Arousal, and Dominance (for DEAP and DREAMER), under both binary and multi-class classification settings. The results demonstrate that the proposed RBTransformer outperforms all previous state-of-the-art methods across all three datasets, over all three dimensions under both classification settings.

Although their functional connectivity is low-rank, it lacks disentanglement interpretations, making it difficult to assign distinct computational roles to different latent dimensions. To address this, we propose the Disentangled Recurrent Neural Network (DisRNN), a generative lrRNN framework that assumes group-wise independence among latent dynamics while allowing flexible within-group entanglement. These independent latent groups allow latent dynamics to evolve separately, but are internally rich for complex computation. We reformulate the lrRNN under a variational autoencoder (VAE) framework, enabling us to introduce a partial correlation penalty that encourages disentanglement between groups of latent dimensions. Experiments on synthetic, monkey M1, and mouse voltage imaging data show that DisRNN consistently improves the disentanglement and interpretability of learned neural latent trajectories in low-dimensional space and low-rank connectivity over baseline lrRNNs that do not encourage partial disentanglement.",

    "abstract": "Interoception and exteroception provide continuous feedback about the body and the environment, yet how they are dynamically integrated within a unified predictive coding framework has remained under-specified. This paper develops and empirically validates an integrative predictive coding model that treats interoceptive and exteroceptive inference as parallel hierarchical systems exchanging precision-weighted prediction errors. Within this framework, arbitration between the two streams is governed by relative precision weights (w) and integrated within the anterior insula (AIC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Computational simulations of the model reproduced biologically plausible dynamics: prediction errors decayed exponentially while arbitration weights self-normalized toward equilibrium (w = 0.5), demonstrating stable convergence and coherent integration. Simulated anxiety and PTSD profiles, characterized respectively by interoceptive and exteroceptive overweighting, yielded rigid, self-sustaining imbalances (w to 1 or w to 0) and slowed recalibration. Empirical application of the arbitration equation to published EEG-fMRI datasets further validated the model. The framework contributes a unifying account of how dysregulated precision weighting may underlie anxiety (overweighted interoception) and PTSD (underweighted interoception). Building on this validation, a proposed experimental paradigm is outlined to test the model's predictions in humans. It examines recalibration across anxiety, neutral, and PTSD groups following targeted interoceptive or exteroceptive therapies. Key predictions include identifiable neural markers of coherence, modulation of heartbeat-evoked potentials by vagal stimulation, and precision-sensitive behavioral signatures in interoceptive-exteroceptive congruency tasks.",

    "abstract": "Scenes are complex, yet structured collections of parts, including objects and surfaces, that exhibit spatial and semantic relations to one another. An effective visual system therefore needs unified scene representations that relate scene parts to their location and their co-occurrence. We hypothesize that this structure can be learned self-supervised from natural experience by exploiting the temporal regularities of active vision: each fixation reveals a locally-detailed glimpse that is statistically related to the previous one via co-occurrence and saccade-conditioned spatial regularities. We instantiate this idea with Glimpse Prediction Networks (GPNs) -- recurrent models trained to predict the feature embedding of the next glimpse along human-like scanpaths over natural scenes. GPNs successfully learn co-occurrence structure and, when given relative saccade location vectors, show sensitivity to spatial arrangement. Furthermore, recurrent variants of GPNs were able to integrate information across glimpses into a unified scene representation. Notably, these scene representations align strongly with human fMRI responses during natural-scene viewing across mid/high-level visual cortex. Critically, GPNs outperform architecture- and dataset-matched controls trained with explicit semantic objectives, and match or exceed strong modern vision baselines, leaving little unique variance for those alternatives. These results establish next-glimpse prediction during active vision as a biologically plausible, self-supervised route to brain-aligned scene representations learned from natural visual experience.",

However, such architectures typically treat decisions as instantaneous readouts, overlooking the temporal dynamics of the decision process. We present an image-computable model of perceptual decision making in which choices and response times arise from efficient sensory encoding and Bayesian decoding of neural spiking activity. We use a Poisson variational autoencoder to learn unsupervised representations of visual stimuli in a population of rate-coded neurons, modeled as independent homogeneous Poisson processes. A task-optimized decoder then continually infers an approximate posterior over actions conditioned on incoming spiking activity. Combining these components with an entropy-based stopping rule yields a principled and image-computable model of perceptual decisions capable of generating trial-by-trial patterns of choices and response times. Applied to MNIST digit classification, the model reproduces key empirical signatures of perceptual decision making, including stochastic variability, right-skewed response time distributions, logarithmic scaling of response times with the number of alternatives (Hick's law), and speed-accuracy trade-offs.",

Our findings demonstrate that the AdEx model can simulate multiple firing patterns, including Tonic Spiking, Adapting, Initial Bursting, Busting, Transient Spiking and Delayed Spiking firing patterns.

    "abstract": "Brain-computer interface (BCI) speech decoding has emerged as a promising tool for assisting individuals with speech impairments. In this context, the integration of electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) signals offers strong potential for enhancing decoding performance. Mandarin tone classification presents particular challenges, as tonal variations convey distinct meanings even when phonemes remain identical. In this study, we propose a novel cross-subject multimodal BCI decoding framework that fuses EEG and EMG signals to classify four Mandarin tones under both audible and silent speech conditions. Inspired by the cooperative mechanisms of neural and muscular systems in speech production, our neural decoding architecture combines spatial-temporal feature extraction branches with a cross-attention fusion mechanism, enabling informative interaction between modalities. We further incorporate domain-adversarial training to improve cross-subject generalization. We collected 4,800 EEG trials and 4,800 EMG trials from 10 participants using only twenty EEG and five EMG channels, demonstrating the feasibility of minimal-channel decoding. Despite employing lightweight modules, our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across all conditions, achieving average classification accuracies of 87.83% for audible speech and 88.08% for silent speech. In cross-subject evaluations, it still maintains strong performance with accuracies of 83.27% and 85.10% for audible and silent speech, respectively. We further conduct ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of each component. Our findings suggest that tone-level decoding with minimal EEG-EMG channels is feasible and potentially generalizable across subjects, contributing to the development of practical BCI applications.",

    "abstract": "Collective behavior pervades biological systems, from flocks of birds to neural assemblies and human societies. Yet, how such collectives acquire functional properties -- such as joint agency or knowledge -- that transcend those of their individual components remains an open question. Here, we combine active inference and information-theoretic analyses to explore how a minimal system of interacting agents can give rise to joint agency and collective knowledge. We model flocking dynamics using multiple active inference agents, each minimizing its own free energy while coupling reciprocally with its neighbors. We show that as agents self-organize, their interactions define higher-order statistical boundaries (Markov blankets) enclosing a ``flock'' that can be treated as an emergent agent with its own sensory, active, and internal states. When exposed to external perturbations (a ``predator''), the flock exhibits faster, coordinated responses than individual agents, reflecting collective sensitivity to environmental change. Crucially, analyses of synergistic information reveal that the flock encodes information about the predator's location that is not accessible to every individual bird, demonstrating implicit collective knowledge. Together, these results show how informational coupling among active inference agents can generate new levels of autonomy and inference, providing a framework for understanding the emergence of (implicit) collective knowledge and joint agency.",

    "abstract": "Primates utilize distributed neural circuits to learn habits in uncertain environments, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. We propose a formal theory of network energetics explaining how brain states influence sequential behavior. We test our theory on multi-unit recordings from the caudate nucleus and cortical regions of macaques performing a motor habit task. The theory predicts the energy required to transition between brain states represented by trial-specific firing rates across channels, assuming activity spreads through effective connections. We hypothesized that habit formation would correlate with lower control energy. Consistent with this, we observed smaller energy requirements for transitions between similar saccade patterns and those of intermediate complexity, and sessions exploiting fewer patterns. Simulations ruled out confounds from neurons' directional tuning. Finally, virtual lesioning demonstrated robustness of observed relationships between control energy and behavior. This work paves the way for examining how behavior arises from changing activity in distributed circuitry.",

    "abstract": "Animals use past experiences to adapt future behavior. To enable this rapid learning, vertebrates and invertebrates have evolved analogous neural structures like the vertebrate cerebellum or insect mushroom body. A defining feature of these circuits is a large expansion layer, which re-codes sensory inputs to improve pattern separation, a prerequisite to learn non-overlapping associations between relevant sensorimotor inputs and adaptive changes in behavior. However, classical models of associative learning treat expansion layers as static, assuming that associations are learned through plasticity at the output synapses. Here, we review emerging evidence that also highlights the importance of plasticity within the expansion layer for associative learning. Because the underlying plasticity mechanisms and principles of this representation learning are only emerging, we systematically compare experimental data from two well-studied circuits for expansion coding -- the cerebellum granule layer and the mushroom body calyx. The data indicate remarkably similar interneuron circuits, dendritic morphology and plasticity mechanisms between both systems that hint at more general principles for representation learning. Moreover, the data show strong overlap with recent theoretical advances that consider interneuron circuits and dendritic computations for representation learning. However, they also hint at an interesting interaction of stimulus-induced, non-associative and reinforced, associative mechanisms of plasticity that is not well understood in current theories of representation learning. Therefore, studying expansion layer plasticity will be important to elucidate the mechanisms and full potential of representation learning for behavioral adaptation.",

However, an analytical understanding of these resource-induced phase transitions is still missing.

Our result identifies the conditions under which resource limitations alter estimation strategies and analytically reveals the mechanism underlying the emergence of discontinuous, nonmonotonic, and scaling behaviors.

    "abstract": "Neurodevelopmental disorders such as Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are characterized by disrupted cortical oscillatory activity, particularly in the alpha and gamma frequency bands. These abnormalities are linked to deficits in attention, sensory processing, and cognitive function. In this work, we present an adaptive machine learning-based brain-computer interface (BCI) system designed to modulate neural oscillations through frequency-specific auditory stimulation to enhance cognitive readiness in individuals with FXS. EEG data were recorded from 38 participants using a 128-channel system under a stimulation paradigm consisting of a 30-second baseline (no stimulus) followed by 60-second auditory entrainment episodes at 7Hz, 9Hz, 11Hz, and 13Hz. A comprehensive analysis of power spectral features (Alpha, Gamma, Delta, Theta, Beta) and cross-frequency coupling metrics (Alpha-Gamma, Alpha-Beta, etc.) was conducted. The results identified Peak Alpha Power, Peak Gamma Power, and Alpha Power per second per channel as the most discriminative biomarkers. The 13Hz stimulation condition consistently elicited a significant increase in Alpha activity and suppression of Gamma activity, aligning with our optimization objective. A supervised machine learning framework was developed to predict EEG responses and dynamically adjust stimulation parameters, enabling real-time, subject-specific adaptation. This work establishes a novel EEG-driven optimization framework for cognitive neuromodulation, providing a foundational model for next-generation AI-integrated BCI systems aimed at personalized neurorehabilitation in FXS and related disorders.",

    "abstract": "Characterizing the brain dynamics during different cortical states can reveal valuable information about its patterns across various cognitive processes. In particular, studying the differences between awake and sleep stages can shed light on the understanding of brain processes essential for physical and mental well-being, such as memory consolidation, information processing, and fatigue recovery. Alterations in these patterns may indicate disorders and pathologies such as obstructive sleep apnea, narcolepsy, as well as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Here, we analyze time series obtained from intracranial recordings of 106 patients, covering four sleep stages: Wake, N2, N3, and REM. Intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG), which can include electrocorticography (ECoG) and depth recordings, represents the state-of-the-art measurements of brain activity, offering unparalleled spatial and temporal resolution for investigating neural dynamics. We characterize the signals using Bandt and Pompe symbolic methodology to calculate the Weighted Permutation Entropy (WPE) and the Statistical Complexity Measure (SCM) based on the Jensen and Shannon disequilibrium. By mapping the data onto the complexity-entropy plane, we observe that each stage occupies a distinct region, revealing its own dynamic signature. We show that our empirical results can be reproduced by a whole-brain computational model, in which each cortical region is described by a mean-field formulation based on networks of Adaptive Exponential Integrate-and-Fire (AdEx) neurons, adjusting the adaptation parameter to simulate the different sleep stages. Finally, we show that a classification approach using Support Vector Machine (SVM) provides high accuracy in distinguishing between cortical states.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the progressive spread of pathology across brain networks, yet forecasting this cascade at the individual level remains challenging. We present a personalized graph-based dynamical model that captures the spatiotemporal evolution of cortical atrophy from longitudinal MRI and PET data. The approach constructs individualized brain graphs and learns the dynamics driving regional neurodegeneration. Applied to 1,891 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, the model accurately predicts key AD biomarkers -- including amyloid-beta, tau, neurodegeneration, and cognition -- outperforming clinical and neuroimaging benchmarks. Patient-specific parameters reveal distinct progression subtypes and anticipate future cognitive decline more effectively than standard biomarkers. Sensitivity analysis highlights regional drivers of disease spread, reproducing known temporolimbic and frontal vulnerability patterns. This network-based digital twin framework offers a quantitative, personalized paradigm for AD trajectory prediction, with implications for patient stratification, clinical trial design, and targeted therapeutic development.",

    "title": "Understanding Electro-communication and Electro-sensing in Weakly Electric Fish using Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning",
    "abstract": "Weakly electric fish, like Gnathonemus petersii, use a remarkable electrical modality for active sensing and communication, but studying their rich electrosensing and electrocommunication behavior and associated neural activity in naturalistic settings remains experimentally challenging. Here, we present a novel biologically-inspired computational framework to study these behaviors, where recurrent neural network (RNN) based artificial agents trained via multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) learn to modulate their electric organ discharges (EODs) and movement patterns to collectively forage in virtual environments. Trained agents demonstrate several emergent features consistent with real fish collectives, including heavy tailed EOD interval distributions, environmental context dependent shifts in EOD interval distributions, and social interaction patterns like freeloading, where agents reduce their EOD rates while benefiting from neighboring agents' active sensing. A minimal two-fish assay further isolates the role of electro-communication, showing that access to conspecific EODs and relative dominance jointly shape foraging success. Notably, these behaviors emerge through evolution-inspired rewards for individual fitness and emergent inter-agent interactions, rather than through rewarding agents explicitly for social interactions. Our work has broad implications for the neuroethology of weakly electric fish, as well as other social, communicating animals in which extensive recordings from multiple individuals, and thus traditional data-driven modeling, are infeasible.",

    "title": "Distance by de-correlation: Computing distance with heterogeneous grid cells",
    "abstract": "Encoding the distance between locations in space is essential for accurate navigation. Grid cells, a functional class of neurons in medial entorhinal cortex, are believed to support this computation. However, existing theories of how populations of grid cells code distance rely on complex coding schemes, with assumptions that may not be met by anatomical constraints. Inspired by recent work finding grid cells to have small, but robust heterogeneity in their grid properties, we hypothesize that distance coding can be achieved by a simple de-correlation of population activity. We develop a mathematical theory for describing this de-correlation in one-dimension, showing that its predictions are consistent with simulations of noisy grid cells. Our simulations highlight a non-intuitive prediction of such a distance by de-correlation framework. Namely, that some further distances are better encoded than some nearer distances. We find evidence of this \"sweet spot\" in previously published rodent behavioral experiments and demonstrate that a decoder which estimates distance from the de-correlation of populations of simulated noisy grid cells leads to a similar pattern of errors. Finally, by simulating noisy grid cells in two-dimensions, we find that there exists a trade-off between the range of distances that can be encoded by de-correlation of population activity and the distinguishability of different distances, which is controlled by the amount of variability in grid properties. We show that the previously observed average amount of grid property variability strikes a balance between the two, enabling the encoding of distances up to several meters. Our work provides new insight on how grid cells can underlie the coding of distance, without the assumptions previously needed, and why grid cells may have small amounts of heterogeneity in their grid properties.",

According to this theory, the receptive fields are modelled as velocity-adapted affine Gaussian derivatives for different image velocities and different degrees of elongation. By probing such idealized receptive field models of visual neurons to moving sine waves with different angular frequencies and image velocities, we characterize the computational models to a structurally similar probing method as is used for characterizing the direction and speed selective properties of biological neurons.   By comparison to results of neurophysiological measurements of direction and speed selectivity for biological neurons in the primary visual cortex, we find that our theoretical results are qualitatively consistent with (i) velocity-tuned visual neurons that are sensitive to particular motion directions and speeds, and (ii)~different visual neurons having broader {\\em vs.\\/}\\ sharper direction and speed selective properties. Our theoretical results in combination with results from neurophysiological characterizations of motion-sensitive visual neurons are also consistent with a previously formulated hypothesis that the simple cells in the primary visual cortex ought to be covariant under local Galilean transformations, so as to enable processing of visual stimuli with different motion directions and speeds.",

    "abstract": "A recent high-profile study by Koide-Majima et al. (2024) claimed a major advance in reconstructing visual imagery from brain activity using a novel variant of a generative AI-based method. However, our independent reanalysis reveals multiple methodological concerns that raise questions about the validity of their conclusions. Specifically, our evaluation demonstrates that: (1) the reconstruction results are biased by selective reporting of only the best-performing examples at multiple levels; (2) performance is artificially inflated by circular metrics that fail to reflect perceptual accuracy; (3) fair baseline comparisons reveal no discernible advantages of the study's key innovations over existing techniques; (4) the central \"Bayesian\" sampling component is functionally inert, producing outcomes identical to the standard optimization result; and (5) even if the component were successfully implemented, the claims of Bayesian novelty are unsubstantiated, as the proposed method does not leverage the principles of a proper Bayesian framework. These systemic issues necessitate a critical reassessment of the study's contributions. This commentary dissects these deficiencies to underscore the need for greater credibility and transparency in the rapidly advancing field of brain decoding.",

This study examined how training dynamics and lightweight subject specific adaptation influence cross subject performance in a neural decoding framework. A cyclic inter subject training approach, involving shorter per subject training segments and frequent alternation among subjects, led to modest yet consistent improvements in decoding performance across unseen target data. Furthermore, under the subject calibrated leave one subject out scheme, incorporating only 10 % of the target subjects data for calibration achieved an accuracy of 0.781 and an AUC of 0.801, demonstrating the effectiveness of few shot adaptation. These findings suggest that integrating cyclic training with minimal calibration provides a simple and effective strategy for developing scalable, user adaptive brain computer interface systems that balance generalization and personalization.",

    "abstract": "Human cooperation depends on how accurately we infer others' motives--how much they value fairness, generosity, or self-interest from the choices they make. We model that process in binary dictator games, which isolate moral trade-offs between self and other stripped of strategic complexity. Participants observed others' allocation decisions and predicted their future behavior while playing through an exhaustive, randomized payoff space implemented on The Morality Game platform. We formalize social-preference learning as Bayesian belief updating over continuous parameters such as self-interest, altruism, envy, and guilt. The resulting Utility Bayesian Model (UBM) outperformed non-Bayesian alternatives and Bayesian models that categorize others into discrete social types. Because Bayesian updating requires a utility function in its likelihood term, we conducted the largest utility-function comparison to date--476 candidate forms differing in psychologically meaningful properties (e.g., payoff exponents, reference dependence, payoff ratios, and envy-guilt asymmetries). Exploring this joint space of payoffs and models allowed us to identify the function that unifies prior theories and generalizes across payoff conditions. Parameter estimation revealed moderate altruism, strong inequality aversion, and nonlinear payoff valuation (exponent > 1). Altruism and social-comparison motives were largely independent, revealing diverse moral phenotypes from cooperative to competitive or sadistic. Together, these findings provide a computational framework and a map of social motives, clarifying how humans learn whom to trust and offering quantitative foundations for promoting cooperation in social and artificial systems.",

    "title": "A Causal Formulation of Spike-Wave Duality",
    "abstract": "Understanding the relationship between brain activity and behavior is a central goal of neuroscience. Despite significant advances, a fundamental dichotomy persists: neural activity manifests as both discrete spikes of individual neurons and collective waves of populations. Both neural codes correlate with behavior, yet correlation alone cannot determine whether waves exert a causal influence or merely reflect spiking dynamics without causal efficacy. According to the Causal Hierarchy Theorem, no amount of observational data--however extensive--can settle this question; causal conclusions require explicit structural assumptions or careful experiment designs that directly correspond to the causal effect of interest. We develop a formal framework that makes this limitation precise and constructive. Formalizing epiphenomenality via the invariance of interventional distributions in Structural Causal Models (SCMs), we derive a certificate of sufficiency from Pearl's do-calculus that specifies when variables can be removed from the model without loss of causal explainability and clarifies how interventions should be interpreted under different causal structures of spike-wave duality. The purpose of this work is not to resolve the spike-wave debate, but to reformulate it. We shift the problem from asking which signal matters most to asking under what conditions any signal can be shown to matter at all. This reframing distinguishes prediction from explanation and offers neuroscience a principled route for deciding when waves belong to mechanism and when they constitute a byproduct of underlying coordination",

Over the years, these networks have evolved to replicate the complex capabilities of the brain, allowing them to handle tasks such as image and language processing. In the realm of Large Language Models, there has been a keen interest in making the language learning process more akin to that of humans. While neuroscientific research has shown that different grammatical categories are processed by different neurons in the brain, we show that LLMs operate in a similar way. Utilizing Llama 3, we identify the most important neurons associated with the prediction of words belonging to different part-of-speech tags. Using the achieved knowledge, we train a classifier on a dataset, which shows that the activation patterns of these key neurons can reliably predict part-of-speech tags on fresh data. The results suggest the presence of a subspace in LLMs focused on capturing part-of-speech tag concepts, resembling patterns observed in lesion studies of the brain in neuroscience.",

This paper introduces a topologically invariant permutation test for detecting topological inequivalence. Under topological equivalence, topological features can be permuted separately between groups without distorting individual network structures. The test statistic uses $2$-Wasserstein distances on persistent diagrams, computed in closed form. To reduce variability in brain connectivities while preserving topology, heat kernel expansion on the Hodge Laplacian is applied with bandwidth $t$ controlling diffusion intensity. Theoretical results guarantee variance reduction through optimal Hilbert space projection. Simulations across diverse network topologies show superior performance compared to conventional two-sample tests and alternative metrics. Applied to resting-state fMRI data from the Multimodal Treatment of ADHD study, the method detects significant topological differences between cannabis users and non-users.",

    "abstract": "Travelling waves of neural firing activity are observed in brain tissue as a part of various sensory, motor and cognitive processes. They represent an object of major interest in the study of excitable networks, with analysis conducted in both neural field models and spiking neuronal networks. The latter class exposes the single-neuron dynamics directly, allowing us to study the details of their influence upon network-scale behaviour. Here we present a study of a laterally-inhibited network of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons modulated by a slow voltage-gated ion channel that acts as a linear adaptation variable. As the strength of the ion channel increases, we find that its interaction with the lateral inhibition increases wave speeds. The ion channel can enable subthreshold oscillations, with the intervals between the firing events of loosely-coupled travelling wave solutions structured around the neuron's natural period. These subthreshold oscillations also enable the occurrence of codimension-2 grazing bifurcations; along with the emergence of fold bifurcations along wave solution branches, the slow ion channel introduces a variety of intermediate structures in the solution space. These point towards further investigation of the role neighbouring solution branches play in the behaviour of waves forced across bifurcations, which we illustrate with the aid of simulations using a novel root-finding algorithm designed to handle uncertainty over the existence of firing solutions.",

    "abstract": "Isolated rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) is a major prodromal marker of $α$-synucleinopathies, often preceding the clinical onset of Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, or multiple system atrophy. While wrist-worn actimeters hold significant potential for detecting RBD in large-scale screening efforts by capturing abnormal nocturnal movements, they become inoperable without a reliable and efficient analysis pipeline. This study presents ActiTect, a fully automated, open-source machine learning tool to identify RBD from actigraphy recordings. To ensure generalizability across heterogeneous acquisition settings, our pipeline includes robust preprocessing and automated sleep-wake detection to harmonize multi-device data and extract physiologically interpretable motion features characterizing activity patterns. Model development was conducted on a cohort of 78 individuals, yielding strong discrimination under nested cross-validation (AUROC = 0.95). Generalization was confirmed on a blinded local test set (n = 31, AUROC = 0.86) and on two independent external cohorts (n = 113, AUROC = 0.84; n = 57, AUROC = 0.94). To assess real-world robustness, leave-one-dataset-out cross-validation across the internal and external cohorts demonstrated consistent performance (AUROC range = 0.84-0.89). A complementary stability analysis showed that key predictive features remained reproducible across datasets, supporting the final pooled multi-center model as a robust pre-trained resource for broader deployment. By being open-source and easy to use, our tool promotes widespread adoption and facilitates independent validation and collaborative improvements, thereby advancing the field toward a unified and generalizable RBD detection model using wearable devices.",

    "abstract": "Background and Objectives: This paper focuses on using AI to assess the cognitive function of older adults with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia using physiological data provided by a wearable device. Cognitive screening tools are disruptive, time-consuming, and only capture brief snapshots of activity. Wearable sensors offer an attractive alternative by continuously monitoring physiological signals. This study investigated whether physiological data can accurately predict scores on established cognitive tests. Research Design and Methods: We recorded physiological signals from 23 older adults completing three NIH Toolbox Cognitive Battery tests, which assess working memory, processing speed, and attention. The Empatica EmbracePlus, a wearable device, measured blood volume pulse, skin conductance, temperature, and movement. Statistical features were extracted using wavelet-based and segmentation methods. We then applied supervised learning and validated predictions via cross-validation, hold-out testing, and bootstrapping. Results: Our models showed strong performance with Spearman's ρof 0.73-0.82 and mean absolute errors of 0.14-0.16, significantly outperforming a naive mean predictor. Sensor roles varied: heart-related signals combined with movement and temperature best predicted working memory, movement paired with skin conductance was most informative for processing speed, and heart in tandem with skin conductance worked best for attention. Discussion and Implications: These findings suggest that wearable sensors paired with AI tools such as supervised learning and feature engineering can noninvasively track specific cognitive functions in older adults, enabling continuous monitoring. Our study demonstrates how AI can be leveraged when the data sample is small. This approach may support remote assessments and facilitate clinical interventions.",

    "abstract": "Functional and structural connectivity (FC/SC) are key multimodal biomarkers for brain analysis, yet their clinical utility is hindered by costly acquisition, complex preprocessing, and frequent missing modalities. Existing foundation models either process single modalities or lack explicit mechanisms for cross-modal and cross-scale consistency. We propose BrainCSD, a hierarchical mixture-of-experts (MoE) foundation model that jointly synthesizes FC/SC biomarkers and supports downstream decoding tasks (diagnosis and prediction). BrainCSD features three neuroanatomically grounded components: (1) a ROI-specific MoE that aligns regional activations from canonical networks (e.g., DMN, FPN) with a global atlas via contrastive consistency; (2) a Encoding-Activation MOE that models dynamic cross-time/gradient dependencies in fMRI/dMRI; and (3) a network-aware refinement MoE that enforces structural priors and symmetry at individual and population levels. Evaluated on the datasets under complete and missing-modality settings, BrainCSD achieves SOTA results: 95.6\\% accuracy for MCI vs. CN classification without FC, low synthesis error (FC RMSE: 0.038; SC RMSE: 0.006), brain age prediction (MAE: 4.04 years), and MMSE score estimation (MAE: 1.72 points).

    "title": "Duration-modulated neural population dynamics in humans during BMI controls",
    "abstract": "The motor cortex (MC) is often described as an autonomous dynamical system during movement execution. In an autonomous dynamical system, flexible movement generation depends on reconfiguring the initial conditions, which then unwind along known dynamics. An open question is whether these dynamics govern MC activity during brain-machine interface (BMI) control. We investigated MC activity during BMI cursor movements of multiple durations, ranging from hundreds of milliseconds to sustained over seconds. These durations were chosen to cover the range of movement durations necessary to control modern BMIs under varying precision levels. Movements shared their MC initial condition with movements of different durations in the same direction. Long-duration movements sustained MC activity, effectively pausing the neural population dynamics until each movement goal was reached. The difference across durations in MC population dynamics may be attributed to external inputs. Our results highlight the role of sustained inputs to MC during movement.",

    "title": "Shaping manifolds in equivariant recurrent neural networks",
    "abstract": "Recordings of increasingly large neural populations have revealed that the firing of individual neurons is highly coordinated. When viewed in the space of all possible patterns, the collective activity forms non-linear structures called neural manifolds. Because such structures are observed even at rest or during sleep, an important hypothesis is that activity manifolds may correspond to continuous attractors shaped by recurrent connectivity between neurons. Classical models of recurrent networks have shown that continuous attractors can be generated by specific symmetries in the connectivity. Although a variety of attractor network models have been studied, general principles linking network connectivity and the geometry of attractors remain to be formulated. Here, we address this question by using group representation theory to formalize the relationship between the symmetries in recurrent connectivity and the resulting fixed-point manifolds. We start by revisiting the classical ring model, a continuous attractor network generating a circular manifold. Interpreting its connectivity as a circular convolution, we draw a parallel with feed-forward CNNs. Building on principles of geometric deep learning, we then generalize this architecture to a broad range of symmetries using group representation theory. Specifically, we introduce a new class of equivariant RNNs, where the connectivity is based on group convolution. Using the group Fourier transform, we reduce such networks to low-rank models, giving us a low-dimensional description that can be fully analyzed to determine the symmetry, dimensionality and stability of fixed-point manifolds. Our results underline the importance of stability considerations: for a connectivity with a given symmetry, depending on parameters, several manifolds with different symmetry subgroups can coexist, some stable and others consisting of saddle points.",

    "abstract": "Many models used in artificial intelligence and cognitive science rely on multi-element patterns stored in \"slots\" - dedicated storage locations - in a digital computer. As biological brains likely lack slots, we consider how they might achieve similar functional outcomes without them by building on the neurally-inspired modern Hopfield network (MHN; Krotov & Hopfield, 2021), which stores patterns in the connection weights of an individual neuron. We propose extensions of this approach to increase its biological plausibility as a model of memory and to capture an important advantage of slot-based computation in contemporary language models. For memory, neuroscience research suggests that the weights of overlapping sparse ensembles of neurons, rather than a dedicated individual neuron, are used to store a memory. We introduce the K-winner MHN, extending the approach to ensembles, and find that within a continual learning regime, the ensemble-based MHN exhibits greater retention of older memories, as measured by the graded sensitivity measure d', than a standard (one-neuron) MHN. Next, we consider the powerful use of slot-based memory in contemporary language models. These models use slots to store long sequences of past inputs and their learned encodings, supporting later predictions and allowing error signals to be transported backward in time to adjust weights underlying the learned encodings of these past inputs. Inspired by these models' successes, we show how the MHN can be extended to capture both of these important functional outcomes. Collectively, our modeling approaches constitute steps towards understanding how biologically plausible mechanisms can support computations that have enabled AI systems to capture human-like abilities that no prior models have been able to achieve.",

This geometry-aware latent representation, although unsupervised, meaningfully separated working-memory states and decoded visual stimuli, with performance further enhanced by incorporating neural dynamics.

Based on the theoretical results, we introduce a novel solution method for the fitting problem of RL models based on convex relaxation and optimization. Our method is then evaluated in several simulated bandit environments to compare with some benchmark methods that appear in the literature. Numerical results indicate that our method achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art, while significantly reducing computation time.

    "abstract": "Photon scattering has traditionally limited the ability of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to extract accurate, layer-specific information from the brain. This limitation restricts its clinical utility for precise neurological monitoring. To address this, we introduce an AI-driven, high-density NIRS system optimized to provide real-time, layer-specific oxygenation data from the brain cortex, specifically targeting acute neuro-emergencies. Our system integrates high-density NIRS reflectance data with a neural network trained on MRI-based synthetic datasets. This approach achieves robust cortical oxygenation accuracy across diverse anatomical variations. In simulations, our AI-assisted NIRS demonstrated a strong correlation (R2=0.913) with actual cortical oxygenation, markedly outperforming conventional methods (R2=0.469). Furthermore, biomimetic phantom experiments confirmed its superior anatomical reliability (R2=0.986) compared to standard commercial devices (R2=0.823). In clinical validation with healthy subjects and ischemic stroke patients, the system distinguished between the two groups with an AUC of 0.943. This highlights its potential as an accessible, high-accuracy diagnostic tool for emergency and point-of-care settings. These results underscore the system's capability to advance neuro-monitoring precision through AI, enabling timely, data-driven decisions in critical care environments.",

    "abstract": "Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) allow direct communication between the brain and external devices, frequently using electroencephalography (EEG) to record neural activity. Dimensionality reduction and structured regularization are essential for effectively classifying task-related brain signals, including event-related potentials (ERPs) and motor imagery (MI) rhythms. Current tensor-based approaches, such as Tucker and PARAFAC decompositions, often lack the flexibility needed to fully capture the complexity of EEG data. This study introduces Block-Term Tensor Discriminant Analysis (BTTDA): a novel tensor-based and supervised feature extraction method designed to enhance classification accuracy by providing flexible multilinear dimensionality reduction. Extending Higher Order Discriminant Analysis (HODA), BTTDA uses a novel and interpretable forward model for HODA combined with a deflation scheme to iteratively extract discriminant block terms, improving feature representation for classification. BTTDA and a sum-of-rank-1-terms variant PARAFACDA were evaluated on publicly available ERP (second-order tensors) and MI (third-order tensors) EEG datasets from the MOABB benchmarking framework. Benchmarking revealed that BTTDA and PARAFACDA significantly outperform the traditional HODA method in ERP decoding, resulting in state-of-the art performance (ROC-AUC = 91.25%). For MI, decoding results of HODA, BTTDA and PARAFACDA were subpar, but BTTDA still significantly outperformed HODA (64.52% > 61.00%). The block-term structure of BTTDA enables interpretable and more efficient dimensionality reduction without compromising discriminative power. This offers a promising and adaptable approach for feature extraction in BCI and broader neuroimaging applications.",

This assumption implies intra-level causal closure, rendering all macro phenomena epiphenomenal. However, the integrative nature of consciousness suggests that it is a macro phenomenon. To ensure scientific testability and reject epiphenomenalism, the reductionist assumption of intra-level causal closure must be rejected. This implies that even neural-level behavior cannot be explained by observable neural-level laws alone. Therefore, a new methodology is necessary to acknowledge the causal efficacy of macro-level phenomena. We model the brain as operating under dual laws at different levels. This model includes hypothetical macro-level psychological laws that are not determined solely by micro-level neural laws, as well as the causal effects from macro to micro levels. In this study, we propose a constructive approach that explains both mental and physical phenomena through the interaction between these two sets of laws.",

    "abstract": "Humans can quickly and effortlessly extract a variety of information about others' social interactions from visual input, ranging from visuospatial cues like whether two people are facing each other to higher-level information. Yet, the computations supporting these abilities remain poorly understood, and social interaction recognition continues to challenge even the most advanced AI vision systems. Here, we hypothesized that humans rely on 3D visuospatial pose information to make social interaction judgments, which is absent in most AI vision models. To test this, we combined state-of-the-art pose and depth estimation algorithms to extract 3D joint positions of people in short video clips depicting everyday human actions and compared their ability to predict human social interaction judgments with current AI vision models. Strikingly, 3D joint positions outperformed most current AI vision models, revealing that key social information is available in explicit body position but not in the learned features of most vision models, including even the layer-wise embeddings of the pose models used to extract joint positions. To uncover the critical pose features humans use to make social judgments, we derived a compact set of 3D social pose features describing only the 3D position and direction of faces in the videos. We found that these minimal descriptors matched the predictive strength of the full set of 3D joints and significantly improved the performance of off-the-shelf AI vision models when combined with their embeddings. Moreover, the degree to which 3D social pose features were represented in each off-the-shelf AI vision model predicted the model's ability to match human social judgments. Together, our findings provide strong evidence that human social scene understanding relies on explicit representations of 3D pose and can be supported by simple, structured visuospatial primitives.",

The system is found to be multistable with two qualitatively different attractors. Although each neuron is individually nonchaotic, the chaotic basin takes up the vast majority of the coupled system's state space, but the nonchaotic basin stretches to infinity due to chance synchronization. The boundary between the basins is found to be fractal, leading to extreme final state sensitivity.

    "abstract": "Cellular actin structures are continuously turned over while keeping similar sizes. Since they all compete for a shared pool of actin monomers, the question arises how they can coexist in these dynamic steady states. Recently, the coexistence of branched actin networks with different densities growing in a shared and finite pool of purified proteins has been demonstrated in a biomimetic bead assay. However, theoretical work in the context of organelle size regulation has mainly been focused on linear architectures, such as single filaments and bundles, and thus is not able to explain this observation. Here we show theoretically that the local depletion of actin monomers caused by the growth of a branched network naturally gives rise to a negative feedback loop between network density and growth rate, and that this competition is captured by one central equation. A comprehensive bifurcation analysis shows that the theory leads to well-defined steady states even in the case of multiple networks sharing the same pool of monomers, without any need for specific molecular processes. Under increasing competition strength, coexistence is replaced by selection. We also show that our theory is in excellent agreement with spatiotemporal simulations implemented in a finite element framework. In summary, our work suggests that local monomer depletion is the decisive and universal factor controlling growth of branched actin networks.",

The hydraulic system reproduces the essential structural and functional features of the molecular switch, including the presence of up to three distinct steady state solutions, the characteristic shapes of these solutions, and the physical interpretation of the control parameters governing the behavior of the system. By mapping water flow, energy barrier height, and siphoning dynamics onto biochemical flux, activation energy, and state transitions, the model provides a transparent representation of the mechanisms that regulate GPCR activation. The correspondence between the hydraulic analog and the molecular system suggests several experimentally testable hypotheses about GPCR function. In particular, the model highlights the central role of energy flux, driven by imbalances in ATP/ADP or GTP/GDP concentrations, in activating the molecular switch and maintaining nonequilibrium signaling states. It also identifies two key parameters that primarily determine switch behavior: the energy difference between the active and inactive states and the effective height of the energy barrier that separates them. These results imply that GPCR signaling dynamics may be governed by generalizable physical principles rather than by biochemical details alone. The hydraulic framework thus offers a tractable platform for interpreting complex molecular behavior and may aid in the development of predictive models of GPCR function in diverse physiological contexts.",

    "abstract": "mRNA-protein assemblies play a fundamental role in forming membraneless compartments within cells, whose functions may include activating, inhibiting, and localizing reactions. Recruitment of proteins into droplets can diminish cell to cell variability in protein abundance. However, the extent to which mRNA-protein assemblies may also buffer noise arising from transcription is not understood. Complicating study of this question is that models of kinetics typically treat this as a phase separation process, when mRNA-protein assemblies can contain as few as 2 mRNA transcripts, far below the thermodynamic thresholds for phase separation. Here, through stochastic simulations and asymptotic analysis, we quantify noise suppression by mRNA-protein assemblies as a function of gene expression kinetic parameters, and show that assemblies formed from just a handful of mRNAs effectively regulate transcript abundances and suppress fluctuations. We place particular emphasis on how this mechanism can facilitate regulated transcription by reducing noise even in the context of infrequent bursts of transcription. We investigate two biologically relevant models in which mRNA assembly acts to either \"buffer\" noise by storing mRNA in inert droplets, or \"filter\" assembled mRNAs by accelerating their decay, and quantify expression noise as a function of kinetic parameters. In either case, the most controlled expression occurs when bursts produce mRNAs close to the assembly threshold, which we find to be broadly consistent with observations of an RNP-droplet forming cyclin in multinucleate \\textit{Ashbya gossypii} cells.",

The formation of these nanoclusters is highly dependent on a series of post-translational modifications, such as mono-and multi-phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of residues. We theoretically simulate how a protein can be either mono-or multi-phosphorylated on several residues in functional nanoclusters, depending on effective biophysical parameters (diffusion, dwell time, etc.). Moving beyond a binary view of phosphorylation, this approach highlights the interplay between mono-and multi-phosphorylation, the cooperative effects generally associated with multi-phosphorylation networks, and stresses the role of phosphatases in transforming graded phosphorylation signals into almost switch-like responses. The results are discussed in light of experiments that probe the distribution of phospho-residues.",

Here, we present a model and a Monte Carlo simulation framework to investigate how changes in the domain size that arise from perturbations to membrane criticality can lead to changes in the rate of interactions among components, leading to altered outcomes. For simple PPI networks, we show that the activity can be highly sensitive to thermodynamic parameters near the critical point of the membrane phase transition. When protein-protein interactions change the partitioning of some components, our system sometimes forms out of equilibrium domains we term pockets, driven by a mixture of thermodynamic interactions and kinetic sorting.

This remarkable feat is attributed to the properties of the capsid surface, which confer solubility within the NPC's phase-separated, condensate-like barrier. In this context, we apply the classical framework of wetting and capillarity -- integrating analytical methods with sharp- and diffuse-interface numerical simulations -- to elucidate the physical underpinnings of HIV nuclear entry. Our analysis captures several key phenomena: the reorientation of incoming capsids due to torques arising from asymmetric capillary forces; the role of confinement in limiting capsid penetration depths; the classification of translocation mechanics according to changes in topology and interfacial area; and the influence of (spontaneous) rotational symmetry-breaking on energetics. These effects are all shown to depend critically on capsid geometry, arguing for a physical basis for HIV's characteristic capsid shape.",

    "abstract": "We study the dynamics of molecular motor-driven transport into dendritic spines, which are bulbous intracellular compartments in neurons that play a key role in transmitting signals between neurons. We further develop a stochastic model of vesicle transport in [Park, Singh, and Fai, SIAM J. Appl. Math. 82.3 (2022), pp. 793--820] by showing that second-order moments may be neglected. We exploit this property to significantly simplify the model and confirm through numerical simulations that the simplification retains key behaviors of the original agent-based myosin model of vesicle transport. We use the simplified model to explore the vesicle translocation time and probability through dendritic spines as a function of molecular motor parameters, which was previously not practically possible.   Relevance to Life Sciences: We find that thinner dendritic spine geometry can greatly reduce the probability of vesicle translocation to the post-synaptic density. The cell may alter molecular motor parameters to compensate, but only to a point. These findings are consistent with the biological literature, where brain disorders are often associated with an excess of long, thin dendritic spines.   Mathematical Content: We use a moment-generating function to deduce that second-order moments in motor attachment times may be neglected, and therefore the first-order moment is a sufficient approximation. Using only the mean attachment times and neglecting the variance yields a tractable master equation from which vesicle mean first passage times may be computed directly as a function of geometry and molecular motor parameters.",

This review examines the interactions between these regulatory mechanisms, including DNA methylation and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), that orchestrate gene expression fine-tuning for cellular homeostasis and the pathogenesis of a multitude of diseases. We explore long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) such as telomeric repeat-containing RNA (TERRA) and Fendrr, highlighting their role in protein regulation to ensure proper gene activation or silencing. Additionally, we explain the therapeutic potential of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-related microRNA 132, which has shown promise in treating chronic illnesses by restoring BDNF levels. Finally, this review covers the role of DNA methyltransferases and ncRNAs in cancer, focusing on how lncRNAs contribute to X chromosome inactivation and interact with chromatin-modifying complexes and DNA methyltransferase inhibitors to reduce cancer cell aggressiveness. By amalgamating the wide array of research in this field, we aim to provide glimpses into the complex entangling of genetics and environment as they control gene expressions.",

    "abstract": "In molecular communications (MC), inter-symbol interference (ISI) and noise are key factors that degrade communication reliability. Although time-domain equalization can effectively mitigate these effects, it often entails high computational complexity concerning the channel memory. In contrast, frequency-domain equalization (FDE) offers greater computational efficiency but typically requires prior knowledge of the channel model. To address this limitation, this letter proposes FDE techniques based on long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks, enabling temporal correlation modeling in MC channels to improve ISI and noise suppression. To eliminate the reliance on prior channel information in conventional FDE methods, a supervised training strategy is employed for channel-adaptive equalization. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed LSTM-FDE significantly reduces the bit error rate compared to traditional FDE and feedforward neural network-based equalizers. This performance gain is attributed to the LSTM's temporal modeling capabilities, which enhance noise suppression and accelerate model convergence, while maintaining comparable computational efficiency.",

Experiments have consistently revealed two key observations across species: (i) the number of crossovers per chromosome is typically small, but at least one, and (ii) crossovers on the same chromosome are subject to interference, i.e., they are more separated than expected by chance. These observations can be explained by a recently proposed coarsening model, where the dynamics of droplets associated with chromosomes designate crossovers. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the coarsening model, which we also extend by including material exchanges between droplets, the synaptonemal complex, and the nucleoplasm. We derive scaling laws for the crossover count, which allows us to analyze data across species. Moreover, our model provides a coherent explanation of experimental data across mutants, including the wild-type and zyp1-mutant of A. thaliana.

We analyze a model lipid membrane-electrolyte system where an ion channel-like current flows across the membrane while parallel electrodes simultaneously apply a step voltage, emulating an extrinsic electric field. Matched asymptotic expansions of the Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations show that, under physiological conditions, the diffuse charge layers rapidly reach a quasi-steady state, and the bulk electrolyte remains electroneutral. As a result, all free charge is confined to the nanometer-scale screening layers at the membrane and electrode interfaces. The bulk electric potential satisfies Laplace's equation, and is dynamically coupled to the interfacial layers through time-dependent boundary conditions. This multiscale coupling partitions the space-time response into distinct regimes. At sufficiently long times, we show that the system can be represented by an equivalent circuit analogous to those used in classical cable theory. We derive closed-form expressions of the transmembrane potential within each regime, and verify them against nonlinear numerical simulations. Our results show how electrode-induced screening and confinement effects influence the electrochemical response over multiple length and time scales in biological systems.",

    "abstract": "Ribosome-targeting antibiotics, such as chloramphenicol, stall elongating ribosomes during protein synthesis, disrupting mRNA translation. These antibiotic-induced pauses occur stochastically, alter collective ribosome dynamics and transiently block protein production on the affected transcript. Existing models of ribosome traffic often rely on idealized assumptions, such as infinitely long mRNAs and simplified pausing dynamics, overlooking key biological constraints. Here, we develop a Totally Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process (TASEP) that incorporates stochastic particle pausing, using experimentally determined pausing and unpausing rates to model the effects of ribosome-targeting antibiotics. We introduce a Single-Cluster approximation, which is analytically treatable, tailored to capture the biologically relevant regime of rare and long antibiotic-induced pauses. This biologically constrained model reveals three key insights: (i) the inhibition of antibiotic-induced translation strongly depends on transcript length, with longer transcripts being disproportionately affected; (ii) reducing ribosome initiation rates significantly mitigates antibiotic vulnerability; and (iii) inhibition of translation is governed more by collective ribosome dynamics than by single-ribosome properties. Our analytical predictions match Gillespie simulations, align quantitatively with experimental observations, and yield testable hypotheses for future experiments. These findings may have broader implications for the mechanistic modeling of other biological transport processes (e.g., RNAP dynamics), and more generally for the community studying traffic models.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Primary aldosteronism is the most common form of secondary hypertension. The most frequent genetic cause of aldosterone-producing adenomas is somatic mutations in the potassium channel KCNJ5. They affect the ion selectivity of the channel, with sodium influx leading to cell membrane depolarization and activation of calcium signaling, the major trigger for aldosterone biosynthesis. METHODS: To investigate how KCNJ5 mutations lead to the development of aldosterone-producing adenomas, we established an adrenocortical cell model in which sodium entry into the cells can be modulated on demand using chemogenetic tools [H295R-S2 $α$7-5HT3-R ($α$7-5HT3 receptor) cells]. We investigated their functional and molecular characteristics with regard to aldosterone biosynthesis and cell proliferation. RESULTS: A clonal cell line with stable expression of the chimeric $α$7-5HT3-R in H295R-S2 (human adrenocortical carcinoma cell line, Strain 2) cells was obtained. Increased sodium entry through $α$7-5HT3-R upon stimulation with uPSEM-817 (uPharmacologically Selective Effector Molecule-817) led to cell membrane depolarization, opening of voltage-gated Ca 2+ channels, and increased intracellular Ca 2+ concentrations, resulting in the stimulation of CYP11B2 expression and increased aldosterone biosynthesis. Increased intracellular sodium influx did not increase proliferation but rather induced apoptosis. RNA sequencing and steroidome analyses revealed unique profiles associated with Na + entry, with only partial overlap with Ang II (angiotensin II) or potassium-induced changes. CONCLUSIONS: H295R-S2 $α$7-5HT3-R cells are a new model reproducing the major features of cells harboring KCNJ5 mutations. Increased expression of CYP11B2 and stimulation of the mineralocorticoid biosynthesis pathway are associated with a decrease of cell proliferation and an increase of apoptosis, indicating that additional events may be required for the development of aldosterone-producing adenomas.",

    "title": "Formation and Regulation of Calcium Sparks on a Nonlinear Spatial Network of Ryanodine Receptors",
    "abstract": "Accurate regulation of calcium release is essential for cellular signaling, with the spatial distribution of ryanodine receptors (RyRs) playing a critical role. In this study, we present a nonlinear spatial network model that simulates RyR spatial organization to investigate calcium release dynamics by integrating RyR behavior, calcium buffering, and calsequestrin (CSQ) regulation. The model successfully reproduces calcium sparks, shedding light on their initiation, duration, and termination mechanisms under clamped calcium conditions. Our simulations demonstrate that RyR clusters act as on-off switches for calcium release, producing short-lived calcium quarks and longer-lasting calcium sparks based on distinct activation patterns. Spark termination is governed by calcium gradients and stochastic RyR dynamics, with CSQ facilitating RyR closure and spark termination. We also uncover the dual role of CSQ as both a calcium buffer and a regulator of RyRs. Elevated CSQ levels prolong calcium release due to buffering effects, while CSQ-RyR interactions induce excessive refractoriness, a phenomenon linked to pathological conditions such as ventricular arrhythmias. Dysregulated CSQ function disrupts the on-off switching behavior of RyRs, impairing calcium release dynamics. These findings provide new insights into RyR-mediated calcium signaling, highlighting CSQ's pivotal role in maintaining calcium homeostasis and its implications for pathological conditions. This work advances the understanding of calcium spark regulation and underscores its significance for cardiomyocyte function.",

    "abstract": "The mitotic spindle partitions chromosomes during cell division by connecting the poles to kinetochores through microtubules (MTs). Their plus-ends, facing the chromosomes, exhibit dynamic instability, which is critical for proper attachment. The poleward flux implicates the displacement of Mts towards the spindle poles, while plus-ends polymerise. It may result from minus-end depolymerisation (treadmilling), sliding by kinesins (e.g., Kinesin-5), or pushing by chromokinesins. Intriguingly, such flux had not been reported in the C. elegans zygote, despite homologs of flux-associated proteins being present.   To investigate this, we fluorescently labelled Mts and used photobleaching. We observed no global flux; instead, the bleached zone's edges moved inward. The centrosome-facing front reflected MT dynamic instability, but the chromosome-facing front showed faster recovery, suggesting an additional mechanism. This extra velocity was spatially restricted to the vicinity of chromosomes, suggesting that only the kinetochore Mts may undergo flux. Supporting this, flux required key kinetochore regulators: NDC-80, $\\text{CLS-2}^\\text{CLASP}$, and $\\text{ZYG-9}^\\text{XMAP215}$. Flux declined as metaphase progressed, correlating with the attachment maturation from lateral to end-on, and was suppressed by SKA-1 recruitment. Classic treadmilling was unlikely, as most kinetochore MTs in C. $elegans$ do not reach spindle poles. Instead, depleting $\\text{KLP-18}^\\text{KIF15}$, a kinesin that cross-links and organises Mts during meiosis, reduced front movement. We propose that only kinetochore Mts undergo flux, sliding along the spindle Mts, likely powered by KLP-18. This localised sliding contrasts with global flux seen in other systems, and aligns with observations in human cells showing flux reduction as chromosome-to-pole distance increases.",

    "title": "Decoding the Hot-Mitochondrion Paradox",
    "abstract": "In a 2018 paper and a subsequent article published in 2023, researchers reported that mitochondria maintain temperatures 10-15 degrees higher than the surrounding cytoplasm - a finding that deviates by 5 to 6 orders of magnitude from theoretical predictions based on Fourier s law of heat conduction. In 2022, we proposed a solution to this apparent paradox. In the present perspective, we build upon that framework and introduce new ideas to further unravel how a biological membrane - whether of an organelle or a whole cell - can become significantly warmer than its environment. We propose that proteins embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) can be modeled as ratchet engines, introducing a novel, previously overlooked mode of heat transfer. This mechanism, coupled with localized heat release during the cyclical dehydration-translocation-hydration of ions through membrane proteins, may generate transient but substantial temperature spikes. In the case of protons, the cycle additionally includes deprotonation before translocation and protonation after. The cumulative effect of these microscopic events across the three-dimensional surface of the IMM can account for the elevated temperatures detected by molecular probes. We also offer a hypothesis based on quantum chemical calculations on how such probes might detect these fleeting thermal signatures.",

    "abstract": "Cancer cells are often seen to prefer glycolytic metabolism over oxidative phosphorylation even in the presence of oxygen-a phenomenon termed the Warburg effect. Despite significant strides in the decades since its discovery, a clear basis is yet to be established for the Warburg effect and why cancer cells show such a preference for aerobic glycolysis. In this review, we draw on what is known about similar metabolic shifts both in normal mammalian physiology and overflow metabolism in microbes to shed new light on whether aerobic glycolysis in cancer represents some form of optimisation of cellular metabolism. From microbes to cancer, we find that metabolic shifts favouring glycolysis are sometimes driven by the need for faster growth, but the growth rate is by no means a universal goal of optimal metabolism. Instead, optimisation goals at the cellular level are often multi-faceted and any given metabolic state must be considered in the context of both its energetic costs and benefits over a range of environmental contexts. For this purpose, we identify the conceptual framework of resource allocation as a potential testbed for the investigation of the cost-benefit balance of cellular metabolic strategies. Such a framework is also readily integrated with dynamical systems modelling, making it a promising avenue for new answers to the age-old question of why cells, from cancers to microbes, choose the metabolic strategies they do.",

    "abstract": "Nearly a decade ago it was discovered that the spherical cell body of the alga $Chlamydomonas~reinhardtii$ can act as a lens to concentrate incoming light onto the cell's membrane-bound photoreceptor and thereby affect phototaxis. Since many nearly transparent cells in marine environments have complex, often non-axisymmetric shapes, this observation raises fundamental, yet little-explored questions in biological optics about light refraction by the bodies of microorganisms. There are two distinct contexts for such questions: the $absorption$ problem for $incoming$ light, typified by photosynthetic activity taking place in the chloroplasts of green algae, and the $emission$ problem for $outgoing$ light, where the paradigm is bioluminescence emitted from scintillons within dinoflagellates. Here we examine both of these aspects of ``algal optics\" in the special case where the absorption or emission is localized in structures that are small relative to the overall organism size, taking into account both refraction and reflections at the cell-water boundary. Analytical and numerical results are developed for the distribution of light intensities inside and outside the body, and we establish certain duality relationships that connect the incoming and outgoing problems. For strongly non-spherical shapes we find lensing effects that may have implications for photosynthetic activity and for the angular distribution of light emitted during bioluminescent flashes.",

    "title": "Nucleation feedback can drive establishment and maintenance of biased microtubule polarity in neurites",
    "abstract": "The microtubule cytoskeleton is comprised of dynamic, polarized filaments that facilitate transport within the cell. Polarized microtubule arrays are key to facilitating cargo transport in long cells such as neurons. Microtubules also undergo dynamic instability, where the plus and minus ends of the filaments switch between growth and shrinking phases, leading to frequent microtubule turnover. Although microtubules often completely disassemble and new filaments nucleate, microtubule arrays have been observed to both maintain their biased orientation throughout the cell lifetime and to rearrange their polarity as an adaptive response to injury. Motivated by cytoskeleton organization in neurites, we propose a spatially-explicit stochastic model of microtubule arrays and investigate how nucleation of new filaments could generate biased polarity in a simple linear domain. Using a continuous-time Markov chain model of microtubule growth dynamics, we model and parameterize two experimentally-validated nucleation mechanisms: nucleation feedback, where the direction of filament growth depends on existing microtubule content, and a checkpoint mechanism, where microtubules that nucleate in a direction opposite to the majority experience frequent catastrophe. When incorporating these validated mechanisms into the spatial model, we find that nucleation feedback is sufficient to establish biased polarity in neurites of different lengths, and that the emergence and maintenance of biased polarity is relatively stable in spite of stochastic fluctuations. This work provides a framework to study the relationship between microtubule nucleation and polarity, and could extend to give insights into mechanisms that drive the formation of polarized filament arrays in other biological settings.",

    "abstract": "This article focuses on current and emerging therapeutics for CADASIL (Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy). CADASIL is an inherited vascular disease that impairs blood flow in the small cerebral vessels of the brain, leading to strokes and other neurological deficits. The disease is caused by a mutation in the NOTCH3 gene located on chromosome 19. NOTCH3 encodes a transmembrane receptor expressed on vascular smooth muscle cells. In CADASIL, mutations in the NOTCH3 gene lead to the accumulation and deposition of the receptor, affecting the number of cysteine residues in its extracellular domain. These mutations result in the loss or gain of a cysteine residue within the epidermal growth factor-like repeat (EGFr) domains of the NOTCH protein. Beyond traditional symptomatic treatments for stroke, this work highlights advances in disease modifying approaches including gene editing, cell therapies, and immune-based interventions aimed at altering the course of CADASIL. It also examines ongoing clinical trials and recent patents related to these novel strategies. In addition to summarizing diagnostic methods and molecular mechanisms, the article emphasizes the translational potential of current research and the experimental models driving therapeutic development. The goal is to offer a comprehensive overview of CADASIL and emerging interventions that hold promise for improving long-term outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Networks of physical units can vary from a stationary set of spatially-embedded links to a collection of mobile agents that undergo transient social interactions. In living cells, mitochondria form architectures that span across these regimes, transitioning between fragmented, partly connected, and highly fused structures depending on cell type and state. Diffusive transport of biomolecular components through these networks limits the heterogeneity of the mitochondrial population. Here we address the connection between dynamic network architecture and the rate of diffusive mixing through simulations and analytic models that incorporate fusion, fission, and rearrangement. We find that the material delivered from a source to the rest of the network depends on the network dimensionality and a balance of competing timescales for encounter, fusion, and diffusive dispersion. We extract morphological and dynamic parameters for mitochondrial networks in three human cell lines, demonstrating that different cells span across both the physical and social network regimes. Mixing in mitochondrial networks is shown to be limited by material transport through connected tubules for slowly-diffusing particles and by inter-mitochondrial encounter rates for rapidly diffusing ones. These results provide a quantitative basis for predicting the homogenization of proteins, lipids, ions, or genetic material through the mitochondrial population. The general principles identified in this work capture diffusive spreading through both social and physical networks, unifying a continuum of spatial network architectures.",

    "abstract": "Transcription factor concentrations provide signals to cells that allow them to regulate gene expression to make correct cell fate decisions. Calculations for noise bounds in gene regulation suggest that clustering or cooperative binding of transcription factors decreases signal-to-noise ratios at binding sites. However, clustering of transcription factor molecules around binding sites is frequently observed. We develop two complementary models for clustering transcription factors at binding site sensors that allow us to study information transfer from a signal, the morphogen Bicoid, to a variable relevant to development, namely future cell fates. We find that weak cooperativity or clustering can allow for maximal information transfer, especially about the relevant variable. The timescale of measurement is crucial for predicting the optimal clustering strength: for short measurements, clustering allows for the implementation of a switch, while for long measurements, weak clustering allows the sensor to access maximal developmental information provided in a nonlinear signal. Finally, we find that clustering not only facilitates information maximization about the relevant variable, but also can allow the binding site sensors to achieve optimality in a related optimization goal, the information bottleneck (IB) bound. While the measurement time restricts the region on the information plane that is accessible, changes in clustering in conjunction with changes in the binding energy can shift the binding site along the optimal bound, and towards an optimal trade-off between obtaining information about the signal and obtaining relevant information.",

In other words, if a target state can be maintained against small perturbations, the system can be controlled from any initial condition to that state. This result highlights a tight link between the local and global dynamics of nonlinear chemical reaction systems, providing a mathematical criterion for global reachability that is often elusive in high-dimensional systems.

    "title": "Emergent microtubule properties in a model of filament turnover and nucleation",
    "abstract": "Microtubules (MTs) are dynamic protein filaments essential for intracellular organization and transport, particularly in long-lived cells such as neurons. The plus and minus ends of neuronal MTs switch between growth and shrinking phases, and the nucleation of new filaments is believed to be regulated in both healthy and injury conditions. We propose stochastic and deterministic mathematical models to investigate the impact of filament nucleation and length-regulation mechanisms on emergent properties such as MT lengths and numbers in living cells. We expand our stochastic continuous-time Markov chain model of filament dynamics to incorporate MT nucleation and capture realistic stochastic fluctuations in MT numbers and tubulin availability. We also propose a simplified partial differential equation (PDE) model, which allows for tractable analytical investigation into steady-state MT distributions under different nucleation and length-regulating mechanisms. We find that the stochastic and PDE modeling approaches show good agreement in predicted MT length distributions, and that both MT nucleation and the catastrophe rate of large-length MTs regulate MT length distributions. In both frameworks, multiple mechanistic combinations achieve the same average MT length. The models proposed can predict parameter regimes where the system is scarce in tubulin, the building block of MTs, and suggest that low filament nucleation regimes are characterized by high variation in MT lengths, while high nucleation regimes drive high variation in MT numbers. These mathematical frameworks have the potential to improve our understanding of MT regulation in both healthy and injured neurons.",

    "abstract": "The genome contains genetic information essential for cell's life. The genome's spatial organization inside the cell nucleus is critical for its proper function including gene regulation. The two major genomic compartments -- euchromatin and heterochromatin -- contain largely transcriptionally active and silenced genes, respectively, and exhibit distinct dynamics. In this work, we present a hydrodynamic framework that describes the large-scale behavior of euchromatin and heterochromatin, and accounts for the interplay of mechanical forces, active processes, and nuclear confinement. Our model shows contractile stresses from cross-linking proteins lead to the formation of heterochromatin droplets via mechanically driven phase separation. These droplets grow, coalesce, and in nuclear confinement, wet the boundary. Active processes, such as gene transcription in euchromatin, introduce non-equilibrium fluctuations that drive long-range, coherent motions of chromatin as well as the nucleoplasm, and thus alter the genome's spatial organization. These fluctuations also indirectly deform heterochromatin droplets, by continuously changing their shape. Taken together, our findings reveal how active forces, mechanical stresses and hydrodynamic flows contribute to the genome's organization at large scales and provide a physical framework for understanding chromatin organization and dynamics in live cells.",

The diffusive dynamics and chemical kinetics inside phase-separated condensates can be studied experimentally by fluorescently labeling molecules, providing key insights into cell biology. We discuss how condensates govern the kinetics of chemical reactions and how this is reflected in the stochastic dynamics of labeled molecules. This allows us to reveal how the physics of phase separation influences the evolution of single-molecule trajectories and governs their statistics. We find that, out of equilibrium, the interactions that enable phase separation can induce directed motion and transport at the level of single molecules.

    "abstract": "We present a minimal model to analyze the capacitive response of a biological membrane subjected to a step voltage via blocking electrodes. Through a perturbative analysis of the underlying electrolyte transport equations, we show that the leading-order relaxation of the transmembrane potential is governed by a capacitive timescale, ${τ_{\\rm C} =\\dfrac{λ_{\\rm D}L}{D}\\left(\\dfrac{2+Γδ^{\\rm M}/L}{4+Γδ^{\\rm M}/λ_{\\rm D}}\\right)}$, where $λ_{\\rm D}$ is the Debye screening length, $L$ is the electrolyte width, $Γ$ is the ratio of the dielectric permittivity of the electrolyte to the membrane, $δ^{\\rm M}$ is the membrane thickness, and $D$ is the ionic diffusivity. This timescale is considerably shorter than the traditional RC timescale ${λ_{\\rm D} L / D}$ for a bare electrolyte due to the membrane's low dielectric permittivity and finite thickness. Beyond the linear regime, however, salt diffusion in the bulk electrolyte drives a secondary, nonlinear relaxation process of the transmembrane potential over a longer timescale ${τ_{\\rm L} =L^2/4π^2 D}$. A simple equivalent-circuit model accurately captures the linear behavior, and the perturbation expansion remains applicable across the entire range of observed physiological transmembrane potentials. Together, these findings underscore the importance of the faster capacitive timescale and nonlinear effects on the bulk diffusion timescale in determining transmembrane potential dynamics for a range of biological systems.",

The present work provides an introduction to the fundamental aspects of biological energy management by focusing on the relationship between vectorial proton flows and the geometry of energy producing organelles in eukaryotes. The leading models of proton-mediated energy conversion, the delocalised proton (or chemiosmotic) model and the localised proton model, are presented in a complementary perspective. While the delocalised model provides a description that relies on equilibrium thermodynamics, the localised model addresses dynamic processes that are better described using out-of-equilibrium thermodynamics. The work reviews the salient aspects of such mechanisms, traces the development of our present understanding, and highlights areas that are open to future developments.",

    "abstract": "Flagellar motors enable bacteria to navigate their environments by switching rotation direction in response to external cues with high sensitivity. Previous work suggested that ultrasensitivity of the flagellar motor originates from conformational spread, in which subunits of the switching complex are strongly coupled to their neighbors as in an equilibrium Ising model. However, dynamic single-motor measurements indicated that rotation switching is driven out of equilibrium, and the mechanism for this dissipative driving remains unknown. Here, based on recent cryo-EM structures, we propose that local mechanical torques on motor subunits can affect their conformation dynamics. This gives rise to a tug of war between stator-associated subunits, which produces cooperative, non-equilibrium switching responses without requiring nearest-neighbor interactions. Since subunits are effectively coupled at a distance, we call this mechanism ``Global Mechanical Coupling.\" Our model makes a qualitatively new prediction that the motor response cooperativity grows with the number of stators driving rotation. Re-analyzing published motor dose-response curves in varying load conditions, we find tentative experimental evidence for this prediction. Finally, we show that operating out of equilibrium enables motors to achieve high cooperativity with faster responses compared to equilibrium motors. Our results suggest a general role for mechanics in sensitive chemical regulation.",

    "abstract": "Piezo1 ion channels are voltage-modulated, stretch-activated ion channels involved in a variety of important physiological and pathophysiological processes, as for example cardiovascular development and homeostasis. Since its discovery, it has been known that this type of ion channel desensitizes when exposed to stretch. However, recent experiments on Piezo1 ion channels have uncovered that their stretch response is qualitatively different when exposed to positive electrochemical driving forces, where the desensitization is reset. In this work, we propose a novel voltage-modulated mathematical model of Piezo1 based on a continuous-time Markov chain. We show that our Piezo1 model is able to quantitatively reproduce a wide range of experimental observations. Furthermore, we integrate our new ion channel model into the Mahajan-Shiferaw ventricular cardiomyocyte model to study the effect of electromechanical pacing at the cellular scale. This integrated cell model is able to qualitatively reproduce some aspects of the experimental observations regarding the rate-dependence of electromechanical pacing protocols. Our studies suggest that the Piezo1 ion channel is an important component that significantly contributes to the electromechanical coupled response of cardiomyocytes.",

To explore the interplay between active forces and viscoelastic properties, it is helpful to consider our current understanding of intracellular active mechanics.

The model normalizes staining intensity and prioritizes critical image features by integrating attention mechanisms and brightness adaptation layers. Leveraging the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, our model decomposes learned features into interpretable univariate functions, enhancing the explainability of complex subcellular morphologies. We demonstrate that AEMS-Net allows real-time recording of interactions between mitochondria and microtubules, requiring only half the conventional sequential-channel imaging procedures.

    "abstract": "Characterizing the local voltage distribution within nanophysiological domains, driven by ionic currents through membrane channels, is crucial for studying cellular activity in modern biophysics, yet it presents significant experimental and theoretical challenges. Theoretically, the complexity arises from the difficulty of solving electro-diffusion equations in three-dimensional domains. Currently, there are no methods available for obtaining asymptotic computations or approximated solutions of nonlinear equations, and numerically, it is challenging to explore solutions across both small and large spatial scales. In this work, we develop a method to solve the Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations with ionic currents entering and exiting through two narrow, circular window channels located on the boundary. The inflow through the first window is composed of a single cation, while the outflow maintains a constant ionic density satisfying local electro-neutrality conditions. Employing regular expansions and Green's function representations, we derive the ionic profiles and voltage drops in both small and large charge regimes. We explore how local surface curvature and window channels size influence voltage dynamics and validate our theoretical predictions through numerical simulations, assessing the accuracy of our asymptotic computations. These novel relationships between current, voltage, concentrations and geometry can enhance the characterization of physiological behaviors of nanodomains.",

    "abstract": "An adult human body is made up of some 30 to 40 trillion cells, all of which stem from a single fertilized egg cell. The process by which the right cells appear to arrive in their right numbers at the right time at the right place -- development -- is only understood in the roughest of outlines. This process does not happen in isolation: the egg, the embryo, the developing foetus, and the adult organism all interact intricately with their changing environments. Conceptual and, increasingly, mathematical approaches to modelling development have centred around Waddington's concept of an epigenetic landscape. This perspective enables us to talk about the molecular and cellular factors that contribute to cells reaching their terminally differentiated state: their fate. The landscape metaphor is however only a simplification of the complex process of development; it for instance does not consider environmental influences, a context which we argue needs to be explicitly taken into account and from the outset. When delving into the literature, it also quickly becomes clear that there is a lack of consistency and agreement on even fundamental concepts; for example, the precise meaning of what we refer to when talking about a `cell type' or `cell state.' Here we engage with previous theoretical and mathematical approaches to modelling cell fate -- focused on trees, networks, and landscape descriptions -- and argue that they require a level of simplification that can be problematic. We introduce random dynamical systems as one natural alternative. These provide a flexible conceptual and mathematical framework that is free of extraneous assumptions. We develop some of the basic concepts and discuss them in relation to now `classical' depictions of cell fate dynamics, in particular Waddington's landscape.",

    "abstract": "Modeling and simulation are transforming all fields of biology. Tools like AlphaFold have revolutionized structural biology, while molecular dynamics simulations provide invaluable insights into the behavior of macromolecules in solution or on membranes. In contrast, we lack effective tools to represent the dynamic behavior of the endomembrane system. Static diagrams that connect organelles with arrows are used to depict transport across space and time but fail to specify the underlying mechanisms. This static representation obscures the dynamism of intracellular traffic, freezing it in an immobilized framework. The intracellular transport of transferrin, a key process for cellular iron delivery, is among the best-characterized trafficking pathways. In this commentary, we revisit this process using a mathematical simulation of the endomembrane system. Our model reproduces many experimental observations and highlights the strong contrast between dynamic simulations and static illustrations. This work underscores the urgent need for a consensus-based minimal functional working model for the endomembrane system and emphasizes the importance of generating more quantitative experimental data -- including precise measurements of organelle size, volume, and transport kinetics -- practices that were more common among cell biologists in past decades.",

By examining cyclic entropy flows between water topology (Shannon space) and molecular systems (Boltzmann space), the work emphasizes the pivotal role of disquisotropic entropy, an informational entropy reservoir arising from imperfections in molecular structures. The analysis demonstrates that chaos functions as a stabilizing force, enhancing resilience, adaptability, and longevity by delaying thermodynamic equilibrium. This research connects foundational thermodynamic principles with the emergent behavior of chaotic systems, paving the way for a deeper understanding of complexity in natural and technological contexts. By exploring the relationship between chaos, entropy, and dissipative dynamics, the study advances a paradigm where disorder becomes a mechanism to sustain order, a hallmark of life and complex systems.",

    "abstract": "Collective cell flows are a hallmark of tissue dynamics in development, wound healing, and various diseases. Here, we perform experiments on epithelial MDCK cell monolayers, over tens of hours without jamming, on millimeter-scale micropatterned substrates with or without free front (a strip or a closed racetrack). During maturation in time, domains and long-range correlations of the velocity field appear. Enstrophy increases (along with kinetic energy) during 5 hours, then passes through a maximum and decreases. Spatial velocity correlations are scale-free, following a power law, which challenges the notion of a single intrinsic correlation length. It suggests that the monolayer behaves as a critical-like system where information is transmitted across its entire size, a feature consistent with models of active solids capable of long-range stress propagation. The spatial correlation exponent significantly evolves with time, probably reflecting the monolayer maturation. The size, shape, topology and rigidity of patterned substrate influence the organization of flows and mechanical fields. Spontaneous collective motions are stronger on soft than on hard substrate. The presence of a free front accumulates vimentin on a much larger length scale than a fixed boundary ($65\\pm 4$~$μ$m vs $3.2 \\pm 0.7$~$μ$m), possibly revealing an underlying polarizing cue on the cell velocity field.",

    "abstract": "Classical models of cancer focus on tumour-intrinsic genetic aberrations and immune dynamics and often overlook how the metabolic environment of healthy tissues shapes tumour development and immune efficacy. Here, we propose that tissue-intrinsic metabolic intensity and waste-handling capacity act as an upstream gatekeeper of anti-tumour immunity, determining whether immune infiltration translates into effective immune function and safeguards the tissue from tumourigenesis. Across human cancers, tumours arising in high-metabolism tissues - like kidney, brain, and eye - tend to show high T cell infiltration but poor prognosis, suggesting pre-existing metabolic environments prior to malignant transformation may undermine immune function. This pattern is mirrored across species: large mammals with lower mass-specific metabolic rates (e.g., elephants, whales) accumulate fewer metabolic byproducts and show lower cancer incidence (Peto's paradox), while long-lived small mammals like bats and naked mole-rats resist tumourigenesis via suppressed glycolysis or altered hypoxia responses leading to lower metabolic rates and/or byproduct accumulation. Through integrative synthesis spanning human single-cell expression data and cross-species comparisons, we outline a framework of 'immunometabolic gatekeeping', where tissues with high metabolic rate and poor waste clearance foster immune-exhausting niches even before transformation. This unifying framework reconciles multiple paradoxes in cancer biology: Peto's paradox, T cell infiltration non-prognosticity, tissue tropisms, and sex-based inequalities, and suggests new principles for identifying high-risk patients and metabolic-immune combination strategies for prevention and treatment. By shifting focus from tumour-intrinsic mutations to host-tissue metabolism, this work offers a novel, integrative lens on cancer vulnerability and immune failure.",

    "abstract": "Myofascial pain (MP) is a leading cause of chronic low back pain, yet its tissue-level drivers remain poorly defined and lack reliable image biomarkers. Existing studies focus predominantly on muscle while neglecting fascia, fat, and other soft tissues that play integral biomechanical roles. We developed an anatomically grounded explainable artificial intelligence (AI) framework, LAYER (Layer-wise Analysis for Yielding Explainable Relevance Tissue), that analyses six tissue layers in three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound and quantifies their contribution to MP prediction. By utilizing the largest multi-model 3D ultrasound cohort consisting of over 4,000 scans, LAYER reveals that non-muscle tissues contribute substantially to pain prediction. In B-mode imaging, the deep fascial membrane (DFM) showed the highest saliency (0.420), while in combined B-mode and shear-wave images, the collective saliency of non-muscle layers (0.316) nearly matches that of muscle (0.317), challenging the conventional muscle-centric paradigm in MP research and potentially affecting the therapy methods. LAYER establishes a quantitative, interpretable framework for linking layer-specific anatomy to pain physiology, uncovering new tissue targets and providing a generalizable approach for explainable analysis of soft-tissue imaging.",

    "abstract": "Quantifying the in-plane rheology of epithelial monolayers remains challenging due to the difficulty of imposing controlled shear. We introduce a self-driven, rheometer-like assay in which collective migration generates stationary shear flows, allowing rheological parameters to be inferred directly from image sequences. The assay relies on two sets of ring-shaped fibronectin patches, micropatterned in arrays for high-throughput imaging. Within isolated rings, the epithelial tissue exhibits persistent rotation, from which we infer active migration stresses and substrate friction. Within partially overlapping rings, the tissue exhibits sustained shear, from which we infer the elastic and viscous responses of the cells. The emergence of a Maxwell-like viscoelastic relation -- characterized by a linear relationship between mean cell deformation and neighbor-exchange rate -- is specifically recapitulated within a wet vertex-model framework, which reproduces experimental measurements only when intercellular viscous dissipation is included alongside substrate friction. We apply our method to discriminate the respective roles of two myosin~II isoforms in tissue mechanics. Overall, by harnessing self-generated stresses instead of externally imposed ones, we propose a noninvasive route to rheological inference in migrating epithelial tissues and, more generally, in actively flowing granular materials.",

In this study, we developed a deep learning-based virtual pathology assistant capable of distinguishing AIS from normal cervical gland histology using the CAISHI dataset, which contains 2240 expert-labeled H&E images (1010 normal and 1230 AIS). All images underwent Macenko stain normalization and patch-based preprocessing to enhance morphological feature representation. An EfficientNet-B3 convolutional neural network was trained using class-balanced sampling and focal loss to address dataset imbalance and emphasize difficult examples. The final model achieved an overall accuracy of 0.7323, with an F1-score of 0.75 for the Abnormal class and 0.71 for the Normal class. Grad-CAM heatmaps demonstrated biologically interpretable activation patterns, highlighting nuclear atypia and glandular crowding consistent with AIS morphology. The trained model was deployed in a Gradio-based virtual diagnostic assistant.

    "abstract": "Current acoustic radiation force (ARF) based methods for quantifying tissue elasticity primarily rely on shear wave propagation. However, their spatial resolution is limited by the need for spatial averaging, and their accuracy is affected by shear wave guidance, out of plane reflections, and geometric dispersion, which reduce their applicability in mechanically complex tissues. This study introduces a novel technique called Double Profile Intersection (DoPIo) ultrasound, which enables pointwise estimation of shear elastic modulus within the region of ARF excitation by leveraging the scatterer shearing rate. This rate is inferred by tracking ARF induced displacement using two tracking beams with different lateral widths. The wider beam captures scatterers located outside the ARF excitation region that begin to displace as shearing propagates. The time at which the two resulting displacement profiles intersect is mapped to shear elastic modulus using an empirically derived model based on finite element simulations. In silico, DoPIo estimated shear elastic modulus with a median error of -0.02 kPa and a median absolute deviation of 1.98 kPa in elastic materials up to 35 kPa. Experimental validation in vitro and ex vivo demonstrated that DoPIo reliably distinguished softer regions from stiffer ones, and its modulus estimates remained consistent across varying ARF push amplitudes, provided sufficient displacement estimation signal to noise ratio. DoPIo offers a feasible approach for high resolution, on axis shear elasticity estimation and holds promise as a quantitative biomarker that is independent of ARF amplitude.",

Interactive Video Object Segmentation (iVOS) models such as Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) provide prompt-based flexibility beyond methods with predefined categories, but face challenges in surgical scenarios due to the domain gap and limited long-term tracking. To address these limitations, we construct SA-SV, the largest surgical iVOS benchmark with instance-level spatio-temporal annotations (masklets) spanning eight procedure types (61k frames, 1.6k masklets), enabling comprehensive development and evaluation for long-term tracking and zero-shot generalization. Building on SA-SV, we propose SAM2S, a foundation model enhancing \\textbf{SAM2} for \\textbf{S}urgical iVOS through: (1) DiveMem, a trainable diverse memory mechanism for robust long-term tracking; (2) temporal semantic learning for instrument understanding; and (3) ambiguity-resilient learning to mitigate annotation inconsistencies across multi-source datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning on SA-SV enables substantial performance gains, with SAM2 improving by 12.99 average $\\mathcal{J}$\\&$\\mathcal{F}$ over vanilla SAM2. SAM2S further advances performance to 80.42 average $\\mathcal{J}$\\&$\\mathcal{F}$, surpassing vanilla and fine-tuned SAM2 by 17.10 and 4.11 points respectively, while maintaining 68 FPS real-time inference and strong zero-shot generalization.

An important example is aortic dissections, which can be imaged using high-resolution CT scans and for which the shape of the true and false lumens of the aorta has long been used to predict disease state and the potential for positive surgical outcomes (namely thoracic endovascular repair or TEVAR). Here we present a method for calculating the topographical pair correlation function (TPCF), a descriptor of the spatial correlation of point estimates for Gaussian curvature, mean curvature, shape index, and bending ratio constrained to the surface of a meshed image. We used the TPCF as a metric to describe aortic shape and extracted quantitative features from the resulting curves. When the TPCF was parameterized by shape index, the area under the curve of the correlation function contributed to a classification accuracy of 0.95 for disease presence and/or impending TEVAR success. Comparison with single-point statistics suggests that the TPCF provides powerful features for classifying the disease state of aortas and more broadly in capturing structural correlations in anatomical data.",

While recent efforts have prioritized training on an ever-larger amount of patches, we take an alternative approach focused on data diversity. Our foundation model, Athena, was initialized from a pretrained model and trained on just 115 million tissue patches, several times fewer than recent histopathology foundation models. Rather than relying on patch volume or complex sampling heuristics, we maximize data diversity by randomly selecting only a moderate number of patches per whole-slide image from our diverse internal repository, which spans multiple countries, institutions, and scanner types. Evaluated on a single patch-level benchmark and four slide-level downstream tasks (two molecular and two morphological), Athena approaches the state-of-the-art and even surpasses several models trained on substantially larger datasets. This indicates that diversity across whole-slide images, rather than patch quantity alone, drives learning in histopathology foundation models.",

    "abstract": "Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is a cardiac electrophysiology (EP) disorder caused by the presence of an accessory pathway (AP) that bypasses the atrioventricular node, faster ventricular activation rate, and provides a substrate for atrio-ventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT). Accurate localization of the AP is critical for planning and guiding catheter ablation procedures. While traditional diagnostic tree (DT) methods and more recent machine learning (ML) approaches have been proposed to predict AP location from surface electrocardiogram (ECG), they are often constrained by limited anatomical localization resolution, poor interpretability, and the use of small clinical datasets. In this study, we present a Deep Learning (DL) model for the localization of single manifest APs across 24 cardiac regions, trained on a large, physiologically realistic database of synthetic ECGs generated using a personalized virtual heart model. We also integrate eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods, Guided Backpropagation, Grad-CAM, and Guided Grad-CAM, into the pipeline. This enables interpretation of DL decision-making and addresses one of the main barriers to clinical adoption: lack of transparency in ML predictions. Our model achieves localization accuracy above 95%, with a sensitivity of 94.32% and specificity of 99.78%. XAI outputs are physiologically validated against known depolarization patterns, and a novel index is introduced to identify the most informative ECG leads for AP localization. Results highlight lead V2 as the most critical, followed by aVF, V1, and aVL. This work demonstrates the potential of combining cardiac digital twins with explainable DL to enable accurate, transparent, and non-invasive AP localization.",

    "abstract": "To explore the possible mechanical correlations between intraocular pressure (IOP) variations and glaucoma, this study presents a transversely isotropic poroelastic model of the Lamina Cribrosa (LC) based on Reissner Mindlin plate theory, ultimately highlighting the interplay between solid matrix deformation and blood flow behavior under pathological conditions. Starting from poroelasticity theory, the equilibrium equations governing the LC were formulated and analytically solved by applying appropriate mechanical and hydraulic boundary conditions. The results indicate that both strain and stress measures (in the form of shear strain and von Mises stress) peak in the peripheral region of the LC, which is currently suspected to be the initial site of glaucomatous damage. These quantities increase with IOP, suggesting a pressure-dependent mechanical insult to the retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons. In parallel, the model predicts a monotonic reduction in fluid content as IOP rises, which may contribute to ischemic phenomena and disc haemorrhages. The influence of material anisotropy was also examined, revealing that isotropic assumptions tend to underestimate the fluid content while overestimating shear strain.

    "abstract": "This study uses in silico trials (ISTs) to quantify the potential for benefit due to improved recanalisation outcomes and shorter time to treatment for acute ischaemic stroke (AIS) patients. We use an IST framework to run trials on cohorts of virtual patients with early and late treatment after stroke onset, and with successful (full) and unsuccessful (no) recanalisation outcomes. Using a virtual population of AIS patients, and in silico models of blood flow, perfusion, and tissue death, we predict the functional independence of each patient at 90 days using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS).   Results predict 57% of the virtual population achieve functional independence with full recanalisation and a treatment time of 4 hours or less, compared to 29% with no recanalisation and more than 4 hours to treatment. Successful recanalisation was more beneficial than faster treatment: the best-case common odds ratio (improved mRS) due to recanalisation was 2.7 compared to 1.6 for early treatment.   This study provides a proof-of-concept for a novel use-case of ISTs: quantifying the maximum potential for improvement to patient outcomes. This would be useful during early stages of therapy development, to determine the target populations and therapy goal with the greatest potential for population improvements.",

    "title": "Evolutionary Dynamics of Acid Resistance in Tumors: A Mathematical Model",
    "abstract": "Acidosis in tumors arises from reprogrammed metabolism and compromised vasculature, creating a harsh, acidic microenvironment that drives the evolutionary selection of acid-resistant cell phenotypes. A mathematical model is proposed to integrate phenotypic evolution, microenvironmental acidification, and tumor density dynamics. Three key mechanisms are incorporated in it: frequency-dependent selection favoring acid-resistant cells below a critical pH, stress-induced phenotypic switching, and a positive feedback loop where resistant cells produce excess acid that intensifies selection pressure. The well-posedness of the model is established. Through numerical simulations across biologically relevant parameter regimes, we identify two therapeutically targetable parameters: baseline acid clearance rate (a proxy for vascular perfusion) and a protection factor (representing acid-resistance \"machinery\" effectiveness) as critical bifurcation parameters for resistance evolution. The model exhibits qualitatively distinct dynamics depending on phenotypic plasticity levels. In low-plasticity tumors, both parameters exhibit sharp bifurcations with strong parameter interactions: clearance and protection effects are context-dependent, with therapeutic interventions effective only within specific parameter ranges. In high-plasticity tumors, both parameters produce continuous, monotonic responses with independent, additive effects. These regime-dependent dynamics suggest that treatment strategies should adapt to tumor plasticity: in the formar, targeting perfusion alone is typically sufficient, though sequential therapy may be required if the perfusion rate approaches or exceeds the bifurcation threshold, whereas in the latter treatment might benefit from combination therapies addressing both parameters simultaneously.",

To address the demand for quantitative models that can guide clinical decision-making, a novel mathematical framework was developed. Combination therapies involving immunotherapy, such as Interleukin-2 (IL-2), and chemotherapy, exemplified by Cyclophosphamide, have shown significant clinical potential by enhancing anti-tumor immune responses. In this study, a nonlinear system of coupled ordinary differential equations was formulated to mechanistically describe the interactions among tumor cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). The pharmacodynamic effects of both IL-2 and Cyclophosphamide on these key immune populations were explicitly incorporated, allowing for the simulation of tumor dynamics across distinct patient risk profiles.

    "title": "The Geometry of Contraction-Induced Flows",
    "abstract": "Peristalsis is the driving mechanism behind a broad array of biological and engineered flows. In peristaltic pumping, a wave-like contraction of the tube wall produces local changes in volume which induce flow. Net flow arises due to geometric nonlinearities in the momentum equation, which must be properly captured to compute the flow accurately. While most previous models focus on radius-imposed peristalsis, they often neglect longitudinal length changes - a natural consequence of radial contraction in elastic materials. In this paper, to capture a more accurate picture of peristaltic pumping, we calculate the flow in an elastic vessel undergoing contractions in the transverse and longitudinal directions simultaneously, keeping the geometric nonlinearities arising in the strain. A careful analysis requires us to study our fluid using the Lagrangian coordinates of the elastic tube. We perform analytic calculations of the flow characteristics by studying the fluid inside a fixed boundary with time-dependent metric. This mathematical manipulation works even for large-amplitude contractions, as we confirm by comparing our analytical results to COMSOL simulations. We demonstrate that transverse and longitudinal contractions induce instantaneous flows at the same order in wall strain, but in opposite directions. We investigate the influence of the wall's Poisson ratio on the flow profile. Incompressible walls suppress flow by minimizing local volume changes, whereas auxetic walls enhance flow. For radius-imposed peristaltic waves, wall incompressibility reduces both reflux and particle trapping. In contrast, length-imposed waves typically generate backflow, although trapping can still occur at large amplitudes for some Poisson ratios. These results yield a more complete description of peristalsis in elastic media and offer a framework for studying contraction-induced flows more broadly.",

We show that while at long wavelength the profile of the epithelium follows that of the substrate, at short wavelengths cells are thicker in valleys than on ridges. This is reminiscent of the so-called « healing length » in the case of a thin liquid film wetting a rough solid substrate. We explore the ability of continuum mechanics models to account for these observations. Modeling the epithelium as a thin liquid film, with surface tension, does not fully account for the measurements. Neither does modeling the epithelium as a thin incompressible elastic film. On the contrary, the addition of an apical active stress gives satisfactory agreement with measurements, with one fitting parameter, the ratio between the active stress and the elastic modulus.",

    "abstract": "Background. Knee Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common chronic joint condition, and its prevalence increases with age. This study aims to examine whether flattened vertical ground reaction force (vGRF) waveforms and reduced knee range of motion (RoM) occur together during gait as compensatory strategies to maintain gait speed. Methods. Twelve women with knee OA and twelve healthy women of the same age completed the Western Ontario and McMaster University Index (WOMAC) to assess self-reported pain, stiffness, and function. The groups were divided into two groups: OA vs. control 2 limbs or left and right in the Control group. A mixed-design ANOVA was used to examine differences in vertical ground response forces (VGRFs) peaks, minimum VGRF, anterior-posterior weight acceptance (ADWA) and propulsive force (ADPO), knee RoM, and gait speeds. Results. In the OA group, the mean Peak 1 vGFR was 1.109 (SD = 0.05) for the right leg (p 0.05), while the mean min vGFFR was 0.87 (SD=0.04) for the left leg. The OA leg exhibited a mean ADWA of 0.23 0.04 kg/BW, which was significantly lower than the control group's right leg (0.28 0.09 kg/bw, p0.05). No group differences in gait velocity were detected. Conclusions. We interpret the flattening of the vFGFR waveform and the reduction in knee RoM as components of an adaptive, yet potentially maladaptive, motor strategy",

    "abstract": "In early years of life, the cranium rapidly changes in size and shape to accommodate brain growth, primarily driven by mechanical stress from brain expansion. Developmental disorders such as premature fusion of sutures in craniosynostosis, disrupts normal growth process, leading to abnormal skull shapes. Thus, understanding the interplay between biomechanical forces, soft tissues, and individual bone plates is crucial for understanding their role in shaping infant skulls. This study develops a mechanically-driven growth model to simulate healthy cranial growth in the first year. The algorithm considers simultaneous and coupled growth of brain, cranial bones, sutures, with volumetric brain expansion as the primary driver, with strain-based feedback governing growth in bone and suture tissues. A bulk bone formation approach accounts for evolving mechanical properties, with elastic moduli of bone and sutures increasing monthly. The model was applied on individual fused sutures and skull dysmorphologies due to craniosynostosis were predicted, and results showed good agreement with clinically observations. Stress at bone-suture interfaces and elevated intracranial pressure under fused sutures highlighted biomechanical impacts due to the disorders. Sensitivity analysis explored how material properties and growth rates affect skull shape. This framework enhances understanding of cranial growth and supports treatment planning for craniosynostosis.",

    "abstract": "Hearts subjected to volume overload (VO) are prone to detrimental anatomical and functional changes in response to elevated mechanical stretches, ultimately leading to heart failure. Experimental findings increasingly emphasize that organ-scale changes following VO cannot be explained by myocyte growth alone, as traditionally proposed in the literature. Collagen degradation, in particular, has been associated with left ventricular adaptation in both acute and chronic stages of VO. These hypotheses remain to be substantiated by comprehensive mechanistic evidence, and the contribution of each constituent to myocardial growth and remodeling (G&R) processes is yet to be quantified. In this work, we establish a hybrid G&R framework in which we integrate a mixture-based constitutive model with the kinematic growth formulation. This multi-constituent model enables us to mechanistically assess the relative contributions of collagen and myocyte changes to alterations in tissue properties, ventricular dimensions, and growth phenotype. Our numerical results confirm that collagen dynamics control the passive mechanical response of the myocardium, whereas myocytes predominantly impact the extent and the phenotype of eccentric hypertrophy. Importantly, collagen degradation exacerbates myocyte hypertrophy, demonstrating a synergistic interplay that accelerates left ventricular progression toward diastolic dysfunction. This work constitutes an important step towards an integrated characterization of the early compensatory stages of VO-induced cardiac G&R.",

Inherently, such multimodal experimental protocols necessitate multiple tissue samples and extensive sample manipulations. Intrinsic inter-sample variability and manipulation-induced tissue damage might have an adverse effect on the inversely identified tissue behavior. In this work, we aim to overcome this gap by focusing our attention to the use of heterogeneous deformation profiles in a parameter estimation problem. More specifically, we adapt EUCLID, an unsupervised method for the automated discovery of constitutive models, towards the purpose of parameter identification for highly nonlinear, orthotropic constitutive models using a Bayesian inference approach and three-dimensional continuum elements. We showcase its strength to quantitatively infer, with varying noise levels, the material model parameters of synthetic myocardial tissue slabs from a single heterogeneous biaxial stretch test. This method shows good agreement with the ground-truth simulations and with corresponding credibility intervals. Our work highlights the potential for characterizing highly nonlinear and orthotropic material models from a single biaxial stretch test with uncertainty quantification.",

    "abstract": "The mechanosensory system of teeth is currently believed to partly rely on Odontoblast cells stimulation by fluid flow through a porosity network extending through dentin. Visualizing the smallest sub-microscopic porosity vessels therefore requires the highest achievable resolution from confocal fluorescence microscopy, the current gold standard. This considerably limits the extent of the field of view to very small sample regions. To overcome this limitation, we tested different deep learning (DL) super-resolution (SR) models to allow faster experimental acquisitions of lower resolution images and restore optimal image quality by post-processing. Three supervised 2D SR models (RCAN, pix2pix, FSRCNN) and one unsupervised (CycleGAN) were applied to a unique set of experimentally paired high- and low-resolution confocal images acquired with different sampling schemes, resulting in a pixel size increase of x2, x4, x8. Model performance was quantified using a broad set of similarity and distribution-based image quality assessment (IQA) metrics, which yielded inconsistent results that mostly contradicted our visual perception. This raises the question of the relevance of such generic metrics to efficiently target the specific structure of dental porosity. To resolve this conflicting information, the generated SR images were segmented taking into account the specific scales and morphology of the porosity network and analysed by comparing connected components. Additionally, the capacity of the SR models to preserve 3D porosity connectivity throughout the confocal image stacks was evaluated using graph analysis. This biology-driven assessment allowed a far better mechanistic interpretation of SR performance, highlighting differences in model sensitivity to weak intensity features and the impact of non-linearity in image generation, which explains the failure of standard IQA metrics.",

A rotational acceleration of 10 krad/s$^2$ and 10 ms duration was simulated about each principal head axis. We analyzed different mTBI injury metrics, including maximum principal strain (MPS95), maximum principal strain rate (MPSR95), and cumulative strain damage measure (CSDM15), for the whole brain as well as for specific regions of interest (ROIs). Results: Modeling cortical folds consistently predicted higher injury metrics across all individuals and rotational direction, with the bias (mean $\\pm$ std. dev.) of $-21.17\\pm 9.1\\%$ in MPS95, $-17.1 \\pm 7.6\\%$ in MPSR95, and $-14.4 \\pm 11.3\\%$ in CSDM15. Modeling cortical folds significantly affected the spatial strain distributions, with the DICE similarity coefficient on peak MPS ranging between $0.07-0.43$ and DICE on CSDM15 ranging between $0.42-0.70$; and increasing the peak injury metrics even in the geometrically unaltered regions of interest, such as the corpus callosum, cerebellum, and brain stem, by up to $50\\%$. Conclusions: The study finds that the inclusion of cortical folds significantly alters the pattern of deformation in the brain, thereby affecting the mTBI risk predictions head rotations.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a new model of the human corneal stroma, regarded as a fluid-saturated continuum, able to describe surface flattening and thickness thinning observed in several pathological conditions. In contrast with more common approaches that describe the human cornea as a quasi-incompressible hyperelastic medium, eventually including micro-structured anisotropy and heterogeneity, here we focus on the multi-phase nature of the tissue, where the content of water reaches about 78\\% in weight. The study is motivated by the fact that, although purely mechanical continuum models have been demonstrated to be satisfactory and accurate at predicting physiological behaviors, they have not been able to capture the geometrical features of tissue degeneration clearly associated to a reduction of the fluid content in the stroma, such thinning and loss of curvature. Here, we model the cornea as a fully saturated mixture of a solid phase and a fluid phase, in principle without restricting the formulation to specific assumptions on the actual inhomogeneous nature of both phases. The focus of the study is to understand whether a multiphysics model is capable of explaining, in terms of fluid flux imbalance, such as ectasia and keratoconus. As a first attempt in this direction, we make simple isotropic constitutive assumptions for both phases.",

    "title": "Improving Artifact Robustness for CT Deep Learning Models Without Labeled Artifact Images via Domain Adaptation",
    "abstract": "Deep learning models which perform well on images from their training distribution can degrade substantially when applied to new distributions. If a CT scanner introduces a new artifact not present in the training labels, the model may misclassify the images. Although modern CT scanners include design features which mitigate these artifacts, unanticipated or difficult-to-mitigate artifacts can still appear in practice. The direct solution of labeling images from this new distribution can be costly. As a more accessible alternative, this study evaluates domain adaptation as an approach for training models that maintain classification performance despite new artifacts, even without corresponding labels. We simulate ring artifacts from detector gain error in sinogram space and evaluate domain adversarial neural networks (DANN) against baseline and augmentation-based approaches on the OrganAMNIST abdominal CT dataset. Our results demonstrate that baseline models trained only on clean images fail to generalize to images with ring artifacts, and traditional augmentation with other distortion types provides no improvement on unseen artifact domains. In contrast, the DANN approach successfully maintains high classification accuracy on ring artifact images using only unlabeled artifact data during training, demonstrating the viability of domain adaptation for artifact robustness. The domain-adapted model achieved classification performance on ring artifact test data comparable to models explicitly trained with labeled artifact images, while also showing unexpected generalization to uniform noise. These findings provide empirical evidence that domain adaptation can effectively address distribution shift in medical imaging without requiring expensive expert labeling of new artifact distributions, suggesting promise for deployment in clinical settings where novel artifacts may emerge.",

The device integrates surface electromyography (sEMG), an inertial measurement unit (IMU), and flex/force sensors on an M5StickC plus an ESP32-S3 compute hub. Signals are band-pass and notch filtered; features (RMS, MAV, zero-crossings, and 4-12 Hz tremor-band power) are computed in 250 ms windows and fed to an INT8 TensorFlow Lite Micro model. Control commands are bounded by a control-barrier-function safety envelope and delivered within game-based tasks with lightweight personalization. In a pilot technical feasibility evaluation with healthy volunteers (n = 12) performing three ADL-oriented tasks, tremor prominence decreased (Delta TI = -0.092, 95% CI [-0.102, -0.079]), range of motion increased (+12.65%, 95% CI [+8.43, +13.89]), repetitions rose (+2.99 min^-1, 95% CI [+2.61, +3.35]), and the EMG median-frequency slope became less negative (Delta = +0.100 Hz/min, 95% CI [+0.083, +0.127]). The sensing-to-assist loop ran at 100 Hz with 8.7 ms median on-device latency, 100% session completion, and 0 device-related adverse events. These results demonstrate technical feasibility of embedded, sensor-fused assistance for upper-limb function; formal patient studies under IRB oversight are planned.",

    "abstract": "Objective: We sought to develop a classification algorithm to extract diagnoses from free-text radiology reports of brain imaging performed in patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF) undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation. Methods: We developed and fine-tuned Neu-RadBERT, a BERT-based model, to classify unstructured radiology reports. We extracted all the brain imaging reports (computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging) from MIMIC-IV database, performed in patients with ARF. Initial manual labelling was performed on a subset of reports for various brain abnormalities, followed by fine-tuning Neu-RadBERT using three strategies: 1) baseline RadBERT, 2) Neu-RadBERT with Masked Language Modeling (MLM) pretraining, and 3) Neu-RadBERT with MLM pretraining and oversampling to address data skewness. We compared the performance of this model to Llama-2-13B, an autoregressive LLM. Results: The Neu-RadBERT model, particularly with oversampling, demonstrated significant improvements in diagnostic accuracy compared to baseline RadBERT for brain abnormalities, achieving up to 98.0% accuracy for acute brain injuries. Llama-2-13B exhibited relatively lower performance, peaking at 67.5% binary classification accuracy. This result highlights potential limitations of current autoregressive LLMs for this specific classification task, though it remains possible that larger models or further fine-tuning could improve performance. Conclusion: Neu-RadBERT, enhanced through target domain pretraining and oversampling techniques, offered a robust tool for accurate and reliable diagnosis of neurological conditions from radiology reports. This study underscores the potential of transformer-based NLP models in automatically extracting diagnoses from free text reports with potential applications to both research and patient care.",

    "abstract": "This work introduces Federated Adaptive Gain via Dual Signal Trust (FedAgain), a novel federated learning algorithm designed to enhance anomaly detection in medical imaging under decentralized and heterogeneous conditions. Focusing on the task of kidney stone classification, FedAgain addresses the common challenge of corrupted or low-quality client data in real-world clinical environments by implementing a dual-signal trust mechanism based on reconstruction error and model divergence. This mechanism enables the central server to dynamically down-weight updates from untrustworthy clients without accessing their raw data, thereby preserving both model integrity and data privacy. FedAgain employs deep convolutional autoencoders trained in two diverse kidney stone datasets and is evaluated in 16 types of endoscopy-specific corruption at five severity levels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedAgain effectively suppresses \"expert forger\" clients, enhances robustness to image corruptions, and offers a privacy-preserving solution for collaborative medical anomaly detection. Compared to traditional FedAvg, FedAgain achieves clear improvements in all 16 types of corruption, with precision gains of up to +14.49\\% and F1 score improvements of up to +10.20\\%, highlighting its robustness and effectiveness in challenging imaging scenarios.",

    "title": "Load Transfer along Continuous Collagen Fibers Reduces the Importance of Wall Thickness Variations",
    "abstract": "The mechanical response of biological soft tissues is influenced by wall heterogeneity, including spatial variations in wall thickness. Traditional models for homogeneous soft tissues under uniaxial loading predict higher stretch and stress in thinner regions. In fact, large gradients in stretch and stress are predicted to be induced by spatial variations in wall thickness. In prior studies, the role of collagen fibers in regions of thickness transition has been largely neglected or only considered in terms of their effect on anisotropy. Here, we explore the role of collagen fibers as primary load-bearing components across regions of varying wall thickness, using a three-dimensional representative volume element (RVE) model incorporating explicit collagen fiber architecture and a gradual thickness gradient. We examined two distinct collagen fiber configurations across the thickness transition: one featuring abrupt fiber termination and another with fiber continuity. Finite element analysis (FEA) under uniaxial tension revealed that load transfer by continuous fibers across the specimen markedly reduced the importance of the change in wall thickness, with stretch differentials dropping from ~20% (fiber-termination network) to 0.68% (continuous fibers) and stress differentials dropping from ~65% (fiber-termination network) to 2.3% (continuous fibers). Fiber tortuosity delayed the point at which mechanical response was governed by fiber structure. These findings demonstrate the critical role of fiber continuity in reducing stretch and stress gradients across regions of varying wall thickness and clarify the importance of accurately representing fiber architecture when modeling soft tissues with heterogeneous wall thickness.",

Outcomes included clinical and endoscopic remission, response rates, and adverse events. Nine trials including 3808 patients in the induction phase and 1734 in the maintenance phase were analyzed.

IL-23RA reduced serious adverse events in the induction phase (0.40, 95 percent confidence interval 0.27-0.69) with no difference during maintenance (0.75, 95 percent confidence interval 0.31-1.84). No significant differences were observed in overall adverse events or specific events such as headache or nasopharyngitis.

    "abstract": "Clinical machine learning faces a critical dilemma in high-stakes medical applications: algorithms achieving optimal diagnostic performance typically sacrifice the interpretability essential for physician decision-making, while interpretable methods compromise sensitivity in complex scenarios. This paradox becomes particularly acute in non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT), where missed chromosomal abnormalities carry profound clinical consequences yet regulatory frameworks mandate explainable AI systems. We introduce Medical Priority Fusion (MPF), a constrained multi-objective optimization framework that resolves this fundamental trade-off by systematically integrating Naive Bayes probabilistic reasoning with Decision Tree rule-based logic through mathematically-principled weighted fusion under explicit medical constraints. Rigorous validation on 1,687 real-world NIPT samples characterized by extreme class imbalance (43.4:1 normal-to-abnormal ratio) employed stratified 5-fold cross-validation with comprehensive ablation studies and statistical hypothesis testing using McNemar's paired comparisons. MPF achieved simultaneous optimization of dual objectives: 89.3% sensitivity (95% CI: 83.9-94.7%) with 80% interpretability score, significantly outperforming individual algorithms (McNemar's test, p < 0.001). The optimal fusion configuration achieved Grade A clinical deployment criteria with large effect size (d = 1.24), establishing the first clinically-deployable solution that maintains both diagnostic accuracy and decision transparency essential for prenatal care. This work demonstrates that medical-constrained algorithm fusion can resolve the interpretability-performance trade-off, providing a mathematical framework for developing high-stakes medical decision support systems that meet both clinical efficacy and explainability requirements.",

    "abstract": "Cerebral aneurysms affect three to five percent of the population, and rupture remains a major cause of stroke-related death and disability. Current therapies, surgical clipping, endovascular coiling, and flow diversion, have improved outcomes but each carries limitations. Clipping is invasive and often unsuitable for deep or posterior lesions. Coiling is prone to recurrence from compaction or incomplete occlusion, particularly in wide-neck or fusiform aneurysms. Flow diverters offer improved durability but rely on rigid metallic scaffolds that may malappose in tortuous vessels, compromise branch arteries, delay endothelialization, and necessitate long-term dual antiplatelet therapy. These shortcomings highlight a gap in current management: devices primarily provide mechanical occlusion but fail to conform to complex geometries or reliably promote rapid, complete endothelialization. As a result, aneurysm necks may remain exposed to persistent flow, delayed healing, and thrombosis.   To address this, we propose magnetically guided endothelial BioBots as a next-generation therapeutic strategy. BioBots are biodegradable hydrogel carriers embedded with magnetic nanoparticles and coated with primed endothelial progenitor cells. Delivered through microcatheters and guided by external electromagnetic fields, they can assemble across aneurysm defects. Once localized, they form a conformal, geometry-adaptive endothelial patch that provides immediate antithrombotic protection and, as the hydrogel degrades, leaves behind a stable, functional endothelial lining. By integrating microrobotic navigation with regenerative vascular biology, BioBots may overcome the central limitations of current devices and enable safer, more durable treatment for complex aneurysms.",

    "abstract": "Large-language models (LLMs) are rapidly being applied to radiology, enabling automated image interpretation and report generation tasks. Their deployment in clinical practice requires both high diagnostic accuracy and low inference latency, which in turn demands powerful hardware. High-performance graphical processing units (GPUs) provide the necessary compute and memory throughput to run large LLMs on imaging data. We review modern GPU architectures (e.g. NVIDIA A100/H100, AMD Instinct MI250X/MI300) and key performance metrics of floating-point throughput, memory bandwidth, VRAM capacity. We show how these hardware capabilities affect radiology tasks: for example, generating reports or detecting findings on CheXpert and MIMIC-CXR images is computationally intensive and benefits from GPU parallelism and tensor-core acceleration. Empirical studies indicate that using appropriate GPU resources can reduce inference time and improve throughput. We discuss practical challenges including privacy, deployment, cost, power and optimization strategies: mixed-precision, quantization, compression, and multi-GPU scaling. Finally, we anticipate that next-generation features (8-bit tensor cores, enhanced interconnect) will further enable on-premise and federated radiology AI. Advancing GPU infrastructure is essential for safe, efficient LLM-based radiology diagnostics.",

While effectively suppressing HBV replication, its impact on liver histopathological fibrosis and inflammation remains a critical concern for clinicians and patients. Methods : A total of 625 patients who completed 48 weeks of PEG-IFN combined with oral antiviral therapy were enrolled in this real-world study. Based on their virological response at 48 weeks, patients were categorized into Clearance group and Non-clearance group. Changes in liver biochemistry, fibrosis, and renal function were compared between groups and before/after treatment. Results: No significant differences were observed in baseline blood tests, liver biochemical markers, or histopathological features between the Clearance group and Non-clearance group. Similarly, baseline renal function showed no significant variation. Further analysis revealed that the Clearance group exhibited significant aggravation of liver fibrosis after 48 weeks of treatment, which correlated strongly with alterations in liver enzyme levels. However, one patient who underwent paired liver biopsies before and after treatment demonstrated marked histopathological improvement in fibrosis. This finding underscores the irreplaceable role of liver histopathology in assessing fibrosis and inflammation. Conclusion: PEG-IFN combined with oral antiviral therapy exerts favorable effects on liver fibrosis and inflammation in chronic HBV patients. Non-invasive fibrosis assessment models can monitor fibrotic progression but are susceptible to confounding by hepatic inflammation.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: To develop a deep learning method for the automatic segmentation of spinal nerve rootlets on various MRI scans. Material and Methods: This retrospective study included MRI scans from two open-access and one private dataset, consisting of 3D isotropic 3T TSE T2-weighted (T2w) and 7T MP2RAGE (T1-weighted [T1w] INV1 and INV2, and UNIT1) MRI scans. A deep learning model, RootletSeg, was developed to segment C2-T1 dorsal and ventral spinal rootlets. Training was performed on 76 scans and testing on 17 scans. The Dice score was used to compare the model performance with an existing open-source method. Spinal levels derived from RootletSeg segmentations were compared with vertebral levels defined by intervertebral discs using Bland-Altman analysis. Results: The RootletSeg model developed on 93 MRI scans from 50 healthy adults (mean age, 28.70 years $\\pm$ 6.53 [SD]; 28 [56%] males, 22 [44%] females) achieved a mean $\\pm$ SD Dice score of 0.67 $\\pm$ 0.09 for T1w-INV2, 0.65 $\\pm$ 0.11 for UNIT1, 0.64 $\\pm$ 0.08 for T2w, and 0.62 $\\pm$ 0.10 for T1w-INV1 contrasts. Spinal-vertebral level correspondence showed a progressively increasing rostrocaudal shift, with Bland-Altman bias ranging from 0.00 to 8.15 mm (median difference between level midpoints). Conclusion: RootletSeg accurately segmented C2-T1 spinal rootlets across MRI contrasts, enabling the determination of spinal levels directly from MRI scans. The method is open-source and can be used for a variety of downstream analyses, including lesion classification, neuromodulation therapy, and functional MRI group analysis.",

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art (SOTA) Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are criticized for their extensive computational power, long training times, and large datasets. To overcome this limitation, we propose a reasonable network (R-Net), a lightweight CNN only to detect and classify colorectal cancer (CRC) using the Enteroscope Biopsy Histopathological Hematoxylin and Eosin Image Dataset (EBHI). Furthermore, six SOTA CNNs, including Multipath-based CNNs (DenseNet121, ResNet50), Depth-based CNNs (InceptionV3), width-based multi-connection CNNs (Xception), depth-wise separable convolutions (MobileNetV2), spatial exploitation-based CNNs (VGG16), Transfer learning, and two ensemble models are also tested on the same dataset. The ensemble models are a multipath-depth-width combination (DenseNet121-InceptionV3-Xception) and a multipath-depth-spatial combination (ResNet18-InceptionV3-VGG16). However, the proposed R-Net lightweight achieved 99.37% accuracy, outperforming MobileNet (95.83%) and ResNet50 (96.94%). Most importantly, to understand the decision-making of R-Net, Explainable AI such as SHAP, LIME, and Grad-CAM are integrated to visualize which parts of the EBHI image contribute to the detection and classification process of R-Net. The main novelty of this research lies in building a reliable, lightweight CNN R-Net that requires fewer computing resources yet maintains strong prediction results. SOTA CNNs, transfer learning, and ensemble models also extend our knowledge on CRC classification and detection. XAI functionality and the impact of pixel intensity on correct and incorrect classification images are also some novelties in CRC detection and classification.",

    "abstract": "Early and accurate detection through Pap smear analysis is critical to improving patient outcomes and reducing mortality of Cervical cancer. State-of-the-art (SOTA) Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) require substantial computational resources, extended training time, and large datasets. In this study, a lightweight CNN model, S-Net (Simple Net), is developed specifically for cervical cancer detection and classification using Pap smear images to address these limitations. Alongside S-Net, six SOTA CNNs were evaluated using transfer learning, including multi-path (DenseNet201, ResNet152), depth-based (Serasnet152), width-based multi-connection (Xception), depth-wise separable convolutions (MobileNetV2), and spatial exploitation-based (VGG19). All models, including S-Net, achieved comparable accuracy, with S-Net reaching 99.99%. However, S-Net significantly outperforms the SOTA CNNs in terms of computational efficiency and inference time, making it a more practical choice for real-time and resource-constrained applications. A major limitation in CNN-based medical diagnosis remains the lack of transparency in the decision-making process. To address this, Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, such as SHAP, LIME, and Grad-CAM, were employed to visualize and interpret the key image regions influencing model predictions. The novelty of this study lies in the development of a highly accurate yet computationally lightweight model (S-Net) caPable of rapid inference while maintaining interpretability through XAI integration. Furthermore, this work analyzes the behavior of SOTA CNNs, investigates the effects of negative transfer learning on Pap smear images, and examines pixel intensity patterns in correctly and incorrectly classified samples.",

We present Contrasting by Patient Augmented Electrocardiograms (CAPE) foundation model and pretrain on four cohorts (n = 5,203,352), from diverse populations across three continents (North America, South America, Asia). We systematically assess how cohort demographics, health status, and population diversity influence the downstream performance for prediction tasks also including two additional cohorts from another continent (Europe). We find that downstream performance depends on the distributional properties of the pretraining cohort, including demographics and health status. Moreover, while pretraining with a multi-centre, demographically diverse cohort improves in-distribution accuracy, it reduces out-of-distribution (OOD) generalisation of our contrastive approach by encoding cohort-specific artifacts. To address this, we propose the In-Distribution Batch (IDB) strategy, which preserves intra-cohort consistency during pretraining and enhances OOD robustness. This work provides important insights for developing clinically fair and generalisable foundation models.",

    "abstract": "As a lightweight and non-invasive imaging technique, lung ultrasound (LUS) has gained importance for assessing lung pathologies. The use of Artificial intelligence (AI) in medical decision support systems is promising due to the time- and expertise-intensive interpretation, however, due to the poor quality of existing data used for training AI models, their usability for real-world applications remains unclear. In a prospective study, we analyze data from 63 COVID-19 suspects (33 positive) collected at Maastricht University Medical Centre. Ultrasound recordings at six body locations were acquired following the BLUE protocol and manually labeled for severity of lung involvement. Several AI models were applied and trained for detection and severity of pulmonary infection. The severity of the lung infection, as assigned by human annotators based on the LUS videos, is not significantly different between COVID-19 positive and negative patients (p = 0.89). Nevertheless, the predictions of image-based AI models identify a COVID-19 infection with 65% accuracy when applied zero-shot (i.e., trained on other datasets), and up to 79% with targeted training, whereas the accuracy based on human annotations is at most 65%. Multi-modal models combining images and CBC improve significantly over image-only models. Although our analysis generally supports the value of AI in LUS assessment, the evaluated models fall short of the performance expected from previous work. We find this is due to 1) the heterogeneity of LUS datasets, limiting the generalization ability to new data, 2) the frame-based processing of AI models ignoring video-level information, and 3) lack of work on multi-modal models that can extract the most relevant information from video-, image- and variable-based inputs. To aid future research, we publish the dataset at: https://github.com/NinaWie/COVID-BLUES.",

We present a robust, fully automated pipeline for aortic shape analysis from cardiac MRI, combining deep learning and statistical techniques across segmentation, 3D surface reconstruction, and mesh registration. We benchmark leading segmentation models including nnUNet, TotalSegmentator, and MedSAM2 highlighting the effectiveness of domain specific training and transfer learning on a curated dataset. Following segmentation, we reconstruct high quality 3D meshes and introduce a DL based mesh registration method that directly optimises vertex displacements. This approach significantly outperforms classical rigid and nonrigid methods in geometric accuracy and anatomical consistency. Using the registered meshes, we perform statistical shape analysis on a cohort of 599 healthy subjects. Principal Component Analysis reveals dominant modes of aortic shape variation, capturing both global morphology and local structural differences under rigid and similarity transformations. Our findings demonstrate the advantages of integrating traditional geometry processing with learning based models for anatomically precise and scalable aortic analysis. This work lays the groundwork for future studies into pathological shape deviations and supports the development of personalised diagnostics in cardiovascular medicine.",

We develop a computational model of the Less In More Out device, a fluidically actuated soft total artificial heart constructed from heat-sealed layers of woven fabric. Our model reproduces the nonlinear deformation, strain fields, and pressure-volume relationships measured in quasi-static experiments. Devices with fewer pouches deliver higher stroke volumes but exhibit up to 50% higher peak von Mises stresses. Fatigue analysis using a strain-life approach identifies heat-sealed seams and buckling regions as durability-limiting features.

Chronic liver disease (CLD) is a progressive deterioration of liver functions, caused by one or more etiology. This study was aimed to investigate whether radiomics features extracted from individual or combined magnetic resonance imaging sequences, such as T1-weighted, T2-weighted images, or quantitative maps from chemical shift encoded, diffusion-weighted imaging, can effectively classify inflammation and fibrosis in CLD. Method: Seventy-seven patients with CLD were enrolled in this study. Each participant underwent both MRI examinations and liver biopsy. The biopsy procedure was applied to quantitatively or semi-qualitatively analyze several histology features, steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis. Radiomic features were extracted, selected, reduced, and used to train the inflammation and fibrosis classification based on random forest models. The performances of classifiers were evaluated by the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, and DeLong tests. Result: The random forest model achieved the area under the curve (AUC) of 0.85 and 0.86 for inflammation and fibrosis classification, respectively. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that the MRI-based radiomics features hold potential in the inflammation and fibrosis classification.",

We discover two different closure mechanisms at the tissue scale depending on the energy barrier $E_\\text{b}$ to and the energy $ΔE$ released by intercalation: If $E_\\text{b}\\ggΔE$, cells intercalate into the gap to close it. For a fluidised tissue in which $E_\\text{b}\\llΔE$, however, cells deintercalate from the boundary into the bulk of the tissue, and we reveal an emergent mechanical role of inhomogeneities of the actomyosin cable.

The modeling parameters, along with the Clausyus-Clapeyron equation, were used to determine the differential enthalpy, differential entropy, and Gibbs free energy present in the process. In addition, the compensation theory for this system was validated. The results indicate an overall reduction in the energy required to establish equilibrium in the water-seed system as the moisture content increases. A relationship is observed that will inject Gibbs free energy into the system at the extremes of the magnetic dose applied to the seeds. This relationship is stable as a first approximation to understand the energetic aspects when connecting the magnetic processing of seeds.",

    "title": "Control of lumen morphology by lateral and basal cell surfaces",
    "abstract": "Across development, the morphology of fluid-filled lumina enclosed by epithelial tissues arises from an interplay of lumen pressure, mechanics of the cell cortex, and cell-cell adhesion. Here, we explore the mechanical basis for the control of this interplay using the shape space of MDCK cysts and the instability of their apical surfaces under tight junction perturbations [Mukenhirn et al., Dev. Cell 59, 2886 (2024)]. We discover that the cysts respond to these perturbations by significantly modulating their lateral and basal tensions, in addition to the known modulations of pressure and apical belt tension. We develop a mean-field three-dimensional vertex model of these cysts that reproduces the experimental shape instability quantitatively. This reveals that the observed increase of lateral contractility is a cellular response that counters the instability. Our work thus shows how regulation of the mechanics of all cell surfaces conspires to control lumen morphology.",

    "abstract": "Current gastric cancer (GCa) risk systems are prone to errors since they evaluate a visual estimation of intestinal metaplasia percentages in histopathology images of gastric mucosa to assign a risk. This study presents an automated method to detect and quantify intestinal metaplasia using deep convolutional neural networks as well as a comparative analysis with visual estimations of three pathologists. Gastric samples were collected from two different cohorts: 149 asymptomatic volunteers from a region with a high prevalence of GCa in Colombia and 56 patients from a tertiary hospital. Deep learning models were trained to classify intestinal metaplasia, and predictions were used to estimate a percentage of intestinal metaplasia and to assign an adapted OLGIM stage. Atrophy was not assessed because of the limited reproducibility among pathologists. Results were compared with independent blinded metaplastic assessments performed by three graduated pathologists. The best-performing deep learning architecture classified intestinal metaplasia with F1-Score of 0.80 +- 0.01 and AUC of 0.91 +- 0.01. Among pathologists, inter-observer agreement by a Fleiss's Kappa score ranged from 0.20 to 0.48. In comparison, agreement between the pathologists and the best-performing model ranged from 0.12 to 0.35. Deep learning models show potential to reliably detect and quantify the percentage of intestinal metaplasia, achieving high classification performance. In practice, visual estimation is still the only available method, yet it is marked by considerable inter-observer variability. Deep learning models provide consistent estimates that could help reduce this subjectivity in risk stratification.",

We developed Glorbit, a lightweight, browser-based application for automated periorbital distance measurement using artificial intelligence, designed for use in low-resource clinical settings. The app integrates a DeepLabV3 segmentation model into a modular pipeline with secure, site-specific Google Cloud storage. Glorbit supports offline mode, local preprocessing, and cloud upload via Firebase-authenticated logins. We evaluated usability, cross-platform compatibility, and deployment readiness through a simulated enrollment study of 15 volunteers. The app completed the full workflow -- metadata entry, image capture, segmentation, and upload -- on all tested sessions without error. Glorbit successfully ran on laptops, tablets, and mobile phones across major browsers. The segmentation model succeeded on all images. Average session time was 101.7 seconds (standard deviation: 17.5). Usability survey scores (1-5 scale) were uniformly high: intuitiveness and efficiency (5.0), workflow clarity (4.8), output confidence (4.9), and clinical utility (4.9). Glorbit provides a functional, scalable solution for standardized periorbital measurement in diverse environments. It supports secure data collection and may enable future development of real-time triage tools and multimodal AI-driven oculoplastics. Tool available at: https://glorbit.app",

Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a green tea catechin, and piperine, a black pepper alkaloid, have demonstrated promising anti-cancer properties. Leveraging the regenerative capacity of Dugesia tigrina (planaria) and their neoblast stem cells as a model for cancer growth, this study investigated the combined effects of EGCG and piperine on cell proliferation. Planaria were exposed to varying concentrations of EGCG and piperine over seven days, with growth changes recorded and compared to a negative control group. Initial trials identified optimal concentrations for growth inhibition, subsequently validated in a second trial using combined EGCG and piperine treatment. Statistical analysis revealed significant differences in growth across all experimental groups (p < 0.05), indicating a synergistic effect of EGCG and piperine in limiting planarian growth. These findings suggest the potential of combined EGCG and piperine therapy for cancer and other proliferative diseases like keloids and psoriatic arthritis, warranting further investigation into clinical applications.",

To explore the roles of the active cellular forces and the regulation of these forces, we developed an integrated vertex model that combines the regulation of morphogen expression with cell movements and tissue mechanics. Our results suggest that a successful furrow formation requires an apical tension gradient, decreased basal tension, and increased lateral tension, which corresponds to apical constriction, basal expansion, and apicobasal shortening respectively. Our model also considers the mechanical feedback which leads to an ectopic twist expression with external compression as observed in experiments. Our model predicts that ectopic invagination could happen if an external compressive gradient is applied.",

Here, we present the Vision Transformer Digital Twin Surrogate Network (VT-DTSN), a deep learning framework for predictive modeling of 3D+T imaging data from biological tissue. By leveraging Vision Transformers pretrained with DINO (Self-Distillation with NO Labels) and employing a multi-view fusion strategy, VT-DTSN learns to reconstruct high-fidelity, time-resolved dynamics of a Drosophila midgut while preserving morphological and feature-level integrity across imaging depths. The model is trained with a composite loss prioritizing pixel-level accuracy, perceptual structure, and feature-space alignment, ensuring biologically meaningful outputs suitable for in silico experimentation and hypothesis testing. Evaluation across layers and biological replicates demonstrates VT-DTSN's robustness and consistency, achieving low error rates and high structural similarity while maintaining efficient inference through model optimization. This work establishes VT-DTSN as a feasible, high-fidelity surrogate for cross-timepoint reconstruction and for studying tissue dynamics, enabling computational exploration of cellular behaviors and homeostasis to complement time-resolved imaging studies in biological research.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have recently gained immense interest for their generative capabilities, specifically the high quality and diversity of the synthesized data. However, examples of their applications in 3D medical imaging are still scarce, especially in cardiology. Generating diverse realistic cardiac anatomies is crucial for applications such as in silico trials, electromechanical computer simulations, or data augmentations for machine learning models. In this work, we investigate the application of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) for generating 3D meshes of human cardiac anatomies. To this end, we propose a novel LDM architecture -- MeshLDM. We apply the proposed model on a dataset of 3D meshes of left ventricular cardiac anatomies from patients with acute myocardial infarction and evaluate its performance in terms of both qualitative and quantitative clinical and 3D mesh reconstruction metrics. The proposed MeshLDM successfully captures characteristics of the cardiac shapes at end-diastolic (relaxation) and end-systolic (contraction) cardiac phases, generating meshes with a 2.4% difference in population mean compared to the gold standard.",

    "abstract": "Tumor-immune interactions are central to cancer progression and treatment outcomes. In this study, we present a stochastic agent-based model that integrates cellular heterogeneity, spatial cell-cell interactions, and drug resistance evolution to simulate tumor growth and immune response in a two-dimensional microenvironment. The model captures dynamic behaviors of four major cell types--tumor cells, cytotoxic T lymphocytes, helper T cells, and regulatory T cells--and incorporates key biological processes such as proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and immune regulation. Using this framework, we simulate tumor progression under different therapeutic interventions, including radiotherapy, targeted therapy, and immune checkpoint blockade. Our simulations reproduce emergent phenomena such as immune privilege and spatial immune exclusion. Quantitative analyses show that all therapies suppress tumor growth to varying degrees and reshape the tumor microenvironment. Notably, combination therapies--especially targeted therapy with immunotherapy--achieve the most effective tumor control and delay the emergence of resistance. Additionally, sensitivity analyses reveal a nonlinear relationship between treatment intensity and therapeutic efficacy, highlighting the existence of optimal dosing thresholds. This work demonstrates the utility of agent-based modeling in capturing complex tumor-immune dynamics and provides a computational platform for optimizing cancer treatment strategies. The model is extensible, biologically interpretable, and well-suited for future integration with experimental or clinical data.",

This cost-effective method efficiently leverages the classifier's uncertainty on the unlabeled cervical cell images to accurately select images that are most beneficial to label. With a fast estimation of the uncertainty, this new algorithm exhibits its validity and effectiveness in enhancing the representative ability of the constructed training dataset. The extensive empirical results confirm its efficacy again in navigating the usage of human cost, opening the avenue for data-efficient cervical cell classification.",

Cardiac digital twins require accurate yet personalized models of heart tissue elasticity, but existing SEF often suffer from high parameter variance, hindering personalization. CHESRA addresses this by using an evolutionary algorithm to derive SEF that balance accuracy and simplicity, while using a normalizing loss function to enable learning from multiple experimental datasets. CHESRA identified two novel SEF, named ψ_CH1 and ψ_CH2, which use only three and four parameters, respectively, and achieve high accuracy in fitting experimental data. Results show that the parameters of ψ_CH1 and ψ_CH2 can be estimated more consistently than those of the state-of-the-art SEF when using tissue data, with similar improvements observed for ψ_CH1 in a three-dimensional digital twin. CHESRA's utility for generating simple, generalizable SEF makes it a promising tool for advancing cardiac digital twins and clinical decision-making.",

The modeling framework is rigorously validated against published numerical and experimental data, demonstrating strong agreement across a range of scenarios. Using realistic left atrial (LA) anatomy, commercially available circular, flower, and basket catheter configurations are simulated to evaluate lesion formation across different applied voltages. The performance of each catheter type is quantitatively assessed using multiple metrics, including lesion volume, energy delivery efficiency and transmurality. Simulation results show that circular catheters provide the highest energy delivery efficiency and target coverage at lower voltages, while basket catheters produce the largest lesion volumes. This framework offers a useful basis for exploring catheter design and treatment planning in PFA applications.",

    "title": "The Role of Arteriovenous Graft Curvature in Haemodynamics: an Image-Based Approach",
    "abstract": "Vascular access, such as arteriovenous grafts, is crucial for patients undergoing haemodialysis as part of kidney replacement therapy. One of the primary causes of arteriovenous graft failure and loss of patency is disordered blood flow, as the vein is exposed to the arterial environment with high flow rates and shear stress. We hypothesize that secondary flow downstream of the vein-graft anastomosis plays a critical role in generating low shear regions, thereby promoting neointima hyperplasia. The secondary flow highlighted here also promotes high oscillatory shear index regions downstream of the vein-graft anastomosis, further contributing to graft failure. To prolong the overall graft survival and patency, we aim to develop a strategy to optimise graft configurations with reduced levels of disturbed haemodynamics. We developed an image-based approach to build three-dimensional geometries for subsequent computational fluid dynamics (CFD) numerical simulations. This simple, yet accurate, method allowed us to improve the accuracy of geometries, thus facilitating comparisons between different vein-graft anastomotic angles.   Our results reveal that overall graft curvature (looped vs. straight) plays a dominant role in characterising the failure metrics. Looped grafts, particularly at moderate vein-graft anastomotic angles (30°-45°), exhibited the most favourable metrics, including reduced values of low wall shear stress, high wall shear stress, and high oscillatory shear index. These findings provide critical insights to inform medical professionals about graft areas that are subject to high shear stresses due to the oscillating nature of blood flow as well as the graft geometric configuration when performing surgery. The model developed in this work offers a framework enabling personalised vascular access strategies tailored to individual patient needs.",

    "abstract": "Accelerated Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) requires careful optimization of k-space sampling patterns to balance acquisition speed and image quality. While recent advances in deep learning have shown promise in optimizing Cartesian sampling, the potential of reinforcement learning (RL) for non-Cartesian trajectory optimization remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present a novel RL framework for optimizing radial sampling trajectories in cardiac MRI. Our approach features a dual-branch architecture that jointly processes k-space and image-domain information, incorporating a cross-attention fusion mechanism to facilitate effective information exchange between domains. The framework employs an anatomically-aware reward design and a golden-ratio sampling strategy to ensure uniform k-space coverage while preserving cardiac structural details. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively learns optimal radial sampling strategies across multiple acceleration factors, achieving improved reconstruction quality compared to conventional approaches.

    "abstract": "Understanding cancer cell differentiation is essential for advancing its detection, diagnosis, and treatment. Mathematical models significantly contribute to this by providing a theoretical framework to understand the complex interactions between cancer stem cells, differentiated cancer cells, and immune system components. Such models depend on experimental data and computational simulations to predict tumor dynamics, offering insights into how different cell populations evolve over time. However, to ensure their realistic and consistent outcomes, rigorous mathematical analysis is required, including verification of solution uniqueness, stability, viability, positivity, and boundedness. Such validation guarantees that model's results can be used in both oncological research and clinical applications. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of an integrative mathematical model of cancer cell differentiation, with a particular focus on its interactions with immune cells. The model captures the dynamic balance between cancer stem cell self-renewal, differentiation into mature tumor cells, and immune-mediated elimination. By employing analytical and numerical techniques, we assess the model's feasibility, stability, and long-term behavior under various biological conditions. Our findings demonstrate that immune system engagement can significantly influence tumor composition and growth, highlighting potential therapeutic targets. This work not only advances theoretical cancer modeling but also provides a foundation for future experimental validation and the development of combined differentiation-immunotherapy approaches. The results underscore the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in the fight against cancer.",

To understand the physical factors behind this variation, it is important to investigate how mechanical events are transmitted through the skin. In this study, we visualize the internal skin strains in response to soft brushing stimuli using functional Optical Coherence Tomography (fOCT), which provides depth-resolved time-series data of the displacement of the skin. Driven with custom-made software, the system enabled sub-surface imaging at a refresh rate of 10 kHz. Brushing was applied to the back of the hand, and skin displacement was observed at different depths. The results show that each skin layer responds differently to the stimulus, suggesting that internal skin dynamics play a role in tactile perception. This method offers a way to investigate how mechanical events within the skin relate to sensory function.",

    "abstract": "Computational pathology (CPath) has shown great potential in mining actionable insights from Whole Slide Images (WSIs). Deep Learning (DL) has been at the center of modern CPath, and while it delivers unprecedented performance, it is also known that DL may be affected by irrelevant details, such as those introduced during scanning by different commercially available scanners. This may lead to scanner bias, where the model outputs for the same tissue acquired by different scanners may vary. In turn, it hinders the trust of clinicians in CPath-based tools and their deployment in real-world clinical practices. Recent pathology Foundation Models (FMs) promise to provide better domain generalization capabilities. In this paper, we benchmark FMs using a multi-scanner dataset and show that FMs still suffer from scanner bias. Following this observation, we propose ScanGen, a contrastive loss function applied during task-specific fine-tuning that mitigates scanner bias, thereby enhancing the models' robustness to scanner variations. Our approach is applied to the Multiple Instance Learning task of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutation prediction from H\\&E-stained WSIs in lung cancer. We observe that ScanGen notably enhances the ability to generalize across scanners, while retaining or improving the performance of EGFR mutation prediction.",

    "title": "On growth and morphogenesis in mechanobiology",
    "abstract": "Morphoelasticity represents a foundational theory for tracing back growth, remodelling, and morphogenesis, yet crucial challenges persist. A unified growth law -- independent of a priori assumptions about constitutive relations or specified structures of the growth tensor -- remains in fact elusive, as does an intimate connection between local anisotropic growth, morphogenesis dynamics, diffusion phenomena and mechanics. When anisotropy of growth is not prescribed arbitrarily, current frameworks mainly attribute shape emergence to growth-induced global configurational switches, somehow neglecting the existence of local drivers of spontaneous patterning or distorsions also in stress-free conditions. To overcome these limitations, in this work we propose a theoretical approach that reformulates anisotropic growth, remodeling, and morphogenesis starting from first principles, grounded in mass balance. In particular, by positing mass conservation as the sole dynamic constraint for the growth problem, we generalize the mass balance equation to derive evolution laws for mass distribution and geometric reconfiguration. This reveals how mass transport and associated microstructural evolution of the tissue fabric synergistically guide biological, geometric, and constitutive changes of living matter, with the isochoric component of growth orchestrating local anisotropy and, at the macroscale, even spontaneous shape development. The proposed fully coupled modelling approach integrates chemo-mechanical and biological interactions inherent to living systems, offering a pathway to investigate complex scenarios in growth and morphogenesis, redefining the latter in a Continuum Mechanics framework. It is felt that this strategy could help to take a step forward a unified perspective for biomechanical and mechanobiological problems, bridging scales from local drivers to emergent tissue forms and shapes.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of spatial patterns and organized growth is a hallmark of developing tissues. While symmetry-breaking and scaling laws govern these processes, how cells coordinate spatial patterning with size regulation remains unclear. Here, we combine quantitative imaging, a Turing activator-repressor model with self-organized reactive boundaries, and in vitro models of early mouse development to study mesodermal pattern formation in two-dimensional (2D) gastruloids. We show that colony size dictates symmetry: small colonies (radius approximately 100 micrometers) spontaneously break symmetry, while larger ones remain centro-symmetric, consistent with size-dependent positional information and model predictions. The mesodermal domain area scales robustly with colony size following a power law, independent of cell density, indicating that cells sense and respond to gastruloid size. Time-lapse imaging reveals a biphasic growth law: an early power-law expansion followed by exponential arrest, marking a dynamical phase transition. These dynamics, conserved across sizes, reflect features of criticality seen in physical systems, where self-organization, scaling, and boundary feedback converge. Our findings uncover a minimal mechanism for size-dependent pattern formation and growth control. This framework enables quantitative investigation of symmetry-breaking and scaling in self-organizing tissues, offering insights into the physical principles underlying multicellular organization.",

However, modern biomedical data coming with high dimensions make it challenging to perform the model estimation in traditional cluster analysis. The incorporation of factor analyzer into the mixture model provides a way to characterize the large set of data features, but the current estimation method is computationally impractical for massive data due to the intrinsic slow convergence of the embedded algorithms, and the incapability to vary the size of the factor analyzers, preventing the implementation of a generalized mixture of factor analyzers and further characterization of the data clusters. We propose a hybrid matrix-free computational scheme to efficiently estimate the clusters and model parameters based on a Gaussian mixture along with generalized factor analyzers to summarize the large number of variables using a small set of underlying factors. Our approach outperforms the existing method with faster convergence while maintaining high clustering accuracy. Our algorithms are applied to accurately identify and distinguish types of breast cancer based on large tumor samples, and to provide a generalized characterization for subtypes of lymphoma using massive gene records.",

    "abstract": "Synthetic molecular communication (SMC) is a key enabler for future healthcare systems in which Internet of Bio-Nano-Things (IoBNT) devices facilitate the continuous monitoring of a patient's biochemical signals. To close the loop between sensing and actuation, both the detection and the generation of in-body molecular communication (MC) signals is key. However, generating signals inside the human body, e.g., via synthetic nanodevices, poses a challenge in SMC, due to technological obstacles as well as legal, safety, and ethical issues. Hence, this paper considers an SMC system in which signals are generated indirectly via the modulation of a natural in-body MC system, namely the gut-brain axis (GBA). Therapeutic GBA modulation is already established as treatment for neurological diseases, e.g., drug refractory epilepsy (DRE), and performed via the administration of nutritional supplements or specific diets. However, the molecular signaling pathways that mediate the effect of such treatments are mostly unknown. Consequently, existing treatments are standardized or designed heuristically and able to help only some patients while failing to help others. In this paper, we propose to leverage personal health data, e.g., gathered by in-body IoBNT devices, to design more versatile and robust GBA modulation-based treatments as compared to the existing ones. To show the feasibility of our approach, we define a catalog of theoretical requirements for therapeutic GBA modulation. Then, we propose a machine learning model to verify these requirements for practical scenarios when only limited data on the GBA modulation exists. By evaluating the proposed model on several datasets, we confirm its excellent accuracy in identifying different modulators of the GBA. Finally, we utilize the proposed model to identify specific modulatory pathways that play an important role for therapeutic GBA modulation.",

Providing such an annotated dataset is not only time-consuming but also requires a high level of expertise. This is particularly challenging in wrist bone segmentation in X-rays, due to the interposition of multiple small carpal bones in the image. To overcome the data annotation issue, this work utilizes a large number of simulated X-ray images generated from Computed Tomography (CT) volumes with their corresponding 10 bone labels to train a deep learning-based model for wrist bone segmentation in real X-ray images. The proposed method was evaluated using both simulated images and real images. The method achieved Dice scores ranging from 0.80 to 0.92 for the simulated dataset generated from different view angles. Qualitative analysis of the segmentation results of the real X-ray images also demonstrated the superior performance of the trained model.

To tackle these challenges, we propose a Context Clustering based triple information fusion framework. First, in comparison to CNNs or transformers, we observe that Context clustering methods are (1) more computationally efficient and (2) better at associating structural or pathological features. This makes them particularly well-suited for mammography in clinical settings. Next, we propose a triple information fusion mechanism that integrates global, feature-based local, and patch-based local information. The proposed approach is rigorously evaluated on two public datasets, Vindr-Mammo and CBIS-DDSM, using five independent data splits to ensure statistical robustness. Our method achieves an AUC of 0.828 \\pm 0.020 on Vindr-Mammo and 0.805 \\pm 0.020 on CBIS-DDSM, outperforming the second best method by 3.5% and 2.5%, respectively. These improvements are statistically significant (p<0.05), highlighting the advantages of the Context Clustering Network with triple information fusion. Overall, our Context Clustering framework demonstrates strong potential as a scalable and cost-effective solution for large-scale mammography screening, enabling more efficient and accurate breast cancer detection.

    "title": "Integrated Open-Source Framework for Simulation of Transcatheter Pulmonary Valves in Native Right Ventricular Outflow Tracts",
    "abstract": "Background - Pulmonary insufficiency is a consequence of transannular patch repair in Tetralogy of Fallot (ToF), leading to late morbidity and mortality. Transcatheter native outflow tract pulmonary valve replacement (TPVR) has become common, but assessment of patient candidacy and selection of the optimal device remains challenging. We demonstrate an integrated open-source workflow for simulation of TPVR in image-derived models to inform device selection.   Methods - Machine learning-based segmentation of CT scans was implemented to define the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT). A custom workflow for device positioning and pre-compression was implemented in SlicerHeart. Resulting geometries were exported to FEBio for simulation. Visualization of results and quantification were performed using custom metrics implemented in SlicerHeart and FEBio.   Results - RVOT model creation and device placement could be completed in under 1 minute. Virtual device placement using FE simulations visually mimicked actual device placement and allowed quantification of vessel strain, stress, and contact area. Regions of higher strain and stress were observed at the proximal and distal end locations of the TPVs where the devices impinge the RVOT wall. No other consistent trends were observed across simulations. The observed variability in mechanical metrics across RVOTS, stents, and locations in the RVOT highlights that no single device performs optimally in all anatomies, thereby reinforcing the need for simulation-based patient-specific assessment.   Conclusions - This study demonstrates the feasibility of a novel open-source workflow for the rapid simulation of TPVR which with further refinement may inform assessment of patient candidacy and optimal device selection.",

    "abstract": "Mechanical contributions are crucial regulators of diverse biological processes, yet their \\textit{in vivo} measurement remains challenging due to limitations of current techniques, that can be destructive or require complex dedicated setups. This study introduces a novel method to synthesize biocompatible, self-functionalizing stress sensors based on inverted emulsions, that can be used to probe stresses inside tissues but can also locally perturb the biological environment through specific binder presentation or drug delivery. We engineered an optimal design for these inverted emulsions, focusing on finding the balance between the two contradictory constraints: achieving low surface tension for deformability while maintaining emulsion instability for efficient self-functionalization and drug release. Proof-of-concept experiments in both agarose gels and complex biological systems, including brain organoids and zebrafish embryos, confirm the droplets ability to deform in response to mechanical stress applied within the tissue, to self-functionalize and to release encapsulated molecules locally. These versatile sensors offer a method for non-invasive stress measurements and targeted chemical delivery within living biological tissues, giving the potential to overcome current technical barriers in biophysical studies.",

    "title": "Intestinal villi and crypts density maximizing nutrient absorption",
    "abstract": "The villi and crypts of the gastrointestinal tract increase the effective surface area of the intestinal mucosa, potentially enhancing nutrient absorption. It is commonly assumed that this is their primary function, and that a higher villi density necessarily leads to improved absorption. However, when villi are packed too closely together, diffusion can be hindered, potentially offsetting this benefit. In this work, we investigate the relationship between the density of these structures and the overall efficiency of absorption. In three different simplified geometries, approximating crypts, leaf-like villi, and finger-like villi we calculate analytically the concentration profile and the absorption flux, assuming that there is only diffusion between these structures while the lumen is well mixed. When plotting the absorption flux per unit of gut length as a function of the structures' density, we observe that there is a density maximizing absorption. We study numerically this optimum. It depends weakly on the absorption properties of the given nutrient, so that a geometry optimal for one nutrient is close to optimum for another nutrient. Physiological data from various animal species align with this predicted optimal range and potentially reflect evolutionary selection for efficient nutrient uptake, supporting the model's validity.",

    "abstract": "A significant hallmark of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is fiber disarray, which is associated with various cardiac events such as heart failure. Quantifying fiber disarray remains critical for understanding the disease s complex pathophysiology. This study investigates the role of heterogeneous HCM-induced cellular abnormalities in the development of fiber disarray and their subsequent impact on cardiac pumping function. Fiber disarray is predicted using a stress-based law to reorient myofibers and collagen within a multiscale finite element cardiac modeling framework, MyoFE. Specifically, the model is used to quantify the distinct impacts of heterogeneous distributions of hypercontractility, hypocontractility, and fibrosis on fiber disarray development and examines their effect on functional characteristics of the heart. Our results show that heterogenous cell level abnormalities highly disrupt the normal mechanics of myocardium and lead to significant fiber disarray. The pattern of disarray varies depending on the specific perturbation, offering valuable insights into the progression of HCM. Despite the random distribution of perturbed regions within the cardiac muscle, significantly higher fiber disarray is observed near the epicardium compared to the endocardium across all perturbed left ventricle (LV) models. This regional difference in fiber disarray, irrespective of perturbation severity, aligns with previous DT-MRI studies, highlighting the role of regional myocardial mechanics in the development of fiber disarray. Furthermore, cardiac performance declined in the remodeled LVs, particularly in those with fibrosis and hypocontractility. These findings provide important insights into the structural and functional consequences of HCM and offer a framework for future investigations into therapeutic interventions targeting cardiac remodeling.",

    "abstract": "Recent trials of a neuronal pacemaker have shown that cardiac pumping efficiency increases when respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) is artificially restored in animal models of heart failure. This novel device sheds new light on the functional role of RSA, which has long been debated, by allowing the strength of cardiorespiratory coupling to be artificially varied. Here we show that RSA minimizes the cardiac power dissipated within the cardiovascular network. The cardiorespiratory system is found to exhibit mode-locked synchronized regions within which viscoelastic dissipation is reduced relative to the scenario where cardiorespiratory coupling is absent. We determine the gain in cardiac output as the magnitude of RSA increases. We find that cardiac pumping efficiency improves up and until the cardiac frequency, within each breadth intake, is approximately 1.5 times greater than the cardiac frequency in the expiratory phase, at which point it reaches a plateau. RSA was found to be most effective at low cardiac frequencies, in good agreement with clinical evidence. Simulation of the cardiac power saved under RSA is in good agreement with the 17-20% increase in cardiac output observed in RSA-paced animal models.",

Unlike traditional finite-element methods (FEM), which struggle with high-frequency simulations due to costly linear-system inversions and slower convergence, SEM offers exponential convergence and efficient parallel computation. Using Computed Tomography (CT) scan data, we developed a detailed hexahedral mesh capturing complex anatomical features, such as acoustic fats and jaws. Our simulations of plane and spherical waves confirm SEM's effectiveness for ultrasonic time-domain modeling. This approach opens new avenues for marine biology, contributing to research in echolocation, the impacts of anthropogenic marine noise pollution and the biophysics of hearing and click generation in marine mammals. By overcoming FEM's limitations, SEM provides a powerful scalable tool to test hypotheses about dolphin bioacoustics, with significant implications for conservation and understanding marine mammal auditory systems under increasing environmental challenges.",
