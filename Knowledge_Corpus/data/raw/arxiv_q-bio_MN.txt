Abstract:
Density Functional Theory (DFT) is a widely used computational method for estimating the energy and behavior of molecules. Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) are models trained to approximate DFT-level energies and forces at dramatically lower computational cost. Many modern MLIPs rely on a scalar regression formulation; given information about a molecule, they predict a single energy value and corresponding forces while minimizing absolute error with DFT's calculations. In this work, we explore a multi-class classification formulation that predicts a categorical distribution over energy/force values, providing richer supervision through multiple targets. Most importantly, this approach offers a principled way to quantify model uncertainty.   In particular, our method predicts a histogram of the energy/force distribution, converts scalar targets into histograms, and trains the model using cross-entropy loss. Our results demonstrate that this categorical formulation can achieve absolute error performance comparable to regression baselines. Furthermore, this representation enables the quantification of epistemic uncertainty through the entropy of the predicted distribution, offering a measure of model confidence absent in scalar regression approaches.

Abstract:
Cellular signaling networks represent complex information processing systems that have been modeled via traditional mathematical or statistical approaches. However, these methods often struggle to capture context-dependent signaling, pathway cross-talk, and temporal dynamics across multiple biological scales. Here, we introduce hierarchical molecular language models (HMLMs), a novel architecture that proposes a molecular network-specific large language model (LLM) to use in intracellular communication as a specialized molecular language, which includes molecules as tokens, protein interactions, post-translational modifications, and regulatory events modeled as semantic relationships within an adapted transformer architecture. HMLMs employ graph-structured attention mechanisms to accommodate signaling network topology while integrating information across the molecular, pathway, and cellular scales through hierarchical attention patterns. We demonstrate HMLM superiority using a cardiac fibroblast signaling network comprising over 100 molecular species across functional modules connected by regulatory edges. HMLM achieved a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.058 for temporal signaling predictions, representing 30% improvement over graph neural networks (GNNs: 0.083) and 52% improvement over ordinary differential equation models (ODEs: 0.121), with particular advantages under sparse temporal sampling conditions where HMLM maintained MSE = 0.041 with only 4 time-points. The HMLMs offer a foundation for AI-driven biology and medicine with predictable scaling characteristics suitable for interactive applications. By bridging molecular mechanisms with cellular phenotypes through AI-driven molecular language representation, HMLMs provide a powerful paradigm for systems biology that advances precision medicine applications and therapeutic discovery in the era of AI.

Abstract:
Stochastic reaction networks (SRNs) are a general class of continuous-time Markov jump processes used to model a wide range of systems, including biochemical dynamics in single cells, ecological and epidemiological populations, and queueing or communication networks. Yet analyzing their dynamics remains challenging because these processes are high-dimensional and their transient behavior can vary substantially across different initial molecular or population states. Here we introduce a spectral framework for the stochastic Koopman operator that provides a tractable, low-dimensional representation of SRN dynamics over continuous time, together with computable error estimates. By exploiting the compactness of the Koopman operator, we recover dominant spectral modes directly from simulated or experimental data, enabling efficient prediction of moments, event probabilities, and other summary statistics across all initial states. We further derive continuous-time parameter sensitivities and cross-spectral densities, offering new tools for probing noise structure and frequency-domain behavior. We demonstrate the approach on biologically relevant systems, including synthetic intracellular feedback controllers, stochastic oscillators, and inference of initial-state distributions from high-temporal-resolution flow cytometry. Together, these results establish spectral Koopman analysis as a powerful and general framework for studying stochastic dynamical systems across the biological, ecological, and computational sciences.

Abstract:
This paper analyses of a stochastic model of a chemical reaction network with three types of chemical species ${\cal R}$, ${\cal M}$ and ${\cal U}$ that interact to transform a flow of external resources, the chemical species ${\cal Q}$, to produce a product, the chemical species ${\cal P}_r$. A regulation mechanism involving the sequestration of the chemical species ${\cal R}$ when the flow of resources is too low is investigated. The original motivation of the study is of analyzing the qualitative properties of a key regulation mechanism of gene expression in biological cells, the {\em stringent response}.   A scaling analysis of a Markov process in $\N^5$ representing the state of the chemical reaction network is achieved. It is shown that, depending on the parameters of the model, there are, quite surprisingly, three possible asymptotic regimes. To each of them corresponds a stochastic averaging principle with a fast process expressed in terms of a network of $M/M/\infty$ queues. One of these regimes, the optimal sequestration regime, does not seem to have been identified up to now. Under this regime, the input flow of resources is low but the state of the network is still acceptable in terms of unused macro-molecules, showing the remarkable efficiency of this regulation mechanism. The technical proofs of the main convergence results rely on a combination of coupling arguments, technical estimates of the solutions of SDEs, of sample paths of fast processes in particular, and the stability properties of some dynamical systems in $\R^2$.

Abstract:
Identifying key driver genes governing biological processes such as development and disease progression remains a challenge. While existing methods can reconstruct cellular trajectories or infer static gene regulatory networks (GRNs), they often fail to quantify time-resolved regulatory effects within specific temporal windows. Here, we present Time-varying Network Driver Estimation (TNDE), a computational framework quantifying dynamic gene driver effects from single-cell snapshot data under a linear Markov assumption. TNDE leverages a shared graph attention encoder to preserve the local topological structure of the data. Furthermore, by incorporating partial optimal transport, TNDE accounts for unmatched cells arising from proliferation or apoptosis, thereby enabling trajectory alignment in non-equilibrium processes. Benchmarking on simulated datasets demonstrates that TNDE outperforms existing baseline methods across diverse complex regulatory scenarios. Applied to mouse erythropoiesis data, TNDE identifies stage-specific driver genes, the functional relevance of which is corroborated by biological validation. TNDE offers an effective quantitative tool for dissecting dynamic regulatory mechanisms underlying complex biological processes.

Abstract:
Autocatalysis is an important feature of metabolic networks, contributing crucially to the self-maintenance of organisms. Autocatalytic subsystems of chemical reaction networks (CRNs) are characterized in terms of algebraic conditions on submatrices of the stoichiometric matrix. Here, we derive sufficient conditions for subgraphs supporting irreducible autocatalytic systems in the bipartite König representation of the CRN. On this basis, we develop an efficient algorithm to enumerate autocatalytic subnetworks and, as a special case, autocatalytic cores, i.e., minimal autocatalytic subnetworks, in full-size metabolic networks. The same algorithmic approach can also be used to determine autocatalytic cores only. As a showcase application, we provide a complete analysis of autocatalysis in the core metabolism of E. coli and enumerate irreducible autocatalytic subsystems of limited size in full-fledged metabolic networks of E. coli, human erythrocytes, and Methanosarcina barkeri (Archea). The mathematical and algorithmic results are accompanied by software enabling the routine analysis of autocatalysis in large CRNs.

Abstract:
T cells are central to the adaptive immune response, capable of detecting pathogenic antigens while ignoring healthy tissues with remarkable specificity and sensitivity. Quantitatively understanding how T cell receptors (TCRs) discriminate among antigens requires biophysical models and theoretical analysis of signaling networks. Here, we review current theoretical frameworks of antigen recognition in the context of modern experimental and computational advances. Antigen potency spans a continuum and exhibits nonlinear effects within complex mixtures, challenging discrete classification and simple threshold-based models. This complexity motivates the development of models such as adaptive kinetic proofreading, which integrate both activating and inhibitory signals. Advances in high-throughput technologies now generate large-scale, quantitative datasets, enabling the refinement of such models through statistical and machine learning approaches. This convergence of theory, data, and computation promises deeper insights into immune decision-making and opens new avenues for rational immunotherapy design.

Abstract:
Gene regulatory networks exhibit remarkable stability, maintaining functional phenotypes despite genetic and environmental perturbations. Discrete dynamical models, such as Boolean networks, provide systems biologists with a tractable framework to explore the mathematical underpinnings of this robustness. A key mechanism conferring stability is canalization. This perspective synthesizes historical insights, formal definitions of canalization in discrete dynamical models, quantitative measures of stability, illustrative applications, and emerging challenges at the interface of theory and experiment.

Abstract:
Three-dimensional polynomial dynamical systems (DSs) can display chaos with various properties already in the quadratic case with only one or two quadratic monomials. In particular, one-wing chaos is reported in quadratic DSs with only one quadratic monomial, while two-wing and hidden chaos in quadratic DSs with only two quadratic monomials. However, none of the reported DSs can be realized with chemical reactions. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we investigate chaos in chemical dynamical systems (CDSs) - a subset of polynomial DSs that can model the dynamics of mass-action chemical reaction networks. To this end, we develop a fundamental theory for mapping polynomial DSs into CDSs of the same dimension and with a reduced number of non-linear terms. Applying this theory, we show that, under suitable robustness assumptions, quadratic CDSs, and cubic CDSs with only one cubic, can display a rich set of chaotic solutions already in three dimensions. Furthermore, we construct some relatively simple three-dimensional examples, including a quadratic CDS with one-wing chaos and three quadratics, a cubic CDS with two-wing chaos and one cubic, and a quadratic CDS with hidden chaos and five quadratics.

Abstract:
Infections depend on interactions between pathogen and host proteins, but comprehensively mapping these interactions is challenging and labor intensive. Many biological networks have hierarchical, scale-free structure, so we developed a deep learning framework, ApexPPI, that represents protein networks in hyperbolic Riemannian space to capture these features. Our model integrates multimodal biological data (protein sequences, gene perturbation experiments, and complementary interaction networks) to predict likely interactions between pathogen and host proteins through multi-task hyperbolic graph neural networks. Mapping protein features into hyperbolic space led to much higher accuracy than previous methods in predicting host-pathogen interactions. From tens of millions of possible protein pairs, our model identified thousands of high-confidence interactions, including many involving human G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). We validated dozens of these predicted complexes using AlphaFold 3 structural modeling, supporting the accuracy of our predictions. This comprehensive map of host-pathogen protein interactions provides a resource for discovering new treatments and illustrates how advanced AI can unravel complex biological systems.

Abstract:
Computer algebra methods for analyzing reaction networks often rely on the assumption of mass-action kinetics, which transform the governing ODEs into polynomial systems amenable to techniques such as Gröbner basis computation and related algebraic tools. However, these methods face significant computational complexity, limiting their applicability to relatively small networks involving only a handful of species. In contrast, building on recent theoretical advances, we introduce here \textsc{BiRNe} (BIfurcations in Reaction NEtworks) Python module, which relies on a symbolic approach designed to detect bifurcations in larger reaction networks (up to 10-20 species, depending on the network's connectivity) equipped with parameter-rich kinetics. This class includes enzymatic kinetics such as Michaelis--Menten, ligand-binding kinetics like Hill functions, and generalized mass-action kinetics. For a given network, the current algorithm identifies all minimal autocatalytic subnetworks and fully characterizes the presence of bifurcations associated with zero eigenvalues, thus determining whether the network admits multistationarity. It also detects oscillatory bifurcations arising from positive-feedback structures, capturing a significant class of possible oscillations.

Abstract:
Estimating causal networks from biological data is a critical step in systems biology. When evaluating the inferred network, assessing the networks based on their intervention effects is particularly important for downstream probabilistic reasoning and the identification of potential drug targets. In the context of gene regulatory network inference, biological databases are often used as reference sources. These databases typically describe relationships in a qualitative rather than quantitative manner. However, few evaluation metrics have been developed that take this qualitative nature into account. To address this, we developed a metric, the sign-augmented Structural Intervention Distance (sSID), and a weighted sSID that incorporates the net effects of the intervention. Through simulations and analyses of real transcriptomic datasets, we found that our proposed metrics could identify a different algorithm as optimal compared to conventional metrics, and the network selected by sSID had a superior performance in the classification task of clinical covariates using transcriptomic data. This suggests that sSID can distinguish networks that are structurally correct but functionally incorrect, highlighting its potential as a more biologically meaningful and practical evaluation metric.

Abstract:
Dabas et al. in Science 2025 report that approximately 117 human kinases directly phosphorylate the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (Pol II), proposing an extensive, direct biochemical bridge between signal transduction and transcriptional control. Such a sweeping claim that one-fourth of the human kinome directly targets the CTD represents a profound revision of canonical transcriptional biology. However, the evidence presented relies primarily on in vitro kinase assays using short CTD peptides, sparse in-cell validation, and mechanistically incomplete models of nuclear trafficking, chromatin targeting, structural compatibility, and catalytic specificity. In this extended critique, we demonstrate that the conclusions of this study are not supported by current biochemical, structural, cell biological, or genomic data. We outline severe shortcomings in assay design, lack of quantitative kinetics, incompatibilities with known Pol II structural constraints, unsupported assumptions about nuclear localization, inappropriate extension to "direct-at-gene" mechanisms, absence of global transcriptional effects, failure to align with the essential role of canonical CDKs, and missing transparency in dataset reporting. We conclude that the central claims of the study are premature and contradicted by decades of established transcriptional research. Substantial new evidence is required before revising the mechanistic model of Pol II CTD regulation.

Abstract:
Multistationarity, underlies biochemical switching and cellular decision-making. We study how multistationarity in the sequential n-site phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle is affected when only some species are open, meaning allowed to exchange with the environment (so-called semi-open networks). Working under mass action kinetics, we obtain two complementary structural results for every $n\geq 2$. First, opening any nonempty subset of the substrate species preserves the network's capacity for nondegenerate multistationarity. Second, opening the enzyme species (both kinase and phosphatase), possibly together with any subset of substrates, always destroys multistationarity. The latter result is proved by a general reduction framework combining the detection of absolute concentration robustness (ACR) with projection onto the remaining species; when the projection is monostationary, the full semi-open system is monostationary. We also illustrate the general method on multi-layer cascade variants and discuss biological implications: opening enzymes acts as a robust switch that converts a potentially multistationary phosphorylation module into a monostationary one, while substrate exchange preserves switching capacity and thus the ability to couple cycles to downstream processes.

Abstract:
We examine a biomolecular machine involving a driven, observable process coupled to a hidden process in a kinetically cooperative manner. A stochastic thermodynamics framework is employed to analyze a fluctuation theorem for the first-passage time of the observable process under nonequilibrium steady-state conditions. Based on a generic kinetic model, we demonstrate that, along first-passage trajectories, entropy production remains constant when the changes in stochastic entropy and free energy of the machine are balanced, which corresponds to zero net hidden flux through the initial state manifold. Under this condition, which we define quite generally, this first-passage time fluctuation theorem can be established, with its violation serving as an experimentally detectable signature of hidden detailed balance breaking (which we subsequently characterize). In addition, using an enzymatic model, we show that the violation of our first-passage time fluctuation theorem can be thought of as a consequence of the breakdown of local detailed balance in the steps linking coarse-grained states that correspond to the initial and intermediate state manifolds. In the absence of hidden current, the fluctuation theorem is restored, and a mesoscopic local detailed balance condition can be established, which has implications for the thermodynamic analysis of driven, coarse-grained systems. This work sheds significant light on the unique connections between stochastic thermodynamic quantities and kinetic measurements in complex cooperative networks.

Abstract:
Stochastic reaction networks with mass-action kinetics provide a useful framework for understanding processes -- biochemical and otherwise -- in homogeneous environments. However, cellular reactions are often compartmentalized, either at the cell level or within cells, and hence non-homogeneous. A general framework for compartmentalized chemistry with dynamic compartments was proposed in (Duso and Zechner, PNAS, 2020), and the special case where the compartment dynamics do not depend on their contents was studied mathematically in (Anderson and Howells, Bull. Math. Biol., 2023). In the present paper, we investigate the case in which the rate of fragmentation of a compartment depends on the abundance of some designated species inside that compartment. The main focus of this work is on providing general conditions for (positive) recurrence and non-explosivity of the models. In particular, we demonstrate that the explosivity characterization from (Anderson and Howells, Bull. Math. Biol., 2023) fails in this setting and provide new sufficient conditions for non-explosivity and positive recurrence, under the assumption that the underlying CRN admits a linear Lyapunov function. These results extend the theoretical foundation for modeling content-mediated compartment dynamics, with implications for systems such as cell division and intracellular transport.

Abstract:
In molecular property prediction, the most valuable compounds (e.g., high potency) often occupy sparse regions of the target space. Standard Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) commonly optimize for the average error, underperforming on these uncommon but critical cases, with existing oversampling methods often distorting molecular topology. In this paper, we introduce SPECTRA, a Spectral Target-Aware graph augmentation framework that generates realistic molecular graphs in the spectral domain. SPECTRA (i) reconstructs multi-attribute molecular graphs from SMILES; (ii) aligns molecule pairs via (Fused) Gromov-Wasserstein couplings to obtain node correspondences; (iii) interpolates Laplacian eigenvalues, eigenvectors and node features in a stable share-basis; and (iv) reconstructs edges to synthesize physically plausible intermediates with interpolated targets. A rarity-aware budgeting scheme, derived from a kernel density estimation of labels, concentrates augmentation where data are scarce. Coupled with a spectral GNN using edge-aware Chebyshev convolutions, SPECTRA densifies underrepresented regions without degrading global accuracy. On benchmarks, SPECTRA consistently improves error in relevant target ranges while maintaining competitive overall MAE, and yields interpretable synthetic molecules whose structure reflects the underlying spectral geometry. Our results demonstrate that spectral, geometry-aware augmentation is an effective and efficient strategy for imbalanced molecular property regression.

Abstract:
The design of genome-scale constraint-based metabolic networks has steadily advanced, with an increasing number of successful cases achieving growth-coupled production, in which the biosynthesis of key metabolites is linked to cell growth. However, a major cause of design failures is the inability to find solutions within realistic time limits. Therefore, it is essential to develop methods that achieve a high success rate within the specified computation time. In this study, we propose a framework for ranking the importance of individual genes to accelerate the solution of the original mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problems in the design of constraint-based models. In the proposed method, after pre-assigning values to highly important genes, the MILPs are solved in parallel as a series of mutually exclusive subproblems. It is found that our framework was able to recover most of the successful cases identified by the original approach and achieved a 37% to 186% increase in success rate compared to the original method within the same time limits. Analysis of the MILP solution process revealed that the proposed method reduced the sizes of subproblems and decreased the number of nodes in the branch-and-bound tree. This framework for ranking gene importance can be directly applicable to a range of MILP-based algorithms for the design of constraint-based metabolic networks. The developed scripts are available on https://github.com/MetNetComp/Gene-Ranked-RatGene.

Abstract:
This paper introduces a biomolecular Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) to investigate the design principles of gene regulatory networks. We show that for fundamental gene regulation network, the bio-controller derived from LQR theory precisely recapitulate natural network motifs, such as auto-regulation and incoherent feedforward loops. This emulation arises from a fundamental principle: the LQR cost function mathematically encodes environmental survival demands, which subsequently drives the selection of both network topology and biochemical parameters. Our work thus establishes a theoretical basis for interpreting biological circuit design, directly linking evolutionary pressures to observable regulatory structures.

Abstract:
Biological networks are pivotal in deciphering the complexity and functionality of biological systems. Causal inference, which focuses on determining the directionality and strength of interactions between variables rather than merely relying on correlations, is considered a logical approach for inferring biological networks. Existing methods for causal structure inference typically assume that causal relationships between variables can be represented by directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). However, this assumption is at odds with the reality of widespread feedback loops in biological systems, making these methods unsuitable for direct use in biological network inference. In this study, we propose a new framework named SCALD (Structural CAusal model for Loop Diagram), which employs a nonlinear structure equation model and a stable feedback loop conditional constraint through continuous optimization to infer causal regulatory relationships under feedback loops. We observe that SCALD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in inferring both transcriptional regulatory networks and signaling transduction networks. SCALD has irreplaceable advantages in identifying feedback regulation. Through transcription factor (TF) perturbation data analysis, we further validate the accuracy and sensitivity of SCALD. Additionally, SCALD facilitates the discovery of previously unknown regulatory relationships, which we have subsequently confirmed through ChIP-seq data analysis. Furthermore, by utilizing SCALD, we infer the key driver genes that facilitate the transformation from colon inflammation to cancer by examining the dynamic changes within regulatory networks during the process.

Simplified stochastic models are widely used in the study of frequency-resolved noise propagation in biochemical reaction networks, a common measure being the coherence between random fluctuations in molecule number trajectories. Such models have also found widespread application in the quantification of how information is transmitted in reaction networks via the mutual information (MI) rate. A common assumption is that, under timescale separation, estimates for the coherence and MI rate obtained from simplified (reduced) models closely approximate those in the underlying full models. Here, we challenge that assumption by showing that, while reduced models can faithfully reproduce low-order statistics of molecular counts, they frequently incur substantial discrepancies in the coherence spectrum, especially at intermediate and high frequencies. These errors, in turn, lead to significant inaccuracies in the resulting estimates for the MI rates. We show that the observed discrepancies are due to the interplay between the structure of the underlying reaction networks, the specific model reduction method that is applied, and the asymptotic limits relating the full and the reduced models. We illustrate our results in canonical models of enzyme catalysis and gene expression, highlighting practical implications for quantifying information flow in cells.

Abstract:
This article serves to concisely review the link between gradient flow systems on hypergraphs and information geometry which has been established within the last five years. Gradient flow systems describe a wealth of physical phenomena and provide powerful analytical technquies which are based on the variational energy-dissipation principle. Modern nonequilbrium physics has complemented this classical principle with thermodynamic uncertaintly relations, speed limits, entropy production rate decompositions, and many more. In this article, we formulate these modern principles within the framework of perturbed gradient flow systems on hypergraphs. In particular, we discuss the geometry induced by the Bregman divergence, the physical implications of dual foliations, as well as the corresponding infinitesimal Riemannian geometry for gradient flow systems. Through the geometrical perspective, we are naturally led to new concepts such as moduli spaces for perturbed gradient flow systems and thermodynamical area which is crucial for understanding speed limits. We hope to encourage the readers working in either of the two fields to further expand on and foster the interaction between the two fields.

Abstract:
Canalization is a key organizing principle in complex systems, particularly in gene regulatory networks. It describes how certain input variables exert dominant control over a function's output, thereby imposing hierarchical structure and conferring robustness to perturbations. Degeneracy, in contrast, captures redundancy among input variables and reflects the complete dominance of some variables by others. Both properties influence the stability and dynamics of discrete dynamical systems, yet their combinatorial underpinnings remain incompletely understood. Here, we derive recursive formulas for counting Boolean functions with prescribed numbers of essential variables and given canalizing properties. In particular, we determine the number of non-degenerate canalizing Boolean functions -- that is, functions for which all variables are essential and at least one variable is canalizing. Our approach extends earlier enumeration results on canalizing and nested canalizing functions. It provides a rigorous foundation for quantifying how frequently canalization occurs among random Boolean functions and for assessing its pronounced over-representation in biological network models, where it contributes to both robustness and to the emergence of distinct regulatory roles.

Abstract:
Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) enables structural characterization of biomolecules under near-native conditions. Existing approaches for interpreting the resulting three-dimensional volumes are computationally expensive and have difficulty interpreting density associated with small proteins/complexes. To explore alternate approaches for identifying proteins in cryo-ET data we pursued a Graph Network and topologically invariant approach. Here, we report on a fast algorithm that distinguishes volumes containing protein density from noise by searching for nuances of evolutionarily conversed motifs and the geometrical characteristics of protein structure. GRIP-Tomo 2.0 is a machine-learning pipeline that extracts interpretable topological features of protein structures within noisy experimental backgrounds. Compared to version 1.0, the new pipeline includes three upgrades that significantly improve performance including synthetic tomogram generation simulating realistic noise, graph-based persistent feature extraction as protein fingerprints, and high-performance computing acceleration. GRIP-Tomo 2.0 achieves over 90% accuracy in distinguishing proteins from noise for synthetic datasets and over 80% accuracy for real datasets, which represents a foundational step toward advancing cryo-ET workflows and empowering automated detection of both small and large proteins for visual proteomics.

Abstract:
Computationally predicting protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is challenging due to the lack of integrated, multimodal protein representations. DPEB is a curated collection of 22,043 human proteins that integrates four embedding types: structural (AlphaFold2), transformer-based sequence (BioEmbeddings), contextual amino acid patterns (ESM-2: Evolutionary Scale Modeling), and sequence-based n-gram statistics (ProtVec]). AlphaFold2 protein structures are available through public databases (e.g., AlphaFold2 Protein Structure Database), but the internal neural network embeddings are not. DPEB addresses this gap by providing AlphaFold2-derived embeddings for computational modeling. Our benchmark evaluations show GraphSAGE with BioEmbedding achieved the highest PPI prediction performance (87.37% AUROC, 79.16% accuracy). The framework also achieved 77.42% accuracy for enzyme classification and 86.04% accuracy for protein family classification. DPEB supports multiple graph neural network methods for PPI prediction, enabling applications in systems biology, drug target identification, pathway analysis, and disease mechanism studies.

Abstract:
Multimodal molecular representation learning, which jointly models molecular graphs and their textual descriptions, enhances predictive accuracy and interpretability by enabling more robust and reliable predictions of drug toxicity, bioactivity, and physicochemical properties through the integration of structural and semantic information. However, existing multimodal methods suffer from two key limitations: (1) they typically perform cross-modal interaction only at the final encoder layer, thus overlooking hierarchical semantic dependencies; (2) they lack a unified prototype space for robust alignment between modalities. To address these limitations, we propose ProtoMol, a prototype-guided multimodal framework that enables fine-grained integration and consistent semantic alignment between molecular graphs and textual descriptions. ProtoMol incorporates dual-branch hierarchical encoders, utilizing Graph Neural Networks to process structured molecular graphs and Transformers to encode unstructured texts, resulting in comprehensive layer-wise representations. Then, ProtoMol introduces a layer-wise bidirectional cross-modal attention mechanism that progressively aligns semantic features across layers. Furthermore, a shared prototype space with learnable, class-specific anchors is constructed to guide both modalities toward coherent and discriminative representations. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that ProtoMol consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across a variety of molecular property prediction tasks.

Abstract:
Extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling is central to a wide variety of healthy and diseased tissue processes. Unfortunately, predicting ECM remodeling under various chemical and mechanical conditions has proven to be excessively challenging, due in part to its complex regulation by intracellular and extracellular molecular reaction networks that are spatially and temporally dynamic. We introduce ECMSim, which is a highly interactive, real-time, and web application designed to simulate heterogeneous matrix remodeling. The current model simulates cardiac scar tissue with configurable input conditions using a large-scale model of the cardiac fibroblast signaling network. Cardiac fibrosis is a major component of many forms of heart failure. ECMSim simulates over 1.3 million equations simultaneously in real time that include more than 125 species and more than 200 edges in each cell in a 100*100 spatial array (10,000 cells), which accounts for inputs, receptors, intracellular signaling cascades, ECM production, and feedback loops, as well as molecular diffusion. The algorithm is represented by a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that are coupled with ECM molecular diffusion. The equations are solved on demand using compiled C++ and the WebAssembly standard. The platform includes brush-style cell selection to target a subset of cells with adjustable input molecule concentrations, parameter sliders to adjust parameters on demand, and multiple coupled real-time visualizations of network dynamics at multiple scales. Implementing ECMSim in standard web technologies enables a fully functional application that combines real-time simulation, visual interaction, and model editing. The software enables the investigation of pathological or experimental conditions, hypothetical scenarios, matrix remodeling, or the testing of the effects of an experimental drug(s) with a target receptor.

Comment: 30 pages, 5 figures

Abstract:
Dynamical systems in the life sciences are often composed of complex mixtures of overlapping behavioral regimes. Cellular subpopulations may shift from cycling to equilibrium dynamics or branch towards different developmental fates. The transitions between these regimes can appear noisy and irregular, posing a serious challenge to traditional, flow-based modeling techniques which assume locally smooth dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose MODE (Mixture Of Dynamical Experts), a graphical modeling framework whose neural gating mechanism decomposes complex dynamics into sparse, interpretable components, enabling both the unsupervised discovery of behavioral regimes and accurate long-term forecasting across regime transitions. Crucially, because agents in our framework can jump to different governing laws, MODE is especially tailored to the aforementioned noisy transitions. We evaluate our method on a battery of synthetic and real datasets from computational biology. First, we systematically benchmark MODE on an unsupervised classification task using synthetic dynamical snapshot data, including in noisy, few-sample settings. Next, we show how MODE succeeds on challenging forecasting tasks which simulate key cycling and branching processes in cell biology. Finally, we deploy our method on human, single-cell RNA sequencing data and show that it can not only distinguish proliferation from differentiation dynamics but also predict when cells will commit to their ultimate fate, a key outstanding challenge in computational biology.

Abstract:
DNA strand displacement (SD) reactions are central to the operation of many synthetic nucleic acid systems, including molecular circuits, sensors, and machines. Over the years, a broad set of design frameworks has emerged to accommodate various functional goals, initial configurations, and environmental conditions. Nevertheless, key challenges persist, particularly in reliably predicting reaction kinetics. This review examines recent approaches to SD reaction design, with emphasis on the properties of single reactions, including kinetics, structural factors, and limitations in current modelling practices. We identify promising innovations while analysing the factors that continue to hinder predictive accuracy. We conclude by outlining future directions for achieving more robust and programmable behaviour in DNA-based systems.

Abstract:
State transitions are fundamental in biological systems but challenging to observe directly. Here, we present the first single-cell observation of state transitions in a synthetic bacterial genetic circuit. Using a mother machine, we tracked over 1007 cells for 27 hours. First-passage analysis and dynamical reconstruction reveal that transitions occur outside the small-noise regime, challenging the applicability of classical Kramers' theory. The process lacks a single characteristic rate, questioning the paradigm of transitions between discrete cell states. We observe significant multiplicative noise that distorts the effective potential landscape yet increases transition times. These findings necessitate theoretical frameworks for biological state transitions beyond the small-noise assumption.

Abstract:
Wuchereria bancrofti, the parasitic roundworm responsible for lymphatic filariasis, permanently disables over 36 million people and places 657 million at risk across 39 countries. A major bottleneck for drug discovery is the lack of functional annotation for more than 90 percent of the W. bancrofti dark proteome, leaving many potential targets unidentified. In this work, we present a novel computational pipeline that converts W. bancrofti's unannotated amino acid sequence data into precise four-level Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers and drug candidates. We utilized a DEtection TRansformer to estimate the probability of enzymatic function, fine-tuned a hierarchical nearest neighbor EC predictor on 4,476 labeled parasite proteins, and applied rejection sampling to retain only four-level EC classifications at 100 percent confidence. This pipeline assigned precise EC numbers to 14,772 previously uncharacterized proteins and discovered 543 EC classes not previously known in W. bancrofti. A qualitative triage emphasizing parasite-specific targets, chemical tractability, biochemical importance, and biological plausibility prioritized six enzymes across five separate strategies: anti-Wolbachia cell-wall inhibition, proteolysis blockade, transmission disruption, purinergic immune interference, and cGMP-signaling destabilization. We curated a 43-compound library from ChEMBL and BindingDB and co-folded across multiple protein conformers with Boltz-2. All six targets exhibited at least moderately strong predicted binding affinities below 1 micromolar, with moenomycin analogs against peptidoglycan glycosyltransferase and NTPase inhibitors showing promising nanomolar hits and well-defined binding pockets. While experimental validation remains essential, our results provide the first large-scale functional map of the W. bancrofti dark proteome and accelerate early-stage drug development for the species.

Abstract:
We study a stochastic model of a copolymerization process that has been extensively investigated in the physics literature. The main questions of interest include: (i) what are the criteria for transience, null recurrence, and positive recurrence in terms of the system parameters; (ii) in the transient regime, what are the limiting fractions of the different monomer types; and (iii) in the transient regime, what is the speed of growth of the polymer? Previous studies in the physics literature have addressed these questions using heuristic methods. Here, we utilize rigorous mathematical arguments to derive the results from the physics literature. Moreover, the techniques developed allow us to generalize to the copolymerization process with finitely many monomer types. We expect that the mathematical methods used and developed in this work will also enable the study of even more complex models in the future.

Abstract:
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is highly heterogeneous, with five-year survival rates dropping from $\sim$90% in localized disease to $\sim$15% with distant metastases. Disease progression is shaped not only by tumor-intrinsic alterations but also by the reorganization of the tumor microenvironment (TME). Metabolic, compositional, and spatial changes contribute to this progression, but considered individually they lack context and often fail as therapeutic targets. Understanding their coordination could reveal processes to alter the disease course. Here, we combined multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI) with machine learning to profile metabolic, functional and spatial states of 522 colorectal lesions with single-cell resolution. We observed recurrent stage-specific remodeling marked by a lymphoid-to-myeloid shift, stromal-cancer cooperation, and malignant metabolic shifts. Spatial organization of epithelial, stromal, and immune compartments provided stronger stratification of disease stage than tumor-intrinsic changes or bulk immune infiltration alone. To systematically model these coordinated changes, we condensed multimodal features into 10 latent factors of TME organization. These factors tracked disease progression, were conserved across cohorts, and revealed frequent multicellular metabolic niches and distinct, non-exclusive TME trajectories. Our framework MuVIcell exposes the elements that together drive CRC progression by grouping co-occurring changes across cell types and feature classes into coordinated multicellular programs. This creates a rational basis to therapeutically target TME reorganization. Importantly, the framework is scalable and flexible, offering a resource for studying multicellular organization in other solid tumors.

Abstract:
Due to the ever-rising global incidence rate of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and the lack of effective clinical treatment drugs, elucidating the detailed pathogenesis, seeking novel targets, and developing promising drugs are the top priority for IBD treatment. Here, we demonstrate that the levels of microRNA (miR)-103a were significantly downregulated in the inflamed mucosa of ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, along with elevated inflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta/TNF-alpha) and reduced tight junction protein (Occludin/ZO-1) levels, as compared with healthy control objects. Consistently, miR-103a deficient intestinal epithelial cells Caco-2 showed serious inflammatory responses and increased permeability, and DSS induced more severe colitis in miR-103a-/- mice than wild-type ones. Mechanistic studies unraveled that c-FOS suppressed miR-103a transcription via binding to its promoter, then miR-103a-targeted NF-kappaB activation contributes to inflammatory responses and barrier disruption by targeting TAB2 and TAK1. Notably, the traditional Chinese medicine Cornus officinalis (CO) and its core active ingredient loganin potently mitigated inflammation and barrier disruption in UC by specifically blocking the EGFR/RAS/ERK/c-FOS signaling axis, these effects mainly attributed to modulated miR-103a levels as the therapeutic activities of them were almost completely shielded in miR-103a KO mice. Taken together, this work reveals that loganin relieves EGFR/c-FOS axis-suppressed epithelial miR-103a expression, thereby inhibiting NF-kappaB pathway activation, suppressing inflammatory responses, and preserving tight junction integrity in UC. Thus, our data enrich mechanistic insights and promising targets for UC treatment.

Abstract:
Dynamical systems with polynomial right-hand sides are very important in various applications, e.g., in biochemistry and population dynamics. The mathematical study of these dynamical systems is challenging due to the possibility of multistability, oscillations, and chaotic dynamics. One important tool for this study is the concept of reaction systems, which are dynamical systems generated by reaction networks for some choices of parameter values. Among these, disguised toric systems are remarkably stable: they have a unique attracting fixed point, and cannot give rise to oscillations or chaotic dynamics. The computation of the set of parameter values for which a network gives rise to disguised toric systems (i.e., the disguised toric locus of the network) is an important but difficult task. We introduce new ideas based on network fluxes for studying the disguised toric locus. We prove that the disguised toric locus of any network $G$ is a contractible manifold with boundary, and introduce an associated graph $G^{\max}$ that characterizes its interior. These theoretical tools allow us, for the first time, to compute the full disguised toric locus for many networks of interest.

Abstract:
The transcriptional response to genetic perturbation reveals fundamental insights into complex cellular systems. While current approaches have made progress in predicting genetic perturbation responses, they provide limited biological understanding and cannot systematically refine existing knowledge. Overcoming these limitations requires an end-to-end integration of data-driven learning and existing knowledge. However, this integration is challenging due to inconsistencies between data and knowledge bases, such as noise, misannotation, and incompleteness. To address this challenge, we propose ALIGNED (Adaptive aLignment for Inconsistent Genetic kNowledgE and Data), a neuro-symbolic framework based on the Abductive Learning (ABL) paradigm. This end-to-end framework aligns neural and symbolic components and performs systematic knowledge refinement. We introduce a balanced consistency metric to evaluate the predictions' consistency against both data and knowledge. Our results show that ALIGNED outperforms state-of-the-art methods by achieving the highest balanced consistency, while also re-discovering biologically meaningful knowledge. Our work advances beyond existing methods to enable both the transparency and the evolution of mechanistic biological understanding.

Abstract:
Single-cell and single-nucleus RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq /snRNA-seq) are widely used to reveal heterogeneity in cells, showing a growing potential for precision and personalized medicine. Nonetheless, sustainable drug discovery must be based on a population-level understanding of molecular mechanisms, which calls for the population-scale analysis of scRNA-seq/snRNA-seq data. This work introduces a sequential target-drug selection model for drug repurposing against Alzheimer's Disease (AD) targets inferred from population-level snRNA-seq studies of AD progression in microglia cells as well as different cell types taken from an AD affected brain vascular tissue atlas, involving hundreds of thousands of nuclei from multi-patient and multi-regional studies. We utilize Persistent Sheaf Laplacians (PSL) to facilitate a Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) analysis of AD targets inferred from differential gene expression (DEG), and then use machine learning models to predict repurpose-able DrugBank compounds for molecular targeting. We screen the efficacy of different DrugBank small compounds and further examine their central nervous system (CNS)-relevant ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity), resulting in a list of lead candidates for AD treatment. The list of significant genes establishes a target domain for effective machine learning based AD drug repurposing analysis of DrugBank small compounds to treat AD related molecular targets.

Abstract:
Control of transcription presides over a vast array of biological processes including through gene regulatory circuits that exhibit multistability. Two- and three-gene network motifs are often found to be critical parts of the repertoire of metabolic and developmental pathways. Theoretical models of these circuits, however, typically vary parameters such as dissociation constants, transcription rates, and degradation rates without specifying precisely how these parameters are controlled biologically. In this paper, we examine the role of effector molecules, which can alter the concentrations of the active transcription factors that control regulation, and are ubiquitous to regulatory processes across biological settings. We specifically consider allosteric regulation in the context of extending the standard bistable switch to three-gene networks, and explore the rich multistable dynamics exhibited in these architectures as a function of effector concentrations. We then study how the conditions required for tristability and more complex dynamics, and the bifurcations in dynamic phase space upon tuning effector concentrations, evolve under various interpretations of regulatory circuit mechanics, the underlying activity of inducers, and perturbations thereof. Notably, the biological mechanism by which we model effector control over dual-function proteins transforms not only the phenotypic trend of dynamic tuning but also the set of available dynamic regimes. In this way, we determine key parameters and regulatory features that drive phenotypic decisions, and offer an experimentally tunable structure for encoding inducible multistable behavior arising from both single and dual-function allosteric transcription factors.

Abstract:
Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong ability in generating rich representations across domains such as natural language processing and generation, computer vision, and multimodal learning. However, their application in biomedical data analysis remains nascent. Single-cell transcriptomic profiling is essential for dissecting cell subtype diversity in development and disease, but rare subtypes pose challenges for scaling laws. We present a computational framework that integrates single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) with LLMs to derive knowledge-informed gene embeddings. Highly expressed genes for each cell are mapped to NCBI Gene descriptions and embedded using models such as text-embedding-ada-002, BioBERT, and SciBERT. Applied to retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), which differ in vulnerability to glaucoma-related neurodegeneration, this strategy improves subtype classification, highlights biologically significant features, and reveals pathways underlying selective neuronal vulnerability. More broadly, it illustrates how LLM-derived embeddings can augment biological analysis under data-limited conditions and lay the groundwork for future foundation models in single-cell biology.

Abstract:
Accurate prediction of drug-target binding affinity can accelerate drug discovery by prioritizing promising compounds before costly wet-lab screening. While deep learning has advanced this task, most models fuse ligand and protein representations via simple concatenation and lack explicit geometric regularization, resulting in poor generalization across chemical space and time. We introduce FIRM-DTI, a lightweight framework that conditions molecular embeddings on protein embeddings through a feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM) layer and enforces metric structure with a triplet loss. An RBF regression head operating on embedding distances yields smooth, interpretable affinity predictions. Despite its modest size, FIRM-DTI achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Therapeutics Data Commons DTI-DG benchmark, as demonstrated by an extensive ablation study and out-of-domain evaluation. Our results underscore the value of conditioning and metric learning for robust drug-target affinity prediction.

Abstract:
Understanding the function of network motifs in an attempt to gain insight into how their combinations create larger reaction networks that drive cellular functions, has been a longstanding pursuit of systems biology. One specific objective within this pursuit is understanding how individual motifs respond to pulsatile and oscillatory signals. This is especially relevant because biochemical networks are often activated by signals that, in nature, occur in the form of pulses and oscillations. A powerful analytical tool for studying such dynamics is the transfer function: a compact frequency-domain description of input-output dynamics. In this work, we derive transfer functions for a set of commonly studied network motifs and characterise their responses to pulsatile and oscillatory inputs. The novelty of this review does not lie in the introduction of new mathematical theorems or biological discoveries, but in bridging well-established frequency domain formalisms from control theory with the analysis of biochemical networks under periodic forcing. In doing so, our contributions are threefold: 1. A systematic derivation and compilation of transfer functions for common network motifs: consolidating results scattered across the literature and establishing a consistent formalism for motif-level transfer functions. 2. Contextualisation of these transfer functions within biological models: extending abstract transfer functions to concrete biological settings so that the results are readily applicable without extensive mathematical labour. 3. Resolution of ambiguity between biological and control-theoretic treatments of feedback: clarifying how feedback loops should be understood within the transfer function formalism and reconciling differences between biology literature and control-oriented literature. This is done by formalising the notion of an intrinsic transfer function.

Abstract:
Advances in genomic medicine accelerate the identi cation of mutations in disease-associated genes, but the pathogenicity of many mutations remains unknown, hindering their use in diagnostics and clinical decision-making. Predictive AI models are generated to combat this issue, but current tools display low accuracy when tested against functionally validated datasets. We show that integrating detailed conformational data extracted from molecular dynamics simulations (MDS) into advanced AI-based models increases their predictive power. We carry out an exhaustive mutational analysis of the disease gene PMM2 and subject structural models of each variant to MDS. AI models trained on this dataset outperform existing tools when predicting the known pathogenicity of mutations. Our best performing model, a neuronal networks model, also predicts the pathogenicity of several PMM2 mutations currently considered of unknown signi cance. We believe this model helps alleviate the burden of unknown variants in genomic medicine.

Abstract:
The ongoing opioid crisis highlights the urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies that can be rapidly deployed. This study presents a novel approach to identify potential repurposable drugs for the treatment of opioid addiction, aiming to bridge the gap between transcriptomic data analysis and drug discovery. Speciffcally, we perform a meta-analysis of seven transcriptomic datasets related to opioid addiction by differential gene expression (DGE) analysis, and propose a novel multiscale topological differentiation to identify key genes from a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network derived from DEGs. This method uses persistent Laplacians to accurately single out important nodes within the PPI network through a multiscale manner to ensure high reliability. Subsequent functional validation by pathway enrichment and rigorous data curation yield 1,865 high-conffdence targets implicated in opioid addiction, which are cross-referenced with DrugBank to compile a repurposing candidate list. To evaluate drug-target interactions, we construct predictive models utilizing two natural language processing-derived molecular embeddings and a conventional molecular ffngerprint. Based on these models, we prioritize compounds with favorable binding afffnity proffles, and select candidates that are further assessed through molecular docking simulations to elucidate their receptor-level interactions. Additionally, pharmacokinetic and toxicological evaluations are performed via ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity) proffling, providing a multidimensional assessment of druggability and safety. This study offers a generalizable approach for drug repurposing in other complex diseases beyond opioid addiction.

Abstract:
In this study, we introduce a sensitivity analysis methodology for stochastic systems in chemistry, where dynamics are often governed by random processes. Our approach is based on gradient estimation via finite differences, averaging simulation outcomes, and analyzing variability under intrinsic noise. We characterize gradient uncertainty as an angular range within which all plausible gradient directions are expected to lie. This uncertainty measure adaptively guides the number of simulations performed for each nominal-perturbation pair of points in order to minimize unnecessary computations while maintaining robustness.   Systematically exploring a range of parameter values across the parameter space, rather than focusing on a single value, allows us to identify not only sensitive parameters but also regions of parameter space associated with different levels of sensitivity. These results are visualized through vector field plots to offer an intuitive representation of local sensitivity across parameter space. Additionally, global sensitivity coefficients are computed to capture overall trends.   Flexibility regarding the choice of output observable measures is another key feature of our method: while traditional sensitivity analyses often focus on species concentrations, our framework allows for the definition of a large range of problem-specific observables. This makes it broadly applicable in diverse chemical and biochemical scenarios. We demonstrate our approach on two systems: classical Michaelis-Menten kinetics and a rule-based model of the formose reaction, using the cheminformatics software MØD for Gillespie-based stochastic simulations.

Abstract:
The ability to detect whether a species (or dimension) is zero in Chemical Reaction Networks (CRN), Vector Addition Systems, or Petri Nets is known to increase the power of these models -- making them capable of universal computation. While this ability may appear in many forms, such as extending the models to allow transitions to be inhibited, prioritized, or synchronized, we present an extension that directly performs this zero checking. We introduce a new void genesis CRN variant with a simple design that merely increments the count of a specific species when any other species' count goes to zero. As with previous extensions, we show that the model is Turing Universal. We then analyze several other studied CRN variants and show that they are all equivalent through a polynomial simulation with the void genesis model, which does not merely follow from Turing-universality. Thus, inhibitor species, reactions that occur at different rates, being allowed to run reactions in parallel, or even being allowed to continually add more volume to the CRN, does not add additional simulation power beyond simply detecting if a species count becomes zero.

Abstract:
The Gillespie algorithm and its extensions are commonly used for the simulation of chemical reaction networks. A limitation of these algorithms is that they have to process and update the system after every reaction, requiring significant computation. Another class of algorithms, based on the tau-leaping method, is able to simulate multiple reactions at a time at the cost of decreased accuracy. We present a new algorithm for the exact simulation of chemical reaction networks that is capable of sampling multiple reactions at a time via a first-order approximation similarly to the tau-leaping methods. We prove that the algorithm has an improved runtime complexity compared to existing methods for the exact simulation of chemical reaction networks, and present an efficient and easy to use implementation that outperforms existing methods in practice.

Abstract:
Antiterminators are essential components of bacterial transcriptional regulation, allowing the control of gene expression in response to fluctuating environmental conditions. Among them, RNA-binding antiterminator proteins play a major role in preventing transcription termination by binding to specific RNA sequences. These RNA-binding antiterminators have been extensively studied for their role in regulating various metabolic pathways. However, their function in modulating the physiology of pathogens requires further investigation. This review focuses on RNA-binding proteins displaying CAT (Co-AntiTerminator) or ANTAR (AmiR and NasR Transcription Antitermination Regulators) domains reported in model bacteria. In particular, their structures, mechanism of action, and target genes will be described. The involvement of the antitermination mechanisms in bacterial pathogenicity is also discussed. This knowledge is crucial for understanding the regulatory mechanisms that control bacterial virulence, and opens up exciting prospects for future research, and potentially new alternative strategies to combat infectious diseases.

Abstract:
Dynamic Flux Balance Analysis (dFBA) extends the capabilities of FBA to track changes in metabolite concentrations and fluxes over time in response to environmental conditions and cellular processes. The key idea of the method called dynamic parallel FBA (dpFBA) is to assign each species to a separate compartment, and to perform dFBA on the individual compartments while keeping track of the shared pool of external metabolites at each time interval. The software package COBRApy for Constraint-Based Modelling currently offers only an out-of-the-box dFBA implementation for the simulation of the batch growth of a single species over an interval divided in $n$ time steps. Here we describe a simple method to extend COBRApy dFBA to a community of species, by implementing dpFBA without any modification of the current package.

Abstract:
The dynamics of gene regulatory networks is governed by the interaction between deterministic biochemical reactions and molecular noise. To understand how gene regulatory networks process information during cell state transitions, we study stochastic dynamics derived from a Boolean network model via its representation on the parameter space of Gaussian distributions, equipped with the Fisher information metric. This reformulation reveals that the trajectories of optimal information transfer are gradient flows of the Kullback-Leibler divergence. We demonstrate that the most efficient dynamics require isotropic decay rates across all nodes and that the noise intensity quantitatively determines the potential differentiation between the initial and final states. Furthermore, we show that paths minimizing biological cost correspond to metric geodesics that require noise suppression, leading to biologically irrelevant deterministic dynamics. Our approach frames noise and decay rates as fundamental control parameters for cellular differentiation, providing a geometric principle for the analysis and design of synthetic networks.

Abstract:
Deciphering complex gene-gene interactions remains challenging in transcriptomics as traditional methods often miss higher-order and nonlinear dependencies. This study introduces a quantum-inspired framework leveraging tensor networks (TNs) to optimally map expression data into a lower dimensional representation preserving biological locality. Using Quantum Mutual Information (QMI), a nonparametric measure natural for tensor networks, we quantify gene dependencies and establish statistical significance via permutation testing. This constructs robust interaction networks where the edges reflect biologically meaningful relationships that are resilient to random chance. The approach effectively distinguishes true regulatory patterns from experimental noise and biological stochasticity. To test the proposed method, we recover a gene regulatory network consisted of six pathway genes from single-cell RNA sequencing data comprising over $28.000$ lymphoblastoid cells. Furthermore, we unveil several triadic regulatory mechanisms. By merging quantum physics inspired techniques with computational biology, our method provides novel insights into gene regulation, with applications in disease mechanisms and precision medicine.

Abstract:
Competitive inhibitors can, paradoxically, stimulate an enzymatic reaction at low to moderate doses. Competitive inhibition of an enzyme occurs when an inhibitor binds to the enzyme's binding site and blocks the enzyme's target molecule from binding. We recently proposed a detailed but straightforward mass action model for competitive inhibition of phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1) by Terazosin (TZ). The full PGK1 model has two substrates and two products which can be bound and released in either order, known as a random bi-bi mechanism. This model, with no further modification, predicts an increased reaction rate at low or moderate TZ doses, suggesting that stimulation is an intrinsic feature of competitive inhibition in enzymes with two products. This mechanism can aid in the development of novel therapies, particularly since enzyme activators are more rare and difficult to design than inhibitors. Here we propose a three-timescale reduction of that detailed model and show that the resulting rate equation retains three essential attributes of competitive inhibitor stimulation. These attributes are the biphasic dose response, the dependence on the relative rates of product dissociation from the binary and ternary complexes, and the parameter region where stimulation is possible. The resulting rate equation is a rational function which is a Monod function of each substrate, but quadratic in the denominator as a function of inhibitor dose.

Abstract:
Biomolecular Neural Networks (BNNs), artificial neural networks with biologically synthesizable architectures, achieve universal function approximation capabilities beyond simple biological circuits. However, training BNNs remains challenging due to the lack of target data. To address this, we propose leveraging Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specifications to define training objectives for BNNs. We build on the quantitative semantics of STL, enabling gradient-based optimization of the BNN weights, and introduce a learning algorithm that enables BNNs to perform regression and control tasks in biological systems. Specifically, we investigate two regression problems in which we train BNNs to act as reporters of dysregulated states, and a feedback control problem in which we train the BNN in closed-loop with a chronic disease model, learning to reduce inflammation while avoiding adverse responses to external infections. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that STL-based learning can solve the investigated regression and control tasks efficiently.

Abstract:
In previous works, we introduced the notion of dominant vertices. This is a set of nodes in the underlying network whose evolution determines the whole network's dynamics after a transient time. In this paper, we focus on the case of Boolean networks. We define a reduced graph on the dominant vertices and an induced automata network on this graph, which we prove is asymptotically equivalent to the original Boolean dynamics. Asymptotic conjugacy ensures that the systems, restricted to their respective attractors, are dynamically equivalent. For a significant class of networks, the induced automata network is indeed a reduction of the original system. In these cases, the reduction, which is obtained from the structure of dominant vertices, supplies a more tractable system with the same structure of attractors as the original one. Furthermore, the structure of the induced system allows us to establish bounds on the number and period of the attractors, as well as on the reduction of the basin's sizes and transient lengths. We illustrate this reduction by considering a class of networks, which we call clover networks, whose dominant set is a singleton. To get insight into the structure of the basins of attraction of Boolean networks with a single dominant vertex, we complement this work with a numerical exploration of the behavior of a parametrized ensemble of systems of this kind.

Abstract:
Despite the thousands of genes implicated in age-related phenotypes, effective interventions for aging remain elusive, a lack of advance rooted in the multifactorial nature of longevity and the functional interconnectedness of the molecular components implicated in aging. Here, we introduce a network medicine framework that integrates 2,358 longevity-associated genes onto the human interactome to identify existing drugs that can modulate aging processes. We find that genes associated with each hallmark of aging form a connected subgraph, or hallmark module, a discovery enabling us to measure the proximity of 6,442 clinically approved or experimental compounds to each hallmark. We then introduce a transcription-based metric, $pAGE$, which evaluates whether the drug-induced expression shifts reinforce or counteract known age-related expression changes. By integrating network proximity and $pAGE$, we identify multiple drug repurposing candidate that not only target specific hallmarks but act to reverse their aging-associated transcriptional changes. Our findings are interpretable, revealing for each drug the molecular mechanisms through which it modulates the hallmark, offering an experimentally falsifiable framework to leverage genomic discoveries to accelerate drug repurposing for longevity.

Comment: 6 pages, 1 figure

Abstract:
Boolean networks are a powerful and popular modeling framework in systems biology, enabling the study of complex processes underlying gene regulation, signal transduction, and cellular decision-making. Most biological networks exhibit a high degree of canalization, a property of the Boolean update rules that stabilizes network dynamics. Despite its importance, existing software packages provide hardly any support for generating Boolean networks with defined canalization properties.   We present BoolForge, a Python toolbox for the analysis and random generation of Boolean functions and networks, with a particular focus on canalization. BoolForge allows users to (i) generate random Boolean functions with specified canalizing depth, layer structure, or other structural constraints; (ii) construct random Boolean networks with tunable topological and functional properties; and (iii) compute structural and dynamical features including network attractors, robustness, and modularity. BoolForge enables researchers to rapidly prototype biological Boolean network models, explore the relationship between structure and dynamics, and generate ensembles of networks for statistical analysis. It is lightweight, adaptable, and fully compatible with existing Boolean network analysis tools.   BoolForge is implemented in Python (version3.8+), with no platform-specific dependencies. The software is distributed under the MIT License and will be maintained for at least two years following publication. Source code, documentation, and tutorial notebooks are freely available at: https://github.com/ckadelka/BoolForge.

Abstract:
The MØD computational framework implements rule-based generative chemistries as explicit transformations of graphs representing chemical structural formulae. Here, we expand MØD by a stochastic simulation module that simulates the time evolution of species concentrations using Gillespie's well-known stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA). This module distinguishes itself among competing implementations of rule-based stochastic simulation engines by its flexible network expansion mechanism and its functionality for defining custom reaction rate functions. It enables direct sampling from actual reactions instead of rules. We present methodology and implementation details followed by examples which demonstrate the capabilities of the stochastic simulation engine.

Abstract:
Understanding the modular structure and central elements of complex biological networks is critical for uncovering system-level mechanisms in disease. Here, we constructed weighted gene co-expression networks from bulk RNA-seq data of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovial tissue, using pairwise correlation and a percolation-guided thresholding strategy. Community detection with Louvain and Leiden algorithms revealed robust modules, and node-strength ranking identified the top 50 hub genes globally and within communities. To assess novelty, we integrated genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with literature-based evidence from PubMed, highlighting five high-centrality genes with little to no prior RA-specific association. Functional enrichment confirmed their roles in immune-related processes, including adaptive immune response and lymphocyte regulation. Notably, these hubs showed strong positive correlations with T- and B-cell markers and negative correlations with NK-cell markers, consistent with RA immunopathology. Overall, our framework demonstrates how correlation-based network construction, modularity-driven clustering, and centrality-guided novelty scoring can jointly reveal informative structure in omics-scale data. This generalizable approach offers a scalable path to gene prioritization in RA and other autoimmune conditions.

Abstract:
Biological pathways map gene-gene interactions that govern all human processes. Despite their importance, most ML models treat genes as unstructured tokens, discarding known pathway structure. The latest pathway-informed models capture pathway-pathway interactions, but still treat each pathway as a "bag of genes" via MLPs, discarding its topology and gene-gene interactions. We propose a Graph Attention Network (GAT) framework that models pathways at the gene level. We show that GATs generalize much better than MLPs, achieving an 81% reduction in MSE when predicting pathway dynamics under unseen treatment conditions. We further validate the correctness of our biological prior by encoding drug mechanisms via edge interventions, boosting model robustness. Finally, we show that our GAT model is able to correctly rediscover all five gene-gene interactions in the canonical TP53-MDM2-MDM4 feedback loop from raw time-series mRNA data, demonstrating potential to generate novel biological hypotheses directly from experimental data.

Microbiomes are a vital part of the human body, engaging in tasks like food digestion and immune defense. Their structure and function must be understood in order to promote host health and facilitate swift recovery during disease. Due to the difficulties in experimentally studying these systems in situ, more research is being conducted in the field of mathematical modeling. Visualizing spatiotemporal data is challenging, and current tools that simulate microbial communities' spatial and temporal development often only provide limited functionalities, often requiring expert knowledge to generate useful results. To overcome these limitations, we provide a user-friendly tool to interactively explore spatiotemporal simulation data, called MicroLabVR, which transfers spatial data into virtual reality (VR) while following guidelines to enhance user experience (UX). With MicroLabVR, users can import CSV datasets containing population growth, substance concentration development, and metabolic flux distribution data. The implemented visualization methods allow users to evaluate the dataset in a VR environment interactively. MicroLabVR aims to improve data analysis for the user by allowing the exploration of microbiome data in their spatial context.

Abstract:
Efficient information processing is crucial for both living organisms and engineered systems. The mutual information rate, a core concept of information theory, quantifies the amount of information shared between the trajectories of input and output signals, and enables the quantification of information flow in dynamic systems. A common approach for estimating the mutual information rate is the Gaussian approximation which assumes that the input and output trajectories follow Gaussian statistics. However, this method is limited to linear systems, and its accuracy in nonlinear or discrete systems remains unclear. In this work, we assess the accuracy of the Gaussian approximation for non-Gaussian systems by leveraging Path Weight Sampling (PWS), a recent technique for exactly computing the mutual information rate. In two case studies, we examine the limitations of the Gaussian approximation. First, we focus on discrete linear systems and demonstrate that, even when the system's statistics are nearly Gaussian, the Gaussian approximation fails to accurately estimate the mutual information rate. Second, we explore a continuous diffusive system with a nonlinear transfer function, revealing significant deviations between the Gaussian approximation and the exact mutual information rate as nonlinearity increases. Our results provide a quantitative evaluation of the Gaussian approximation's performance across different stochastic models and highlight when more computationally intensive methods, such as PWS, are necessary.

Abstract:
Determining mechanistic models of gene regulation, especially underlying phenotypic variation, is a central goal of both mathematical biology and modern evolutionary biology. However, several challenges, involving both common characteristics of experimental data and the model development process, remain that limit the discovery of general principles. Even the highest-quality experimental data come with challenges. There are always sources of noise, a limit to how often we can measure the system in time, and it is impossible to measure all the relevant states that participate in the full underlying complexity. Additionally, there are usually sources of uncertainty in the underlying biological mechanisms, which give rise to multiple competing model structures. We walk through a case study involving inference of a regulatory network structure involved in a developmental decision in the nematode, \textit{Pristonchus pacificus}. In this study, we fit 13,824 distinct regulatory network models to gene expression data from three experimental conditions to determine which regulatory features are supported by the data. We discover \textit{model sets}, or collections of models with shared regulatory network features that best fit the data, for each of the three experiments we considered, and identify a regulatory network in the intersection of the three model sets. This model describes the data across the experimental conditions and exhibits a high degree of positive regulation and interconnectivity between the key regulators, \textit{eud-1}, \textit{sult-1}, and \textit{nhr-40}. While the biological results are specific to the molecular biology of development in \textit{Pristonchus pacificus}, the comparative modeling framework introduced here can be applied to other systems of gene regulation in an evolutionary developmental context.

Abstract:
We propose a direct optimization framework for learning reduced and sparse chemical reaction networks (CRNs) from time-series trajectory data. In contrast to widely used indirect methods-such as those based on sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy)-which infer reaction dynamics by fitting numerically estimated derivatives, our approach fits entire trajectories by solving a dynamically constrained optimization problem. This formulation enables the construction of reduced CRNs that are both low-dimensional and sparse, while preserving key dynamical behaviors of the original system. We develop an accelerated proximal gradient algorithm to efficiently solve the resulting non-convex optimization problem. Through illustrative examples, including a Drosophila circadian oscillator and a glycolytic oscillator, we demonstrate the ability of our method to recover accurate and interpretable reduced-order CRNs. Notably, the direct approach avoids the derivative estimation step and mitigates error accumulation issues inherent in indirect methods, making it a robust alternative for data-driven CRN realizations.

Abstract:
Cancer research has traditionally focused on identifying driver genes, those with mutations that initiate tumorigenesis. The Cancer Driver Gene (CDG) paradigm, further supported by the observation of oncogene addiction in tumors, has successfully guided the development of targeted therapies. However, the limitations of this driver-centric view, highlighted by the broad emergence of frequent therapeutic resistance, the presence of driver mutations in healthy tissues or individuals, and the lack of identifiable drivers in many tumors, call for a shift in perspective and clinical practice. The latest network controllability perspective on cancer cells introduced the concept of Cancer Keeper Genes (CKGs) and a CKG-based paradigm for cancer therapeutics. The new concept encompasses the concept of non-oncogene addiction, emphasizing reliance on non-mutated pathways crucial for maintaining oncogenic cellular states. Here, we explore the transition towards a system-level understanding of cancer based on the CKG paradigm, emphasizing the essential role of genes required for tumor maintenance, irrespective of their initiating function or mutational capacity. We discuss clinical implications of this paradigm shift, highlighting the progress made so far and potential of targeting non-driver CKGs, genes involved in processes like DNA damage response, proteostasis, and metabolism, as a promising strategy to overcome therapeutic challenges and achieve more durable cancer control. Targeting these maintenance vulnerabilities represents a critical evolution in precision oncology, moving towards therapies designed to dismantle the networks sustaining malignancies.

Abstract:
Oscillatory chemical reactions are functional components in a variety of biological contexts. In chemistry, the construction and identification of even rudimentary oscillators remain elusive and lack a general framework. Using parameter-rich kinetics - a methodology enabling the disentanglement of parametric dependencies from structural analysis - we investigate the stoichiometry of chemical oscillators. We introduce the concept of oscillatory cores: minimal subnetworks that guarantee the potential for oscillations in any reaction network containing them. These cores fall into two classes, depending on whether they involve positive or negative feedback. In particular, the latter class unveils a family of oscillators - yet to be synthesized - that require a minimum number of reaction steps to exhibit oscillations, a phenomenon we refer to as the principle of length. We identify several mechanisms through which catalysis promotes oscillations: (I) furnishing instability (e.g. autocatalysis), (II) lifting dependencies, (III) lowering length thresholds. Notwithstanding this mechanistic ubiquity, we show that oscillators can also be realized without employing any catalysis. Our results highlight branches of chemistry where oscillators are likely to arise by chance, suggest new strategies for their design, and point to novel classes of oscillators yet to be realized experimentally.

Abstract:
Objective: To investigate the mechanism by which quercetin inhibits triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) through regulating T-cell-related targets, providing a novel strategy for TNBC immunotherapy.Methods: Single-cell RNA sequencing (GSE161529 dataset) and network pharmacology were integrated. PCA and UMAP clustering identified T-cell subsets and differentially expressed genes in TNBC microenvironment. TNBC-related targets were screened via CTD and OMIM databases, with functional pathways analyzed by GO/KEGG enrichment. Molecular docking and PPI networks validated interactions between quercetin and core targets.Results: Quercetin intersected with 79 TNBC targets, including AKT1, EGFR, and MMP9, enriched in EGFR inhibitor resistance and endocrine resistance pathways. Molecular docking revealed the highest affinity between quercetin and GSK3B (-13.2 kJ/mol). AKT1 and MMP9 expression correlated with patient survival.Conclusion: Quercetin may reverse TNBC immunosuppression by multi-target modulation of T-cell function, but clinical application requires solutions for its low bioavailability, such as delivery systems or combination therapies.

Abstract:
Understanding the complex and stochastic nature of Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) remains a central challenge in systems biology. Existing modeling paradigms often struggle to effectively capture the intricate, multi-factor regulatory logic and to rigorously manage the dual uncertainties of network structure and kinetic parameters. In response, this work introduces the Probabilistic Categorical GRN(PC-GRN) framework. It is a novel theoretical approach founded on the synergistic integration of three core methodologies. Firstly, category theory provides a formal language for the modularity and composition of regulatory pathways. Secondly, Bayesian Typed Petri Nets (BTPNs) serve as an interpretable,mechanistic substrate for modeling stochastic cellular processes, with kinetic parameters themselves represented as probability distributions. The central innovation of PC-GRN is its end-to-end generative Bayesian inference engine, which learns a full posterior distribution over BTPN models (P (G, Θ|D)) directly from data. This is achieved by the novel interplay of a GFlowNet, which learns a policy to sample network topologies, and a HyperNetwork, which performs amortized inference to predict their corresponding parameter distributions. The resulting framework provides a mathematically rigorous, biologically interpretable, and uncertainty-aware representation of GRNs, advancing predictive modeling and systems-level analysis.

Abstract:
Biological organisms are simple at heart: cells, their basic units, perform a variety of behaviors by expressing proteins from DNA-encoded genes. Gene expression though depends on sets of often-convoluted regulatory interactions known as gene networks, contributing to biology's apparent complexity. Even in Escherichia coli K-12, the pioneering model organism of molecular biology, gene networks are complicated and inconsistent with gene expression data. Recent discoveries of multicellular self-organization in E. coli suggest a new model for gene regulation that may help in many cases: control of gene networks by multicellular interaction networks, i.e. the changing physical and chemical interactions between cells in communities. E. coli's observed dynamics indicate multicellular interactions serve as inputs for key gene networks, thereby producing robust expression of otherwise noisy genes. In turn, multicellular interaction networks are dynamically generated as outputs of gene networks during self-organization. Thus, multicellular self-organization enables uniquely-biological control mechanisms that are not available to individual cells. As further suggested by E. coli self-organization, the gene-network outputs from one multicellular stage can be linked, via multicellular interaction networks, to serve as the gene-network inputs for later stages, thereby creating multicellular daisy chains. Daisy chains are a general model for reliably propagating multicellular communities and, therefore, for predictably determining the gene-network inputs of each cell throughout multicellular self-organization and development. Considerations for several fields are briefly discussed and suggest multicellular daisy chains are a general mechanism for biological organisms to control cell behavior and to be simpler than the sum of their parts.

Abstract:
G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are central to cellular information processing, yet the physical principles governing their switching behavior remain incompletely understood. We present a first principles theoretical framework, grounded in nonequilibrium thermodynamics, to describe GPCR switching as observed in light-controlled impedance assays. The model identifies two fundamental control parameters: (1) ATP/GTP-driven chemical flux through the receptor complex, and (2) the free-energy difference between phosphorylated and dephosphorylated switch states. Together, these parameters defin the switch configuration. The model predicts that GPCRs can occupy one of three quasi-stable configurations, each corresponding to a local maximum in information transmission. Active states support chemical flux and exist in an on or off switch configuration, whereas inactive states lack flux, introducing a distinction absent in conventional phosphorylation models. The model takes two ligand-derived inputs: fixed structural features and inducible conformations (e.g. cis or trans). It shows that phosphatase activity, modeled as an energy barrier, chiefly governs on/off occupancy, whereas the kinase sustains flux without directly determining the switch configuration. Comparison with experimental data confirms the predicted existence of multiple quasi-stable states modulated by ligand conformation. Importantly, this framework generalizes beyond GPCRs to encompass a wider class of biological switching systems driven by nonequilibrium chemical flux.

Abstract:
Cancer is recognized as a complex group of diseases, contributing to the highest global mortality rates, with increasing prevalence and a trend toward affecting younger populations. It is characterized by uncontrolled proliferation of abnormal cells, invasion of adjacent tissues, and metastasis to distant organs. Garcinia cowa, a traditional medicinal plant widely used in Southeast Asia, including Vietnam, is employed to treat fever, cough, indigestion, as a laxative, and for parasitic diseases. Numerous xanthone compounds isolated from this species exhibit a broad spectrum of biological activities, with some showing promise as anti cancer and antimalarial agents. Network pharmacology analysis successfully identified key bioactive compounds Rubraxanthone, Garcinone D, Norcowanin, Cowanol, and Cowaxanthone alongside their primary protein targets (TNF, CTNNB1, SRC, NFKB1, and MTOR), providing critical insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying their anti-cancer effects. The Graph Attention Network algorithm demonstrated superior predictive performance, achieving an R2 of 0.98 and an RMSE of 0.02 after data augmentation, highlighting its accuracy in predicting pIC50 values for xanthone based compounds. Additionally, molecular docking revealed MTOR as a potential target for inducing cytotoxicity in HeLa cancer cells from Garcinia cowa.

Abstract:
Cell phenotype dynamic homeostasis contrasts with the inherent randomness of intracellular reactions. Although feedback control of master regulatory genes (MRG) is a key strategy for maintaining gene network expression ranges limited, understanding the quantitative constraints and corresponding mechanisms enabling such a dynamic stability under noise remains elusive. Here we model MRG expression as a stochastic process and downstream genes as sensors which response conditionally induce MRG activity. We show that at homeostatic regime: i. the trajectories of the MRG expression levels can be adjusted towards specific ranges using both the exact solutions of the stochastic model and the exact stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA); ii. there exists a sampling rate which optimizes the feedback control of the MRG activity, and non-optimal controls resulting in alternative homeostatic dynamics; iii. the feedback control of MRG activity leads to updates which intensities and time intervals are non-linearly related; iv. the ON state probability of an MRG promoter has dynamics confined within a narrow domain. Our results help to understand the quantitative constraints underpinning dynamic homeostasis despite randomness, the mechanisms underlying alternative, non-optimal, homeostatic regimes, and may be useful for theoretically prototyping therapies aiming at gene networks modulation.

Abstract:
Drug-drug interactions pose a significant challenge in clinical pharmacology, with severe class imbalance among interaction types limiting the effectiveness of predictive models. Common interactions dominate datasets, while rare but critical interactions remain underrepresented, leading to poor model performance on infrequent cases. Existing methods often treat DDI prediction as a binary problem, ignoring class-specific nuances and exacerbating bias toward frequent interactions. To address this, we propose a framework combining Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNet) with Variational Graph Autoencoders (VGAE) to generate synthetic samples for rare classes, improving model balance and generate effective and novel DDI pairs. Our approach enhances predictive performance across interaction types, ensuring better clinical reliability.

Abstract:
Intellectual disability (ID) is defined by an IQ under 70, in addition to deficits in two or more adaptive behaviors that affect everyday living. Throughout history, individuals with ID have often been margin-alized from society and continue to suffer significantly even in modern times. A varying proportion of ID cases are attributable to genetic causes. Identifying the causal relation among these ID-associated genes and their gene expression pattern during brain development process would gain us a better understanding of the molecular basis of ID. In this paper, we interpret gene expression data collected at different time points during the in vitro brain development process as time series and further introduce Granger causality test to evaluate the dynamic dependence relations among genes. These evaluations are used as input to construct gene expression network and extract the pathological information associated to ID including identi-fying new genes that can be critically related to the disease. To demonstrate our methods, we pro-vide a priority list of new genes that are most likely associated with Mowat Wilson Syndrome via monitoring the community structure of ZEB2 in our Granger causality network constructed based on the Kutsche dataset (Kutsche, et al., 2018).

Abstract:
Understanding the molecular-level mechanisms underpinning Alzheimer's disease (AD) by studying crucial genes associated with the disease remains a challenge. Alzheimer's, being a multifactorial disease, requires understanding the gene-gene interactions underlying it for theranostics and progress. In this article, a novel attempt has been made using a quantum regression to decode how some crucial genes in the AD Amyloid Beta Precursor Protein ($APP$), Sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 14 ($FGF14$), Yin Yang 1 ($YY1$), and Phospholipase D Family Member 3 ($PLD3$) etc. become influenced by other prominent switching genes during disease progression, which may help in gene expression-based therapy for AD. Our proposed Quantum Regression Network (Alz-QNet) introduces a pioneering approach with insights from the state-of-the-art Quantum Gene Regulatory Networks (QGRN) to unravel the gene interactions involved in AD pathology, particularly within the Entorhinal Cortex (EC), where early pathological changes occur. Using the proposed Alz-QNet framework, we explore the interactions between key genes ($APP$, $FGF14$, $YY1$, $EGR1$, $GAS7$, $AKT3$, $SREBF2$, and $PLD3$) within the CE microenvironment of AD patients, studying genetic samples from the database $GSE138852$, all of which are believed to play a crucial role in the progression of AD. Our investigation uncovers intricate gene-gene interactions, shedding light on the potential regulatory mechanisms that underlie the pathogenesis of AD, which help us to find potential gene inhibitors or regulators for theranostics.

Abstract:
Smart agriculture applications, integrating technologies like the Internet of Things and machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) into agriculture, hold promise to address modern challenges of rising food demand, environmental pollution, and water scarcity. Alongside the concept of the phytobiome, which defines the area including the plant, its environment, and associated organisms, and the recent emergence of molecular communication (MC), there exists an important opportunity to advance agricultural science and practice using communication theory. In this article, we motivate to use the communication engineering perspective for developing a holistic understanding of the phytobiome communication and bridge the gap between the phytobiome communication and smart agriculture. Firstly, an overview of phytobiome communication via molecular and electrophysiological signals is presented and a multi-scale framework modeling the phytobiome as a communication network is conceptualized. Then, how this framework is used to model electrophysiological signals is demonstrated with plant experiments. Furthermore, possible smart agriculture applications, such as smart irrigation and targeted delivery of agrochemicals, through engineering the phytobiome communication are proposed. These applications merge ML/AI methods with the Internet of Bio-Nano-Things enabled by MC and pave the way towards more efficient, sustainable, and eco-friendly agricultural production. Finally, the implementation challenges, open research issues, and industrial outlook for these applications are discussed.

Abstract:
Endothelial cells release various vasorelaxing molecules, such as nitric oxide and prostacyclin, along with defined factors that induce hyperpolarization of vascular smooth muscle cells through the opening of calcium-sensitive potassium channels. Potassium channel-dependent vasorelaxation is prevalent in microvessels and can partially compensate for deficiencies in other vasodilatory mechanisms. Enhancing this backup vasorelaxant mechanism may aid the treatment of microvascular disorders, such as cerebral small vessel disease and preeclampsia, a pregnancy-specific hypertensive syndrome, which is characterized by systemic endothelial dysfunction. The development of pharmacological potassium channel openers has encountered significant challenges, including issues of specificity, safety concerns, and off-target effects. This study critically evaluates the advantages and drawbacks of integrating hyperpolarization into a holistic vasorelaxant strategy for managing ischemic disease through single or combination drug therapies.

Abstract:
Background: The rational identification of essential genes is a cornerstone of drug discovery, yet standard computational methods like Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) often struggle to produce accurate predictions in complex, redundant metabolic networks. Hypothesis: We hypothesized that the topological structure of a metabolic network contains a more robust predictive signal for essentiality than functional simulations alone. Methodology: To test this hypothesis, we developed a machine learning pipeline by first constructing a reaction-reaction graph from the e_coli_core metabolic model. Graph-theoretic features, including betweenness centrality and PageRank, were engineered to describe the topological role of each gene. A RandomForestClassifier was trained on these features, and its performance was rigorously benchmarked against a standard FBA single-gene deletion analysis using a curated ground-truth dataset. Results: Our machine learning model achieved a solid predictive performance with an F1-Score of 0.400 (Precision: 0.412, Recall: 0.389). In profound contrast, the standard FBA baseline method failed to correctly identify any of the known essential genes, resulting in an F1-Score of 0.000. Conclusion: This work demonstrates that a "structure-first" machine learning approach is a significantly superior strategy for predicting gene essentiality compared to traditional FBA on the E. coli core network. By learning the topological signatures of critical network roles, our model successfully overcomes the known limitations of simulation-based methods in handling biological redundancy. While the performance of topology-only models is expected to face challenges on more complex genome-scale networks, this validated framework represents a significant step forward and highlights the primacy of network architecture in determining biological function.

Abstract:
Autocatalysis underlies the ability of chemical and biochemical systems to replicate. Autocatalysis was recently defined stoichiometrically for reaction networks; five types of minimal autocatalytic networks, termed autocatalytic cores were identified. A necessary and sufficient stoichiometric criterion was later established for dynamical autocatalysis in diluted regimes, ensuring a positive growth rate of autocatalytic species starting from infinitesimal concentrations, given that degradation rates are sufficiently low. Here, we show that minimal autocatalytic networks in the dynamical sense, in the diluted regime, follow the same classification as autocatalytic cores in the stoichiometric sense. We further prove the uniqueness of the stationary regimes of autocatalytic cores, with and without degradation, for all types, except types II with three catalytic loops or more. These results indicate that the stationary point is likely to be robust under perturbation at low concentrations. More complex behaviours are likely to arise by additional non-linear couplings between cores.

Abstract:
Multisite protein phosphorylation plays a pivotal role in regulating cellular signaling and decision-making processes. In this study, we focus on the mathematical underpinnings and informational aspects of sequential, distributive phosphorylation systems. We first provide rigorous steady-state solutions derived using geometric series arguments and formal mathematical induction, demonstrating that the distribution of phosphorylation states follows a geometric progression determined by the kinase-to-phosphatase activity ratio. We then extend the analysis with entropy-based insights, quantifying uncertainty in phosphorylation states and examining the mutual information between kinase activity and phosphorylation levels through a truncated Poisson model. These results highlight how phosphorylation dynamics introduce both structured patterns and inherent signal variability. By combining exact mathematical proofs with entropy analysis, this work clarifies key quantitative features of multisite phosphorylation from a systems-level perspective.

Abstract:
Autocatalytic chemical reaction networks can collectively replicate or maintain their constituents despite degradation reactions only above a certain threshold, which we refer to as the decay threshold. When the chemical network has a Jacobian matrix with the Metzler property, we leverage analytical methods developed for Markov processes to show that the decay threshold can be calculated by solving a linear problem, instead of the standard eigenvalue problem. We explore how this decay threshold depends on the network parameters, such as its size, the directionality of the reactions (reversible or irreversible), and its connectivity, then we deduce design principles from this that might be relevant to research on the Origin of Life.

Abstract:
Computing equilibrium concentrations of molecular complexes is generally analytically intractable and requires numerical approaches. In this work we focus on the polymer-monomer level, where indivisible molecules (monomers) combine to form complexes (polymers). Rather than employing free-energy parameters for each polymer, we focus on the athermic setting where all interactions preserve enthalpy. This setting aligns with the strongly bonded (domain-based) regime in DNA nanotechnology when strands can bind in different ways, but always with maximum overall bonding -- and is consistent with the saturated configurations in the Thermodynamic Binding Networks (TBNs) model. Within this context, we develop an iterative algorithm for assigning polymer concentrations to satisfy detailed-balance, where on-target (desired) polymers are in high concentrations and off-target (undesired) polymers are in low. Even if not directly executed, our algorithm provides effective insights into upper bounds on concentration of off-target polymers, connecting combinatorial arguments about discrete configurations such as those in the TBN model to real-valued concentrations. We conclude with an application of our method to decreasing leak in DNA logic and signal propagation. Our results offer a new framework for design and verification of equilibrium concentrations when configurations are distinguished by entropic forces.

Abstract:
Eukaryotic gene regulation is based on stochastic yet controlled promoter switching, during which genes transition between transcriptionally active and inactive states. Despite the molecular complexity of this process, recent studies reveal a surprising invariance of the "switching correlation time" ($T_C$), which characterizes promoter activity fluctuations, across gene expression levels in diverse genes and organisms. A biophysically plausible explanation for this invariance remains missing. Here, we show that this invariance imposes stringent constraints on minimal yet plausible models of transcriptional regulation, requiring at least four system states and non-equilibrium dynamics that break detailed balance. Using Bayesian inference on Drosophila gap gene expression data, we demonstrate that such models (i) accurately reproduce the observed $T_C$-invariance; (ii) remain robust to parameter perturbations; and (iii) maximize information transmission from transcription factor concentration to gene expression. These findings suggest that eukaryotic gene regulation has evolved to balance precision with reaction rate and energy dissipation constraints, favoring non-equilibrium architectures for optimal information transmission.

Abstract:
Random graph models have been instrumental in characterizing complex networks, but chemical reaction networks (CRNs) are better represented as hypergraphs. Traditional models of random CRNs often reduce CRNs to bipartite graphs, representing species and reactions as distinct nodes, or simpler derived graphs, which can obscure the relationship between the statistical properties of these representations and the physical characteristics of the CRN. We introduce a straightforward model for generating random CRNs that preserves their hypergraph structure as well as atomic composition, enabling the direct study of chemically relevant features. Notably, our approach distinguishes two notions of connectivity that are equivalent in graphs but differ fundamentally in hypergraphs. These notions exhibit percolation-like phase transitions, which we analyze in detail. The first type of connectivity has relevance to steady-state synthesis and transduction, determining the effective reactions an open CRN can perform at steady state. The second type is suitable to identify which species can be produced from a given initial set of species in a closed CRN. Our findings highlight the importance of hypergraph-based modeling for uncovering the complex behaviors of CRNs.

Abstract:
Stochastic reaction networks are mathematical models frequently used in, but not limited to, biochemistry. These models are continuous-time Markov chains whose transition rates depend on certain parameters called rate constants, which despite the name may not be constant in real-world applications. In this paper we study how random switching between different stochastic reaction networks with asymptotically linear rate functions affects the stability of the process. We give matrix conditions for both positive recurrence (indeed, exponentially ergodicity) and transience (indeed, evanescence) in both the regime with high switching rates and the regime with low switching rates. We then make use of these conditions to provide examples of processes whose stability behavior changes as the switching rate varies. We also explore what happens in the middle regime where the switching rates are neither high nor low and our theorems do not apply. Specifically, we show by examples that there can be arbitrarily many phase transitions between exponentially ergodicity and evanescence as the switching rate increases.

Abstract:
Zero-one biochemical reaction networks are widely recognized for their importance in analyzing signal transduction and cellular decision-making processes. Degenerate networks reveal non-standard behaviors and mark the boundary where classical methods fail. Their analysis is key to understanding exceptional dynamical phenomena in biochemical systems. Therefore, we focus on investigating the degeneracy of zero-one reaction networks. It is known that one-dimensional zero-one networks cannot degenerate. In this work, we identify all degenerate two-dimensional zero-one reaction networks with up to three species by an efficient algorithm. By analyzing the structure of these networks, we arrive at the following conclusion: if a two-dimensional zero-one reaction network with three species is degenerate, then its steady-state system is equivalent to a binomial system.

Abstract:
Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) represent a critical challenge in pharmacology, often leading to adverse drug reactions with significant implications for patient safety and healthcare outcomes. While graph-based methods have achieved strong predictive performance, most approaches treat drug pairs independently, overlooking the complex, context-dependent interactions unique to drug pairs. Additionally, these models struggle to integrate biological interaction networks and molecular-level structures to provide meaningful mechanistic insights. In this study, we propose MolecBioNet, a novel graph-based framework that integrates molecular and biomedical knowledge for robust and interpretable DDI prediction. By modeling drug pairs as unified entities, MolecBioNet captures both macro-level biological interactions and micro-level molecular influences, offering a comprehensive perspective on DDIs. The framework extracts local subgraphs from biomedical knowledge graphs and constructs hierarchical interaction graphs from molecular representations, leveraging classical graph neural network methods to learn multi-scale representations of drug pairs. To enhance accuracy and interpretability, MolecBioNet introduces two domain-specific pooling strategies: context-aware subgraph pooling (CASPool), which emphasizes biologically relevant entities, and attention-guided influence pooling (AGIPool), which prioritizes influential molecular substructures. The framework further employs mutual information minimization regularization to enhance information diversity during embedding fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that MolecBioNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in DDI prediction, while ablation studies and embedding visualizations further validate the advantages of unified drug pair modeling and multi-scale knowledge integration.

Abstract:
Understanding how biological systems achieve robust control despite relying on imperfect local information remains a challenging problem. Here, we consider non-equilibrium models which are generically used to describe natural and synthetic biological processes, such as gene regulation and protein conformational dynamics, and investigate their capacity for effective control using imperfect local feedback mechanisms. We derive a thermodynamic constraint on the response of non-equilibrium steady-state properties to changes in the driving forces. We show that this constraint enables linear, local, and easily implementable feedback rules to achieve environmental tracking and adaptation without consideration of network topology. In particular, we demonstrate that local stability of these feedback dynamics implies global stability for systems with one or two chemical regulators, regardless of the network topology. For higher-dimensional systems, global stability is not guaranteed. However, in part due to simplifications in attractor landscapes implied by our thermodynamic constraint, we find the basin of attraction remains significantly larger than would be expected from linear approximation alone. Our findings provide insight into how biological and synthetically engineered systems can respond effectively to environmental changes given only minimal feedback, without highly engineered interactions or precise parameter tuning.

Abstract:
Molecular structure elucidation from spectra is a fundamental challenge in molecular science. Conventional approaches rely heavily on expert interpretation and lack scalability, while retrieval-based machine learning approaches remain constrained by limited reference libraries. Generative models offer a promising alternative, yet most adopt autoregressive architectures that overlook 3D geometry and struggle to integrate diverse spectral modalities. In this work, we present DiffSpectra, a generative framework that formulates molecular structure elucidation as a conditional generation process, directly inferring 2D and 3D molecular structures from multi-modal spectra using diffusion models. Its denoising network is parameterized by the Diffusion Molecule Transformer, an SE(3)-equivariant architecture for geometric modeling, conditioned by SpecFormer, a Transformer-based spectral encoder capturing multi-modal spectral dependencies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiffSpectra accurately elucidates molecular structures, achieving 40.76% top-1 and 99.49% top-10 accuracy. Its performance benefits substantially from 3D geometric modeling, SpecFormer pre-training, and multi-modal conditioning. To our knowledge, DiffSpectra is the first framework that unifies multi-modal spectral reasoning and joint 2D/3D generative modeling for de novo molecular structure elucidation.

Abstract:
The synthesis of complex natural products remains one of the grand challenges of organic chemistry. We present DeepRetro, a major advancement in computational retrosynthesis that enables the discovery of viable synthetic routes for complex molecules typically considered beyond the reach of existing retrosynthetic methods. DeepRetro is a novel, open-source framework that tightly integrates large language models (LLMs), traditional retrosynthetic engines, and expert human feedback in an iterative design loop. Prior approaches rely solely on template-based methods or unconstrained LLM outputs. In contrast, DeepRetro combines the precision of template-based methods with the generative flexibility of LLMs, controlled by rigorous chemical validity checks and enhanced by recursive refinement. This hybrid system dynamically explores and revises synthetic pathways, guided by both algorithmic checks and expert chemist feedback through an interactive user interface. While DeepRetro achieves strong performance on standard retrosynthesis benchmarks, its true strength lies in its ability to propose novel, viable pathways to highly complex natural products-targets that have historically eluded automated planning. Through detailed case studies, we illustrate how this approach enables new routes for total synthesis and facilitates human-machine collaboration in organic chemistry. Beyond retrosynthesis, DeepRetro represents a working model for how to leverage LLMs in scientific discovery. We provide a transparent account of the system's design, algorithms, and human-feedback loop, enabling broad adaptation across scientific domains. By releasing DeepRetro as an open-source tool, we aim to empower chemists to tackle increasingly ambitious synthetic targets, accelerating progress in drug discovery, materials design, and beyond.

Abstract:
Efficient signal representation is essential for the functioning of living and artificial systems operating under resource constraints. A widely recognized framework for deriving such representations is the information bottleneck method, which yields the optimal strategy for encoding a random variable, such as the signal, in a way that preserves maximal information about a functionally relevant variable, subject to an explicit constraint on the amount of information encoded. While in its general formulation the method is numerical, it admits an analytical solution in an important special case where the variables involved are jointly Gaussian. In this setting, the solution predicts discrete transitions in the dimensionality of the optimal representation as the encoding capacity is increased. Although these signature transitions, along with other features of the optimal strategy, can be derived from a constrained optimization problem, a clear and intuitive understanding of their emergence is still lacking. In our work, we advance our understanding of the Gaussian information bottleneck method through multiple mutually enriching perspectives, including geometric and information-theoretic ones. These perspectives offer novel intuition about the set of optimal encoding directions, the nature of the critical points where the optimal number of encoding components changes, and about the way the optimal strategy navigates between these critical points. We then apply our treatment of the method to a previously studied signal prediction problem, obtaining new insights on how different features of the signal are encoded across multiple components to enable optimal prediction of future signals. Altogether, our work deepens the foundational understanding of the information bottleneck method in the Gaussian setting, motivating the exploration of analogous perspectives in broader, non-Gaussian contexts.

Abstract:
Deep learning-based computational methods have achieved promising results in predicting protein-protein interactions (PPIs). However, existing benchmarks predominantly focus on isolated pairwise evaluations, overlooking a model's capability to reconstruct biologically meaningful PPI networks, which is crucial for biology research. To address this gap, we introduce PRING, the first comprehensive benchmark that evaluates protein-protein interaction prediction from a graph-level perspective. PRING curates a high-quality, multi-species PPI network dataset comprising 21,484 proteins and 186,818 interactions, with well-designed strategies to address both data redundancy and leakage. Building on this golden-standard dataset, we establish two complementary evaluation paradigms: (1) topology-oriented tasks, which assess intra and cross-species PPI network construction, and (2) function-oriented tasks, including protein complex pathway prediction, GO module analysis, and essential protein justification. These evaluations not only reflect the model's capability to understand the network topology but also facilitate protein function annotation, biological module detection, and even disease mechanism analysis. Extensive experiments on four representative model categories, consisting of sequence similarity-based, naive sequence-based, protein language model-based, and structure-based approaches, demonstrate that current PPI models have potential limitations in recovering both structural and functional properties of PPI networks, highlighting the gap in supporting real-world biological applications. We believe PRING provides a reliable platform to guide the development of more effective PPI prediction models for the community. The dataset and source code of PRING are available at https://github.com/SophieSarceau/PRING.

Abstract:
The use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) models is becoming ubiquitous in many fields. Though progress continues to be made, general purpose large language AI models (LLM) show a tendency to deliver creative answers, often called "hallucinations", which have slowed their application in the medical and biomedical fields where accuracy is paramount. We propose that the design and use of much smaller, domain and even task-specific LM may be a more rational and appropriate use of this technology in biomedical research. In this work we apply a very small LM by today's standards to the specialized task of predicting regulatory interactions between molecular components to fill gaps in our current understanding of intracellular pathways. Toward this we attempt to correctly posit known pathway-informed interactions recovered from manually curated pathway databases by selecting and using only the most informative examples as part of an active learning scheme. With this example we show that a small (~110 million parameters) LM based on a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) architecture can propose molecular interactions relevant to tuberculosis persistence and transmission with over 80% accuracy using less than 25% of the ~520 regulatory relationships in question. Using information entropy as a metric for the iterative selection of new tuning examples, we also find that increased accuracy is driven by favoring the use of the incorrectly assigned statements with the highest certainty (lowest entropy). In contrast, the concurrent use of correct but least certain examples contributed little and may have even been detrimental to the learning rate.

Abstract:
Cells integrate signals and make decisions about their future state in short amounts of time. A lot of theoretical effort has gone into asking how to best design gene regulatory circuits that fulfill a given function, yet little is known about the constraints that performing that function in a small amount of time imposes on circuit architectures. Using an optimization framework, we explore the properties of a class of promoter architectures that distinguish small differences in transcription factor concentrations under time constraints. We show that the full temporal trajectory of gene activity allows for faster decisions than its integrated activity represented by the total number of transcribed mRNA. The topology of promoter architectures that allow for rapidly distinguishing low transcription factor concentrations result in a low, shallow, and non cooperative response, while at high concentrations, the response is high and cooperative. In the presence of non-cognate ligands, networks with fast and accurate decision times need not be optimally selective, especially if discrimination is difficult. While optimal networks are generically out of equilibrium, the energy associated with that irreversibility is only modest, and negligible at small concentrations. Instead, our results highlight the crucial role of rate-limiting steps imposed by biophysical constraints.

Abstract:
The discovery of new ionizable lipids for efficient lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-mediated RNA delivery remains a critical bottleneck for RNA-based therapeutics development. Recent advances have highlighted the potential of machine learning (ML) to predict transfection efficiency from molecular structure, enabling high-throughput virtual screening and accelerating lead identification. However, existing approaches are hindered by inadequate data quality, ineffective feature representations, low predictive accuracy, and poor generalizability. Here, we present LANTERN (Lipid nANoparticle Transfection Efficiency pRedictioN), a robust ML framework for predicting transfection efficiency based on ionizable lipid representation. We benchmarked a diverse set of ML models against AGILE, a previously published model developed for transfection prediction. Our results show that combining simpler models with chemically informative features, particularly count-based Morgan fingerprints, outperforms more complex models that rely on internally learned embeddings, such as AGILE. We also show that a multi-layer perceptron trained on a combination of Morgan fingerprints and Expert descriptors achieved the highest performance ($\text{R}^2$ = 0.8161, r = 0.9053), significantly exceeding AGILE ($\text{R}^2$ = 0.2655, r = 0.5488). We show that the models in LANTERN consistently have strong performance across multiple evaluation metrics. Thus, LANTERN offers a robust benchmarking framework for LNP transfection prediction and serves as a valuable tool for accelerating lipid-based RNA delivery systems design.

Abstract:
With the advancement of crewed deep-space missions, Bioregenerative Life Support Systems (BLSS) for lunar bases face stresses from lunar environmental factors. While microgravity and radiation are well-studied, the low-magnetic field's effects remain unclear. Earthworms ("soil scavengers") improve lunar soil simulant and degrade plant waste, as shown in our prior studies. We tested earthworms in lunar soil simulant mixed with organic waste (from "Lunar Palace 365" experiment) under three magnetic conditions: lunar-low, Earth, and high. Stronger fields increased earthworm oxidative stress (MDA) and impaired neurotransmitters. Weaker fields enhanced substrate cultivability: neutralized pH, increased nutrients, humus, and wheat seedling rate. Microbial analyses showed: (1) Higher fungal Shannon index under high fields indicated impaired digestion; (2) More positive correlations in gut networks suggested slower microbial cooperation (e.g., lignocellulose degradation); (3) Reduced Network Size, Path Length and Modularity confirmed disrupted interactions. This disproves lunar low-magnetic stress on earthworm-soil-waste systems, aiding deep-space BLSS research.

Abstract:
Single-cell data reveal the presence of biological stochasticity between cells of identical genome and environment, in particular highlighting the transcriptional bursting phenomenon. To account for this property, gene expression may be modeled as a continuous-time Markov chain where biochemical species are described in a discrete way, leading to Gillespie's stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) which turns out to be computationally expensive for realistic mRNA and protein copy numbers. Alternatively, hybrid models based on piecewise-deterministic Markov processes (PDMPs) offer an effective compromise for capturing cell-to-cell variability, but their simulation remains limited to specialized mathematical communities. With a view to making them more accessible, we present here a simple simulation method that is reminiscent of SSA, while allowing for much lower computational cost. We detail the algorithm for a bursty PDMP describing an arbitrary number of interacting genes, and prove that it simulates exact trajectories of the model. As an illustration, we use the algorithm to simulate a two-gene toggle switch: this example highlights the fact that bimodal distributions as observed in real data are not explained by transcriptional bursting per se, but rather by distinct burst frequencies that may emerge from interactions between genes.

Abstract:
Graph-structured data is ubiquitous in scientific domains, where models often face imbalanced learning settings. In imbalanced regression, domain preferences focus on specific target value ranges that represent the most scientifically valuable cases; however, we observe a significant lack of research regarding this challenge. In this paper, we present Spectral Manifold Harmonization (SMH), a novel approach to address imbalanced regression challenges on graph-structured data by generating synthetic graph samples that preserve topological properties while focusing on the most relevant target distribution regions. Conventional methods fail in this context because they either ignore graph topology in case generation or do not target specific domain ranges, resulting in models biased toward average target values. Experimental results demonstrate the potential of SMH on chemistry and drug discovery benchmark datasets, showing consistent improvements in predictive performance for target domain ranges.

Abstract:
HIV epidemiological data is increasingly complex, requiring advanced computation for accurate cluster detection and forecasting. We employed quantum-accelerated machine learning to analyze HIV prevalence at the ZIP-code level using AIDSVu and synthetic SDoH data for 2022. Our approach compared classical clustering (DBSCAN, HDBSCAN) with a quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA), developed a hybrid quantum-classical neural network for HIV prevalence forecasting, and used quantum Bayesian networks to explore causal links between SDoH factors and HIV incidence. The QAOA-based method achieved 92% accuracy in cluster detection within 1.6 seconds, outperforming classical algorithms. Meanwhile, the hybrid quantum-classical neural network predicted HIV prevalence with 94% accuracy, surpassing a purely classical counterpart. Quantum Bayesian analysis identified housing instability as a key driver of HIV cluster emergence and expansion, with stigma exerting a geographically variable influence. These quantum-enhanced methods deliver greater precision and efficiency in HIV surveillance while illuminating critical causal pathways. This work can guide targeted interventions, optimize resource allocation for PrEP, and address structural inequities fueling HIV transmission.

Abstract:
Microbial networks, representing microbes as nodes and their interactions as edges, are crucial for understanding community dynamics in various environments. Analyzing microbiome networks is crucial for identifying keystone taxa that play central roles in maintaining microbial community structure and function, assessing how environmental changes such as pollution, climate shifts, or land use affect microbial dynamics, tracking disease progression by revealing alterations in microbial interactions over time, and predicting microbial community responses to interventions such as antibiotics, probiotics, or changes in diet and habitat. The complexity of microbial interactions necessitates the use of computational tools such as the MiNAA-WebApp, available at https://minaa.wid.wisc.edu, which enhances the accessibility of the Microbiome Network Alignment Algorithm MiNAA. This tool allows researchers to align microbial networks and explore ecological relationships and community dynamics without extensive computational skills. Originally, MiNAA's command-line interface limited its usability for those without programming backgrounds. The web-based MiNAA-WebApp addresses this shortcoming by offering an intuitive interface with visualization tools, allowing easy exploration and analysis of microbial networks. The web app is designed for microbiome networks but also applicable to other biological networks, broadening its use in computational biology and making network-based research accessible to a wider audience.

Abstract:
One of the puzzles left open by energetic analyses of irreversible stochastic processes is that boundary conditions that prevent the performance of work or the dissipation of heat make no contribution to an entropy-production budget; yet we see ubiquitously in both engineered and living systems that both transient and persistent energy costs are paid to create and maintain such boundaries. We wish to know whether there are inherent limits for the costs of such phenomena, and common units in which those can be traded off against more familiar costs measured in terms of heat dissipation. We give this problem a concrete framing in the context of CRNs, for the problem of extracting a topologically restricted pathway from a larger distributed network, through activation of some reactions and selective elimination of others. We define a thermodynamic cost function for pathways derived from large-deviation theory of stochastic CRNs, which decomposes into two components: an ongoing maintenance cost to sustain a NESS, and a restriction cost, quantifying the ongoing improbability of neutralizing reactions outside the specified pathway. Applying this formalism to detailed-balanced CRNs in the linear response regime, we make use of their formal equivalence to electrical circuits. We prove that the resistance of a CRN decreases as reactions are added that support the throughput current, and that the maintenance cost, the restriction cost, and the thermodynamic cost of nested pathways are bounded below by those of their hosting network. For small CRNs, we show how catalytic and inhibitory mechanisms can drastically alter pathway costs, enabling unfavorable pathways to become favorable and approach the cost of the hosting pathway. Our results provide insights into the thermodynamic principles governing open CRNs and offer a foundation for understanding the evolution of metabolic networks.

Abstract:
The rapid expansion of biomolecular datasets presents significant challenges for computational biology. Quantum computing emerges as a promising solution to address these complexities. This study introduces a novel quantum framework for analyzing TART-T and TART-C gene data by integrating genomic and structural information. Leveraging a Quantum Neural Network (QNN), we classify hotspot mutations, utilizing quantum superposition to uncover intricate relationships within the data. Additionally, a Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is employed to estimate molecular ground-state energies through a hybrid classical-quantum approach, overcoming the limitations of traditional computational methods. Implemented using IBM Qiskit, our framework demonstrates high accuracy in both mutation classification and energy estimation on current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. These results underscore the potential of quantum computing to advance the understanding of gene function and protein structure. Furthermore, this research serves as a foundational blueprint for extending quantum computational methods to other genes and biological systems, highlighting their synergy with classical approaches and paving the way for breakthroughs in drug discovery and personalized medicine.

Abstract:
Recent benchmarks reveal that models for single-cell perturbation response are often outperformed by simply predicting the dataset mean. We trace this anomaly to a metric artifact: control-referenced deltas and unweighted error metrics reward mode collapse whenever the control is biased or the biological signal is sparse. Large-scale \textit{in silico} simulations and analysis of two real-world perturbation datasets confirm that shared reference shifts, not genuine biological change, drives high performance in these evaluations. We introduce differentially expressed gene (DEG)-aware metrics, weighted mean-squared error (WMSE) and weighted delta $R^{2}$ ($R^{2}_{w}(Δ)$) with respect to all perturbations, that measure error in niche signals with high sensitivity. We further introduce negative and positive performance baselines to calibrate these metrics. With these improvements, the mean baseline sinks to null performance while genuine predictors are correctly rewarded. Finally, we show that using WMSE as a loss function reduces mode collapse and improves model performance.

Abstract:
Populations of cells regulate gene expression in response to external signals, but their ability to make reliable collective decisions is limited by both intrinsic noise in molecular signaling and variability between individual cells. In this work, we use optogenetic control of the canonical Wnt pathway as an example to study how reliably information about an external signal is transmitted to a population of cells, and determine an optimal encoding strategy to maximize information transmission from Wnt signals to gene expression. We find that it is possible to reach an information capacity beyond 1 bit only through an appropriate, discrete encoding of signals. By averaging over an increasing number of outputs, we systematically vary the effective noise in the pathway. As the effective noise decreases, the optimal encoding comprises more discrete input signals. These signals do not need to be fine-tuned. The optimal code transitions into a continuous code in the small-noise limit, which can be shown to be consistent with the Jeffreys prior. We visualize the performance of signal encodings using decoding maps. Our results suggest optogenetic Wnt signaling allows for regulatory control beyond a simple binary switch, and provides a framework to apply ideas from information processing to single-cell in vitro experiments.

Abstract:
Estimating single-cell responses across various perturbations facilitates the identification of key genes and enhances drug screening, significantly boosting experimental efficiency. However, single-cell sequencing is a destructive process, making it impossible to capture the same cell's phenotype before and after perturbation. Consequently, data collected under perturbed and unperturbed conditions are inherently unpaired. Existing methods either attempt to forcibly pair unpaired data using random sampling, or neglect the inherent relationship between unperturbed and perturbed cells during the modeling. In this work, we propose a framework based on Dual Diffusion Implicit Bridges (DDIB) to learn the mapping between different data distributions, effectively addressing the challenge of unpaired data. We further interpret this framework as a form of data augmentation. We integrate gene regulatory network (GRN) information to propagate perturbation signals in a biologically meaningful way, and further incorporate a masking mechanism to predict silent genes, improving the quality of generated profiles. Moreover, gene expression under the same perturbation often varies significantly across cells, frequently exhibiting a bimodal distribution that reflects intrinsic heterogeneity. To capture this, we introduce a more suitable evaluation metric. We propose Unlasting, dual conditional diffusion models that overcome the problem of unpaired single-cell perturbation data and strengthen the model's insight into perturbations under the guidance of the GRN, with a dedicated mask model designed to improve generation quality by predicting silent genes. In addition, we introduce a biologically grounded evaluation metric that better reflects the inherent heterogeneity in single-cell responses.

Abstract:
Understanding protein function at the molecular level requires connecting residue-level annotations with physical and structural properties. This can be cumbersome and error-prone when functional annotation, computation of physico-chemical properties, and structure visualization are separated. To address this, we introduce ProCaliper, an open-source Python library for computing and visualizing physico-chemical properties of proteins. It can retrieve annotation and structure data from UniProt and AlphaFold databases, compute residue-level properties such as charge, solvent accessibility, and protonation state, and interactively visualize the results of these computations along with user-supplied residue-level data. Additionally, ProCaliper incorporates functional and structural information to construct and optionally sparsify networks that encode the distance between residues and/or annotated functional sites or regions. The package ProCaliper and its source code, along with the code used to generate the figures in this manuscript, are freely available at https://github.com/PNNL-Predictive-Phenomics/ProCaliper.

Abstract:
Designing reaction pathways that maximize the production of a target compound in a given metabolic network is a fundamental problem in systems biology. In this study, we systematically explore the non-oxidative glycolysis metabolic network, guided by the principle that reactions with negative Gibbs free energy differences are thermodynamically favored. We enumerate alternative pathways that implement the net non-oxidative glycolysis reaction, categorized by their length. Our analysis reveals several alternative thermodynamically favorable pathways beyond those reported in experiments. In addition, we identify molecules within the network, such as 3-hydroxypropionic acid, that may have significant potential for further investigation.

Abstract:
This paper introduces a tamper-resistant framework for large language models (LLMs) in medical applications, utilizing quantum gradient descent (QGD) to detect malicious parameter modifications in real time. Integrated into a LLaMA-based model, QGD monitors weight amplitude distributions, identifying adversarial fine-tuning anomalies. Tests on the MIMIC and eICU datasets show minimal performance impact (accuracy: 89.1 to 88.3 on MIMIC) while robustly detecting tampering. PubMedQA evaluations confirm preserved biomedical question-answering capabilities. Compared to baselines like selective unlearning and cryptographic fingerprinting, QGD offers superior sensitivity to subtle weight changes. This quantum-inspired approach ensures secure, reliable medical AI, extensible to other high-stakes domains.

Abstract:
The propagation of noise through parallel regulatory pathways is a characteristic feature of feed-forward loops in genetic networks. Although the contributions of the direct and indirect regulatory pathways of feed-forward loops to output variability have been well characterized, the impact of their joint action arising from their shared input and output remains poorly understood. Here, we identify an additional component of noise that emerges specifically from this convergent nature of the pathways. Using inter-gene correlations, we reveal the regulatory basis of the cross-interaction noise and interpret it as synergy or redundancy in noise propagation, depending on whether the combined pathways amplify or suppress fluctuations. Synergy typically arises in coherent feed-forward loops, whereas redundancy is common in incoherent ones. This framework not only accounts for previously observed differences in noise behavior across coherent and incoherent structures but also provides a generalizable strategy to connect network structure with stochastic gene regulation. Furthermore, by relating these synergy and redundancy to dynamical properties such as sign-sensitive delay or response acceleration, the framework offers a statistical lens to interpret the functional roles in cellular decision-making.

We review the major drivers of this progress, from establishing feasibility to powerful and increasingly scalable methods. We focus on the tradeoffs and synergies of different technological solutions within a coherent conceptual framework, which projects considerable room both for throughput scaling and for extending the analysis scope to functional protein measurements. We highlight the potential of these technologies to support the development of mechanistic biophysical models and help uncover new principles.

Abstract:
This paper proposes an extension of the traditional Central Dogma of molecular biology to a more dynamic model termed the Central Dogma Cycle (CDC) and a broader network called the Central Dogma Cyclic Network (CDCN). While the Central Dogma is necessary for genetic information flow, it is not sufficient to fully explain cellular memory and information management. The CDC incorporates additional well-established steps, including protein folding and protein networking, highlighting the cyclical nature of information flow in cells. This cyclic architecture is proposed as a key mechanism for cellular memory, drawing analogies to memory functions in computers, such as input, read, write, execute, and erase. The interconnected cycles within the CDCN, including metabolic cycles and signaling pathways, are suggested to function akin to latches in computer memory, contributing to the storage and processing of cellular information beyond nucleic acid sequences. Understanding cellular memory through this cyclic network model offers a new perspective on heredity, cell processes, and the potential disruptions in disease pathology.

Abstract:
In recent decades, it has been emphasized that the evolving structure of networks may be shaped by interaction principles that yield sparse graphs with a vertex degree distribution exhibiting an algebraic tail, and other structural traits that are not featured in traditional random graphs. In this respect, through a mean-field approach, this review tackles the statistical physics of graph models based on the interaction principle of duplication-divergence. Additional sophistications extending the duplication-divergence model are also reviewed as well as generalizations of other known models. Possible research gaps and related prior results are then discussed.

Abstract:
We study the impact of noise on attractor dynamics in Boolean networks, focusing on their stability and transition behaviors. By constructing attractor matrices based on single-node perturbations, we propose a framework to quantify attractor stability and identify dominant attractors. We find that attractors are more stable than predicted by basin sizes, showing the importance of dynamical structure in noisy environments. In addition, under global perturbations, basin sizes dictate long-term behavior; under local noise, however, attractor dominance is determined by noise-induced transition patterns rather than basin sizes. Our results show that transition dynamics induced by stochastic perturbations provide an efficient and quantitative description for the attractor stability and dynamics in Boolean networks under noise.

Abstract:
We present a novel framework for chemical learning based on Competitive Dimerization Networks (CDNs) - systems in which multiple molecular species, e.g. proteins or DNA/RNA oligomers, reversibly bind to form dimers. We show that these networks can be trained in vitro through directed evolution, enabling the implementation of complex learning tasks such as multiclass classification without digital hardware or explicit parameter tuning. Each molecular species functions analogously to a neuron, with binding affinities acting as tunable synaptic weights. A training protocol involving mutation, selection, and amplification of DNA-based components allows CDNs to robustly discriminate among noisy input patterns. The resulting classifiers exhibit strong output contrast and high mutual information between input and output, especially when guided by a contrast-enhancing loss function. Comparative analysis with in silico gradient descent training reveals closely correlated performance. These results establish CDNs as a promising platform for analog physical computation, bridging synthetic biology and machine learning, and advancing the development of adaptive, energy-efficient molecular computing systems.

Abstract:
Cyclodextrins (CDs) are cyclic oligosaccharides composed of glucopyranose units bonded together to form a truncated cone that can make inclusion complexes with guest molecules. The α, \b{eta}, and γ-CDs, which respectively comprise six, seven or eight glucopyranose units, are used extensively in pharmaceutical formulations as functional excipients. The cavity sizes of all three natural CDs have been approximated using static structures but a growing consensus is that the CDs are flexible; moreover, the size range of molecules that CDs can accommodate has not been systematically studied. Here the results of molecular dynamics simulations performed using spherical continuum probe particles of different sizes to observe the complex-forming behaviour of CDs are presented. Results revealed that CDs can make dynamic complexes with guest molecules that are larger than their reported cavity sizes.

Abstract:
Boolean networks, inspired by gene regulatory networks, were developed to understand the complex behaviors observed in biological systems, with network attractors corresponding to biological phenotypes or cell types. In this article, we present a proof for a conjecture by Williadsen, Triesch and Wiles about upper bounds for the stability of basins of attraction in Boolean networks. We further extend this result from a single basin of attraction to the entire network. Specifically, we demonstrate that the asymptotic upper bound for the robustness and the basin entropy of a Boolean network are negatively linearly related.

Abstract:
We present a chemical reaction network that is unstable under deterministic mass action kinetics, exhibiting finite-time blow-up of trajectories in the interior of the state space, but whose stochastic counterpart is positive recurrent. This provides an example of noise-induced stabilization of the model's dynamics arising due to noise perturbing transversally the divergent trajectories of the system that is independently of boundary effects. The proof is based on a careful decomposition of the state space and the construction of suitable Lyapunov functions in each region.

Abstract:
Knowing which parts of a complex system have identical roles simplifies computations and reveals patterns in its network structure. Group theory has been applied to study symmetries in unweighted networks. However, in real-world weighted networks, edge weights are rarely equal, making exact symmetry uncommon. To study symmetries in weighted networks, we aggregate edge weights into a small number of discrete categories. The symmetries of these aggregated networks identify vertices with similar roles in the original weighted network.   In food webs, this approach helps to quantify ecological co-existence and competition by assessing the functional substitutability of species. We apply our method to 250 empirical food webs, finding that symmetric vertices emerge even under weak approximations, typically forming small orbits of size two or three. These symmetric vertices can appear at any trophic level or network position. We also apply three symmetry measures to compare structural patterns at the network level.

Abstract:
Background: Radiation-induced leukopenia caused by low-dose exposure is frequently associated with Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) syndromes like "blood deficiency" and "fatigue syndrome". Ci Bai Capsule (CB) has been reported to enhance white blood cell levels; however, its mechanisms and bioactive compounds remain unclear.Aim: This study aimed to identify the bioactive compounds group of CB and elucidate its potential mechanisms in radiation-induced leukopenia.Methods: Syndrome-related data were gathered from SYMMAP and CTD database. CB's target profile is predicted by DrugCIPHER. Network pharmacology approaches were employed to identify active compounds and related pathways. Experimental validation was conducted through flow cytometry and RNA-sequencing in both ex vivo and in vivo models.Results: A total of 22 pathways related to cellular processes, immune responses, and signal transduction were identified. Five key bioactive compounds (kaempferol-3-glucorhamnoside, syringin, schisandrin, 3-hydroxytyrosol 3-O-glucoside and salidroside) were found to significantly modulate syndrome-related pathways. Optimal dosing of this compound combination enhanced leukocyte counts and splenic immune cell proliferation in irradiated mice. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that the compounds exert regulatory effects on PP1A, RB, CDK4/6, CDK2, and CDK1, thereby modulating downstream immune and hematopoietic markers such as MNDA, BST2, and HSPA1A.Conclusion: Our findings suggest that CB mitigates radiation-induced leukopenia by enhancing immune and hematopoietic recovery, offering a promising therapeutic approach for managing radiation-related hematological disorders.

Abstract:
The complex regulatory dynamics of a biological network can be succinctly captured using discrete logic models. Given even sparse time-course data from the system of interest, previous work has shown that global optimization schemes are suitable for proposing logic models that explain the data and make predictions about how the system will behave under varying conditions. Considering the large scale of the parameter search spaces associated with these regulatory systems, performance optimizations on the level of both hardware and software are necessary for making this a practical tool for in silico pharmaceutical research. We show here how the implementation of these global optimization algorithms in a GPU-computing environment can accelerate the solution of these parameter search problems considerably. We carry out parameter searches on two model biological regulatory systems that represent almost an order of magnitude scale-up in complexity, and we find the gains in efficiency from GPU to be a 33%-43% improvement compared to multi-thread CPU implementations and a 33%-1866% increase compared to CPU in serial. These improvements make global optimization of logic model identification a far more attractive and feasible method for in silico hypothesis generation and design of experiments.

Abstract:
Biomolecular networks, such as protein-protein interactions, gene-gene associations, and cell-cell interactions, offer valuable insights into the complex organization of biological systems. These networks are key to understanding cellular functions, disease mechanisms, and identifying therapeutic targets. However, their analysis is challenged by the high dimensionality, heterogeneity, and sparsity of multi-omics data. Random walk algorithms are widely used to propagate information through disease modules, helping to identify disease-associated genes and uncover relevant biological pathways. In this work, we investigate the limitations of classical random walks and explore the potential of quantum random walks (QRWs) for biomolecular network analysis. We evaluate QRWs in two network-based applications. First, in a gene-gene interaction network associated with asthma, autism, and schizophrenia, QRWs more accurately rank disease-associated genes compared to classical methods. Second, in a structured multi-partite cell-cell interaction network derived from mouse brown adipose tissue, QRWs identify key driver genes in malignant cells that are overlooked by classical random walks. Our findings suggest that quantum random walks offer a promising alternative to classical approaches, with improved sensitivity to network structure and better performance in identifying biologically relevant features. This highlights their potential in advancing network medicine and systems biology.

Abstract:
We derive a single-cell level understanding of metabolism in an isogenic cyanobacterial population by integrating secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) derived multi-isotope uptake measurements of Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 with a statistical inference protocol based on Liebig's law of the minimum, the maximum entropy principle, and constraint-based modeling. We find the population is structured in two metabolically distinct clusters: cells optimizing carbon yield while excessively turning over nitrogen, and cells which act reciprocally, optimizing nitrogen yield and excessively turning over carbon. This partition enables partial heterotrophy within the population via metabolic exchange, likely in the form of organic acids. Exchange increases the feasible metabolic space, and mixotrophic cells achieve the fastest growth rates. Metabolic flux analysis at the single-cell level reveals heterogeneity in carbon fixation rates, Rubisco specificity, and nitrogen assimilation. Our results provide a necessary foundation for understanding how population level phenotypes arise from the collective contributions of distinct individuals.

Abstract:
Protein sequestration motifs appear in many biological regulatory networks and introduce special properties into the network dynamics. Sequestration can be described as a mode of inactivation of a given protein by its binding to a second protein to form a new complex. In this complexed form, the original protein is prevented from performing its specific functions and is thus rendered inactive. We study a mathematical model of the mammalian circadian clock with a protein sequestration motif, which generates one of the negative feedback loops that guarantees periodic behavior. First, the motif permits a time-scale separation, which can be used to simplify the model. We show that the simplified model admits a periodic orbit over a fairly large region of parameters. Second, we are able to show that the sequestration motif induces a phase response curve with a very specific form, implying that external perturbations can affect the system only in a narrow window of the periodic orbit. Finally, we compare our model with a classic Goodwin oscillator, to illustrate the dynamical and robustness properties induced by the protein sequestration motif.

Abstract:
Climate change is a major threat to crop potential and is characterized by both long-term shifts in temperature and precipitation patterns as well as increased occurrence of extreme weather events, these extreme weather events are the most immediate and intractable threat to agriculture. Crop resilience in the face of stress depends upon the speed and effectiveness with which plants and cropping systems sense and respond to that stress. A variety of agronomic practices including breeding, exogenous inputs (nutrients, water, biostimulants and others) and shifts in cultivation practice have been used to influence plant stress response to achieve the goal of increased plant and cropping system resilience. Traditional breeding is a powerful tool that has resulted in stable and long-term cultivar improvements but is often too slow and complex to meet the diverse, complex and unpredictable challenges of climate induced stresses. Increased inputs (water, nutrients, pesticides etc.) and management strategies (cropping system choice, soil management etc.) can alleviate stress but are often constrained by cost and availability of inputs. Exogenous biostimulants, microbials and plant hormones have shown great promise as mechanisms to optimize natural plant resilience resulting in immediate but non-permanent improvements in plant responses to climate induced stresses. The failure to modernize regulatory frameworks for the use of biostimulants in agriculture will constrain the development of safe effective tools and deprive growers of means to respond to the vagaries of climate change. Here we discuss the scientific rationale for eliminating the regulatory barriers that constrain the potential for biostimulants or products that modulate plant regulatory networks to address climate change challenges and propose a framework for enabling legislation to strengthen cropping system resilience.

Abstract:
We introduce the boundary reproduction number, adapted from the next generation matrix method, to assess whether an infusion of species will persist or become exhausted in a chemical reaction system. Our main contributions are as follows: (a) we show how the concept of a siphon, prevalent in Petri nets and chemical reaction network theory, identifies sets of species that may become depleted at steady state, analogous to a disease-free boundary steady state; (b) we develop an approach for incorporating biochemically motivated conservation laws, which allows the stability of boundary steady states to be determined within specific compatibility classes; and (c) we present an effective heuristic for decomposing the Jacobian of the system that reduces the computational complexity required to compute the stability domain of a boundary steady state. The boundary reproduction number approach significantly simplifies existing parameter-dependent methods for determining the stability of boundary steady states in chemical reaction systems and has implications for the capacity of critical metabolites and substrates in metabolic pathways to become exhausted.

Abstract:
Molecular computation based on chemical reaction networks (CRNs) has emerged as a promising paradigm for designing programmable biochemical systems. However, the implementation of complex computations still requires excessively large and intricate network structures, largely due to the limited understanding of composability, that is, how multiple subsystems can be coupled while preserving computational functionality. Existing composability frameworks primarily focus on rate-independent CRNs, whose computational capabilities are severely restricted. This article aims to establish a systematic framework for composable CRNs governed by mass-action kinetics, a common type of rate-dependent CRNs. Drawing upon the concepts of composable rate-independent CRNs, we introduce the notions of mass-action chemical reaction computers (msCRCs), dynamic computation and dynamic composability to establish a rigorous mathematical framework for composing two or more msCRCs to achieve layer-by-layer computation of composite functions. Further, we derive several sufficient conditions based on the notions of input-to-state stability (ISS) to characterize msCRCs that can be composed to implement desired molecular computations, thereby providing theoretical support for this framework. Some examples are presented to illustrate the efficiency of our method. Finally, comparative results demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits notable advantages in both computational ability and accuracy over the state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract:
Cell sensory transcription networks are the intracellular computation structure that regulates and drives cellular activity. Activity in these networks determines the the cell's ability to adapt to changes in its environment. Resilient cells successfully identify (classify) and appropriately respond to environmental shifts. We present a model for identification and response to environmental changes in resilient bacteria. This model combines two known motifs in transcription networks: dense overlapping regulons (DORs) and single input modules (SIMs). DORs have the ability to perform cellular decision making and have a network structure similar to that of a shallow neural network, with a number of input transcription factors (TFs) mapping to a distinct set of genes. SIMs contain a master TF that simultaneously activates a number of target genes. Within most observed cell sensory transcription networks, the master transcription factor of SIMs are output genes of a DOR creating a fan-in-fan-out (bowtie) structure in the transcriptional network. We model this hybrid network motif (which we call the DOR2SIM motif) with a superposition of modular nonlinear functions to describe protein signaling in the network and basic mass action kinetics to describe the other chemical reactions in this process. We analyze this model's biological feasibility and capacity to perform classification, the first step in adaptation. We provide sufficient conditions for models of the DOR2SIM motif to classify constant (environmental) inputs. These conditions suggest that generally low monomer degradation rates as well as low expression of source node genes at equilibrium in the DOR component enable classification.

Abstract:
Trajectory mutual information is frequently used to quantify information transfer in biochemical systems. Tractable solutions of the trajectory mutual information can be obtained via the widely used Linear-Noise Approximation (LNA) using Gaussian channel theory. This approach is expected to be accurate for sufficiently large systems. However, recent observations show that there are cases, where the mutual information obtained this way differs qualitatively from results derived using an exact Markov jump process formalism, and that the differences persist even for large systems. In this letter, we show that these differences can be explained by introducing the notion of reaction- versus state-based descriptions of trajectories. In chemical systems, the information is encoded in the sequence of reaction events, and the reaction-based trajectories of Markov jump processes capture this information. In contrast, the commonly used form of the LNA uses a state (concentration) based description of trajectories, which contains, in general, less information than a reaction-based description. Here, we show that an alternative formulation of the LNA that retains the reaction-specific information of trajectories can accurately describe the trajectory mutual information for large systems. We illustrate the consequences of different trajectory descriptions for two common cellular reaction motifs and discuss the connection with Berg-Purcell and Maximum-Likelihood sensing.

Abstract:
Accurate molecular property prediction (MPP) is a critical step in modern drug development. However, the scarcity of experimental validation data poses a significant challenge to AI-driven research paradigms. Under few-shot learning scenarios, the quality of molecular representations directly dictates the theoretical upper limit of model performance. We present AdaptMol, a prototypical network integrating Adaptive multimodal fusion for Molecular representation. This framework employs a dual-level attention mechanism to dynamically integrate global and local molecular features derived from two modalities: SMILES sequences and molecular graphs. (1) At the local level, structural features such as atomic interactions and substructures are extracted from molecular graphs, emphasizing fine-grained topological information; (2) At the global level, the SMILES sequence provides a holistic representation of the molecule. To validate the necessity of multimodal adaptive fusion, we propose an interpretable approach based on identifying molecular active substructures to demonstrate that multimodal adaptive fusion can efficiently represent molecules. Extensive experiments on three commonly used benchmarks under 5-shot and 10-shot settings demonstrate that AdaptMol achieves state-of-the-art performance in most cases. The rationale-extracted method guides the fusion of two modalities and highlights the importance of both modalities.

Abstract:
The G-protein coupled receptors EP2 and EP4 both transduce the signal of the lipid messenger Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Changes in the cell response to PGE2 can have important effects on immunity and development of diseases, however, a thorough understanding of the EP2-EP4 receptors' signaling pathways is lacking. Experimental data show that receptor activity (indicated by cAMP expression) has a different kinetics depending on which receptor is triggered by PGE2 and that crosstalk exists between EP2 and EP4. To better understand the underlying mechanisms and be able to predict cell responses to PGE2, we develop novel mathematical models for the cAMP signaling pathways of EP2 and EP4 and their crosstalk. Ligand binding dynamics plays a crucial role for both, the single receptor activity and their crosstalk. The mathematical models can predict the qualitative cAMP levels observed experimentally and provide possible explanations for the differences and commonalities in the signaling behavior of EP2 and EP4. As inhibition of PGE2 signaling is gaining increasing attention in tumor immunology, these mathematical models could contribute to design effective anti-tumor therapies targeting EP2 and EP4.

Abstract:
Embryonic development relies on the formation of sharp, precise gene expression boundaries. In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, boundary formation has been proposed to occur at a dynamical critical point. Yet, in the paradigmatic case of the hunchback (hb) gene, evidence suggests that boundary formation occurs in a bistable regime, not at the dynamical critical point. We develop a minimal model for hb expression and identify a single parameter that tunes the system from its monostable regime to its bistable regime, crossing the critical point in between. We find that boundary precision is maximized when the system is weakly bistable--near, but not at, the critical point--optimally negotiating the tradeoff between two key effects of bistability: sharpening the boundary and amplifying its noise. Incorporating the diffusion of Hb proteins into our model, we show that boundary precision is maximized simultaneously at an optimal degree of bistability and an optimal diffusion strength. Our work elucidates design principles of precise boundary formation and has general implications for pattern formation in multicellular systems.

Abstract:
Network science has become an essential interdisciplinary tool for understanding complex biological systems. However, because these systems undergo continuous, often stimulus-driven changes in both structure and function, traditional static network approaches frequently fall short in capturing their dynamic nature. Dynamic network analysis (DNA) addresses this limitation and offers a powerful framework to investigate these evolving relationships. This work focuses on temporal networks, a central paradigm within DNA, as an effective approach for modelling time-resolved changes in biological systems. While DNA has gained traction in domains like social and communication sciences, its integration in biology has been more gradual, hindered by data limitations and the need for domain-specific adaptations. Aimed at supporting researchers, particularly those new to the field, the review offers an integrative overview of the diverse and multidisciplinary landscape of DNA, with a focus on temporal networks in systems biology. I begin by clarifying foundational terminology and concepts, then present a multi-scale perspective spanning microscale (nodes and edges), mesoscale (motifs and communities), and macroscale (global topology) analyses. Finally, I explore analytical strategies and computational tools suited to various research objectives, including methods for detecting structural shifts, assessing network similarity, tracking module evolution, and predictive modelling of future network states.

Abstract:
Gene regulatory network (GRN) inference serves as a cornerstone for deciphering cellular decision-making processes. Early approaches rely exclusively on gene expression data, thus their predictive power remain fundamentally constrained by the vast combinatorial space of potential gene-gene interactions. Subsequent methods integrate prior knowledge to mitigate this challenge by restricting the solution space to biologically plausible interactions. However, we argue that the effectiveness of these approaches is contingent upon the precision of prior information and the reduction in the search space will circumscribe the models' potential for novel biological discoveries. To address these limitations, we introduce KINDLE, a three-stage framework that decouples GRN inference from prior knowledge dependencies. KINDLE trains a teacher model that integrates prior knowledge with temporal gene expression dynamics and subsequently distills this encoded knowledge to a student model, enabling accurate GRN inference solely from expression data without access to any prior. KINDLE achieves state-of-the-art performance across four benchmark datasets. Notably, it successfully identifies key transcription factors governing mouse embryonic development and precisely characterizes their functional roles. In mouse hematopoietic stem cell data, KINDLE accurately predicts fate transition outcomes following knockout of two critical regulators (Gata1 and Spi1). These biological validations demonstrate our framework's dual capability in maintaining topological inference precision while preserving discovery potential for novel biological mechanisms.

Abstract:
How do we enable artificial intelligence models to improve themselves? This is central to exponentially improving generalized artificial intelligence models, which can improve their own architecture to handle new problem domains in an efficient manner that leverages the latest hardware. However, current automated compilation methods are poor, and efficient algorithms require years of human development. In this paper, we use neural circuit diagrams, based in category theory, to prove a general theorem related to deep learning algorithms, guide the development of a novel attention algorithm catered to the domain of gene regulatory networks, and produce a corresponding efficient kernel. The algorithm we propose, spherical attention, shows that neural circuit diagrams enable a principled and systematic method for reasoning about deep learning architectures and providing high-performance code. By replacing SoftMax with an $L^2$ norm as suggested by diagrams, it overcomes the special function unit bottleneck of standard attention while retaining the streaming property essential to high-performance. Our diagrammatically derived \textit{FlashSign} kernel achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art, fine-tuned FlashAttention algorithm on an A100, and $3.6\times$ the performance of PyTorch. Overall, this investigation shows neural circuit diagrams' suitability as a high-level framework for the automated development of efficient, novel artificial intelligence architectures.

Abstract:
Biochemical systems are inherently stochastic, particularly those with small-molecule populations. The spatial distribution of molecules plays a critical role and requires the inclusion of spatial coordinates in their analysis. Stochastic models such as the chemical master equation are commonly used to study these systems. However, analytical solutions are limited to specific cases, and stochastic simulations require significant computational resources. To mitigate these challenges, approximation methods, such as the moment approach, reduce the system to a set of ordinary differential equations, thereby lowering the computational requirements. This study investigates the conditions under which the second-moment approach yields exact results during the dynamic evolution of chemical reaction-diffusion networks. The analysis encompasses second-order or higher-order reactions and Hill functions without relying on higher-order moment estimations or closure approximations. Starting with stationary states, we extended the analysis to a dynamic evolution. An enzymatic process and an antithetic feedback system were examined for purely reactive systems, demonstrating the approach's accuracy in capturing system behavior and quantifying errors. The study was further extended to genetic regulatory networks governed by Hill functions, including both purely reactive and reaction-diffusion systems, validating the method in spatially distributed contexts. This framework enables precise characterization of biochemical systems, avoiding information loss typically associated with approximations and allowing for stability analysis under fluctuations. These findings optimize computational strategies while providing insights into intracellular signaling and regulatory processes, paving the way for efficient and accurate stochastic modeling in biochemical systems.

Abstract:
All cells respond to changes in both their internal milieu and the environment around them through the regulation of their genes. Despite decades of effort, there remain huge gaps in our knowledge of both the function of many genes (the so-called y-ome) and how they adapt to changing environments via regulation. Here we describe a joint experimental and theoretical dissection of the regulation of a broad array of over 100 biologically interesting genes in E. coli across 39 diverse environments, permitting us to discover the binding sites and transcription factors that mediate regulatory control. Using a combination of mutagenesis, massively parallel reporter assays, mass spectrometry and tools from information theory and statistical physics, we go from complete ignorance of a promoter's environment-dependent regulatory architecture to predictive models of its behavior. As a proof of principle of the biological insights to be gained from such a study, we chose a combination of genes from the y-ome, toxin-antitoxin pairs, and genes hypothesized to be part of regulatory modules; in all cases, we discovered a host of new insights into their underlying regulatory landscape and resulting biological function.

We investigate the diffusion approximation of reaction networks with mass-action kinetics, focusing on the identifiability of the generator of the associated stochastic differential equations. We derive conditions under which the law of the diffusion approximation is identifiable and provide theorems for verifying identifiability in practice. Notably, our results show that some reaction networks have non-identifiable reaction rates, even when the law of the corresponding stochastic process is completely known. Moreover, we show that reaction networks with distinct graphical structures can generate the same diffusion law under specific choices of reaction rates. Finally, we compare our framework with identifiability results in the deterministic ODE setting and the discrete continuous-time Markov chain models for reaction networks.

Abstract:
Genes are connected in complex networks of interactions where often the product of one gene is a transcription factor that alters the expression of another. Many of these networks are based on a few fundamental motifs leading to switches and oscillators of various kinds. And yet, there is more to the story than which transcription factors control these various circuits. These transcription factors are often themselves under the control of effector molecules that bind them and alter their level of activity. Traditionally, much beautiful work has shown how to think about the stability of the different states achieved by these fundamental regulatory architectures by examining how parameters such as transcription rates, degradation rates and dissociation constants tune the circuit, giving rise to behavior such as bistability. However, such studies explore dynamics without asking how these quantities are altered in real time in living cells as opposed to at the fingertips of the synthetic biologist's pipette or on the computational biologist's computer screen. In this paper, we make a departure from the conventional dynamical systems view of these regulatory motifs by using statistical mechanical models to focus on endogenous signaling knobs such as effector concentrations rather than on the convenient but more experimentally remote knobs such as dissociation constants, transcription rates and degradation rates that are often considered. We also contrast the traditional use of Hill functions to describe transcription factor binding with more detailed thermodynamic models. This approach provides insights into how biological parameters are tuned to control the stability of regulatory motifs in living cells, sometimes revealing quite a different picture than is found by using Hill functions and tuning circuit parameters by hand.

Abstract:
Feedback in cellular processes is typically inferred through cellular responses to experimental perturbations. Modular response analysis provides a theoretical framework for translating specific perturbations into feedback sensitivities between cellular modules. However, in large-scale drug perturbation studies the effect of any given drug may not be known and may not only affect one module at a time. Here, we analyze the response of gene expression models to random perturbations that affect multiple modules simultaneously. In the deterministic regime we analytically show how cellular responses to infinitesimal random perturbations can be used to infer the nature of feedback regulation in gene expression, as long as the effects of perturbations are statistically independent between modules. We numerically extend this deterministic analysis to the response of average abundances of stochastic gene expression models to finite perturbations. Across a large sample of stochastic models, the response of average abundances generally obeyed predicted bounds from the deterministic analysis, but dramatic deviations occurred in systems with bimodal or fat-tailed stationary state distributions. These discrepancies demonstrate how deterministic analyses can fail to capture the effect of perturbations on averages of stochastic cellular feedback systems--even in the linear response regime.

Abstract:
Using the Monty Hall probability problem as a model system, we ask whether simple chemical reaction mechanisms can implement optimal strategies for non-trivial decision making. In this puzzle, a contestant chooses one of three doors (only one hides a prize), the host, knowing the content, opens another door revealing no prize, and finally the contestant must decide whether to stay with the original choice or switch to the remaining closed door. Assigning distinct molecular species to the player, initial choice, reveal step, and final decision, we encode the problem in mass-action kinetics. For pseudo-first-order conditions, tuning a single rate constant shifts the network continuously between "always-stay" (1/3 success) and "always-switch" (2/3 success) regimes. We derive closed-form, time-dependent expressions for the success kinetics, concluding with a brief discussion of proposed DNA strand-displacement implementations and kinetically hard-wired molecular decision-making.

Abstract:
Cellular response to environmental and internal signals can be modeled by dynamical gene regulatory networks (GRN). In the literature, three main classes of gene network models can be distinguished: (i) non-quantitative (or data-based) models which do not describe the probability distribution of gene expressions; (ii) quantitative models which fully describe the probability distribution of all genes coexpression; and (iii) mechanistic models which allow for a causal interpretation of gene interactions. We propose two rigorous frameworks to model gene alteration in a dynamical GRN, depending on whether the network model is quantitative or mechanistic. We explain how these models can be used for design of experiment, or, if additional alteration data are available, for validation purposes or to improve the parameter estimation of the original model. We apply these methods to the Gaussian graphical model, which is quantitative but non-mechanistic, and to mechanistic models of Bayesian networks and penalized linear regression.

Abstract:
Quantitative Systems Pharmacology (QSP) promises to accelerate drug development, enable personalized medicine, and improve the predictability of clinical outcomes. Realizing this potential requires effectively managing the complexity of mathematical models representing biological systems. Here, we present and validate a novel QSP workflow--CRISP (Contextualized Reduction for Identifiability and Scientific Precision)--that addresses a central challenge in QSP: the problem of complexity and over-parameterization, in which models contain irrelevant parameters that obscure interpretation and hinder predictive reliability. The CRISP workflow begins with a literature-derived model, constructed to be comprehensive and unbiased by integrating prior mechanistic insights. At the core of the workflow is the Manifold Boundary Approximation Method (MBAM), a reduction technique that simplifies models while preserving mechanistic structure and predictive fidelity. By applying MBAM in a context-specific manner, CRISP links parsimonious models directly to predictions of interest, clarifying causal structure and enhancing interpretability. The resulting models are computationally efficient and well-suited to key QSP tasks, including virtual population generation, experimental design, toxicology, and target discovery. We demonstrate the utility of CRISP on case studies involving the coagulation cascade and SHIV infection, and identify promising directions for improving the efficacy of bNAb therapies for HIV. Together, these results establish CRISP as a general-purpose QSP workflow for turning complex mechanistic models into tools for precise scientific reasoning to guide pharmacological and regulatory decision-making.

Abstract:
Cellular reprogramming, the artificial transformation of one cell type into another, has been attracting increasing research attention due to its therapeutic potential for complex diseases. However, identifying effective reprogramming strategies through classical wet-lab experiments is hindered by lengthy time commitments and high costs.   In this study, we explore the use of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to control Boolean network models of complex biological systems, such as gene regulatory and signalling pathway networks. We formulate a novel control problem for Boolean network models under the asynchronous update mode, specifically in the context of cellular reprogramming. To solve it, we devise GATTACA, a scalable computational framework.   To facilitate scalability of our framework, we consider previously introduced concept of a pseudo-attractor and improve the procedure for effective identification of pseudo-attractor states. We then incorporate graph neural networks with graph convolution operations into the artificial neural network approximator of the DRL agent's action-value function. This allows us to leverage the available knowledge on the structure of a biological system and to indirectly, yet effectively, encode the system's modelled dynamics into a latent representation.   Experiments on several large-scale, real-world biological networks from the literature demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract:
DNA microarray technology enables the simultaneous measurement of expression levels of thousands of genes, thereby facilitating the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying complex diseases such as brain tumors and the identification of diagnostic genetic signatures. To derive meaningful biological insights from the high-dimensional and complex gene features obtained through this technology and to analyze gene properties in detail, classical AI-based approaches such as machine learning and deep learning are widely employed. However, these methods face various limitations in managing high-dimensional vector spaces and modeling the intricate relationships among genes. In particular, challenges such as hyperparameter tuning, computational costs, and high processing power requirements can hinder their efficiency. To overcome these limitations, quantum computing and quantum AI approaches are gaining increasing attention. Leveraging quantum properties such as superposition and entanglement, quantum methods enable more efficient parallel processing of high-dimensional data and offer faster and more effective solutions to problems that are computationally demanding for classical methods. In this study, a novel model called "Deep VQC" is proposed, based on the Variational Quantum Classifier approach. Developed using microarray data containing 54,676 gene features, the model successfully classified four different types of brain tumors-ependymoma, glioblastoma, medulloblastoma, and pilocytic astrocytoma-alongside healthy samples with high accuracy. Furthermore, compared to classical ML algorithms, our model demonstrated either superior or comparable classification performance. These results highlight the potential of quantum AI methods as an effective and promising approach for the analysis and classification of complex structures such as brain tumors based on gene expression features.

Abstract:
We extend the traditional framework of steady state energy transduction -- typically characterized by a single input and output -- to multi-resource transduction in open chemical reaction networks (CRNs). Transduction occurs when stoichiometrically balanced processes are driven against their spontaneous directions by coupling them with thermodynamically favorable ones. However, when multiple processes (resources) interact through a shared CRN, identifying the relevant set of processes for analyzing transduction becomes a critical and complex challenge. To address this, we introduce a systematic procedure based on elementary processes, which cannot be further decomposed into subprocesses. Our theory generalizes the methodology used to define transduction efficiency in thermal engines operating between multiple heat baths. By selecting a reference equilibrium environment, it explicitly reveals the inherently relative nature of transduction efficiency and ties its definition to exergy. This framework also allows one to exclude unusable outputs from efficiency calculations. We further extend the concept of chemical gears to multi-process transduction, demonstrating their versatility as an analytical tool in complex settings. Finally, we apply our framework to central metabolic pathways, uncovering deep insights into their operation and highlighting the crucial difference between thermodynamic efficiencies and stoichiometric yields.

Abstract:
Molecular chirality is critical to biochemical function, but it is unknown when chiral selectivity first became important in the evolutionary transition from geochemistry to biochemistry during the emergence of life. Here, we identify key transitions in the selection of chiral molecules in metabolic evolution, showing how achiral molecules (lacking chiral centers) may have given rise to specific and abundant chiral molecules in the elaboration of metabolic networks from geochemically available precursor molecules. Simulated expansions of biosphere-scale metabolism suggest new hypotheses about the evolution of chiral molecules within biochemistry, including a prominent role for both achiral and chiral compounds as nucleation sites of early metabolic network growth, an increasing enrichment of molecules with more chiral centers as these networks expand, and conservation of broken chiral symmetries along reaction pathways as a general organizing principle. We also find an unexpected enrichment in large, non-polymeric achiral molecules. Leveraging metabolic data of 40,023 genomes and metagenomes, we analyzed the statistics of chiral and achiral molecules in the large-scale organization of metabolism, revealing a chiral-enriched phase of network organization evidenced by system-size dependent chiral scaling laws that differ for individuals and ecosystems. By uncovering how metabolic networks could lead to chiral selection, our findings open new avenues for bridging metabolism and genetics-first approaches to the origin of chirality, allowing tools for better timing of major transitions in molecular organization during the emergence of life, understanding the role of chirality in extant and synthetic metabolisms, and informing targets for chirality-based biosignatures.

Abstract:
The inference of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) is a foundational stride towards deciphering the fundamentals of complex biological systems. Inferring a possible regulatory link between two genes can be formulated as a link prediction problem. Inference of GRNs via gene coexpression profiling data may not always reflect true biological interactions, as its susceptibility to noise and misrepresenting true biological regulatory relationships. Most GRN inference methods face several challenges in the network reconstruction phase. Therefore, it is important to encode gene expression values, leverege the prior knowledge gained from the available inferred network structures and positional informations of the input network nodes towards inferring a better and more confident GRN network reconstruction. In this paper, we explore the integration of multiple inferred networks to enhance the inference of Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs). Primarily, we employ autoencoder embeddings to capture gene expression patterns directly from raw data, preserving intricate biological signals. Then, we embed the prior knowledge from GRN structures transforming them into a text-like representation using random walks, which are then encoded with a masked language model, BERT, to generate global embeddings for each gene across all networks. Additionally, we embed the positional encodings of the input gene networks to better identify the position of each unique gene within the graph. These embeddings are integrated into graph transformer-based model, termed GT-GRN, for GRN inference. The GT-GRN model effectively utilizes the topological structure of the ground truth network while incorporating the enriched encoded information. Experimental results demonstrate that GT-GRN significantly outperforms existing GRN inference methods, achieving superior accuracy and highlighting the robustness of our approach.

Abstract:
There is an abundance of highly stochastic, non-linear phenomena present in population dynamics across various fields, including molecular biology, epidemiology, and ecology. Oscillations and multi-stability are particularly prevalent in gene regulation systems. None of the currently available stochastic models for population dynamics are accurate and computationally efficient for long-term predictions. A prominent model in this field, known as the Linear Noise Approximation (LNA), is computationally efficient for tasks such as simulation, sensitivity analysis, and parameter estimation, still, it is only accurate for linear systems and short-time predictions. Other models may achieve greater accuracy across a broader range of systems, but they sacrifice computational efficiency and analytical tractability. This paper demonstrates that, with specific modifications, the LNA can indeed accurately capture non-linear dynamics in population dynamics. We introduce a new framework that employs centre manifold theory, a classical concept in non-linear dynamical systems. This approach allows us to identify simple, specialised modifications to the LNA tailored to classes of qualitatively similar non-linear dynamical systems. With these modifications, the LNA can achieve accurate long-term predictions without compromising its computational efficiency. We apply our methodology to a class of oscillatory systems and a class of bi-stable systems, and we provide multiple examples in molecular population dynamics that showcase accurate long-term predictions, and significant improvements in computational efficiency.

Abstract:
The evolution of chemical reaction networks is often analyzed through kinetic models and energy landscapes, but these approaches fail to capture the deeper structural constraints governing complexity growth. In chemical reaction networks, emergent constraints dictate the organization of reaction pathways, limiting combinatorial expansion and determining stability conditions. This paper introduces a novel approach to modeling chemical reaction networks by incorporating differential geometry into the classical framework of reaction kinetics. By utilizing the Riemannian metric, Christoffel symbols, and a system-specific entropy-like term, we provide a new method for understanding the evolution of complex reaction systems. The approach captures the interdependence between species, the curvature of the reaction network's configuration space, and the tendency of the system to evolve toward more probable states. The interaction topology constrains the accessible reaction trajectories and the introduced differential geometrical approach allows analysis of curvature constraints which help us to understand pathway saturation and transition dynamics. Rather than treating reaction space as an unconstrained combinatorial landscape, we frame it as a structured manifold with higher order curvature describing a geodesic for system evolution under intrinsic constraints. This geometrical perspective offers a unique insight into pathway saturation, self-interruption, and emergent behavior in reaction networks, and provides a scalable framework for modeling large biochemical or catalytic systems.

Abstract:
A continuing frustration for origin of life scientists is that abiotic and, by extension, pre-biotic attempts to develop self-sustaining, evolving molecular systems tend to produce more dead-end substances than macromolecular products with the necessary potential for biostructure and function -- the so-called `tar problem'. Nevertheless primordial life somehow emerged despite that presumed handicap. A~resolution of this problem is important in emergence-of-life science because it would provide valuable guidance in choosing subsequent paths of investigation, such as identifying pre-biotic patterns on Mars. To study the problem we set up a simple non-equilibrium flow dynamical model for the coupled temperature and mass dynamics of the decomposition of a polymeric carbohydrate adsorbed on a mineral surface, with incident stochastic thermal fluctuations. Results show that the model system behaves as a reciprocating thermochemical oscillator. The output fluctuation distribution is bimodal, with a right-weighted component that guarantees a bias towards detachment and desorption of monomeric species such as ribose, even while tar is formed concomitantly. This fluctuating thermochemical reciprocator may ensure that non-performing polymers can be fractionated into a refractory carbon reservoir and active monomers which may be reincorporated into better-performing polymers with less vulnerability towards adsorptive tarring.

Abstract:
A physics-informed neural network (PINN) models the dynamics of a system by integrating the governing physical laws into the architecture of a neural network. By enforcing physical laws as constraints, PINN overcomes challenges with data scarsity and potentially high dimensionality. Existing PINN frameworks rely on fully observed time-course data, the acquisition of which could be prohibitive for many systems. In this study, we developed a new PINN learning paradigm, namely Constrained Learning, that enables the approximation of first-order derivatives or motions using non-time course or partially observed data. Computational principles and a general mathematical formulation of Constrained Learning were developed. We further introduced MPOCtrL (Message Passing Optimization-based Constrained Learning) an optimization approach tailored for the Constrained Learning framework that strives to balance the fitting of physical models and observed data. Its code is available at github link: https://github.com/ptdang1001/MPOCtrL Experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrated that MPOCtrL can effectively detect the nonlinear dependency between observed data and the underlying physical properties of the system. In particular, on the task of metabolic flux analysis, MPOCtrL outperforms all existing data-driven flux estimators.

Abstract:
Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) are intricate biological systems that control gene expression and regulation in response to environmental and developmental cues. Advances in computational biology, coupled with high throughput sequencing technologies, have significantly improved the accuracy of GRN inference and modeling. Modern approaches increasingly leverage artificial intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning techniques including supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and contrastive learning to analyze large scale omics data and uncover regulatory gene interactions. To support both the application of GRN inference in studying gene regulation and the development of novel machine learning methods, we present a comprehensive review of machine learning based GRN inference methodologies, along with the datasets and evaluation metrics commonly used. Special emphasis is placed on the emerging role of cutting edge deep learning techniques in enhancing inference performance. The potential future directions for improving GRN inference are also discussed.

Abstract:
The ribosome flow model (RFM) is a phenomenological model for the unidirectional flow of particles along a 1D chain of $n$ sites. The RFM has been extensively used to study the dynamics of ribosome flow along a single mRNA molecule during translation. In this case, the particles model ribosomes and each site corresponds to a consecutive group of codons. Networks of interconnected RFMs have been used to model and analyze large-scale translation in the cell and, in particular, the effects of competition for shared resources. Here, we analyze the RFM with a negative feedback connection from the protein production rate to the initiation rate. This models, for example, the production of proteins that inhibit the translation of their own mRNA. Using tools from the theory of 2-cooperative dynamical systems, we provide a simple condition guaranteeing that the closed-loop system admits at least one non-trivial periodic solution. When this condition holds, we also explicitly characterize a large set of initial conditions such that any solution emanating from this set converges to a non-trivial periodic solution. Such a solution corresponds to a periodic pattern of ribosome densities along the mRNA, and to a periodic pattern of protein production.

Abstract:
Substrate modification networks are ubiquitous in living, biochemical systems. A higher-level hypergraph "skeleton" captures key information about which substrates are transformed in the presence of modification-specific enzymes. Many different detailed models can be associated to the same skeleton, however uncertainty related to model fitting increases with the level of detail. We show that essential dynamical properties such as existence of positive steady states and concentration robustness can be extracted directly from the skeleton independent of the detailed model. The novel formalism of directed hypergraphs is used to prove that bifunctional enzyme action plays a key role in generating robustness. Moreover, we use another novel concept of "current" on a directed hypergraph to establish a link between potentially remote network components. Current is an essential notion required for existence of positive steady states, and furthermore, current-matching combined with bifunctionality generates concentration robustness.

Abstract:
There is growing awareness that the success of pharmacologic interventions on living organisms is significantly impacted by context and timing of exposure. In turn, this complexity has led to an increased focus on regulatory network dynamics in biology and our ability to represent them in a high-fidelity way, in silico. Logic network models show great promise here and their parameter estimation can be formulated as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) that is well-suited to the often sparse, incomplete data in biology. Unfortunately, even in the case of Boolean logic, the combinatorial complexity of these problems grows rapidly, challenging the creation of models at physiologically-relevant scales. That said, quantum computing, while still nascent, facilitates novel information-processing paradigms with the potential for transformative impact in problems such as this one. In this work, we take a first step at actualizing this potential by identifying the structure and Boolean decisional logic of a well-studied network linking 5 proteins involved in the neural development of the mammalian cortical area of the brain. We identify the protein-protein connectivity and binary decisional logic governing this network by formulating it as a Boolean Satisfiability (B-SAT) problem. We employ Grover's algorithm to solve the NP-hard problem faster than the exponential time complexity required by deterministic classical algorithms. Using approaches deployed on both quantum simulators and actual noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) hardware, we accurately recover several high-likelihood models from very sparse protein expression data. The results highlight the differential roles of data types in supporting accurate models; the impact of quantum algorithm design as it pertains to the mutability of quantum hardware; and the opportunities for accelerated discovery enabled by this approach.

Abstract:
The in vitro transcription reaction (IVT) is of growing importance for the manufacture of RNA vaccines and therapeutics. While the kinetics of the microscopic steps of this reaction (promoter binding, initiation, and elongation) are well studied, the rate law of overall RNA synthesis that emerges from this system is unclear. In this work, we show that a model that incorporates both initiation and elongation steps is essential for describing trends in IVT kinetics in conditions relevant to RNA manufacturing. In contrast to previous reports, we find that the IVT reaction can be either initiation- or elongation-limited depending on solution conditions. This initiation-elongation model is also essential for describing the effect of salts, which disrupt polymerase-promoter binding, on transcription rates. Polymerase-polymerase interactions during elongation are incorporated into our modeling framework and found to have nonzero but unidentifiable effects on macroscopic transcription rates. Finally, we develop an extension of our modeling approach to quantitatively describe and experimentally evaluate RNA- and DNA-templated mechanisms for the formation of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) impurities. We show experimental results that indicate that an RNA-templated mechanism is not appropriate for describing macroscopic dsRNA formation in the context of RNA manufacturing.

Abstract:
A detailed understanding of biochemical networks at the molecular level is essential for studying complex cellular processes. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive description of biochemical networks by considering individual atoms and chemical bonds. To address combinatorial complexity, we introduce a well-established approach to group similar types of information within biochemical networks. A conserved moiety is a set of atoms whose association is invariant across all reactions in a network. A reacting moiety is a set of bonds that are either broken, formed, or undergo a change in bond order in at least one reaction in the network. By mathematically identifying these moieties, we establish the biological significance of conserved and reacting moieties according to the mathematical properties of the stoichiometric matrix. We also present a novel decomposition of the stoichiometric matrix based on conserved moieties. This approach bridges the gap between graph theory, linear algebra, and biological interpretation, thus opening up new horizons in the study of chemical reaction networks.

Abstract:
Protein representation learning is critical for numerous biological tasks. Recently, large transformer-based protein language models (pLMs) pretrained on large scale protein sequences have demonstrated significant success in sequence-based tasks. However, pLMs lack structural context. Conversely, graph neural networks (GNNs) designed to leverage 3D structural information have shown promising generalization in protein-related prediction tasks, but their effectiveness is often constrained by the scarcity of labeled structural data. Recognizing that sequence and structural representations are complementary perspectives of the same protein entity, we propose a multimodal bidirectional hierarchical fusion framework to effectively merge these modalities. Our framework employs attention and gating mechanisms to enable effective interaction between pLMs-generated sequential representations and GNN-extracted structural features, improving information exchange and enhancement across layers of the neural network. This bidirectional and hierarchical (Bi-Hierarchical) fusion approach leverages the strengths of both modalities to capture richer and more comprehensive protein representations. Based on the framework, we further introduce local Bi-Hierarchical Fusion with gating and global Bi-Hierarchical Fusion with multihead self-attention approaches. Our method demonstrates consistent improvements over strong baselines and existing fusion techniques in a variety of protein representation learning benchmarks, including enzyme EC classification, model quality assessment, protein-ligand binding affinity prediction, protein-protein binding site prediction, and B cell epitopes prediction. Our method establishes a new state-of-the-art for multimodal protein representation learning, emphasizing the efficacy of Bi-Hierarchical Fusion in bridging sequence and structural modalities.

Abstract:
Essential life processes take place across multiple space and time scales in living organisms but understanding their mechanistic interactions remains an ongoing challenge. Advanced multiscale modeling techniques are providing new opportunities and insights into these complex processes. In cells, meters of chromatin are folded into a nucleus with a diameter on the order of microns. The three-dimensional chromatin structure coupled with biochemical processes that turn genes on or off, specify a given cell type through a complicated set of interactions collectively referred to as epigenetics. Important epigenetic processes include the differential accessibility of genomic loci to transcription factors and chemical modifications to DNA and DNA-binding molecules such as histones. The dynamics of these epigenetic processes span timescales from milliseconds to years. How do chemical modifications consisting of a handful of atoms cooperate to modulate genome folding at the scale of the nucleus and impact organism outcomes? In this review, we highlight the inherently multiscale nature of chromatin organization, with a focus on computational modeling to bridge the gaps in our understanding of biochemical processes across scales. We review relevant chromatin biology, including major types of epigenetic modifications as well as the higher order chromatin structures to present a multiscale view of chromatin. We also review relevant computational methods to simulate chromatin structure, function, and dynamics, as well as experimental techniques that inform and validate said models. Finally, we argue that multiscale modeling provides a path forward towards understanding emergent behavior in this inherently multiscale system.

Abstract:
Gene expression in response to stimuli is regulated by transcription factors (TFs) through feedback loop motifs, aimed at maintaining the desired TF concentration despite uncertainties and perturbations. In this work, we consider a stochastic model of the positive gene autoregulating feedback loop and we probabilistically quantify its resilience, \textit{i.e.}, its ability to preserve the equilibrium associated with a prescribed concentration of TFs, and the corresponding basin of attraction, in the presence of noise. We show that the formation of larger oligomers, corresponding to larger Hill coefficients of the regulation function, and thus to sharper non-linearities, improves the system resilience, even close to critical concentrations of TFs. We also explore a complementary definition of resilience that can be assessed within a stochastic formulation relying on the Fokker-Planck equation. Our formal results are accompanied by numerical simulations.

Abstract:
Computational methods in drug repositioning can help to conserve resources. In particular, methods based on biological networks are showing promise. Considering only the network topology and knowledge on drug target genes is not sufficient for quantitative predictions or predictions involving drug combinations. We propose an iterative procedure alternating between system identification and drug response experiments. Data from experiments are used to improve the model and drug effect knowledge, which is then used to select drugs for the next experiments. Using simulated data, we show that the procedure can identify nearly optimal drug combinations.

Abstract:
We present an exact algorithm for computing all common subgraphs with the maximum number of vertices across multiple graphs. Our approach is further extended to handle the connected Maximum Common Subgraph (MCS), identifying the largest common subgraph in terms of either vertices or edges across multiple graphs, where edges or vertices may additionally be labeled to account for possible atom types or bond types, a classical labeling used in molecular graphs. Our approach leverages modular product graphs and a modified Bron-Kerbosch algorithm to enumerate maximal cliques, ensuring all intermediate solutions are retained. A pruning heuristic efficiently reduces the modular product size, improving computational feasibility. Additionally, we introduce a graph ordering strategy based on graph-kernel similarity measures to optimize the search process. Our method is particularly relevant for bioinformatics and cheminformatics, where identifying conserved structural motifs in molecular graphs is crucial. Empirical results on molecular datasets demonstrate that our approach is scalable and fast.

Abstract:
Ermiao San (EMS), a traditional Chinese medicine composed of Atractylodes macrocephala and Cortex Phellodendron, has demonstrated therapeutic efficacy in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Studies suggest that EMS modulates dendritic cell (DC) maturation in adjuvant arthritis (AA) rats, though the precise mechanisms remain unclear. Prostaglandin receptor 4 (EP4) is critical in inflammation and DC function, while cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) regulates cellular signaling, potentially influencing RA pathogenesis via protein kinase A (PKA) and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) activation. EMS exerts protective effects in RA rats by suppressing DC functions, including reduced EP4 mRNA/protein expression, diminished cAMP levels, and impaired CREB phosphorylation. Additionally, serum from EMS-treated rats inhibited antigen uptake by bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs), downregulating CD40, CD80, and CD86 expression and altering pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion. Mechanistically, EMS-treated serum suppressed the EP4-cAMP pathway by decreasing EP4 protein expression and CREB activation, alongside reduced intracellular cAMP and PKA levels in BMDCs co-stimulated with PGE2 and TNF-a. These findings indicate that EMS alleviates RA by inhibiting the EP4-cAMP-CREB signaling axis in DCs, providing a scientific rationale for its clinical application in RA treatment.

Abstract:
Single-cell data provide high-dimensional measurements of the transcriptional states of cells, but extracting insights into the regulatory functions of genes, particularly identifying transcriptional mechanisms affected by biological perturbations, remains a challenge. Many perturbations induce compensatory cellular responses, making it difficult to distinguish direct from indirect effects on gene regulation. Modeling how gene regulatory functions shape the temporal dynamics of these responses is key to improving our understanding of biological perturbations. Dynamical models based on differential equations offer a principled way to capture transcriptional dynamics, but their application to single-cell data has been hindered by computational constraints, stochasticity, sparsity, and noise. Existing methods either rely on low-dimensional representations or make strong simplifying assumptions, limiting their ability to model transcriptional dynamics at scale. We introduce a Functional and Learnable model of Cell dynamicS, FLeCS, that incorporates gene network structure into coupled differential equations to model gene regulatory functions. Given (pseudo)time-series single-cell data, FLeCS accurately infers cell dynamics at scale, provides improved functional insights into transcriptional mechanisms perturbed by gene knockouts, both in myeloid differentiation and K562 Perturb-seq experiments, and simulates single-cell trajectories of A549 cells following small-molecule perturbations.

Abstract:
Information geometry is based on classical Legendre duality but allows to incorporate additional structure such as algebraic constraints and Bregman divergence functions. It is naturally suited, and has been successfully used, to describe the thermodynamics of chemical reaction networks (CRNs) based on the Legendre duality between concentration and potential spaces, where algebraic constraints are enforced by the stoichiometry. In this article, the Riemannian geometrical aspects of the theory are explored. It is shown that duality between concentration and potential spaces and the natural parametrizations of equilibrium subspace are isometries, which leads to a multivariate Cramer-Rao bound through the comparison of two Riemannian metric tensors.   In the subsequent part, the theory is applied to the recently introduced concept of absolute sensitivity. Using the Riemannian geometric tools, it is proven that the absolute sensitivity is a projection operator onto the tangent bundle of the equilibrium manifold. A linear algebraic characterization and explicit results on first order corrections to the thermodynamics of ideal solutions are provided. Finally, the theory is applied to the IDHKP-IDH glyoxylate bypass regulation system.   The novelty of the theory is that it is applicable to CRNs with non-ideal thermodynamical behavior, which are prevalent in highly crowded cellular environments due to various interactions between the chemicals. Indeed, the analyzed example shows remarkable behavior ranging from hypersensitivity to negative-self regulations. These are effects which usually require strongly nonlinear reaction kinetics. However, here, they are obtained by tuning thermodynamical interactions providing a complementary, and physically well-founded, viewpoint on such phenomena.

Can machine learning algorithms be implemented using chemical reaction networks? We demonstrate that this is possible in the case of support vector machines (SVMs). SVMs are powerful tools for data classification, leveraging VC theory to handle high-dimensional data and small datasets effectively. In this work, we propose a reaction network scheme for implementing SVMs, utilizing the steady-state behavior of reaction network dynamics to model key computational aspects of SVMs. This approach introduces a novel biochemical framework for implementing machine learning algorithms in non-traditional computational environments.

Abstract:
The emergent dynamics of complex gene regulatory networks govern various cellular processes. However, understanding these dynamics is challenging due to the difficulty of parameterizing the computational models for these networks, especially as the network size increases. Here, we introduce a simulation library, Gene Regulatory Interaction Network Simulator (GRiNS), to address these challenges. GRiNS integrates popular parameter-agnostic simulation frameworks, RACIPE and Boolean Ising formalism, into a single Python library capable of leveraging GPU acceleration for efficient and scalable simulations. GRiNS extends the ordinary differential equations (ODE) based RACIPE framework with a more modular design, allowing users to choose parameters, initial conditions, and time-series outputs for greater customisability and accuracy in simulations. For large networks, where ODE-based simulation formalisms do not scale well, GRiNS implements Boolean Ising formalism, providing a simplified, coarse-grained alternative, significantly reducing the computational cost while capturing key dynamical behaviours of large regulatory networks. The documentation and installation instructions for GRiNS can be found at https://moltenecdysone09.github.io/GRiNS/.

Abstract:
Enzyme kinetics has historically been described by deterministic models, with the Michaelis-Menten (MM) equation serving as a paradigm. However, recent experimental and theoretical advances have made it clear that stochastic fluctuations, particularly at low copy numbers or single-enzyme levels, can profoundly impact reaction outcomes. In this paper, we present a comprehensive view of enzyme kinetics from both deterministic and stochastic perspectives. We begin by deriving the classical Michaelis-Menten equation under the quasi-steady-state assumption (QSSA) and discuss its validity. We then formulate the corresponding stochastic model via the chemical master equation (CME) and illustrate how the Gillespie algorithm can simulate single-molecule events and briefly use Kampen's system-size expansion to justify our simulation methods. Through extended computational analyses -- including variance calculations, phase-plane exploration, and parameter sensitivity -- we highlight how deterministic and stochastic predictions coincide in certain limits but can diverge in small systems. We further incorporate case studies from single-enzyme turnover experiments and cellular contexts to showcase the real-world implications of noise. Taken together, our results underscore the necessity of a multifaceted modeling strategy, whereby one can switch between deterministic methods and stochastic realism to gain a fuller understanding of enzyme kinetics at different scales.

Abstract:
Studies by microbiologists from the 1970s provided robust estimates for the energy supply and demand of a prokaryotic cell. The amount of ATP needed to support growth was calculated from the chemical composition of the cell and known enzymatic pathways that synthesize its constituents from known substrates in culture. Starting in 2015, geneticists and evolutionary biologists began investigating the bioenergetic role of mitochondria at eukaryote origin and energy in metazoan evolution using their own, widely trusted but hitherto unvetted model for the costs of growth in terms of ATP per cell. The more recent model contains, however, a severe and previously unrecognized error that systematically overestimates the ATP cost of amino acid synthesis up to 200 fold. The error applies to all organisms studied by such models and leads to conspicuously false inferences, for example that the synthesis of an average amino acid in humans requires 30 ATP, which no biochemistry textbook will confirm. Their ATP cost calculations would require that Escherichia coli obtains roughly 100 ATP per glucose and that mammals obtain roughly 240 ATP per glucose, propositions that invalidate evolutionary inferences so based. By contrast, established methods for estimating the ATP cost of microbial growth show that the first mitochondrial endosymbionts could have easily doubled the hosts available ATP pool, provided that genes for growth on environmental amino acids were transferred from the mitochondrial symbiont to the archaeal host and that the host for mitochondrial origin was an autotroph using the acetyl-CoA pathway.

Abstract:
Stochastic systems have a control-theoretic interpretation in which noise plays the role of control. In the weak-noise limit, relevant at low temperatures or in large populations, this leads to a precise mathematical mapping: the most probable trajectory between two states minimizes an action functional and corresponds to an optimal control strategy. In Langevin dynamics, the noise term itself serves as the control. For general Markov jump processes, such as chemical reaction networks or electronic circuits, we use the Doi-Peliti formalism to identify the `response' (or `momentum') field $π$ as the control variable. This resolves a long-standing interpretational problem in the field-theoretic description of stochastic systems: although $π$ evolves backward in time, it has a clear physical role as the control that steers the system along rare trajectories. This implies that Nature is constantly sampling control strategies. We illustrate the mapping on multistable chemical reaction networks, systems with unstable fixed points, and specifically on stochastic resonance and Brownian ratchets. The noise-control mapping justifies agential descriptions of these phenomena, and builds intuition for otherwise puzzling phenomena of stochastic systems: why probabilities are generically non-smooth functions of state out of thermal equilibrium; why biological mechanisms can work better in the presence of noise; and how agential behavior emerges naturally without recourse to mysticism.

Abstract:
Chemical reaction networks underpin biological and physical phenomena across scales, from microbial interactions to planetary atmosphere dynamics. Bacterial communities exhibit complex competitive interactions for resources, human organs and tissues demonstrate specialized biochemical functions, and planetary atmospheres are capable of displaying diverse organic and inorganic chemical processes. Despite their complexities, comparing these networks methodically remains a challenge due to the vast underlying degrees of freedom. In biological systems, comparative genomics has been pivotal in tracing evolutionary trajectories and classifying organisms via DNA sequences. However, purely genomic classifications often fail to capture functional roles within ecological systems. Metabolic changes driven by nutrient availability highlight the need for classification schemes that integrate metabolic information. Here we introduce and apply a computational framework for a classification scheme of organisms that compares matrix representations of chemical reaction networks using the Grassmann distance, corresponding to measuring distances between the fundamental subspaces of stoichiometric matrices. Applying this framework to human gut microbiome data confirms that metabolic distances are distinct from phylogenetic distances, underscoring the limitations of genetic information in metabolic classification. Importantly, our analysis of metabolic distances reveals functional groups of organisms enriched or depleted in specific metabolic processes and shows robustness to metabolically silent genetic perturbations. The generalizability of metabolic Grassmann distances is illustrated by application to chemical reaction networks in human tissue and planetary atmospheres, highlighting its potential for advancing functional comparisons across diverse chemical reaction systems.

Abstract:
Living organisms maintain stable functioning amid environmental fluctuations through homeostasis, a property that preserves a system's behavior despite changes in environmental conditions. To elucidate homeostasis in stochastic biochemical reactions, theoretical tools for assessing population-level invariance under parameter perturbations are crucial. In this paper, we propose a systematic method for identifying the stationary moments that remain invariant under parameter perturbations by leveraging the structural properties of the stationary moment equations. A key step in this development is addressing the underdetermined nature of moment equations, which has traditionally made it difficult to characterize how stationary moments depend on system parameters. To overcome this, we utilize the Dulmage-Mendelsohn (DM) decomposition of the coefficient matrix to extract welldetermined subequations and reveal their hierarchical structure. Leveraging this structure, we identify stationary moments whose partial derivatives with respect to parameters are structurally zero, facilitating the exploration of fundamental constraints that govern homeostatic behavior in stochastic biochemical systems.

Abstract:
Molecular communication (MC) offers a groundbreaking approach to communication inspired by biological signaling. It is particularly suited for environments where traditional electromagnetic methods fail, such as fluid mediums or within the human body. This study focuses on addressing a major challenge in MC systems: inter symbol interference (ISI), which arises due to the random, diffusive propagation of molecules. We propose a novel technique that leverages transmission shaping to mitigate ISI effectively by designing optimal transmission pulse (or sequence) for symbols. Our approach centers on solving a multi-objective optimization problem that aims to maximize the separability of individual symbol's responses within the symbol duration while matching the interference caused by molecular spillover for all symbols. By making ISI of each symbol similar, the approach reduces the effect of previous symbols and thus not require any adaptive computations. We introduce a geometric analogy involving two families of ellipses to derive the optimal solution. Analytical insights are supported by numerical simulations to design optimized transmission profiles to enhance the resilience toward ISI. The proposed transmission shaping method is evaluated through symbol error rate (SER). These results mark a significant step forward in developing robust and efficient MC systems, opening doors to advanced applications in bio-inspired and nano-scale communication technologies.

Abstract:
Hamilton-Jacobi reachability (HJR) is an exciting framework used for control of safety-critical systems with nonlinear and possibly uncertain dynamics. However, HJR suffers from the curse of dimensionality, with computation times growing exponentially in the dimension of the system state. Many autonomous and controlled systems involve dynamics that evolve on multiple timescales, and for these systems, singular perturbation methods can be used for model reduction. However, such methods are more challenging to apply in HJR due to the presence of an underlying differential game. In this work, we leverage prior work on singularly perturbed differential games to identify a class of systems which can be readily reduced, and we relate these results to the quantities of interest in HJR. We demonstrate the utility of our results on two examples involving biological systems, where dynamics fitting the identified class are frequently encountered.

Abstract:
Recent advances in single cell sequencing and multi-omics techniques have significantly improved our understanding of biological phenomena and our capacity to model them. Despite combined capture of data modalities showing similar progress, notably single cell transcriptomics and proteomics, simultaneous multi-omics level probing still remains challenging. As an alternative to combined capture of biological data, in this review, we explore current and upcoming methods for post-hoc network inference and integration with an emphasis on single cell transcriptomics and proteomics. By examining various approaches, from probabilistic models to graph-based algorithms, we outline the challenges and potential strategies for effectively combining biological data types while simultaneously highlighting the importance of model validation. With this review, we aim to inform readers of the breadth of tools currently available for the purpose-specific generation of heterogeneous multi-layer networks.

Abstract:
Network pharmacology (NP) explores pharmacological mechanisms through biological networks. Multi-omics data enable multi-layer network construction under diverse conditions, requiring integration into NP analyses. We developed POINT, a novel NP platform enhanced by multi-omics biological networks, advanced algorithms, and knowledge graphs (KGs) featuring network-based and KG-based analytical functions. In the network-based analysis, users can perform NP studies flexibly using 1,158 multi-omics biological networks encompassing proteins, transcription factors, and non-coding RNAs across diverse cell line-, tissue- and disease-specific conditions. Network-based analysis-including random walk with restart (RWR), GSEA, and diffusion profile (DP) similarity algorithms-supports tasks such as target prediction, functional enrichment, and drug screening. We merged networks from experimental sources to generate a pre-integrated multi-layer human network for evaluation. RWR demonstrated superior performance with a 33.1% average ranking improvement over the second-best algorithm, PageRank, in identifying known targets across 2,002 drugs. Additionally, multi-layer networks significantly improve the ability to identify FDA-approved drug-disease pairs compared to the single-layer network. For KG-based analysis, we compiled three high-quality KGs to construct POINT KG, which cross-references over 90% of network-based predictions. We illustrated the platform's capabilities through two case studies. POINT bridges the gap between multi-omics networks and drug discovery; it is freely accessible at http://point.gene.ac/.

Abstract:
Graphical modeling is a widely used tool for analyzing conditional dependencies between variables and traditional methods may struggle to capture shared and distinct structures in multi-group or multi-condition settings. Joint graphical modeling (JGM) extends this framework by simultaneously estimating network structures across multiple related datasets, allowing for a deeper understanding of commonalities and differences. This capability is particularly valuable in fields such as genomics and neuroscience, where identifying variations in network topology can provide critical biological insights. Existing JGM methodologies largely fall into two categories: regularization-based approaches, which introduce additional penalties to enforce structured sparsity, and Bayesian frameworks, which incorporate prior knowledge to improve network inference. In this study, we explore an alternative method based on two-target linear covariance matrix shrinkage. Formula for optimal shrinkage intensities is proposed which leads to the development of JointStein framework. Performance of JointStein framework is proposed through simulation benchmarking which demonstrates its effectiveness for large-scale single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data analysis. Finally, we apply our approach to glioblastoma scRNA-seq data, uncovering dynamic shifts in T cell network structures across disease progression stages. The result highlights potential of JointStein framework in extracting biologically meaningful insights from high-dimensional data.

Title: Exact first passage time distribution for nonlinear chemical reaction networks II: monomolecular reactions and a A + B - C type of second-order reaction with arbitrary initial conditions

Abstract:
In biochemical reaction networks, the first passage time (FPT) of a reaction quantifies the time it takes for the reaction to first occur, from the initial state. While the mean FPT historically served as a summary metric, a far more comprehensive characterization of the dynamics of the network is contained within the complete FPT distribution. The relatively uncommon theoretical treatments of the FPT distribution that have been given in the past have been confined to linear systems, with zero and first-order processes. Recently, we presented theoretically exact solutions for the FPT distribution, within nonlinear systems involving two-particle collisions, such as A+B - C. Although this research yielded invaluable results, it was based upon the assumption of initial conditions in the form of a Poisson distribution. This somewhat restricts its relevance to real-world biochemical systems, which frequently display intricate behaviour and initial conditions that are non-Poisson in nature. Our current study extends prior analyses to accommodate arbitrary initial conditions, thereby expanding the applicability of our theoretical framework and providing a more adaptable tool for capturing the dynamics of biochemical reaction networks.

Abstract:
Chronic superficial gastritis (CSG) severely affects quality of life and can progress to worse gastric pathologies. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) effectively treats CSG, as exemplified by Jinhong Tablets (JHT) with known anti-inflammatory properties, though their mechanism remains unclear. This study integrated network pharmacology, untargeted metabolomics, and gut microbiota analyses to investigate how JHT alleviates CSG. A rat CSG model was established and evaluated via H&E staining. We identified JHT's target profiles and constructed a multi-layer biomolecular network. Differential metabolites in plasma were determined by untargeted metabolomics, and gut microbiota diversity/composition in fecal and cecal samples was assessed via 16S rRNA sequencing. JHT markedly reduced gastric inflammation. Network pharmacology highlighted metabolic pathways, particularly lipid and nitric oxide metabolism, as essential to JHT's therapeutic effect. Metabolomics identified key differential metabolites including betaine (enhancing gut microbiota), phospholipids, and citrulline (indicating severity of CSG). Pathway enrichment supported the gut microbiota's involvement. Further microbiota analysis showed that JHT increased betaine abundance, improved short-chain fatty acid production, and elevated Faecalibaculum and Bifidobacterium, thereby alleviating gastric inflammation. In conclusion, JHT alleviates CSG via diverse metabolic processes, especially lipid and energy metabolism, and influences metabolites like betaine alongside gut microbes such as Faecalibaculum and Bifidobacterium. These findings underscore JHT's therapeutic potential and deepen our understanding of TCM's role in CSG management.

Abstract:
Accurately predicting complex protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is crucial for decoding biological processes, from cellular functioning to disease mechanisms. However, experimental methods for determining PPIs are computationally expensive. Thus, attention has been recently drawn to machine learning approaches. Furthermore, insufficient effort has been made toward analyzing signed PPI networks, which capture both activating (positive) and inhibitory (negative) interactions. To accurately represent biological relationships, we present the Signed Two-Space Proximity Model (S2-SPM) for signed PPI networks, which explicitly incorporates both types of interactions, reflecting the complex regulatory mechanisms within biological systems. This is achieved by leveraging two independent latent spaces to differentiate between positive and negative interactions while representing protein similarity through proximity in these spaces. Our approach also enables the identification of archetypes representing extreme protein profiles. S2-SPM's superior performance in predicting the presence and sign of interactions in SPPI networks is demonstrated in link prediction tasks against relevant baseline methods. Additionally, the biological prevalence of the identified archetypes is confirmed by an enrichment analysis of Gene Ontology (GO) terms, which reveals that distinct biological tasks are associated with archetypal groups formed by both interactions. This study is also validated regarding statistical significance and sensitivity analysis, providing insights into the functional roles of different interaction types. Finally, the robustness and consistency of the extracted archetype structures are confirmed using the Bayesian Normalized Mutual Information (BNMI) metric, proving the model's reliability in capturing meaningful SPPI patterns.

Abstract:
Stochastic models for biochemical reaction networks are widely used to explore their complex dynamics but face significant challenges, including difficulties in determining rate constants and high computational costs. To address these issues, model reduction approaches based on deterministic quasi-steady-state approximations (QSSA) have been employed, resulting in propensity functions in the form of deterministic non-elementary reaction functions, such as the Michaelis-Menten equation. In particular, the total QSSA (tQSSA), known for its accuracy in deterministic frameworks, has been perceived as universally valid for stochastic model reduction. However, recent studies have challenged this perception. In this review, we demonstrate that applying tQSSA in stochastic model reduction can distort dynamics, even in cases where the deterministic tQSSA is rigorously valid. This highlights the need for caution when using deterministic QSSA in stochastic model reduction to avoid erroneous conclusions from model simulations.

Abstract:
The classical and extended deficiency one theorems by Feinberg apply to reaction networks with mass-action kinetics that have independent linkage classes or subnetworks, each with a deficiency of at most one and exactly one terminal strong component. The theorems assume the existence of a positive equilibrium and guarantee the existence of a unique positive equilibrium in every stoichiometric compatibility class.   In our work, we use the $\textit{monomial dependency}$ which extends the concept of deficiency. First, we provide a dependency one theorem for parametrized systems of polynomial equations that are essentially univariate and decomposable. As our main result, we present a corresponding theorem for mass-action systems, which permits subnetworks with arbitrary deficiency and arbitrary number of terminal strong components. Finally, to complete the picture, we derive the extended deficiency one theorem as a special case of our more general dependency one theorem.

Abstract:
A symmetry is a `change without change'. As simple as it sounds, this concept is the fundamental cornerstone that unifies all branches of theoretical physics. Virtually all physical laws -- ranging from classical mechanics and electrodynamics to relativity, quantum mechanics, and the standard model -- can be expressed in terms of symmetry invariances. In this book, we explore whether the same principle can also explain the emergent laws of biological systems. We introduce a new geometry for biological networks and AI architectures, drawing inspiration from the mystic genius of Grothendieck's fibrations in category theory. We attempt to bridge the gap between physics and biology using symmetries but with a twist. The traditional symmetry groups of physics are global and too rigid to describe biology. Instead, the novel notion of symmetry fibration is local, flexible, and adaptable to evolutionary pressures, providing the right framework for understanding biological complexity. In other words, this more general symmetry invariance is necessary and sufficient to ensure that a given biological network configuration can support a synchronized function. In this book, we review the theoretical progress over the last decades from mathematics, physics, computer science, dynamical systems, and graph theory that has led to the discovery of symmetry fibrations in biological networks. These symmetries act as organizing principles for biological networks. They serve as effective tools for describing the structure of these networks, blending geometry and topology. Fibrations explain how structure dictates function across various biological domains, including the transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, and connectome. Additionally, they facilitate a reduction in the dimensionality of the network, simplifying it into its fundamental building blocks for biological computation.

Abstract:
This paper presents a mathematical model that explores the interactions between Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 1 (CDK1) and the Anaphase-Promoting Complex (APC) in cancer cells. Through the analysis of a dynamical system simulating the CDK1-APC network, we investigate the system's behavior and its implications for cancer progression and potential therapeutic interventions. Our findings highlight the critical role of CDK1-APC interactions in regulating the cell cycle and examine the impact of Zingerone, a compound derived from ginger, on modulating the period of the oscillatory dynamics. These results provide new insights into the potential of Zingerone to influence cell proliferation and offer avenues for less harmful cancer treatments. The quantitative analysis is conducted by first theoretically deriving the cell viability as a function of time and Zingerone concentration, and then validating this function by using experimental data.

Abstract:
At the microscopic scale, open chemical reaction networks are described by stochastic reactions that follow mass-action kinetics and are coupled to chemostats. We show that closed chemical reaction networks -- with specific stoichiometries imposed by mass-action kinetics -- behave like open ones in the limit where the abundances of a subset of species become macroscopic, thus playing the role of chemostats. We prove that this limit is thermodynamically consistent by recovering the local detailed balance condition of open chemical reaction networks and deriving the proper expression of the entropy production rate. In particular, the entropy production rate features two contributions: one accounting for the dissipation of the stochastic reactions, the other for the dissipation of continuous reactions controlling the chemostats. Finally, we illustrate our results for two prototypical examples.

Abstract:
Many biological and social systems are naturally represented as edge-weighted directed or undirected hypergraphs since they exhibit group interactions involving three or more system units as opposed to pairwise interactions that can be incorporated in graph-theoretic representations. However, finding influential cores in hypergraphs is still not as extensively studied as their graph-theoretic counter-parts. To this end, we develop and implement a hypergraph-curvature guided discrete time diffusion process with suitable topological surgeries and edge-weight re-normalization procedures for both undirected and directed weighted hypergraphs to find influential cores. We successfully apply our framework for directed hypergraphs to seven metabolic hypergraphs and our framework for undirected hypergraphs to two social (co-authorship) hypergraphs to find influential cores, thereby demonstrating the practical feasibility of our approach. In addition, we prove a theorem showing that a certain edge weight re-normalization procedure in a prior research work for Ricci flows for edge-weighted graphs has the undesirable outcome of modifying the edge-weights to negative numbers, thereby rendering the procedure impossible to use. To the best of our knowledge, this seems to be one of the first articles that formulates algorithmic approaches for finding core(s) of (weighted or unweighted) directed hypergraphs.

Abstract:
Knowing gene regulatory networks (GRNs) is important for understanding various biological mechanisms. In this paper, we present a method, QWENDY, that uses single-cell gene expression data measured at four time points to infer GRNs. Based on a linear gene expression model, it solves the transformation of the covariance matrices. Unlike its predecessor WENDY, QWENDY avoids solving a non-convex optimization problem and produces a unique solution. We test the performance of QWENDY on three experimental data sets and two synthetic data sets. Compared to previously tested methods on the same data sets, QWENDY ranks the first on experimental data, although it does not perform well on synthetic data.

Abstract:
Recurrent neural networks are frequently studied in terms of their information-processing capabilities. The structural properties of these networks are seldom considered, beyond those emerging from the connectivity tuning necessary for network training. However, real biological networks have non-contingent architectures that have been shaped by evolution over eons, constrained partly by information-processing criteria, but more generally by fitness maximization requirements. Here we examine the topological properties of existing biological networks, focusing in particular on gene regulatory networks in bacteria. We identify structural features, both local and global, that dictate the ability of recurrent networks to store information on the fly and process complex time-dependent inputs.

Abstract:
Interpreting biological networks becomes challenging when molecular components, such as genes or proteins, participate in numerous interactions, resulting in densely connected regions and overlapping interactions that obscure functional relationships and biological insights. To address this, we introduce Alias4SBML, a Python package that enhances SBML model visualizations by generating alias nodes-duplicate representations of highly connected molecular components-to redistribute interactions and reduce visual congestion. Applying Alias4SBML to the SBML models, including one with 59 species and 41 reactions and another with 701 species and 505 reactions, demonstrated significant improvements in readability, with edge length reductions of up to 50.88 %. Our approach preserves the structural integrity of the network while facilitating clearer interpretation of complex biological systems, offering a flexible and scalable solution for visualizing biological models more efficiently.

Abstract:
Zero-one reaction networks play a crucial role in cell signaling. Determining the equivalence of reaction networks is a fundamental computational problem in the field of chemical reaction networks. In this work, we develop an efficient method for determining the equivalence of zero-one networks. The efficiency comes from several criteria for determining the equivalence of the steady-state ideals arising from zero-one networks, which helps for cutting down the expenses on computing Grobner bases. Experiments show that our method can successfully classify over three million networks according to their equivalence in a reasonable time.

Abstract:
Graphs depict pairwise relationships between objects within a system. Higher-order interactions (HOIs), which involve more than two objects simultaneously, are common in nature. Such interactions can change the stability of a complex system. Hypergraphs can represent an HOI as an arbitrary subset of vertices. However, they fail to capture the specific roles of the vertices involved, which can be highly asymmetric, particularly in the case of interaction modifications.   We introduce pangraphs, a robust and quantitative generalisation of graphs that accurately captures arbitrarily complex higher-order interactions. We demonstrate that several higher-order representations proposed in the literature are specific instances of pangraphs. Additionally, we introduce an incidence multilayer digraph representation of a pangraph, referred to as Levi digraph. We adapt degree and Katz centrality measures to the pangraph framework and show that a consistent generalisation of recursive graph measures cannot be simplified to a Levi digraph of a pangraph.   We construct a pangraph for a real-world coffee agroecosystem and compare Katz centrality between its dihypergraph and pangraph representations, both analytically and numerically. The choice of representation significantly affects centrality values and alters vertex ranks. Additionally, we emphasise the use of real-valued incidence matrices to quantify interaction strengths and the roles of vertices within the system.

Abstract:
Understanding the interplay among processes that occur over different timescales is a challenging issue in the physics of systems regulation. In gene regulation, the timescales for changes in chromatin states can differ from those for changes in the concentration of product protein, raising questions about how to understand their coupled dynamics. In this study, we examine the effects of these different timescales on eukaryotic gene regulation using a stochastic model that describes the landscapes and probability currents of nonequilibrium fluctuations.This model shows that slow, nonadiabatic transitions of chromatin states significantly impact gene-regulation dynamics. The simulated circular flow of the probability currents indicates a maximum entropy production when the rates of chromatin-state transitions are low in the intensely nonadiabatic regime. In the mildly nonadiabatic regime, this circular flow fosters hysteresis, suggesting that changes in chromatin states precede changes in transcription activity. Furthermore, calculations using a model of a circuit involving three core genes in mouse embryonic stem cells illustrate how the timescale difference can tune fluctuations in individual genes. These findings highlight the rich effects of nonadiabatic chromatin-state transitions on gene regulation in eukaryotic cells.

Abstract:
Dynamical systems with quadratic or polynomial drift exhibit complex dynamics, yet compared to nonlinear systems in general form, are often easier to analyze, simulate, control, and learn. Results going back over a century have shown that the majority of nonpolynomial nonlinear systems can be recast in polynomial form, and their degree can be reduced further to quadratic. This process of polynomialization/quadratization reveals new variables (in most cases, additional variables have to be added to achieve this) in which the system dynamics adhere to that specific form, which leads us to discover new structures of a model. This chapter summarizes the state of the art for the discovery of polynomial and quadratic representations of finite-dimensional dynamical systems. We review known existence results, discuss the two prevalent algorithms for automating the discovery process, and give examples in form of a single-layer neural network and a phenomenological model of cell signaling.

Abstract:
Trajectory inference is used to order single-cell omics data along a path that reflects a continuous transition between cells. This approach is useful for studying processes like cell differentiation, where a stem cell matures into a specialized cell type, or investigating state changes in pathological conditions. In the current article, we provide a general introduction to trajectory inference, explaining the concepts and assumptions underlying the different methods. We then briefly discuss the strengths and weaknesses of different trajectory inference methods. We also describe best practices for using trajectory inference, such as how to validate the results and how to interpret them in the context of biological knowledge. Finally, the article will discuss some of the applications of trajectory inference in single-cell omics research. These applications include studying cell differentiation, development, and disease. We provide examples of how trajectory inference has been used to gain new insights into these processes.

Abstract:
In chemical reaction network theory, ordinary differential equations are used to model the temporal change of chemical species concentration. As the functional form of these ordinary differential equations systems is derived from an empirical model of the reaction network, it may be incomplete. Our approach aims to elucidate these hidden insights in the reaction network by combining dynamic modelling with deep learning in the form of neural ordinary differential equations. Our contributions not only help to identify the shortcomings of existing empirical models but also assist the design of future reaction networks.

Abstract:
Drug-side effect research is vital for understanding adverse reactions arising in complex multi-drug therapies. However, the scarcity of higher-order datasets that capture the combinatorial effects of multiple drugs severely limits progress in this field. Existing resources such as TWOSIDES primarily focus on pairwise interactions. To fill this critical gap, we introduce HODDI, the first Higher-Order Drug-Drug Interaction Dataset, constructed from U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) records spanning the past decade, to advance computational pharmacovigilance. HODDI contains 109,744 records involving 2,506 unique drugs and 4,569 unique side effects, specifically curated to capture multi-drug interactions and their collective impact on adverse effects. Comprehensive statistical analyses demonstrate HODDI's extensive coverage and robust analytical metrics, making it a valuable resource for studying higher-order drug relationships. Evaluating HODDI with multiple models, we found that simple Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) can outperform graph models, while hypergraph models demonstrate superior performance in capturing complex multi-drug interactions, further validating HODDI's effectiveness. Our findings highlight the inherent value of higher-order information in drug-side effect prediction and position HODDI as a benchmark dataset for advancing research in pharmacovigilance, drug safety, and personalized medicine.

Abstract:
Over the last decade, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified numerous genetic variants associated with complex diseases. These associations have the potential to reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying complex diseases and lead to the identification of novel drug targets. Despite these advancements, the biological pathways and mechanisms linking genetic variants to complex diseases are still not fully understood. Most trait-associated variants reside in non-coding regions and are presumed to influence phenotypes through regulatory effects on gene expression. Yet, it is often unclear which genes they regulate and in which cell types this regulation occurs. Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) aim to bridge this gap by detecting trait-associated tissue gene expression regulated by GWAS variants. However, traditional TWAS approaches frequently overlook the critical contributions of trans-regulatory effects and fail to integrate comprehensive regulatory networks. Here, we present a novel framework that leverages tissue-specific gene regulatory networks (GRNs) to integrate cis- and trans-genetic regulatory effects into the TWAS framework for complex diseases. We validate our approach using coronary artery disease (CAD), utilizing data from the STARNET project, which provides multi-tissue gene expression and genetic data from around 600 living patients with cardiovascular disease. Preliminary results demonstrate the potential of our GRN-driven framework to uncover more genes and pathways that may underlie CAD. This framework extends traditional TWAS methodologies by utilizing tissue-specific regulatory insights and advancing the understanding of complex disease genetic architecture.

Abstract:
The development of multicellular organisms relies on the precise coordination of molecular events across multiple spatial and temporal scales. Understanding how information flows from molecular interactions to cellular processes and tissue organization during development is crucial for explaining the remarkable reproducibility of complex organisms. This review explores how chromatin-encoded information is transduced from localized transcriptional events to global gene expression patterns, highlighting the challenge of bridging these scales. We discuss recent experimental findings and theoretical frameworks, emphasizing polymer physics as a tool for describing the relationship between chromatin structure and dynamics across scales. By integrating these perspectives, we aim to clarify how gene regulation is coordinated across levels of biological organization and suggest strategies for future experimental approaches.

Abstract:
What is the most crucial characteristic of a system with life activity? Currently, many theories have attempted to explain the most essential difference between living systems and general systems, such as the self-organization theory and the free energy principle, but there is a lack of a reasonable indicator that can measure to what extent a system can be regarded as a system with life characteristics, especially the lack of attention to the dynamic characteristics of life systems. In this article, we propose a new indicator at the level of dynamic mechanisms to measure the ability of a system to flexibly respond to the environment. We proved that this indicator satisfies the axiom system of multivariate information decomposition in the partial information decomposition (PID) framework. Through further disassembly and analysis of this indicator, we found that it is determined by the degree of entanglement between system and environmental variables in the dynamics and the magnitude of noise. We conducted measurements on cellular automata (CA), random Boolean networks, and real gene regulatory networks (GRN), verified its relationship with the type of CA and the Langton parameter, and identified that the feedback loops have high abilities to flexibly respond to the environment on the GRN. We also combined machine learning technology to prove that this framework can be applied in the case of unknown dynamics.

Abstract:
Intracellular networks process cellular-level information and control cell fate. They can be computationally modeled using Boolean networks, which are implicit-time causal models of discrete binary events. These networks can be embedded in computational agents to drive cellular behavior. To explore this integration, we construct a set of candidate interventions that induce apoptosis in a cell-survival network of a rare leukemia using exhaustive search simulation, stable motif control, and an individual-based mean field approach (IBMFA). Due to inherent algorithmic limitations, these interventions are most suitable for cell-level determinations, not the more realistic multicellular setting. To address these limitations, we treat the target control solutions as putative targets for therapeutic interventions and develop a pipeline to translate them to continuous-time multicellular, agent-based models. We set the discrete-to-continuous transitions between the Boolean network and multicellular model via thresholding and produce simple computational simulations designed to emulate situations in experimental and translational biology. These include a series of simulations: constant substrate gradients, global substrate pulses, and time-varying boundary conditions. We find that interventions that perform equally well in the implicit-time single-cell setting are separable in the multiscale setting in ability to impact population growth and spatial distribution. Further analysis shows that the population and spatial distribution differences arise from differences in internal dynamics (stable motif controls versus target controls) and network distance between the intervention and output nodes. This proof of concept work demonstrates the importance of accounting for internal dynamics in multicellular simulations as well as impacts on understanding of Boolean network control.

Abstract:
Long COVID is a multisystem condition characterized by persistent symptoms such as fatigue, cognitive impairment, and systemic inflammation, following COVID-19 infection, yet its mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this study, we applied quantum walk (QW), a computational approach leveraging quantum interference, to explore large-scale SARS-CoV-2-induced protein (SIP) networks. Compared to the conventional random walk with restart (RWR) method, QW demonstrated superior capacity to traverse deeper regions of the network, uncovering proteins and pathways implicated in Long COVID. Key findings include mitochondrial dysfunction, thromboinflammatory responses, and neuronal inflammation as central mechanisms. QW uniquely identified the CDGSH iron-sulfur domain-containing protein family and VDAC1, a mitochondrial calcium transporter, as critical regulators of these processes. VDAC1 emerged as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target, supported by FDA-approved compounds such as cannabidiol. These findings highlight QW as a powerful tool for elucidating complex biological systems and identifying novel therapeutic targets for conditions like Long COVID.

Abstract:
Global climate change has reduced crop resilience and pesticide efficacy, making reliance on synthetic pesticides inevitable, even though their widespread use poses significant health and environmental risks. While these pesticides remain a key tool in pest management, previous machine-learning applications in pesticide and agriculture have focused on classification or regression, leaving the fundamental challenge of generating new molecular structures or designing novel candidates unaddressed. In this paper, we propose Pesti-Gen, a novel generative model based on variational auto-encoders, designed to create pesticide candidates with optimized properties for the first time. Specifically, Pesti-Gen leverages a two-stage learning process: an initial pre-training phase that captures a generalized chemical structure representation, followed by a fine-tuning stage that incorporates toxicity-specific information. The model simultaneously optimizes over multiple toxicity metrics, such as (1) livestock toxicity and (2) aqua toxicity to generate environmentally friendly pesticide candidates. Notably, Pesti-Gen achieves approximately 68\% structural validity in generating new molecular structures, demonstrating the model's effectiveness in producing optimized and feasible pesticide candidates, thereby providing a new way for safer and more sustainable pest management solutions.

Abstract:
This paper presents a novel graph-based deep learning model for tasks involving relations between two nodes (edge-centric tasks), where the focus lies on predicting relationships and interactions between pairs of nodes rather than node properties themselves. This model combines supervised and self-supervised learning, taking into account for the loss function the embeddings learned and patterns with and without ground truth. Additionally it incorporates an attention mechanism that leverages both node and edge features. The architecture, trained end-to-end, comprises two primary components: embedding generation and prediction. First, a graph neural network (GNN) transform raw node features into dense, low-dimensional embeddings, incorporating edge attributes. Then, a feedforward neural model processes the node embeddings to produce the final output. Experiments demonstrate that our model matches or exceeds existing methods for protein-protein interactions prediction and Gene Ontology (GO) terms prediction. The model also performs effectively with one-hot encoding for node features, providing a solution for the previously unsolved problem of predicting similarity between compounds with unknown structures.

Abstract:
We address the challenge of identifying all real positive steady states in chemical reaction networks (CRNs) governed by mass-action kinetics. Traditional numerical methods often require specific initial guesses and may fail to find all the solutions in systems exhibiting multistability. Gröbner bases offer an algebraic framework that systematically transforms polynomial equations into simpler forms, facilitating comprehensive solution enumeration. In this work, we propose a conjecture that CRNs with at most pairwise interactions yield Gröbner bases possessing a near-"triangular" structure, under appropriate assumptions. We illustrate this phenomenon using examples from a gene regulatory network and the Wnt signaling pathway, where the Gröbner basis approach reliably captures all real positive solutions. Our computational experiments reveal the potential of Gröbner bases to overcome limitations of local numerical methods for finding the steady states of complex biological systems, making them a powerful tool for understanding dynamical processes across diverse biochemical models.

Abstract:
Formulating quantitative and predictive models for tissue development requires consideration of the complex, stochastic gene expression dynamics, its regulation via cell-to-cell interactions, and cell proliferation. Including all of these processes into a practical mathematical framework requires complex expressions that are difficult to interpret and apply. We construct a simple theory that incorporates intracellular stochastic gene expression dynamics, signaling chemicals that influence these dynamics and mediate cell-cell interactions, and cell proliferation and its accompanying differentiation. Cellular states (genetic and epigenetic) are described by a Waddington vector field that allows for non-gradient dynamics (cycles, entropy production, loss of detailed balance) which is precluded in Waddington potential landscape representations of gene expression dynamics. We define an epigenetic fitness landscape that describes the proliferation of different cell types, and elucidate how this fitness landscape is related to Waddington's vector field. We illustrate the applicability of our framework by analyzing two model systems: an interacting two-gene differentiation process and a spatiotemporal organism model inspired by planaria.

Abstract:
A fluctuation theorem is examined for the first-passage time of a biomolecular machine (e.g., a motor protein or an enzyme) in a nonequilibrium steady-state. For such machines in which the driven, observable process is coupled to a hidden process in a kinetically cooperative fashion, the entropy produced along first-passage trajectories is no longer constant, resulting in a breakdown of this expression. Here, we consider the canonical model for this type of system, a kinetic scheme for conformation-modulated single-enzyme catalysis (a type of continuous-time Markov process with relevance to $β$-galactosidase and human glucokinase), as we explore this fluctuation theorem in cooperative biomolecular networks. Kinetic evaluations are performed using a novel, efficient pathway analysis technique, allowing us to attain surprising and concise results from complex calculations. We find that in the absence of hidden current, a fluctuation theorem can be established for the first-passage time of the observable process, and we demonstrate that this dramatic reduction is a general feature applicable to a wide variety of cooperative networks. The validity of this expression can be experimentally tested, with its violation serving as a unique signature of hidden detailed balance breaking. In addition, we obtain a remarkably compact exact expression for the integrated correction to this first-passage time fluctuation theorem, as well as the general form, revealing a thermodynamic bound on the kinetic branching ratio (a measure of directionality defined as the ratio of the forward observable process probability to the backward one). These results provide detailed insight into the rich connections between dynamic measurements and the underlying nonequilibrium thermodynamics for cooperative biomolecular machines.

Abstract:
The network inference problem arises in biological research when one needs to quantitatively choose the best protein-interaction model for explaining a phenotype. The diverse nature of the data and nonlinear dynamics pose significant challenges in the search for the best methodology. In addition to balancing fit and model complexity, computational efficiency must be considered. In this paper, we present a novel approach that finds a solution that fits the observed dataset and otherwise a minimal number of unobserved datasets. We present algorithms for computing Boolean networks that optimally satisfy this criterion, and allow for asynchronicity network dynamics. Furthermore, we show that using our methodology a solution to the pseudo-time inference problem, which is pertinent to the analysis of single-cell data, can be intertwined with network inference. Results are described for real and simulated datasets.

Abstract:
Modern high-throughput biological datasets with thousands of perturbations provide the opportunity for large-scale discovery of causal graphs that represent the regulatory interactions between genes. Differentiable causal graphical models have been proposed to infer a gene regulatory network (GRN) from large scale interventional datasets, capturing the causal gene regulatory relationships from genetic perturbations. However, existing models are limited in their expressivity and scalability while failing to address the dynamic nature of biological processes such as cellular differentiation. We propose PerturbODE, a novel framework that incorporates biologically informative neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs) to model cell state trajectories under perturbations and derive the causal GRN from the neural ODE's parameters. We demonstrate PerturbODE's efficacy in trajectory prediction and GRN inference across simulated and real over-expression datasets.

Abstract:
Modeling the associations between real world entities from their multivariate cross-sectional profiles can provide cues into the concerted working of these entities as a system. Several techniques have been proposed for deciphering these associations including constraint-based Bayesian structure learning (BSL) algorithms that model them as directed acyclic graphs. Benchmarking these algorithms have typically focused on assessing the variation in performance measures such as sensitivity as a function of the dimensionality represented by the number of nodes in the DAG, and sample size. The present study elucidates the importance of network topology in benchmarking exercises. More specifically, it investigates variations in sensitivity across distinct network topologies while constraining the nodes, edges, and sample-size to be identical, eliminating these as potential confounders. Sensitivity of three popular constraint-based BSL algorithms (Peter-Clarke, Grow-Shrink, Incremental Association Markov Blanket) in learning the network structure from multivariate cross-sectional profiles sampled from network models with sub-linear, linear, and super-linear DAG topologies generated using preferential attachment is investigated. Results across linear and nonlinear models revealed statistically significant $(α=0.05)$ decrease in sensitivity estimates from sub-linear to super-linear topology constitutively across the three algorithms. These results are demonstrated on networks with nodes $(N_{nods}=48,64)$, noise strengths $(σ=3,6)$ and sample size $(N = 2^{10})$. The findings elucidate the importance of accommodating the network topology in constraint-based BSL benchmarking exercises.

Abstract:
We study Hopfield networks with non-reciprocal coupling inducing switches between memory patterns. Dynamical phase transitions occur between phases of no memory retrieval, retrieval of multiple point-attractors, and limit-cycle attractors. The limit cycle phase is bounded by two critical regions: a Hopf bifurcation line and a fold bifurcation line, each with unique dynamical critical exponents and sensitivity to perturbations. A Master Equation approach numerically verifies the critical behavior predicted analytically. We discuss how these networks could model biological processes near a critical threshold of cyclic instability evolving through multi-step transitions.

Abstract:
The human MHC transplantation loci (HLA-A, -B, -C, -DPB1, -DQB1, -DRB1) are the most polymorphic in the human genome. It is generally accepted this polymorphism reflects a role in presenting pathogen-derived peptide to the adaptive immune system. Proposed mechanisms for the polymorphism such as negative frequency-dependent selection (NFDS) and heterozygote advantage (HA) focus on HLA alleles, not haplotypes. Here, we propose a model for the polymorphism in which infectious diseases impose independent density-dependent regulation on HLA haplotypes. More specifically, a complex pathogen environment drives extensive host polymorphism through a guild of HLA haplotypes that are specialised and show incomplete peptide recognition. Separation of haplotype guilds is maintained by limiting similarity. The outcome is a wide and stable range of haplotype densities at steady-state in which effective Fisher fitnesses are zero. Densities, and therefore frequencies, emerge theoretically as alternative measures of fitness. A catalogue of ranked frequencies is therefore one of ranked fitnesses. The model is supported by data from a range of sources including a Caucasian HLA dataset compiled by the US National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP). These provide evidence of positive selection on the top 350-2000 5-locus HLA haplotypes taken from an overall NMDP sample set of 10E5. High-fitness haplotypes drive the selection of 137 high-frequency alleles spread across the 5 HLA loci under consideration. These alleles demonstrate positive epistasis and pleiotropy in the formation of haplotypes. Allelic pleiotropy creates a network of highly inter-related HLA haplotypes that account for 97% of the census sample. We suggest this network has properties of a quasi-species and is itself under selection. We also suggest this is the origin of balancing selection in the HLA system.

Abstract:
Achaete-scute complex homolog 2 (ASCL2) codes a part of the basic helix-loop-helix (BHLH) transcription factor family. WNTs have been found to directly affect the stemness of the tumor cells via regulation of ASCL2. Switching off the ASCL2 literally blocks the stemness process of the tumor cells and vice versa. In colorectal cancer (CRC) cells treated with ETC-1922159, ASCL2 was found to be down regulated along with other genes. A recently developed search engine ranked combinations of ASCL2-X (X, a particular gene/protein) at 2nd order level after drug administration. Some rankings confirm the already tested combinations, while others point to those that are untested/unexplored. These rankings reveal which ASCL2-X combinations might be working synergistically in CRC. In this research work, I cover combinations of ASCL2 with WNT, transforming growth factor beta (TGFB), interleukin (IL), leucine rich repeat containing G protein-coupled receptor (LGR), NOTCH, solute carrier family (SLC), SRY-box transcription factor (SOX), small nucleolar RNA host gene (SNHG), KIAA, F-box protein (FBXO), family with sequence similarity (FAM), B cell CLL/lymphoma (BCL), autophagy related (ATG) and Rho GTPase activating protein (ARHGAP) family.

Abstract:
We answer several fundamental geometric questions about reaction networks with power-law kinetics, on topics such as generic finiteness of the number of steady states, robustness, and nondegenerate multistationarity. In particular, we give an ideal-theoretic characterization of generic absolute concentration robustness, as well as conditions under which a network that admits multiple steady states also has the capacity for nondegenerate multistationarity. The key tools underlying our results come from the theory of vertically parametrized systems, and include a linear algebra condition that characterizes when the steady state system has positive nondegenerate zeros.

Abstract:
Decades after their initial observation in prion-infected brain tissues, the identities of virus-like dense particles, varicose tubules, and oval bodies containing parallel bands and fibrils have remained elusive. Our recent work revealed that a phenotype of dilation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), most notable for the perinuclear space (PNS), contributes to spongiform degeneration. To assess the significance of this phenotype for the etiology of prion diseases, we explored whether it can be functionally linked to other neuropathological hallmarks observed in these diseases, as this would indicate it to be a central event. Having surveyed the neuropathological record and other distant literature niches, we propose a model in which pathogenic forms of the prion protein poison raft domains, including essential Na+, K+-ATPases (NKAs) embedded within them, thereby triggering an ER-centered cellular rescue program coordinated by the unfolded protein response (UPR). The execution of this program stalls general protein synthesis, causing the deterioration of synaptic spines. As the disease progresses, cells selectively increase sterol biosynthesis, along with ribosome and ER biogenesis. These adaptive rescue attempts cause morphological changes to the ER which manifest as ER dilation or ER hypertrophy in a manner that is influenced by Ca2+ influx into the cell. The nuclear-to-cytoplasmic transport of mRNAs and tRNAs interrupts in late stage disease, thereby depriving ribosomes of supplies and inducing them to aggregate into a paracrystalline form. In support of this model, we share previously reported data, whose features are consistent with the interpretation that 1) the phenotype of ER dilation is observed in major prion diseases, 2) varicose tubules and oval bodies represent ER hypertrophy, and 3) virus-like dense particles are paracrystalline aggregates of inactive ribosomes.

Abstract:
We study the global stability of generalized Lotka-Volterra systems with generalized polynomial right-hand side, without restrictions on the number of variables or the polynomial degree, including negative and non-integer degree. We introduce polyexponential dynamical systems, which are equivalent to the generalized Lotka-Volterra systems, and we use an analogy to the theory of mass-action kinetics to define and analyze complex balanced polyexponential systems, and implicitly analyze complex balanced generalized Lotka-Volterra systems. We prove that complex balanced generalized Lotka-Volterra systems have globally attracting states, up to standard conservation relations, which become linear for the associated polyexponential systems. In particular, complex balanced generalized Lotka-Volterra systems cannot give rise to periodic solutions, chaotic dynamics, or other complex dynamical behaviors. We describe a simple sufficient condition for complex balance in terms of an associated graph structure, and we use it to analyze specific examples.

Abstract:
A complex regulatory network controlling Arabidopsis root hair patterning has been defined using data collected over decades. The network, embedded in the root epidermis, contains positive and negative feedback loops, cell-cell signalling within the epidermal tissue, and receives positional signalling from underlying tissue. While there are extensive data regarding individual components and their interactions within the network, the sufficiency of the regulatory network to produce robust epidermal patterning is not clear, nor is it clear how individual components and interactions work together to ensure correct epidermal patterning. Mathematical modelling was used to address the questions of sufficiency, and to gain an integrated understanding of collective behaviour emerging from individual components and interactions within the regulatory network. Theoretical experiments were performed on a model of the root hair patterning regulatory network. It was found that our current understanding of the epidermal patterning network was insufficient to reproduce experimental data. The model was used to hypothesise the existence of an additional negative feedback loop which, when added to the currently understood regulatory network, enabled the model to reproduce wild type and mutant root hair patterning. Results of theoretical experiments on the modified regulatory network were used to; define an essential relationship between diffusive movement of two cell-cell signalling proteins; show that directed movement dysregulation of another cell-cell signalling protein causes root hair patterning to appear as though it no longer receives positional cues; and show that cooperativity or oligomerisation within the regulatory network's positive feedback loop are essential. This work presents an integrated, exploration of the regulatory network controlling epidermal root hair patterning in Arabidopsis.

Abstract:
The hierarchical organisation of cell identity is a fundamental feature of animal development with rich and well-characterized experimental phenomenology, yet the mechanisms driving its emergence remain unknown. The regulation of cell identity genes relies on a distinct mechanism involving higher-order interactions of transcription factors on distant regulatory regions called enhancers. These interactions are mediated by epigenetic regulators that are broadly shared between enhancers. Through the development of a new and predictive mathematical theory on the effects of epigenetic regulator activity on gene network dynamics, we demonstrate that hierarchical identities are essential emergent properties of animal-specific gene regulatory mechanisms. Hierarchical identities arise from the interplay between enhancer competition for epigenetic readers and cooperation through activation of shared transcriptional programs. We show that epigenetic regulatory mechanisms provide the network with self-similar properties that enable multilineage priming and signal-dependent control of progenitor states. The stabilisation of progenitor states is predicted to be controlled by the balance in activities between epigenetic writers and erasers. Our model quantitatively predicts lineage relationships, reconstructs all known blood progenitor states from terminal states, and explains mechanisms of cell identity dysregulation in cancer and the general differentiation effects of histone deacetylase inhibition. We identify non-specific modulation of enhancer competition as a central regulatory axis, with implications for developmental biology, cancer, and differentiation therapy.

Abstract:
In this paper, we propose a hypothesis regarding the travel and movement of chemicals between locations. We introduce six distinct methods to explain this process. The chemicals referred to in this article are those that we detect by the nose and can travel through the air. These are generally known as odorants or volatile compounds. Method 1 involves decomposing chemicals and transmitting their formulas digitally. Method 2 embeds chemicals in water, freezes it into ice, and transports it to the receiver, where the chemicals are extracted upon melting. Method 3 transfers chemicals via water logistics, with the receiver extracting them from the water. Method 4 uses airtight pipelines to transport chemicals in water, which are then extracted by the receiver. Method 5 projects chemical odors into the air, where the receiver captures them using suction. Method 6 draws from optical fiber technology to transmit chemical odors through a cable, ensuring the chemical composition remains intact. Each method ensures the receiver experiences the same scent as the sender.

Abstract:
To advance understanding of cellular metabolism and reduce batch-to-batch variability in cell culture processes, this study introduces a multi-scale hybrid modeling framework designed to simulate and predict the dynamic behavior of CHO cell cultures undergoing metabolic phase transitions. The model captures dependencies across molecular, cellular, and macro-kinetic levels, accounting for variability in single-cell metabolic phases. It integrates three components: (i) a stochastic mechanistic model of single-cell metabolic networks, (ii) a probabilistic model of phase transitions, and (iii) a macro-kinetic model of heterogeneous population dynamics. This modular architecture enables flexible representation of process trajectories under diverse conditions and incorporates heterogeneous online (e.g., oxygen uptake, pH) and offline measurements (e.g., viable cell density, metabolite concentrations). Leveraging these data and single-cell insights, the framework predicts culture dynamics using only readily available online measurements and initial conditions, delivering accurate long-term forecasts of multivariate culture behavior and uncertainty-aware estimates of batch-to-batch variation. Overall, this work establishes a robust foundation for digital twin platforms and predictive bioprocess analytics, supporting systematic experimental design and process control to improve yield and production stability in biomanufacturing.

Abstract:
Modeling dynamical biological systems is key for understanding, predicting, and controlling complex biological behaviors. Traditional methods for identifying governing equations, such as ordinary differential equations (ODEs), typically require extensive quantitative data, which is often scarce in biological systems due to experimental limitations. To address this challenge, we introduce an approach that determines biomolecular models from qualitative system behaviors expressed as Signal Temporal Logic (STL) statements, which are naturally suited to translate expert knowledge into computationally tractable specifications. Our method represents the biological network as a graph, where edges represent interactions between species, and uses a genetic algorithm to identify the graph. To infer the parameters of the ODEs modeling the interactions, we propose a gradient-based algorithm. On a numerical example, we evaluate two loss functions using STL robustness and analyze different initialization techniques to improve the convergence of the approach.

Abstract:
Biochemical reaction networks are typically modeled by $\dfrac{dx}{dt}=N\cdot K(x)=Y\cdot I_a\cdot K(x)$, with $x$ and $K(x)$ as the concentration and rate vectors, respectively, and $N$, $Y$, and $I_a$ as the stoichiometric, molecularity, and incidence matrices, respectively. Steady states, which describe their long-term behaviors, are determined by solving $N\cdot K(x)=0$, while complex balanced steady states are found by solving $I_a \cdot K(x)=0$. To investigate these complex networks, decomposition techniques are important, in particular, for computing steady states. Previously, we identified a widespread property across many networks: the existence of independent and incidence-independent decompositions, characterized by the ability to directly sum the stoichiometric and incidence matrices of the subnetworks, respectively, to match those of the entire network. Here, we discover the ubiquitous property that we call the Finest Decomposition Coarsening (FDC), where the finest independent decomposition (FID) is a coarsening of the finest incidence-independent decomposition (FIID). To support the analysis of this property, we introduce a MATLAB package designed to compute both these decompositions. We then characterize the FDC property and its relationship to structural factors such as the invertibility of the molecularity matrix. We also introduce and characterize the Finest Decompositions Equality (FDE) property, where FIID equals FID. Notably, we show that all deficiency zero networks exhibit the FDE property. Furthermore, we establish important relationships of the FID and FIID with decomposition of the network into its connected components. Our results highlight the prevalence of the coarsening property in reaction networks and deepens the understanding of the algebraic structure and dynamics of biochemical networks.

Abstract:
Under mass-action kinetics, complex-balanced systems emerge from biochemical reaction networks and exhibit stable and predictable dynamics. For a reaction network $G$, the associated dynamical system is called $\textit{disguised toric}$ if it can yield a complex-balanced realization on a possibly different network $G_1$. This concept extends the robust properties of toric systems to those that are not inherently toric. In this work, we study the $\textit{disguised toric locus}$ of a reaction network - i.e., the set of positive rate constants that make the corresponding mass-action system disguised toric. Our primary focus is to compute the exact dimension of this locus. We subsequently apply our results to Thomas-type and circadian clock models.

Abstract:
Polymers play a crucial role in the development of engineering materials, with applications ranging from mechanical to biomedical fields. However, the limited polymerization processes constrain the variety of organic building blocks that can be experimentally tested. We propose an open-source computational generative pipeline that integrates neural-network-based discriminators, generators, and query-based filtration mechanisms to overcome this limitation and generate hypothetical polymers. The pipeline targets properties, such as ionization potential (IP), by aligning various representational formats to generate hypothetical polymer candidates. The discriminators demonstrate improvements over state-of-the-art models due to optimized architecture, while the generators produce novel polymers tailored to the desired property range. We conducted extensive evaluations to assess the generative performance of the pipeline components, focusing on the polymers' ionization potential (IP). The developed pipeline is integrated into the DeepChem framework, enhancing its accessibility and compatibility for various polymer generation studies.

Abstract:
Natural biological systems process environmental information through both amplitude and frequency-modulated signals, yet engineered biological circuits have largely relied on amplitude-based regulation alone. Despite the prevalence of frequency-encoded signals in natural systems, fundamental challenges in designing and implementing frequency-responsive gene circuits have limited their development in synthetic biology. Here we present a Time-Resolved Gene Circuit (TRGC) architecture that enables frequency-to-amplitude signal conversion in engineered biological systems. Through systematic analysis, we establish a theoretical framework that guides the design of synthetic circuits capable of distinct frequency-dependent responses, implementing both high-pass and low-pass filtering behaviors. To enable rigorous characterization of these dynamic circuits, we developed a high-throughput automated platform that ensures stable and reproducible measurements of frequency-dependent r esponses across diverse conditions. Using this platform, we demonstrate that these frequency-modulated circuits can access cellular states unreachable through conventional amplitude modulation, significantly expanding the controllable gene expression space in multi-gene systems. Our results show that frequency modulation expands the range of achievable expression patterns when controlling multiple genes through a single input, demonstrating a new paradigm for engineering cellular behaviors. This work establishes frequency modulation as a powerful strategy for expanding the capabilities of engineered biological systems and enhancing cellular response to dynamic signals.

Abstract:
The search for pathways that optimize the formation of a particular target molecule in a reaction network is a key problem in many settings, including reactor systems. Chemical reaction networks are mathematically well represented as hypergraphs, modeling that facilitates the search for pathways by computational means. We propose to enrich an existing search method for pathways by including thermodynamic principles. In more detail, we give a mixed-integer linear programming (mixed ILP) formulation of the search problem into which we integrate chemical potentials and concentrations for individual molecules, enabling us to constrain the search to return pathways containing only thermodynamically favorable reactions. Moreover, if multiple possible pathways are found, we can rank these by objective functions based on thermodynamics. As an example of use, we apply the framework to a reaction network representing the HCN-formamide chemistry. Alternative pathways to the one currently hypothesized in the literature are queried and enumerated, including some that score better according to our chosen objective function.

Abstract:
Gaining insights from realistic dynamical models of biochemical systems can be challenging given their large number of state variables. Model reduction techniques can mitigate this by decreasing complexity by mapping the model onto a lower-dimensional state space. Exact constrained lumping identifies reductions as linear combinations of the original state variables in systems of nonlinear ordinary differential equations, preserving specific user-defined output variables without error. However, exact reductions can be too stringent in practice, as model parameters are often uncertain or imprecise -- a particularly relevant problem for biochemical systems. We propose approximate constrained lumping. It allows for a relaxation of exactness within a given tolerance parameter $\varepsilon$, while still working in polynomial time. We prove that the accuracy, i.e., the difference between the output variables in the original and reduced model, is in the order of $\varepsilon$. Furthermore, we provide a heuristic algorithm to find the smallest $\varepsilon$ for a given maximum allowable size of the lumped system. Our method is applied to several models from the literature, resulting in coarser aggregations than exact lumping while still capturing the dynamics of the original system accurately.

Abstract:
Regulation of gene expression is the consequence of interactions between the promoter of the gene and the transcription factors (TFs). In this paper, we explore the features of a genetic network where the TFs (activators and repressors) bind the promoter in a competitive way. We develop an analytical theory that offers detailed reaction kinetics of the competitive activator-repressor system which could be the powerful tools for extensive study and analysis of the genetic circuit in future research. Moreover, the theoretical approach helps us to find a most probable set of parameter values which was unavailable in experiments. We study the noisy behaviour of the circuit and compare the profile with the network where the activator and repressor bind the promoter non-competitively. We further notice that, due to the effect of transcriptional reinitiation in the presence of the activator and repressor molecules, there exits some anomalous characteristic features in the mean expressions and noise profiles. We find that, in presence of the reinitiation the noise in transcriptional level remains low while it is higher in translational level than the noise when the reinitiation is absent. In addition, it is possible to reduce the noise further below the Poissonian level in competitive circuit than the non-competitive one with the help of some noise reducing parameters.

Abstract:
In computational metabolic design, it is often necessary to modify the original constraint-based metabolic networks to lead to growth-coupled production, where cell growth forces target metabolite production. However, in genome-scale models, finding strategies to simultaneously delete and add genes to induce growth-coupled production is challenging. This is particularly true when heavy computation is necessary due to numerous gene deletions and additions. In this study, we mathematically defined related problems, proved NP-hardness and/or NP-completeness, and developed an algorithm named RatGene that (1) automatically integrates multiple constraint-based metabolic networks, (2) identifies gene deletion-addition strategies by a growth-to-production ratio-based approach, and (3) eliminates redundant gene additions and deletions. The results of computational experiments demonstrated that the RatGene-based approach can significantly improve the success ratio for identifying the strategies for growth-coupled production. RatGene can facilitate a more rational approach to computational metabolic design for the production of useful substances using microorganisms by concurrently considering both gene deletions and additions.

Abstract:
Mathematical models of living cells have been successively refined with advancements in experimental techniques. A main concern is striking a balance between modelling power and the tractability of the associated mathematical analysis.   In this work we model the dynamics for the transcription factor Hairy and enhancer of split-1 (Hes1), whose expression oscillates during neural development, and which critically enables stable fate decision in the embryonic brain. We design, parametrise, and analyse a detailed spatial model using ordinary differential equations (ODEs) over a grid capturing both transient oscillatory behaviour and fate decision on a population-level. We also investigate the relationship between this ODE model and a more realistic grid-based model involving intrinsic noise using mostly directly biologically motivated parameters.   While we focus specifically on Hes1 in neural development, the approach of linking deterministic and stochastic grid-based models shows promise in modelling various biological processes taking place in a cell population. In this context, our work stresses the importance of the interpretability of complex computational models into a framework which is amenable to mathematical analysis.

Abstract:
A fundamental question in the field of molecular computation is what computational tasks a biochemical system can carry out. In this work, we focus on the problem of finding the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) for log-affine models. We revisit a construction due to Gopalkrishnan of a mass-action system with the MLE as its unique positive steady state, which is based on choosing a basis for the kernel of the design matrix of the model. We extend this construction to allow for any finite spanning set of the kernel, and explore how the choice of spanning set influences the dynamics of the resulting network, including the existence of boundary steady states, the deficiency of the network, and the rate of convergence. In particular, we prove that using a Markov basis as the spanning set guarantees global stability of the MLE steady state.

Abstract:
Understanding how viral mutant spectra organize and explore genotype space is essential for unraveling the mechanisms driving evolution at the finest scale. Here we use deep-sequencing data of an amplicon in the A2 protein of the RNA bacteriophage Q$β$ to reconstruct genotype networks with tens of thousands of different haplotypes. The study of populations evolved under different temperature regimes uncovers generic topological features conditioned by fundamental structural motifs of genotype networks -- tetrahedrons, triangles, and squares -- that govern their local architecture. Mutant swarms display a hierarchical structure where sequences cluster around a highly connected and abundant sequence core that sustains population diversity. The immediate neighborhood of this core is comprehensively sampled, with no signs of selection, while a few mutations away sampling becomes dynamical and sparse, showing signs of purifying selection. By aggregating genotype networks from populations adapted to different temperatures, we capture the early stages of evolutionary divergence, with overlapping populations that remain connected through short mutational paths. Even at the time scale of these experiments, evolutionary pathways might be multiple, preventing the backward reconstruction of unique trajectories once mutations have been fixed. This analysis provides a detailed view of the local, fine-scale processes shaping viral quasispecies evolution and underscores the usefulness of genotype networks as an enlightening visualization of the organization of mutant swarms.

Abstract:
In this essay, we investigate some relations between Chemical Reaction Networks (CRN) and Mathematical Epidemiology (ME) and report on several pleasant surprises which we had simply by putting these two topics together.   Firstly, we propose a definition of ME models as a subset of CRN models.   Secondly, we review a fundamental stability result for boundary points, known in ME as the NGM method since it replaces the investigation of the Jacobian by that of a matrix whose origins lie in probability (the theory of branching processes). This important result seems to be little known outside of ME; even in ME, it has not been made clear before that the method gets sometimes the right answer, even though the conditions of the NGM theorem are not all satisfied. Thus, beyond the theorem, there is a heuristic approach, the validity conditions for which are not sufficiently understood.   Thirdly, we show that some simple CRN models with absolute concentration robustness (ACR), are close qualitatively to simple ME models, in the sense that they have an unique disease free equilibrium, and a unique interior fixed point, and the latter enters the positive domain and becomes stable precisely when $R_0:=s_{dfe} \mathcal{R}=\frac{s_{dfe}}{s_e}>1.$   (where $s$ denotes the "ACR species"). Thus, for these "ME type models", a "relay phenomena" takes place: precisely when the DFE loses stability, a new fixed point enters the domain, and takes over.   Last but not least, we offer in the associated GitHub repository https://github.com/adhalanay/epidemiology_crns a Mathematica package, Epid-CRN, which is addressed to researchers of both disciplines, and provide illustrative notebooks, which in particular solve a few minor open ME and CRN problems. Our package may also be used to study easy cases of analogue continuous time Markov chain (CTMC) ME and CRN models.

Abstract:
$β$-arrestins play pivotal roles in seven transmembrane receptor (7TMR) signalling and trafficking. To study their functional role in the regulation of specific receptor systems, current research relies mainly on genetic tools, as few pharmacological options are available. To address this issue, we designed and synthesised a novel lipidated phosphomimetic peptide inhibitor targeting $β$-arrestins, called ARIP, which was developed based on the C-terminal tail (A343-S371) of the vasopressin V2 receptor. As the V2R sequence has been shown to bind $β$-arrestins with high affinity and stability, we added an N-terminal palmitate residue to allow membrane tethering and subsequent cell entry. Here, using BRET2-based biosensors, we demonstrated the ability of ARIP to inhibit agonist-induced $β$-arrestin recruitment on a series of 7TMRs belonging to class A (low stable associations with arrestins) or class B (high stability), with efficiencies that dependent on receptor type. In addition, we showed that ARIP was unable to recruit $β$-arrestins to the cell membrane by itself, and that it did not interfere with canonical G protein signalling. Molecular modelling studies also revealed that ARIP binds $β$-arrestins in the same way as V2Rpp, the phosphorylated peptide derived from the V2R C-terminal domain, and that replacing the p-Ser and p-Thr residues of V2Rpp with Glu residues does not alter the inhibitory activity of ARIP on $β$-arrestin recruitment. Importantly, ARIP exerted an opioid-sparing effect in vivo, as intrathecal injection of ARIP potentiated the analgesic effect of morphine in the tail-flick nociceptive model, a behavioural response consistent with $β$-arrestin genetic inhibition. ARIP therefore represents a promising pharmacological tool for investigating the fine-tuning roles of $β$-arrestins in 7TMR-driven pathophysiological processes.

Abstract:
Molecular property prediction (MPP) is integral to drug discovery and material science, but often faces the challenge of data scarcity in real-world scenarios. Addressing this, few-shot molecular property prediction (FSMPP) has been developed. Unlike other few-shot tasks, FSMPP typically employs a pre-trained molecular encoder and a context-aware classifier, benefiting from molecular pre-training and molecular context information. Despite these advancements, existing methods struggle with the ineffective fine-tuning of pre-trained encoders. We attribute this issue to the imbalance between the abundance of tunable parameters and the scarcity of labeled molecules, and the lack of contextual perceptiveness in the encoders. To overcome this hurdle, we propose a parameter-efficient in-context tuning method, named Pin-Tuning. Specifically, we propose a lightweight adapter for pre-trained message passing layers (MP-Adapter) and Bayesian weight consolidation for pre-trained atom/bond embedding layers (Emb-BWC), to achieve parameter-efficient tuning while preventing over-fitting and catastrophic forgetting. Additionally, we enhance the MP-Adapters with contextual perceptiveness. This innovation allows for in-context tuning of the pre-trained encoder, thereby improving its adaptability for specific FSMPP tasks. When evaluated on public datasets, our method demonstrates superior tuning with fewer trainable parameters, improving few-shot predictive performance.

Abstract:
Conventional histopathology has long been essential for disease diagnosis, relying on visual inspection of tissue sections. Immunohistochemistry aids in detecting specific biomarkers but is limited by its single-marker approach, restricting its ability to capture the full tissue environment. The advent of multiplexed imaging technologies, like multiplexed immunofluorescence and spatial transcriptomics, allows for simultaneous visualization of multiple biomarkers in a single section, enhancing morphological data with molecular and spatial information. This provides a more comprehensive view of the tissue microenvironment, cellular interactions, and disease mechanisms - crucial for understanding disease progression, prognosis, and treatment response. However, the extensive data from multiplexed imaging necessitates sophisticated computational methods for preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction, and spatial analysis. These tools are vital for managing large, multidimensional datasets, converting raw imaging data into actionable insights. By automating labor-intensive tasks and enhancing reproducibility and accuracy, computational tools are pivotal in diagnostics and research. This review explores the current landscape of multiplexed imaging in pathology, detailing workflows and key technologies like PathML, an AI-powered platform that streamlines image analysis, making complex dataset interpretation accessible for clinical and research settings.

Abstract:
Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable generalization and instruction-following capabilities with instruction tuning. The advancements in LLMs and instruction tuning have led to the development of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). However, the competency of the LLMs and instruction tuning have been less explored in the molecular domain. Thus, we propose LLaMo: Large Language Model-based Molecular graph assistant, which is an end-to-end trained large molecular graph-language model. To bridge the discrepancy between the language and graph modalities, we present the multi-level graph projector that transforms graph representations into graph tokens by abstracting the output representations of each GNN layer and motif representations with the cross-attention mechanism. We also introduce machine-generated molecular graph instruction data to instruction-tune the large molecular graph-language model for general-purpose molecule and language understanding. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that LLaMo shows the best performance on diverse tasks, such as molecular description generation, property prediction, and IUPAC name prediction. The code of LLaMo is available at https://github.com/mlvlab/LLaMo.

Abstract:
Understanding the genetic basis of complex traits is a longstanding challenge in the field of genomics. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of variant-trait associations, but most of these variants are located in non-coding regions, making the link to biological function elusive. While traditional approaches, such as transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS), have advanced our understanding by linking genetic variants to gene expression, they often overlook gene-gene interactions. Here, we review current approaches to integrate different molecular data, leveraging machine learning methods to identify gene modules based on co-expression and functional relationships. These integrative approaches, like PhenoPLIER, combine TWAS and drug-induced transcriptional profiles to effectively capture biologically meaningful gene networks. This integration provides a context-specific understanding of disease processes while highlighting both core and peripheral genes. These insights pave the way for novel therapeutic targets and enhance the interpretability of genetic studies in personalized medicine.

Abstract:
Metabolite biosynthesis is regulated via metabolic pathways, which can be activated and deactivated within organisms. Understanding and identifying an organism's metabolic pathway network is a crucial aspect for various research fields, including crop and life stock breeding, pharmacology, and medicine. The problem of identifying whether a pathway is part of a studied metabolic system is commonly framed as a hyperlink prediction problem. The most important challenge in prediction of metabolic pathways is the sparsity of the labeled data. This challenge can partially be mitigated using metabolite correlation networks which are affected by all active pathways including those that were not confirmed yet in laboratory experiments. Unfortunately, extracting properties that can confirm or refute existence of a metabolic pathway in a particular organism is not a trivial task. In this research, we introduce the Network Auralization Hyperlink Prediction (NetAurHPD) which is a framework that relies on (1) graph auralization to extract and aggregate representations of nodes in metabolite correlation networks and (2) data augmentation method that generates metabolite correlation networks given a subset of chemical reactions defined as hyperlinks. Experiments with metabolites correlation-based networks of tomato pericarp demonstrate promising results for NetAurHPD, compared to alternative methods. Furthermore, the application of data augmentation improved NetAurHPD's learning capabilities and overall performance. Additionally, NetAurHPD outperformed state-of-the-art method in experiments under challenging conditions, and has the potential to be a valuable tool for exploring organisms with limited existing knowledge.

Abstract:
Modeling cellular dynamics from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data is critical for understanding cell development and underlying gene regulatory relationships. Many current methods rely on single-cell velocity to obtain pseudotime, which can lead to inconsistencies between pseudotime and velocity. It is challenging to simultaneously infer cell pseudotime and gene interaction networks, especially in multi-branch differentiation scenarios. We present single-cell Piecewise Network (scPN), a novel high-dimensional dynamical modeling approach that iteratively extracts temporal patterns and inter-gene relationships from scRNA-seq data. To tackle multi-branch differentiation challenges, scPN models gene regulatory dynamics using piecewise gene-gene interaction networks, offering an interpretable framework for deciphering complex gene regulation patterns over time. Results on synthetic data and multiple scRNA-seq datasets demonstrate the superior performance of scPN in reconstructing cellular dynamics and identifying key transcription factors involved in development compared to existing methods. To the best of our knowledge, scPN is the first attempt at modeling that can recover pseudotime, velocity fields, and gene interactions all at once on multi-branch datasets.

Abstract:
Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN) is a standardised notational system that visualises biochemical processes as networks. These visualizations lack a formal framework, so that the analysis of such networks through modelling and simulation is an entirely separate task, determined by a chosen modelling framework (e.g. differential equations, Petri nets, stochastic processes, graphs). A second research gap is the lack of a mathematical framework to compose network representations. The complexity of molecular and cellular processes forces experimental studies to focus on subsystems. To study the functioning of biological systems across levels of structural and functional organisation, we require tools to compose and organise networks with different levels of detail and abstraction.   We address these challenges by introducing a category-theoretic formalism for biochemical processes visualised using SBGN Process Description (SBGN-PD) language. Using the theory of structured cospans, we construct a symmetric monoidal double category and demonstrate its horizontal 1-morphisms as SBGN Process Descriptions. We obtain organisational principles such as 'compositionality' (building a large SBGN-PD from smaller ones) and 'zooming-out' (abstracting away details in biochemical processes) defined in category-theoretic terms. We also formally investigate how a particular portion of a biochemical network influences the remaining portion of the network and vice versa. Throughout the paper, we illustrate our findings using standard SBGN-PD examples.

Abstract:
Antiterminators are essential components of bacterial transcriptional regulation, allowing the control of gene expression in response to fluctuating environmental conditions. RNA-binding antiterminators are particularly important regulatory proteins that play a significant role in preventing transcription termination by binding to specific RNA sequences. These RNA-binding antiterminators have been extensively studied for their roles in regulating various metabolic pathways. However, their role in modulating the physiology of pathogens requires further investigations. This review focuses on these RNA-binding proteins in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, particularly on their structures, mechanism of action, and target genes. Additionally, the involvement of the antitermination mechanisms in bacterial pathogenicity will be discussed. This knowledge is crucial for understanding the regulatory mechanisms that govern bacterial pathogenicity, opening up exciting prospects for future research, and potentially new alternative strategies to fight against infectious diseases.

Abstract:
Understanding the origins of complexity is a fundamental challenge with implications for biological and technological systems. Network theory emerges as a powerful tool to model complex systems. Networks are an intuitive framework to represent inter-dependencies among many system components, facilitating the study of both local and global properties. However, it is unclear whether we can define a universal theoretical framework for evolving networks. While basic growth mechanisms, like preferential attachment, recapitulate common properties such as the power-law degree distribution, they fall short in capturing other system-specific properties. Tinkering, on the other hand, has shown to be very successful in generating modular or nested structures "for-free", highlighting the role of internal, non-adaptive mechanisms in the evolution of complexity. Different network extensions, like hypergraphs, have been recently developed to integrate exogenous factors in evolutionary models, as pairwise interactions are insufficient to capture environmentally-mediated species associations. As we confront global societal and climatic challenges, the study of network and hypergraphs provides valuable insights, emphasizing the importance of scientific exploration in understanding and managing complexity.

Abstract:
In the modelling of stochastic phenomena, such as quasi-reaction systems, parameter estimation of kinetic rates can be challenging, particularly when the time gap between consecutive measurements is large. Local linear approximation approaches account for the stochasticity in the system but fail to capture the nonlinear nature of the underlying process. At the mean level, the dynamics of the system can be described by a system of ODEs, which have an explicit solution only for simple unitary systems. An analytical solution for generic quasi-reaction systems is proposed via a first order Taylor approximation of the hazard rate. This allows a nonlinear forward prediction of the future dynamics given the current state of the system. Predictions and corresponding observations are embedded in a nonlinear least-squares approach for parameter estimation. The performance of the algorithm is compared to existing SDE and ODE-based methods via a simulation study. Besides the increased computational efficiency of the approach, the results show an improvement in the kinetic rate estimation, particularly for data observed at large time intervals. Additionally, the availability of an explicit solution makes the method robust to stiffness, which is often present in biological systems. An illustration on Rhesus Macaque data shows the applicability of the approach to the study of cell differentiation.

Abstract:
Through experimental studies, many details of the pathway of integrin $α_{\rm IIb}β_3$ activation by ADP during the platelet aggregation process have been mapped out. ADP binds to two separate G protein coupled receptors on platelet surfaces, leading to alterations in the regulation of the small GTPase RAP1. We seek to (1) gain insights into the relative contributions of both pathways to RAP1-mediated integrin activation and to (2) predict wildtype and mutated cell behavior in response to a continuous range of external agonist concentrations. To this end, we develop a dynamical systems model detailing the action of each protein in the two pathways up to the regulation of RAP1. We perform a parameter estimation using flow cytometry data to determine a number of unknown rate constants. We then validate with already published data; in particular, the model confirmed the effect of impaired P2Y$_1$ receptor desensitization or reduced RASA3 expression on RAP1 activation. We then predict the effect of protein expression levels on integrin activation and show that components of the P2Y$_{12}$ pathway are critical to the regulation of integrin. This model aids in our understanding of interindividual variability in platelet response to ADP and therapeutic P2Y$_{12}$ inhibition. It also provides a more detailed view of platelet activation in the ongoing mathematical study of platelet aggregation.

Abstract:
A cell routinely responds to one of many competing environmental cues. A fundamental question is whether the cell follows the cue prioritized by its internal signaling network or the cue that carries the most external information. We introduce a theoretical framework to answer this question. We derive information limits for four types of directional cues: external and self-generated chemical gradients, fluid flow, and contact inhibition of locomotion. When the cues compete as pairs, these limits predict which cue a cell should follow if its decision is based on environmental information alone. We compare these predicted decision boundaries with data from our and others' cell migration experiments, finding cases where the boundary is obeyed and cases where it is violated by orders of magnitude. Both outcomes are informative, and we find that they rationalize known properties, or predict putative properties, of cells' internal signaling networks. Our work introduces a physical framework to quantify the degree to which a cell acts like an autonomous agent, rather than a passive detector, favoring a cue even when it is less informative.

Abstract:
Artificial neural networks (NNs) can be implemented using chemical reaction networks (CRNs), where the concentrations of species act as inputs and outputs. In such biochemical computing, noise-robust computing is crucial due to the intrinsic and extrinsic noise present in chemical reactions. Previously suggested CRNs for feed-forward networks often utilized the rectified linear unit (ReLU) or discrete activation functions. However, one concern in this case is the discontinuities of the derivatives of those non-smooth functions, which can cause significant noise disruption during backpropagation. In this study, we propose a CRN that performs both feed-forward and training processes using smooth activation functions to avoid discontinuities in the backpropagation. All reactions occur in a single pot, and the reactions for training are bimolecular. Our case studies on XOR, Iris, MNIST datasets, and a non-linear regression model demonstrate that computation via the CRN (i) maintains accuracy despite noise in the reaction rates and the concentration of species and (ii) is insensitive to the choice of the running time and the magnitude of the noise in comparison to NNs with a non-smooth activation function. This work presents a noise-robust CRN for full NN computation, including backpropagation, paving the way for more stable and efficient biochemical computing systems.

Abstract:
Many cellular patterns exhibit a reaction-diffusion component, suggesting that Turing instability may contribute to pattern formation. However, biological gene-regulatory pathways are more complex than simple Turing activator-inhibitor models and generally do not require fine-tuning of parameters as dictated by the Turing conditions. To address these issues, we employ random matrix theory to analyze the Jacobian matrices of larger networks with robust statistical properties. Our analysis reveals that Turing patterns are more likely to occur by chance than previously thought and that the most robust Turing networks have an optimal size, surprisingly consisting only of a handful of molecular species, thus significantly increasing their identifiability in biological systems. This optimal size emerges from a tradeoff between the highest stability in small networks and the greatest instability with diffusion in large networks. Furthermore, we find that with multiple immobile nodes, differential diffusion ceases to be important for Turing patterns. Our findings may inform future synthetic biology approaches and provide insights into bridging the gap to complex developmental pathways.

Abstract:
Stochastic models for chemical reaction networks are increasingly popular in systems and synthetic biology. These models formulate the reaction dynamics as Continuous-Time Markov Chains (CTMCs) whose propensities are parameterized by a vector $θ$ and parameter sensitivities are introduced as derivatives of their expected outputs with respect to components of the parameter vector. Sensitivities characterise key properties of the output like robustness and are also at the heart of numerically efficient optimisation routines like Newton-type algorithms used in parameter inference and the design of of control mechanisms. Currently the only unbiased estimator for second-order sensitivities is based on the Girsanov transform and it often suffers from high estimator variance. We develop a novel estimator for second-order sensitivities by first rigorously deriving an integral representation of these sensitivities. We call the resulting method the Double Bernoulli Path Algorithm and illustrate its efficiency through numerical examples.

Abstract:
Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) play a crucial role in the control of cellular functions. Numerous methods have been developed to infer GRNs from gene expression data, including mechanism-based approaches, information-based approaches, and more recent deep learning techniques, the last of which often overlook the underlying gene expression mechanisms. In this work, we introduce TRENDY, a novel GRN inference method that integrates transformer models to enhance the mechanism-based WENDY approach. Through testing on both simulated and experimental datasets, TRENDY demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods. Furthermore, we apply this transformer-based approach to three additional inference methods, showcasing its broad potential to enhance GRN inference.

Abstract:
Oxidative stress is a fundamental stimulus to which eukaryotic cells respond via many channels. Among these channels are both protein systems that process oxidative stress, such as the 2-Cys peroxiredoxin-thioredoxin system (PTRS), as well as changes in transcriptional activity that target outcomes such as growth, damage control and repair, or cell death. Recent work has revealed connections between the PTRS and temporal phases of transcriptional activity involving famous transcription factors like p53 and FOXO1. To examine potential mechanisms for these connections, we implement an existing dynamical systems mathematical model for the PTRS. We hypothesize that dose-dependent hyperoxidation events enact ultrasensitive switches by which the PTRS can categorize stress severity and activate appropriate transcriptional responses. Using numerical simulations of the PTRS in human cells, we provide a proof of principle for staggered, switchlike hyperoxidation of peroxiredoxins (Prx) as well as an underlying mechanism requiring simultaneous signaling by Prx I and II. Then, we use our model to make testable predictions about individual Prx knockouts as well as the affinity for hydrogen peroxide of Prx across oxidation states. This study provides direction for future experimental work and sheds light into the mechanisms underlying oxidative stress response in human cells.

Abstract:
Recently, plenty research has been done on discovering the role of energy dissipation in biological networks, most of which focus on the relationship of dissipation and functionality. However, the development of networks science urged us to fathom the systematic architecture of biological networks and their evolutionary advantages. We found the dissipation of biological dissipative networks is highly related to their structure. By interrogating these well-adapted networks, we find that the energy producing module is relatively isolated in all situations. We applied evolutionary simulation and analysis on premature networks of classic dissipative networks, namely kinetic proofreading, activator-inhibitor oscillator and two typical adaptative response models. We found despite that selection was imposed merely on the network function, the networks tended to decouple high energy molecules as fuels from the functional module, to achieve higher overall dissipation during the course of evolution. Furthermore, we find that decoupled fuel modules can increase the robustness of the networks towards parameter or structure perturbations. We provide theoretical analysis on the kinetic proofreading networks and the general case of energy-driven networks. We find fuel decoupling can guarantee higher dissipation and, in most cases when considering dissipative networks, higher performance. We conclude that fuel decoupling is an evolutionary outcome and bears benefits during evolution.

Abstract:
We develop a systems approach based on an energy-landscape concept to differentiate interactions involving redox activities and conformational changes of proteins and nucleic acids interactions in multi-layered protein-DNA regulatory networks under light disturbance. Our approach is a data-driven modeling workflow using a physics-informed machine learning algorithm to train a non-linear mathematical model for interpreting gene expression dynamics and to lead discovery for protein regulators using redox proteome analysis. We distinguish light-responsive elements within central carbon metabolism pathways from independent variables like circadian time using the publicly available transcriptome datasets of Synechococcus elongatus over diel cycles responding to light perturbations. Our approach provides interpretable de novo models for elucidating events of reactions in complex regulatory pathways in response to stressful disturbance from the environment. We discovered protein regulators in response to light disturbance in the proteome analysis involving shifts in protein abundance as well as cysteine redox states under constant illumination and after two hours of darkness. We discovered significant shifts in cysteine redox states in regulatory proteins such as transcription sigma factors and metabolic enzymes in the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway and the Calvin-Benson cycle, while the changes in their protein abundance were minimal. These results indicate that regulatory dynamics in reductant generation link photo-induced electron transport pathways and redox metabolic pathways with circadian rhythms through fast redox-induced conformational changes or slow expression regulations across networks.

Abstract:
Asynchronous Boolean networks are a type of discrete dynamical system in which each variable can take one of two states, and a single variable state is updated in each time step according to pre-selected rules. Boolean networks are popular in systems biology due to their ability to model long-term biological phenotypes within a qualitative, predictive framework. Boolean networks model phenotypes as attractors, which are closely linked to minimal trap spaces (inescapable hypercubes in the system's state space). In biological applications, attractors and minimal trap spaces are typically in one-to-one correspondence. However, this correspondence is not guaranteed: motif-avoidant attractors (MAAs) that lie outside minimal trap spaces are possible.   MAAs are rare and (despite recent efforts) poorly understood. Here we summarize the current state of knowledge regarding MAAs and present several novel observations regarding their response to node deletion reductions and linear extensions of edges. We conduct large-scale computational studies on an ensemble of 14,000 models derived from published Boolean models of biological systems, and more than 100 million Random Boolean Networks. Our findings quantify the rarity of MAAs (in particular, we found no MAAs in the biological models), but highlight the role of network reduction in introducing MAAs into the dynamics. We also show that MAAs are fragile to linear extensions: in sparse networks, even a single linear node can disrupt virtually all MAAs. Motivated by this observation, we improve the upper bound on the number of delays needed to disrupt a motif-avoidant attractor.

Abstract:
In this study, the predominant lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolates were obtained from Gouda, Jack, Cheddar, and Parmesan cheeses produced in Uganda. The isolates were identified through Gram staining, catalase and oxidase tests, and 16S rDNA sequencing. Approximately 90% of the isolates were cocci (n=192), including Streptococcus, Enterococcus, and Lactococcus. The remaining 10% were identified as rod-shaped bacteria, primarily belonging to the Lactobacillus species (n=23). BLAST analysis revealed that Pediococcus pentosaceus dominated in all cheese samples (23.7%, of the total 114 isolates). This was followed by uncultured bacterium (15.8%), uncultured Pediococcus species (13.2%), Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus (8.8%) among others

Abstract:
Agent-based models capture heterogeneity among individuals in a population and are widely used in studies of multi-cellular systems, disease, epidemics and demography to name a few. However, existing frameworks consider discrete time-step simulation or assume that agents' states only change as a result of discrete events. In this note, we present AgentBasedModeling$.$jl, a Julia package for simulating stochastic agent-based population models in continuous time. The tool allows to easily specify and simulate agents evolving through generic continuous-time jump-diffusions and interacting via continuous-rate processes. AgentBasedModeling$.$jl provides a powerful methodology for studying the effects of stochasticity on structured population dynamics.

Abstract:
Identifying driver genes is crucial for understanding oncogenesis and developing targeted cancer therapies. Driver discovery methods using protein or pathway networks rely on traditional network science measures, focusing on nodes, edges, or community metrics. These methods can overlook the high-dimensional interactions that cancer genes have within cancer networks. This study presents a novel method using Persistent Homology to analyze the role of driver genes in higher-order structures within Cancer Consensus Networks derived from main cellular pathways. We integrate mutation data from six cancer types and three biological functions: DNA Repair, Chromatin Organization, and Programmed Cell Death. We systematically evaluated the impact of gene removal on topological voids ($β_2$ structures) within the Cancer Consensus Networks. Our results reveal that only known driver genes and cancer-associated genes influence these structures, while passenger genes do not. Although centrality measures alone proved insufficient to fully characterize impact genes, combining higher-order topological analysis with traditional network metrics can improve the precision of distinguishing between drivers and passengers. This work shows that cancer genes play an important role in higher-order structures, going beyond pairwise measures, and provides an approach to distinguish drivers and cancer-associated genes from passenger genes.

Abstract:
Motivation   Network visualization is critical for effective communication in various fields of knowledge. Currently, a gap separates network manipulation from network visualization in programming environments. Users often export network data to be laid out in external interactive software, like Cytoscape and Gephi. We argue the current R package ecosystem lacks an interactive layout engine well integrated with common data analysis workflows.   Results   We present easylayout, an R package that bridges network manipulation and visualization by leveraging interactive force simulations within the IDE itself (e.g., RStudio, VSCode). It is not yet another visualization library, but instead aims to interconnect existing libraries and streamline their usage into the R ecosystem. easylayout takes an igraph object and serializes it into a web application integrated with the IDE's interface through a Shiny server. The app lays out the network by simulating attraction and repulsion forces. Simulation parameters can be adjusted in real-time. An editing mode allows moving and rotating nodes. The implementation aims for performance, so that even lower-end devices are able to work with relatively large networks. Once the user finishes tweaking the layout, it is sent back to the R session to be plotted through popular libraries like ggraph, igraph or even the base package itself. The current implementation focuses on the R ecosystem, but using web technologies makes it easily portable to similar environments, like Python/Jupyter Notebooks. We expect this tool to reduce the time spent searching for suitable network layouts, ultimately allowing researchers to generate more compelling figures.   Availability and implementation   easylayout is freely available under an MIT license on GitHub (https://github.com/dalmolingroup/easylayout). The package is implemented in R/Shiny and JavaScript/Svelte.

Abstract:
Controlling the stochastic dynamics of biological populations is a challenge that arises across various biological contexts. However, these dynamics are inherently nonlinear and involve a discrete state space, i.e., the number of molecules, cells, or organisms. Additionally, the possibility of extinction has a significant impact on both dynamics and control strategies, particularly when the population size is small. These factors hamper the direct application of conventional control theories to biological systems. To address these challenges, we formulate the optimal control problem for stochastic population dynamics by utilizing control cost functions based on the f-divergence, which naturally accounts for population-specific factors. If Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence is adopted for the cost function, the complex nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation is simplified into a linear form, facilitating efficient computation of optimal solutions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to the control of interacting random walkers, Moran processes, and SIR models, and observe the mode-switching phenomena in the control strategies. Our approach provides new opportunities for applying control theory to a wide range of biological problems.

Abstract:
Stochastic fluctuations of molecular abundances are a ubiquitous feature of cellular processes and lead to significant cell-to-cell variability. Recent theoretical work established lower bounds for stochastic fluctuations in cells for broad classes of cellular processes by analyzing the dynamics of reaction motifs that are embedded within a larger network with arbitrary interactions and dynamics. For example, a class of generalized assembly processes in which two co-regulated subunits irreversibly form a complex was shown to exhibit an unavoidable trade-off between assembly efficiency and subunit fluctuations: Regardless of rate constants and details of feedback control, subunit fluctuations were shown to diverge as the assembly efficiency approaches 100%. In contrast, other work has reported how efficient assembly processes work as stochastic noise filters or can achieve robust adaptation through integral control. While all of these results are technically correct their seemingly contradictory conclusions raise the question of how broadly applicable the previously reported efficiency-fluctuation trade-off is. Here, we show that a much broader class of assembly processes than previously considered is subject to an efficiency-fluctuation trade-off which diverges in the high efficiency regime. We find the proposed noise filtering property of efficient assembly processes corresponds to a singular limit of this class of systems. Additionally, we show that combining feedback control with distinct subunit synthesis rates is a necessary condition to overcome the generalized efficiency-fluctuation trade-off. Through numerical examples, we show that biomolecular integral controllers are one of several realizations of such control. How small a change to joint subunit control is sufficient to avoid diverging fluctuations in the high-efficiency limit remains an open question.

Abstract:
This Letter introduces a generalization of known duplication-divergence models for growing random graphs. This general duplication-divergence model includes a new coupled divergence asymmetry rate, which allows to obtain the structure of random growing networks by duplication-divergence in a continuous range of configurations between two known limit cases (i) complete asymmetric divergence, i.e., divergence rates affect only edges of either the original or the copy vertex, and (ii) symmetric divergence, i.e., divergence rates affect equiprobably both the original and the copy vertex. Multiple connected sub-graphs (of order greater than one) (of order greater than one) emerge as the divergence asymmetry rate slightly moves from the complete asymmetric divergence case. Mean-field results of priorly published models are nicely reproduced by this generalization. In special cases, the connected components size distribution $C_s$ suggests a power-law scaling of the form $C_s \sim s^{-λ}$ for $s>1$, e.g., with $λ\approx 5/3$ for divergence rate $δ\approx 0.7$.

Abstract:
Incomplete knowledge of metabolic processes hinders the accuracy of GEnome-scale Metabolic models (GEMs), which in turn impedes advancements in systems biology and metabolic engineering. Existing gap-filling methods typically rely on phenotypic data to minimize the disparity between computational predictions and experimental results. However, there is still a lack of an automatic and precise gap-filling method for initial state GEMs before experimental data and annotated genomes become available. In this study, we introduce CLOSEgaps, a deep learning-driven tool that addresses the gap-filling issue by modeling it as a hyperedge prediction problem within GEMs. Specifically, CLOSEgaps maps metabolic networks as hypergraphs and learns their hyper-topology features to identify missing reactions and gaps by leveraging hypothetical reactions. This innovative approach allows for the characterization and curation of both known and hypothetical reactions within metabolic networks. Extensive results demonstrate that CLOSEgaps accurately gap-filling over 96% of artificially introduced gaps for various GEMs. Furthermore, CLOSEgaps enhances phenotypic predictions for 24 GEMs and also finds a notable improvement in producing four crucial metabolites (Lactate, Ethanol, Propionate, and Succinate) in two organisms. As a broadly applicable solution for any GEM, CLOSEgaps represents a promising model to automate the gap-filling process and uncover missing connections between reactions and observed metabolic phenotypes.

Abstract:
We present a systematic procedure for testing whether reaction networks exhibit non-expansivity or monotonicity. This procedure identifies explicit norms under which a network is non-expansive or cones for which the system is monotone-or provides proof that no such structures exist. Our approach reproduces known results, generates novel findings, and demonstrates that certain reaction networks cannot exhibit monotonicity or non-expansivity with respect to any cone or norm. Additionally, we establish a duality relationship which states that if a network is monotone, so is its dual network.

Abstract:
Emergence during mammalian evolution of concordant and divergent traits of genomic regulatory networks encompassing ubiquitous, qualitatively nearly identical yet quantitatively distinct arrays of sequences of transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) for 716 proteins is reported. A vast majority of TFs (770 of 716; 98%) comprising protein constituents of these networks appear to share common Gene Ontology (GO) features of sequence-specific double-stranded DNA binding (GO: 1990837). Genome-wide and individual chromosome-level analyses of 17,935 ATAC-seq-defined brain development regulatory regions (BDRRs) revealed nearly universal representations of TFBS for TF-constituents of these networks, TFBS densities of which appear consistently higher within thousands BDRRs of Modern Humans compare to Chimpanzee. Transposable elements (TE), including LTR/HERV, SINE/Alu, SVA, and LINE families, appear to harbor and spread genome-wide consensus regulatory nodes of identified herein highly conserved sequence-specific double-stranded DNA binding networks, selections of TFBS panels of which manifest individual chromosome-specific profiles and species-specific divergence patterns. Collectively, observations reported in this contribution highlight a previously unrecognized essential function of human genomic DNA sequences encoded by TE in providing genome-wide regulatory seed templates of highly conserved sequence-specific double-stranded DNA binding networks likely contributing to continuing divergent genomic evolution of human and chimpanzee brain development.

Abstract:
The discovery of CRISPR-mediated gene activation (CRISPRa) has transformed the way in which we perform genetic screening, bioproduction and therapeutics through its ability to scale and multiplex. However, the emergence of loads on the key molecular resources constituting CRISPRa by the orthogonal short RNA that guide such resources to gene targets, couple theoretically independent CRISPRa modules. This coupling negates the ability of CRISPRa systems to concurrently regulate multiple genes independent of one another. In this paper, we propose to reduce this coupling by mitigating the loads on the molecular resources that constitute CRISPRa. In particular, we design a multi-variable controller that makes the concentration of these molecular resources robust to variations in the level of the short RNA loads. This work serves as a foundation to design and implement CRISPRa controllers for practical applications.

Abstract:
We present results on the geometry of the positive equilibrium set of a mass action network. Any mass action network gives rise to a parameterised family of polynomial equations whose positive solutions are the positive equilibria of the network. Here, we start by deriving alternative systems of equations, whose solutions are in smooth, one-to-one correspondence with positive equilibria of the network, and capture degeneracy or nondegeneracy of the corresponding equilibria. The derivation leads us to consider partitions of networks in a natural sense, and we explore the implications of choosing different partitions. The alternative systems are often simpler than the original mass action equations, sometimes giving explicit parameterisations of positive equilibria, and allowing us to rapidly identify various algebraic and geometric properties of the positive equilibrium set, including toricity and local toricity. We can use the approaches we develop to bound the number of positive nondegenerate equilibria on stoichiometric classes; to derive semialgebraic descriptions of the parameter regions for multistationarity; and to study bifurcations. We present the main construction, various consequences for particular classes of networks, and numerous examples. We also develop additional techniques specifically for quadratic networks, the most common class of networks in applications, and use these techniques to derive strengthened results for quadratic networks.

Abstract:
Epigenetics plays a key role in cellular differentiation and maintaining cell identity, enabling cells to regulate their genetic activity without altering the DNA sequence. Epigenetic regulation occurs within the context of hierarchically folded chromatin, yet the interplay between the dynamics of epigenetic modifications and chromatin architecture remains poorly understood. In addition, it remains unclear what mechanisms drive the formation of rugged epigenetic patterns, characterised by alternating genomic regions enriched in activating and repressive marks. In this study, we focus on post-translational modifications of histone H3 tails, particularly H3K27me3, H3K4me3, and H3K27ac. We introduce a mesoscopic stochastic model that incorporates chromatin architecture and competition of histone-modifying enzymes into the dynamics of epigenetic modifications in small genomic loci comprising several nucleosomes. Our approach enables us to investigate the mechanisms by which epigenetic patterns form on larger scales of chromatin organisation, such as loops and domains. Through bifurcation analysis and stochastic simulations, we demonstrate that the model can reproduce uniform chromatin states (open, closed, and bivalent) and generate previously unexplored rugged profiles. Our results suggest that enzyme competition and chromatin conformations with high-frequency interactions between distant genomic loci can drive the emergence of rugged epigenetic landscapes. Additionally, we hypothesise that bivalent chromatin can act as an intermediate state, facilitating transitions between uniform and rugged landscapes. This work offers a powerful mathematical framework for understanding the dynamic interactions between chromatin architecture and epigenetic regulation, providing new insights into the formation of complex epigenetic patterns.

Abstract:
Many biological decision-making processes can be viewed as performing a classification task over a set of inputs, using various chemical and physical processes as "biological hardware." In this context, it is important to understand the inherent limitations on the computational expressivity of classification functions instantiated in biophysical media. Here, we model biochemical networks as Markov jump processes and train them to perform classification tasks, allowing us to investigate their computational expressivity. We reveal several unanticipated limitations on the input-output functions of these systems, which we further show can be lifted using biochemical mechanisms like promiscuous binding. We analyze the flexibility and sharpness of decision boundaries as well as the classification capacity of these networks. Additionally, we identify distinctive signatures of networks trained for classification, including the emergence of correlated subsets of spanning trees and a creased "energy landscape" with multiple basins. Our findings have implications for understanding and designing physical computing systems in both biological and synthetic chemical settings.

Abstract:
The in vivo circadian clock in single cyanobacteria is studied here by time-lapse fluorescence microscopy when the temperature is lowered below 25°C . We first disentangle the circadian clock behavior from the bacterial cold shock response by identifying a sequence of "death steps" based on cellular indicators. By analyzing only "alive" tracks, we show that the dynamic response of individual oscillatory tracks to a step-down temperature signal is described by a simple Stuart-Landau oscillator model. The same dynamical analysis applied to in vitro data (KaiC phosphorylation level following a temperature step-down) allows for extracting and comparing both clock's responses to a temperature step down. It appears, therefore, that both oscillators go through a similar supercritical Hopf bifurcation. Finally, to quantitatively describe the temperature dependence of the resulting in vivo and in vitro Stuart-Landau parameters $μ(T)$ and $ω_c(T)$, we propose two simplified analytical models: temperature-dependent positive feedback or time-delayed negative feedback that is temperature compensated. Our results provide strong constraints for future models and emphasize the importance of studying transitory regimes along temperature effects in circadian systems.

Abstract:
Reaction networks have been widely used as generic models in diverse areas of applied science, such as biology, chemistry, ecology, epidemiology, and computer science. Reaction networks incorporating noisy effect are modelled as continuous time Markov chains (CTMC), and are called stochastic reaction systems. Non-explosivity is a concept that characterizes regularity of CTMCs. In this paper, we study non-explosivity of stochastic reaction systems, in the sense of their underlying CTMCs. By constructing a simple linear Lyapunov function, we obtain non-explosivity for a class of endotactic stochastic reaction systems containing second-order endotactic stochastic mass-action systems as a subset. As a consequence, we prove that every bimolecular weakly reversible stochastic mass-action system is non-explosive. We apply our results to diverse models in biochemistry, epidemiology, ecology, and synthetic biology in the literature.

Abstract:
Irreversibility, in which a transient perturbation leaves a system in a new state, is an emergent property in systems of interacting entities. This property has well-established implications in statistical physics but remains underexplored in biological networks, especially for bacteria and other prokaryotes whose regulation of gene expression occurs predominantly at the transcriptional level. Focusing on the reconstructed regulatory network of \emph{Escherichia coli}, we examine network responses to transient single-gene perturbations. We predict irreversibility in numerous cases and find that the incidence of irreversibility increases with the proximity of the perturbed gene to positive circuits in the network. Comparison with experimental data suggests a connection between the predicted irreversibility to transient perturbations and the evolutionary response to permanent perturbations.

Abstract:
Molecular communication (MC) within the synaptic cleft is vital for neurotransmitter diffusion, a process critical to cognitive functions. In Alzheimer's Disease (AD), beta-amyloid oligomers (A$β$os) disrupt this communication, leading to synaptic dysfunction. This paper investigates the molecular interactions between glutamate, a key neurotransmitter, and A$β$os within the synaptic cleft, aiming to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of this disruption. Through stochastic modeling, we simulate the dynamics of A$β$os and their impact on glutamate diffusion. The findings, validated by comparing simulated results with existing experimental data, demonstrate that A$β$os serve as physical obstacles, hindering glutamate movement and increasing collision frequency. This impairment of synaptic transmission and long-term potentiation (LTP) by binding to receptors on the postsynaptic membrane is further validated against known molecular interaction behaviors observed in similar neurodegenerative contexts. The study also explores potential therapeutic strategies to mitigate these disruptions. By enhancing our understanding of these molecular interactions, this research contributes to the development of more effective treatments for AD, with the ultimate goal of alleviating synaptic impairments associated with the disease.

Abstract:
The first passage time (FPT) is a generic measure that quantifies when a random quantity reaches a specific state. We consider the FTP distribution in nonlinear stochastic biochemical networks, where obtaining exact solutions of the distribution is a challenging problem. Even simple two-particle collisions cause strong nonlinearities that hinder the theoretical determination of the full FPT distribution. Previous research has either focused on analyzing the mean FPT, which provides limited information about a system, or has considered time-consuming stochastic simulations that do not clearly expose causal relationships between parameters and the system's dynamics. This paper presents the first exact theoretical solution of the full FPT distribution in a broad class of chemical reaction networks involving $A + B \rightarrow C$ type of second-order reactions. Our exact theoretical method outperforms stochastic simulations, in terms of computational efficiency, and deviates from approximate analytical solutions. Given the prevalence of bimolecular reactions in biochemical systems, our approach has the potential to enhance the understanding of real-world biochemical processes.

Abstract:
Numerous biological processes accelerate as temperatures increase, but the period of circadian rhythms remains constant, known as temperature compensation, while synchronizing with the 24h light-dark cycle. We theoretically explores the possible relevance of waveform distortions in circadian gene-protein dynamics to the temperature compensation and synchronization. Our analysis of the Goodwin model provides a coherent explanation of most of temperature compensation hypotheses. Using the renormalization group method, we analytically demonstrate that the decreasing phase of circadian protein oscillations should lengthen with increasing temperature, leading to waveform distortions to maintain a stable period. This waveform-period correlation also occurs in other oscillators like Lotka-Volterra and van der Pol models. A reanalysis of known data nicely confirms our findings on waveform distortion and its impact on synchronization range. Thus we conclude that circadian rhythm waveforms are fundamental to both temperature compensation and synchronization.

Abstract:
The ability to quantify the directional flow of information is vital to understanding natural systems and designing engineered information-processing systems. A widely used measure to quantify this information flow is the transfer entropy. However, until now, this quantity could only be obtained in dynamical models using approximations that are typically uncontrolled. Here we introduce a computational algorithm called Transfer Entropy-Path Weight Sampling (TE-PWS), which makes it possible, for the first time, to quantify the transfer entropy and its variants exactly for any stochastic model, including those with multiple hidden variables, nonlinearity, transient conditions, and feedback. By leveraging techniques from polymer and path sampling, TE-PWS efficiently computes the transfer entropy as a Monte-Carlo average over signal trajectory space. We use our exact technique to demonstrate that commonly used approximate methods to compute transfer entropies incur large systematic errors and high computational costs. As an application, we use TE-PWS in linear and nonlinear systems to reveal how transfer entropy can overcome naive applications of the data processing inequality in the presence of feedback.

Abstract:
The formation, dissolution, and dynamics of multi-particle complexes is of fundamental interest in the study of stochastic chemical systems. In 1976, Masao Doi introduced a Fock space formalism for modeling classical particles. Doi's formalism, however, does not support the assembly of multiple particles into complexes. Starting in the 2000's, multiple groups developed rule-based methods for computationally simulating biochemical systems involving large macromolecular complexes. However, these methods are based on graph-rewriting rules and/or process algebras that are mathematically disconnected from the statistical physics methods generally used to analyze equilibrium and nonequilibrium systems. Here we bridge these two approaches by introducing an operator algebra for the rule-based modeling of multi-particle complexes. Our formalism is based on a Fock space that supports not only the creation and annihilation of classical particles, but also the assembly of multiple particles into complexes, as well as the disassembly of complexes into their components. Rules are specified by algebraic operators that act on particles through a manifestation of Wick's theorem. We further describe diagrammatic methods that facilitate rule specification and analytic calculations. We demonstrate our formalism on systems in and out of thermal equilibrium, and for nonequilibrium systems we present a stochastic simulation algorithm based on our formalism. The results provide a unified approach to the mathematical and computational study of stochastic chemical systems in which multi-particle complexes play an important role.

Abstract:
Recent studies suggest that drug-drug interaction (DDI) prediction via computational approaches has significant importance for understanding the functions and co-prescriptions of multiple drugs. However, the existing silico DDI prediction methods either ignore the potential interactions among drug-drug pairs (DDPs), or fail to explicitly model and fuse the multi-scale drug feature representations for better prediction. In this study, we propose RGDA-DDI, a residual graph attention network (residual-GAT) and dual-attention based framework for drug-drug interaction prediction. A residual-GAT module is introduced to simultaneously learn multi-scale feature representations from drugs and DDPs. In addition, a dual-attention based feature fusion block is constructed to learn local joint interaction representations. A series of evaluation metrics demonstrate that the RGDA-DDI significantly improved DDI prediction performance on two public benchmark datasets, which provides a new insight into drug development.

Abstract:
Living cells inherently exhibit the ability to spontaneously reorganize their structures in response to changes in both their internal and external environments. Among these responses, the organization of stress fibers composed of actin molecules changes in direct accordance with the mechanical stiffness of their environments. On soft substrates, SFs are rarely formed, but as stiffness increases, they emerge with random orientation, progressively align, and eventually form thicker bundles as stiffness surpasses successive thresholds. These transformations share similarities with phase transitions studied in condensed matter physics, yet despite extensive research on cellular dynamics, the introduction of the statistical mechanics perspective to the environmental dependence of intracellular structures remains underexplored. With this physical framework, we identify key relationships governing these intracellular transitions, highlighting the delicate balance between energy and entropy. Our analysis provides a unified understanding of the stepwise phase transitions of actin structures, offering new insights into related biological mechanisms. Notably, our study suggests the existence of mechanical checkpoints in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, which sequentially regulate the formation of intracellular structures to ensure proper cell cycle progression.

Abstract:
Fluctuations are inherent to biological systems, arising from the stochastic nature of molecular interactions, and influence various aspects of system behavior, stability, and robustness. These fluctuations can be categorized as intrinsic, stemming from the system's inherent structure and dynamics, and extrinsic, arising from external factors, such as temperature variations. Understanding the interplay between these fluctuations is crucial for obtaining a comprehensive understanding of biological phenomena. However, studying these effects poses significant computational challenges. In this study, we used an underexplored methodology to analyze the effect of extrinsic fluctuations in stochastic systems using ordinary differential equations instead of solving the Master Equation with stochastic parameters. By incorporating temperature fluctuations into reaction rates, we explored the impact of extrinsic factors on system dynamics. We constructed a master equation and calculated the equations for the dynamics of the first two moments, offering computational efficiency compared with directly solving the chemical master equation. We applied this approach to analyze a biological oscillator, focusing on the p53 model and its response to temperature-induced extrinsic fluctuations. Our findings underscore the impact of extrinsic fluctuations on the nature of oscillations in biological systems, with alterations in oscillatory behavior depending on the characteristics of extrinsic fluctuations. We observed an increased oscillation amplitude and frequency of the p53 concentration cycle. This study provides valuable insights into the effects of extrinsic fluctuations on biological oscillations and highlights the importance of considering them in more complex systems to prevent unwanted scenarios related to health issues.

Abstract:
We apply logic-based machine learning techniques to facilitate cellular engineering and drive biological discovery, based on comprehensive databases of metabolic processes called genome-scale metabolic network models (GEMs). Predicted host behaviours are not always correctly described by GEMs. Learning the intricate genetic interactions within GEMs presents computational and empirical challenges. To address these, we describe a novel approach called Boolean Matrix Logic Programming (BMLP) by leveraging boolean matrices to evaluate large logic programs. We introduce a new system, $BMLP_{active}$, which efficiently explores the genomic hypothesis space by guiding informative experimentation through active learning. In contrast to sub-symbolic methods, $BMLP_{active}$ encodes a state-of-the-art GEM of a widely accepted bacterial host in an interpretable and logical representation using datalog logic programs. Notably, $BMLP_{active}$ can successfully learn the interaction between a gene pair with fewer training examples than random experimentation, overcoming the increase in experimental design space. $BMLP_{active}$ enables rapid optimisation of metabolic models and offers a realistic approach to a self-driving lab for microbial engineering.

Abstract:
Models of reaction networks within interacting compartments (RNIC) are a generalization of stochastic reaction networks. It is most natural to think of the interacting compartments as "cells" that can appear, degrade, split, and even merge, with each cell containing an evolving copy of the underlying stochastic reaction network. Such models have a number of parameters, including those associated with the internal chemical model and those associated with the compartment interactions, and it is natural to want efficient computational methods for the numerical estimation of sensitivities of model statistics with respect to these parameters. Motivated by the extensive work on computational methods for parametric sensitivity analysis in the context of stochastic reaction networks over the past few decades, we provide a number of methods in the basic RNIC setting. Provided methods include the (unbiased) Girsanov transformation method (also called the Likelihood Ratio method) and a number of coupling methods for the implementation of finite differences, each motivated by methods from previous work related to stochastic reaction networks. We provide several numerical examples comparing the various methods in the new setting. We find that the relative performance of each method is in line with its analog in the "standard" stochastic reaction network setting. We have made all of the Matlab code used to implement the various methods freely available for download.

Abstract:
The biological targets of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) are the core effectors mediating the interaction between TCM and the human body. Identification of TCM targets is essential to elucidate the chemical basis and mechanisms of TCM for treating diseases. Given the chemical complexity of TCM, both in silico high-throughput drug-target interaction predicting models and biological profile-based methods have been commonly applied for identifying TCM targets based on the structural information of TCM chemical components and biological information, respectively. However, the existing methods lack the integration of TCM chemical and biological information, resulting in difficulty in the systematic discovery of TCM action pathways. To solve this problem, we propose a novel target identification model NP-TCMtarget to explore the TCM target path by combining the overall chemical and biological profiles. First, NP-TCMtarget infers TCM effect targets by calculating associations between drug/disease inducible gene expression profiles and specific gene signatures for 8,233 targets. Then, NP-TCMtarget utilizes a constructed binary classification model to predict binding targets of herbal ingredients. Finally, we can distinguish TCM direct and indirect targets by comparing the effect targets and binding targets to establish the action pathways of herbal components-direct targets-indirect targets by mapping TCM targets in the biological molecular network. We apply NP-TCMtarget to the formula XiaoKeAn to demonstrate the power of revealing the action pathways of herbal formula. We expect that this novel model could provide a systematic framework for exploring the molecular mechanisms of TCM at the target level.

Abstract:
The description of gene interactions that constantly occur in the cellular environment is an extremely challenging task due to an immense number of degrees of freedom and incomplete knowledge about microscopic details. Hence, a coarse-grained and rather powerful modeling of such dynamics is provided by Boolean Networks (BNs). BNs are dynamical systems composed of Boolean agents and a record of their possible interactions over time. Stable states in these systems are called attractors which are closely related to the cellular expression of biological phenotypes. Identifying the full set of attractors is, therefore, of substantial biological interest. However, for conventional high-performance computing, this problem is plagued by an exponential growth of the dynamic state space. Here, we demonstrate a novel quantum search algorithm inspired by Grover's algorithm to be implemented on quantum computing platforms. The algorithm performs an iterative suppression of states belonging to basins of previously discovered attractors from a uniform superposition, thus increasing the amplitudes of states in basins of yet unknown attractors. This approach guarantees that a new attractor state is measured with each iteration of the algorithm, an optimization not currently achieved by any other algorithm in the literature. Tests of its resistance to noise have also shown promising performance on devices from the current Noise Intermediate Scale Quantum Computing (NISQ) era.

Abstract:
Gene expression prediction plays a vital role in transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS), which seek to establish associations between tissue gene expression and complex traits. Traditional models rely on genetic variants in close genomic proximity to the gene of interest to predict the genetic component of gene expression. In this study, we propose a novel approach incorporating distal genetic variants acting through gene regulatory networks (GRNs) into gene expression prediction models, in line with the omnigenic model of complex trait inheritance. Using causal and coexpression GRNs reconstructed from genomic and transcriptomic data and modeling the data as a Bayesian network jointly over genetic variants and genes, inference of gene expression from observed genotypic data is achieved through a two-step process. Initially, the expression level of each gene in the network is predicted using its local genetic variants. The residuals, calculated as the differences between the observed and predicted expression levels, are then modeled using the genotype information of parent and/or grandparent nodes in the GRN. The final predicted expression level of the gene is obtained by summing the predictions from the local variants model and the residual model, effectively incorporating both local and distal genetic influences. Using various regularized regression techniques for parameter estimation, we found that GRN-based gene expression prediction outperformed the traditional local-variant approach on simulated data from the DREAM5 Systems Genetics Challenge and real data from the Geuvadis study and an eQTL mapping study in yeast. This study provides important insights into the challenge of gene expression prediction for TWAS. It reaffirms the importance of GRNs for understanding the genetic effects on gene expression and complex traits more generally.

Abstract:
Research organisms provide invaluable insights into human biology and diseases, serving as essential tools for functional experiments, disease modeling, and drug testing. However, evolutionary divergence between humans and research organisms hinders effective knowledge transfer across species. Here, we review state-of-the-art methods for computationally transferring knowledge across species, primarily focusing on methods that utilize transcriptome data and/or molecular networks. Our review addresses four key areas: (1) transferring disease and gene annotation knowledge across species, (2) identifying functionally equivalent molecular components, (3) inferring equivalent perturbed genes or gene sets, and (4) identifying equivalent cell types. We conclude with an outlook on future directions and several key challenges that remain in cross-species knowledge transfer, including introducing the concept of "agnology" to describe functional equivalence of biological entities, regardless of their evolutionary origins. This concept is becoming pervasive in integrative data-driven models where evolutionary origins of functions can remain unresolved.

Abstract:
New experimental methods make it possible to measure the expression levels of many genes, simultaneously, in snapshots from thousands or even millions of individual cells. Current approaches to analyze these experiments involve clustering or low-dimensional projections. Here we use the principle of maximum entropy to obtain a probabilistic description that captures the observed presence or absence of mRNAs from hundreds of genes in cells from the mammalian brain. We construct the Ising model compatible with experimental means and pairwise correlations, and validate it by showing that it gives good predictions for higher-order statistics. We notice that the probability distribution of cell states has many local maxima. By labeling cell states according to the associated maximum, we obtain a cell classification that agrees well with previous results that use traditional clustering techniques. Our results provide quantitative descriptions of gene expression statistics and interpretable criteria for defining cell classes, supporting the hypothesis that cell classes emerge from the collective interaction of gene expression levels.

Abstract:
Elucidating gene function is one of the ultimate goals of plant science. Despite this, only ~15% of all genes in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana have comprehensively experimentally verified functions. While bioinformatical gene function prediction approaches can guide biologists in their experimental efforts, neither the performance of the gene function prediction methods nor the number of experimental characterisation of genes has increased dramatically in recent years. In this review, we will discuss the status quo and the trajectory of gene function elucidation and outline the recent advances in gene function prediction approaches. We will then discuss how recent artificial intelligence advances in large language models and knowledge graphs can be leveraged to accelerate gene function predictions and keep us updated with scientific literature.

Abstract:
We prove that nested canalizing functions are the minimum-sensitivity Boolean functions for any activity ratio and we determine the functional form of this boundary which has a nontrivial fractal structure. We further observe that the majority of the gene regulatory functions found in known biological networks (submitted to the Cell Collective database) lie on the line of minimum sensitivity which paradoxically remains largely in the unstable regime. Our results provide a quantitative basis for the argument that an evolutionary preference for nested canalizing functions in gene regulation (e.g., for higher robustness) and for elasticity of gene activity are sufficient for concentration of such systems near the "edge of chaos." The original structure of gene regulatory networks is unknown due to the undiscovered functions of some genes. Most gene function discovery approaches make use of unsupervised clustering or classification methods that discover and exploit patterns in gene expression profiles. However, existing knowledge in the field derives from multiple and diverse sources. Incorporating this know-how for novel gene function prediction can, therefore, be expected to improve such predictions. We here propose a function-specific novel gene discovery tool that uses a semi-supervised autoencoder. Our method is thus able to address the needs of a modern researcher whose expertise is typically confined to a specific functional domain. Lastly, the dynamics of unorthodox learning approaches like biologically plausible learning algorithms are investigated and found to exhibit a general form of Einstein relation.

Abstract:
Understanding the mechanisms of interactions within cells, tissues, and organisms is crucial to driving developments across biology and medicine. Mathematical modeling is an essential tool for simulating biological systems and revealing biochemical regulatory mechanisms. Building on experiments, mechanistic models are widely used to describe small-scale intracellular networks and uncover biochemical mechanisms in healthy and diseased states. The rapid development of high-throughput sequencing techniques and computational tools has recently enabled models that span multiple scales, often integrating signaling, gene regulatory, and metabolic networks. These multiscale models enable comprehensive investigations of cellular networks and thus reveal previously unknown disease mechanisms and pharmacological interventions. Here, we review systems biology models from classical mechanistic models to larger, multiscale models that integrate multiple layers of cellular networks. We introduce several examples of models of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, exercise, and cancer cell proliferation. Additionally, we discuss methods that increase the certainty and accuracy of model predictions. Integrating multiscale models has become a powerful tool for understanding disease and inspiring drug discoveries by incorporating omics data within the cell and across tissues and organisms.

Abstract:
Stress generation by the actin cytoskeleton shapes cells and tissues. Despite impressive progress in live imaging and quantitative physical descriptions of cytoskeletal network dynamics, the connection between processes at molecular scales and cell-scale spatio-temporal patterns is still unclear. Here we review studies reporting acto-myosin clusters of micrometer size and with lifetimes of several minutes in a large number of organisms ranging from fission yeast to humans. Such structures have also been found in reconstituted systems in vitro and in theoretical analysis of cytoskeletal dynamics. We propose that tracking these clusters can serve as a simple readout for characterising living matter. Spatio-temporal patterns of clusters could serve as determinants of morphogenetic processes that play similar roles in diverse organisms.

As a case study, we present a comprehensive analysis of regulatory motifs in the connectome of the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). Leveraging the Efficient Subgraph Counting Algorithmic PackagE (ESCAPE) algorithm, we identify network motifs in the multi-layer nervous system of C. elegans and link them to functional circuits. We further investigate motif enrichment within signal pathways and benchmark our findings with random networks of similar size and link density. Our findings provide valuable insights into the organization of the nerve net of this well documented organism and can be easily transferred to other species and disciplines alike.

Abstract:
Bacterial second messengers are crucial for transmitting environmental information to cellular responses. However, quantifying their information transmission capacity remains challenging. Here, we engineer an isolated cAMP signaling channel in Pseudomonas aeruginosa using targeted gene knockouts, optogenetics, and a fluorescent cAMP probe. This design allows precise optical control and real-time monitoring of cAMP dynamics. By integrating experimental data with information theory, we reveal an optimal frequency for light-mediated cAMP signaling that maximizes information transmission, reaching about 40 bits/h. This rate correlates strongly with cAMP degradation kinetics and employs a two-state encoding scheme. Our findings suggest a mechanism for fine-tuned regulation of multiple genes through temporal encoding of second messenger signals, providing new insights into bacterial adaptation strategies. This approach offers a framework for quantifying information processing in cellular signaling systems.

Abstract:
Notch signaling is a ubiquitous and versatile intercellular signaling system that drives collective behaviors and pattern formation in biological tissues. During embryonic development, Notch is involved in generation of collective biochemical oscillations that form the vertebrate body segments, and its failure results in embryonic defects. Notch ligands of the Delta family are key components of this collective rhythm, but it is unclear how different Delta ligands with distinct properties contribute to relaying information among cells. Motivated by the zebrafish segmentation clock, in this work we propose a theory describing interactions between biochemical oscillators, where Notch receptor is bound by both oscillatory and nonoscillatory Delta ligands. Based on previous in vitro binding studies, we first consider Notch activation by Delta dimers. This hypothesis is consistent with experimental observations in conditions of perturbed Notch signaling. Then we test an alternative hypothesis where Delta monomers directly bind and activate Notch, and show that this second model can also describe the experimental observations. We show that these two hypotheses assign different roles for a non-oscillatory ligand, as a binding partner or as a baseline signal. Finally, we discuss experiments to distinguish between the two scenarios. Broadly, this work highlights how a multiplicity of ligands may be harnessed by a signaling system to generate versatile responses.

Abstract:
Markov chains on the non-negative quadrant of dimension $d$ are often used to model the stochastic dynamics of the number of $d$ entities, such as $d$ chemical species in stochastic reaction networks. The infinite state space poses technical challenges, and the boundary of the quadrant can have a dramatic effect on the long term behavior of these Markov chains. For instance, the boundary can slow down the convergence speed of an ergodic Markov chain towards its stationary distribution due to the extinction or the lack of an entity. In this paper, we quantify this slow-down for a class of stochastic reaction networks and for more general Markov chains on the non-negative quadrant. We establish general criteria for such a Markov chain to exhibit a power-law lower bound for its mixing time. The lower bound is of order $|x|^θ$ for all initial state $x$ on a boundary face of the quadrant, where $θ$ is characterized by the local behavior of the Markov chain near the boundary of the quadrant. A better understanding of how these lower bounds arise leads to insights into how the structure of chemical reaction networks contributes to slow-mixing.

Abstract:
Living systems are usually maintained out of equilibrium and consume energy to sustain emergent organized states. Their robust functioning rely on a set of interconnected chemical reaction networks (CRN) in which the external energy supply often comes from fluxes that can keep some species concentrations constant. Hence, to capture the emergent complexity of living systems and the role of their non-equilibrium nature, it is fundamental to uncover constraints and properties of the CRNs underpinning their functions. In particular, while kinetics plays a key role in shaping detailed dynamical phenomena, the range of operations of these underlying CRNs is fundamentally constrained by thermodynamics. Here, we derive universal thermodynamic upper and lower bounds for species concentrations in a generic CRN operating within a given energy budget. The resulting region determines the thermodynamic space of the CRN, a concept we introduce in this work that determines the range of accessible concentrations for the chemical species involved at a given value of non-equilibrium driving. We obtain similar bounds for the affinities, shedding light on how global thermodynamic properties, such as the total dissipation, can limit local non-equilibrium quantities. We illustrate our results in various paradigmatic examples, the Schlogl model for bistability, a minimal self-assembly process, a paradigmatic system exhibiting chiral symmetry breaking, and a multi-molecular model for reaction-diffusion patterns, demonstrating how the onset of complex behaviors is intimately tangled with the presence of non-equilibrium conditions. By providing a general tool for analyzing CRNs, the presented framework constitutes a stepping stone to deepen our ability to predict complex out-of-equilibrium phenomena and design artificial chemical systems, starting from the sole knowledge of the underlying thermodynamic properties.

Abstract:
Homeostasis occurs in a biological system when a chosen output variable remains approximately constant despite changes in an input variable. In this work we specifically focus on biological systems which may be represented as chemical reaction networks and consider their infinitesimal homeostasis, where the derivative of the input-output function is zero. The specific challenge of chemical reaction networks is that they often obey various conservation laws complicating the standard input-output analysis. We derive several results that allow to verify the existence of infinitesimal homeostasis points both in the absence of conservation and under conservation laws where conserved quantities serve as input parameters. In particular, we introduce the notion of infinitesimal concentration robustness, where the output variable remains nearly constant despite fluctuations in the conserved quantities. We provide several examples of chemical networks which illustrate our results both in deterministic and stochastic settings.
