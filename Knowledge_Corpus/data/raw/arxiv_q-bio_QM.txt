Abstract:
Study Objectives: Wrist accelerometry is widely used for inferring sleep-wake state. Previous works demonstrated poor wake detection, without cross-device generalizability and validation in different age range and sleep disorders. We developed a robust deep learning model for to detect sleep-wakefulness from triaxial accelerometry and evaluated its validity across three devices and in a large adult population spanning a wide range of ages with and without sleep disorders. Methods: We collected wrist accelerometry simultaneous to polysomnography (PSG) in 453 adults undergoing clinical sleep testing at a tertiary care sleep laboratory, using three devices. We extracted features in 30-second epochs and trained a 3-class model to detect wake, sleep, and sleep with arousals, which was then collapsed into wake vs. sleep using a decision tree. To enhance wake detection, the model was specifically trained on randomly selected subjects with low sleep efficiency and/or high arousal index from one device recording and then tested on the remaining recordings. Results: The model showed high performance with F1 Score of 0.86, sensitivity (sleep) of 0.87, and specificity (wakefulness) of 0.78, and significant and moderate correlation to PSG in predicting total sleep time (R=0.69) and sleep efficiency (R=0.63). Model performance was robust to the presence of sleep disorders, including sleep apnea and periodic limb movements in sleep, and was consistent across all three models of accelerometer. Conclusions: We present a deep model to detect sleep-wakefulness from actigraphy in adults with relative robustness to the presence of sleep disorders and generalizability across diverse commonly used wrist accelerometers.

Abstract:
Tracking cells in time-lapse videos is an essential technique for monitoring cell population dynamics at a single-cell level. Current methods for cell tracking are developed on videos with mostly single, constant signals and do not detect pivotal events such as cell death. Here, we present TransientTrack, a deep learning-based framework for cell tracking in multi-channel microscopy video data with transient fluorescent signals that fluctuate over time following processes such as the circadian rhythm of cells. By identifying key cellular events - mitosis (cell division) and apoptosis (cell death) our method allows us to build complete trajectories, including cell lineage information. TransientTrack is lightweight and performs matching on cell detection embeddings directly, without the need for quantification of tracking-specific cell features. Furthermore, our approach integrates Transformer Networks, multi-stage matching using all detection boxes, and the interpolation of missing tracklets with the Kalman Filter. This unified framework achieves strong performance across diverse conditions, effectively tracking cells and capturing cell division and death. We demonstrate the use of TransientTrack in an analysis of the efficacy of a chemotherapeutic drug at a single-cell level. The proposed framework could further advance quantitative studies of cancer cell dynamics, enabling detailed characterization of treatment response and resistance mechanisms. The code is available at https://github.com/bozeklab/TransientTrack.

Abstract:
Controlling spatial patterns in synthetic biological systems remains challenging due to poor parameter robustness and limited experimental tunability. We introduce two complementary mechanisms-the pattern switch and the pattern dial-to systematically control Turing pattern formation in gene circuits. The switch toggles pattern onset via a single parameter, while the dial enables transitions between distinct pattern types using weakly nonlinear amplitude equations. Analyzing network size reveals a key trade-off: small networks are easier to control but less robust, while larger networks gain robustness at the cost of tunability-suggesting a sweet spot for both evolvability and designability. Our results offer practical design rules for engineering programmable patterns in living systems.

Abstract:
Natural systems are remarkably robust and resilient, maintaining essential functions despite variability, uncertainty, and hostile conditions. Understanding these nonlinear, dynamic behaviours is challenging because such systems involve many interacting parameters, yet it is crucial for explaining processes from cellular regulation to disease onset and epidemic spreading. Robustness and resilience describe a system's ability to preserve and recover desired behaviours in the presence of intrinsic and extrinsic fluctuations. This survey reviews how different disciplines define these concepts, examines methods for assessing whether key properties of uncertain, networked dynamical systems are structural (parameter-free) or robust (preserved for parameter variations within an uncertainty bounding set), and discusses integrated structural and probabilistic techniques for biological and epidemiological models. The text introduces formal definitions of resilience for families of systems obtained by adding stochastic perturbations to a nominal deterministic model, enabling a probabilistic characterisation of the ability to remain within or return to a prescribed attractor. These definitions generalise probabilistic robustness and shed new light on classical biological examples. In addition, the survey summarises resilience indicators and data-driven tools for detecting resilience loss and regime shifts, drawing on bifurcation analysis to anticipate qualitative changes in system behaviour. Together, these methodologies support the study and control of complex natural systems, guiding the design of biomolecular feedback architectures, the identification of therapeutic targets, the forecasting and management of epidemics, and the detection of tipping points in ecological and biological networks.

Abstract:
High-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) dosing in children remains largely empirical, relying on one-size-fits-all protocols despite rapid developmental changes in head anatomy and tissue properties that strongly modulate how currents reach the developing brain. Using 70 pediatric head models and commonly used cortical targets, our forward simulations find that standard montages produce marked age-dependent reductions in target electric-field intensity and systematic sex differences linked to tissue-volume covariation, underscoring the profound limitations of conventional uniform montages. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a developmentally informed, dual-objective optimization framework designed to generate personalized Pareto fronts summarizing the trade-off between electric-field intensity and focality. From these optimized solutions, we derive two practical dosing prescriptions: a dose-consistency strategy that, for the first time, enforces fixed target intensity across individuals to implicitly mitigate demographic effects, and a target-engagement strategy that maximizes target intensity under safety limits. Both strategies remain robust to large conductivity variations, and we further show that dense HD-tDCS solutions admit sparse equivalents without performance loss under the target-engagement strategy. We also find that tissue conductivity sensitivity is depth-dependent, with Pareto-front distributions for superficial cortical targets most influenced by gray matter, scalp, and bone conductivities, and those for a deep target predominantly shaped by gray and white matter conductivities. Together, these results establish a principled framework for pediatric HD-tDCS planning that explicitly accounts for developmental anatomy and physiological uncertainty, enabling reliable and individualized neuromodulation dosing in pediatric populations.

Abstract:
Accurate and reliable forecasting models are critical for guiding public health responses and policy decisions during pandemics such as COVID-19. Retrospective evaluation of model performance is essential for improving epidemic forecasting capabilities. In this study, we used COVID-19 wastewater data from CDC's National Wastewater Surveillance System to generate sequential weekly retrospective forecasts for the United States from March 2022 through September 2024, both at the national level and for four major regions (Northeast, Midwest, South, and West). We produced 133 weekly forecasts using 11 models, including ARIMA, generalized additive models (GAM), simple linear regression (SLR), Prophet, and the n-sub-epidemic framework (top-ranked, weighted-ensemble, and unweighted-ensemble variants). Forecast performance was assessed using mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), weighted interval score (WIS), and 95% prediction interval coverage. The n-sub-epidemic unweighted ensembles outperformed all other models at 3-4-week horizons, particularly at the national level and in the Midwest and West. ARIMA and GAM performed best at 1-2-week horizons in most regions, whereas Prophet and SLR consistently underperformed across regions and horizons. These findings highlight the value of region-specific modeling strategies and demonstrate the utility of the n-sub-epidemic framework for real-time outbreak forecasting using wastewater surveillance data.

Abstract:
This study presents an unsupervised method to infer discreteness, syntax and temporal structures of fruit-bats vocalizations, as a case study of graded vocal systems, and evaluates the complexity of communication patterns in relation with behavioral context. The method improved the baseline for unsupervised labeling of vocal units (i.e. syllables) through manifold learning, by investigating how dimen- sionality reduction on mel-spectrograms affects labeling, and comparing it with unsupervised labels based on acoustic similarity. We then encoded vocalizations as syllabic sequences to analyze the type of syntax, and extracted the Maximal Repetitions (MRs) to evaluate syntactical structures. We found evidence for: i) associative syntax, rather than combinatorial (context classification is unaffected by permutation of sequences, F 1 > 0.9); ii) context-dependent use of syllables (Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, p-value < 0.05); iii) heavy-tail distribution of MRs (truncated power-law, exponent α < 2), indicative of mechanism encoding com- binatorial complexity. Analysis of MRs and syllabic transition networks revealed that mother-pupil interactions were characterized by repetitions, while commu- nication in conflict-contexts exhibited higher complexity (longer MRs and more interconnected vocal sequences) than non-agonistic contexts. We propose that communicative complexity is higher in scenarios of disagreement, reflecting lower compressibility of information.

Abstract:
Objectives: We present and evaluate a Mamba-based deep-learning model for diagnosis and event-level characterization of sleep disordered breathing based on signals from the ANNE One, a non-intrusive dual-module wireless wearable system measuring chest electrocardiography, triaxial accelerometry, chest and finger temperature, and finger phototplethysmography.   Methods: We obtained concurrent PSG and wearable sensor recordings from 384 adults attending a tertiary care sleep laboratory. Respiratory events in the PSG were manually annotated in accordance with AASM guidelines. Wearable sensor and PSG recordings were automatically aligned based on the ECG signal, alignment confirmed by visual inspection, and PSG-derived respiratory event labels were used to train and evaluate a deep sequential neural network based on the Mamba architecture.   Results: In 57 recordings in our test set (mean age 56, mean AHI 10.8, 43.86\% female) the model-predicted AHI was highly correlated with that derived form the PSG labels (R=0.95, p=8.3e-30, men absolute error 2.83). This performance did not vary with age or sex. At a threshold of AHI$>$5, the model had a sensitivity of 0.96, specificity of 0.87, and kappa of 0.82, and at a threshold of AHI$>$15, the model had a sensitivity of 0.86, specificity of 0.98, and kappa of 0.85. At the level of 30-sec epochs, the model had a sensitivity of 0.93 and specificity of 0.95, with a kappa of 0.68 regarding whether any given epoch contained a respiratory event.   Conclusions: Applied to data from the ANNE One, a Mamba-based deep learning model can accurately predict AHI and identify SDB at clinically relevant thresholds, achieves good epoch- and event-level identification of individual respiratory events, and shows promise at physiological characterization of these events including event type (central vs. other) and event duration.

Abstract:
The use of coarse demographic adjustments in clinical equations has been increasingly scrutinized. In particular, adjustments for race have sparked significant debate with several medical professional societies recommending race-neutral equations in recent years. However, current approaches to remove race from clinical equations do not address the underlying causes of observed differences. Here, we present ARC (Approach for identifying pRoxies of demographic Correction), a framework to identify explanatory factors of group-level differences, which may inform the development of more accurate and precise clinical equations. We apply ARC to spirometry tests across two observational cohorts, CDC NHANES and UK Biobank, comprising 159,893 participants. Cross-sectional sociodemographic or exposure measures did not explain differences in reference lung function across race groups beyond those already explained by age, sex, and height. By contrast, sitting height accounted for up to 26% of the remaining differences in lung volumes between healthy Black and White adults. We then demonstrate how pulmonary function test (PFT) reference equations can incorporate these factors in a new set of equations called $ARC_{PFT}$, surpassing the predictive performance of the race-neutral GLI-Global equation recommended by major pulmonary societies. When compared to GLI-Global, inclusion of sitting height and waist circumference in $ARC_{PFT}$ decreased mean absolute error by 13% among Black participants in the UK Biobank and by 24% in NHANES. $ARC_{PFT}$ also had reduced vulnerability to domain shift compared to race-based methods, with mean absolute error 19.3% and 35.6% lower than race-stratified models in out-of-sample Asian and Hispanic populations, respectively. This approach provides a path for understanding the proxies of imprecise demographic adjustments and developing personalized clinical equations.

Abstract:
This work presents the development and evaluation of an NLP-enabled probabilistic classifier designed to estimate the probability of technical and regulatory success (pTRS) for clinical trials in the field of neuroscience. While pharmaceutical R&D is plagued by high attrition rates and enormous costs, particularly within neuroscience, where success rates are below 10%, timely identification of promising programs can streamline resource allocation and reduce financial risk. Leveraging data from the ClinicalTrials.gov database and success labels from the recently developed Clinical Trial Outcome dataset, the classifier extracts text-based clinical trial features using statistical NLP techniques. These features were integrated into several non-LLM frameworks (logistic regression, gradient boosting, and random forest) to generate calibrated probability scores. Model performance was assessed on a retrospective dataset of 101,145 completed clinical trials spanning 1976-2024, achieving an overall ROC-AUC of 0.64. An LLM-based predictive model was then built using BioBERT, a domain-specific language representation encoder. The BioBERT-based model achieved an overall ROC-AUC of 0.74 and a Brier Score of 0.185, indicating its predictions had, on average, 40% less squared error than would be observed using industry benchmarks. The BioBERT-based model also made trial outcome predictions that were superior to benchmark values 70% of the time overall. By integrating NLP-driven insights into drug development decision-making, this work aims to enhance strategic planning and optimize investment allocation in neuroscience programs.

Abstract:
Cells within biological tissue are constantly subjected to dynamic mechanical forces. Measuring the internal stress of tissues has proven crucial for our understanding of the role of mechanical forces in fundamental biological processes like morphogenesis, collective migration, cell division or cell elimination and death. Previously, we have introduced Bayesian Inversion Stress Microscopy (BISM), which is relying on measuring cell-generated traction forces in vitro and has proven particularly useful to measure absolute stresses in confined cell monolayers. We further demonstrate the applicability and robustness of BISM across various experimental settings with different boundary conditions, ranging from confined tissues of arbitrary shape to monolayers composed of different cell types. Importantly, BISM does not require assumptions on cell rheology. Therefore, it can be applied to complex heterogeneous tissues consisting of different cell types, as long as they can be grown on a flat substrate. Finally, we compare BISM to other common stress measurement techniques using a coherent experimental setup, followed by a discussion on its limitations and further perspectives.

Abstract:
In early stage drug discovery, bioactivity prediction of molecules against target proteins plays a crucial role. Trdaitional QSAR models that utilizes molecular descriptor based data often struggles to predict bioactivity of molecules effectively due to its limitation in capturing structural and contextual information embedded within each compound. To address this challenge, we propose Rep3Net, a unified deep learning architecture that not only incorporates descriptor data but also includes spatial and relational information through graph-based represenation of compounds and contextual information through ChemBERTa generated embeddings from SMILES strings. Our model employing multimodal concatenated features produce reliable bioactivity prediction on Poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 1 (PARP-1) dataset. PARP-1 is a crucial agent in DNA damage repair and has become a significant theraputic target in malignancies that depend on it for survival and growth. A comprehensive analysis and comparison with conventional standalone models including GCN, GAT, XGBoost, etc. demonstrates that our architecture achieves the highest predictive performance. In computational screening of compounds in drug discovery, our architecture provides a scalable framework for bioactivity prediction.

Abstract:
Protein language models (PLMs) have transformed sequence-based protein analysis, yet most applications rely only on final-layer embeddings, which may overlook biologically meaningful information encoded in earlier layers. We systematically evaluate all 33 layers of ESM-2 for kinase functional prediction using both unsupervised clustering and supervised classification. We show that mid-to-late transformer layers (layers 20-33) outperform the final layer by 32 percent in unsupervised Adjusted Rand Index and improve homology-aware supervised accuracy to 75.7 percent. Domain-level extraction, calibrated probability estimates, and a reproducible benchmarking pipeline further strengthen reliability. Our results demonstrate that transformer depth contains functionally distinct biological signals and that principled layer selection significantly improves kinase function prediction.

Abstract:
Foundation models have revolutionized various fields such as natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV). While efforts have been made to transfer the success of the foundation models in general AI domains to biology, existing works focus on directly adopting the existing foundation model architectures from general machine learning domains without a systematic design considering the unique physicochemical and structural properties of each biological data modality. This leads to suboptimal performance, as these repurposed architectures struggle to capture the long-range dependencies, sparse information, and complex underlying ``grammars'' inherent to biological data. To address this gap, we introduce BioArc, a novel framework designed to move beyond intuition-driven architecture design towards principled, automated architecture discovery for biological foundation models. Leveraging Neural Architecture Search (NAS), BioArc systematically explores a vast architecture design space, evaluating architectures across multiple biological modalities while rigorously analyzing the interplay between architecture, tokenization, and training strategies. This large-scale analysis identifies novel, high-performance architectures, allowing us to distill a set of empirical design principles to guide future model development. Furthermore, to make the best of this set of discovered principled architectures, we propose and compare several architecture prediction methods that effectively and efficiently predict optimal architectures for new biological tasks. Overall, our work provides a foundational resource and a principled methodology to guide the creation of the next generation of task-specific and foundation models for biology.

Abstract:
We introduce EEG Autoclean Vision Language AI (ICVision) a first-of-its-kind system that emulates expert-level EEG ICA component classification through AI-agent vision and natural language reasoning. Unlike conventional classifiers such as ICLabel, which rely on handcrafted features, ICVision directly interprets ICA dashboard visualizations topography, time series, power spectra, and ERP plots, using a multimodal large language model (GPT-4 Vision). This allows the AI to see and explain EEG components the way trained neurologists do, making it the first scientific implementation of AI-agent visual cognition in neurophysiology. ICVision classifies each component into one of six canonical categories (brain, eye, heart, muscle, channel noise, and other noise), returning both a confidence score and a human-like explanation. Evaluated on 3,168 ICA components from 124 EEG datasets, ICVision achieved k = 0.677 agreement with expert consensus, surpassing MNE ICLabel, while also preserving clinically relevant brain signals in ambiguous cases. Over 97% of its outputs were rated as interpretable and actionable by expert reviewers. As a core module of the open-source EEG Autoclean platform, ICVision signals a paradigm shift in scientific AI, where models do not just classify, but see, reason, and communicate. It opens the door to globally scalable, explainable, and reproducible EEG workflows, marking the emergence of AI agents capable of expert-level visual decision-making in brain science and beyond.

Abstract:
Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are a major barrier to safe and effective pharmacotherapy and increasingly reflect higher order interactions between drugs, genetic background, and clinical phenotypes. Existing graph based approaches usually predict ADRs as properties of drugs or drug pairs, leaving the causal gene implicit and limiting their value for pharmacogenomic decision making. We introduce HyperADRs, a hierarchical hypergraph framework that predicts ADR risk at the level of drug-gene-ADR triads. Starting from curated pharmacogenomic annotations in PharmGKB and the pharmacogenomics subdatabase of DrugBank, we construct high confidence triplets and integrate them with auxiliary molecular, functional, and disease relations from precision-medicine-oriented knowledge graphs. Drugs, genes, and ADR concepts are embedded with modality appropriate pretrained models (UniMol, ESM2, SapBERT) and propagated through a hypergraph convolutional network. A FiLM based, query conditioned contrastive learning module learns context specific representations so that, given any two entities, the model retrieves the correct third entity against many candidates. To improve robustness and interpretability, we propose a nine category ADR macro system scheme that reduces large heterogeneous "other" bins while aligning with organ system reasoning in clinical pharmacology. Across drug-, gene-, and ADR-held-out evaluations on PharmGKB, HyperADRs matches or exceeds strong baselines on ranking based metrics. When trained on PharmGKB and tested on unseen DrugBank triplets, HyperADRs maintains its ranking advantage, indicating that the learned representations capture transferable biological mechanisms and can support mechanistically grounded pharmacogenomic hypothesis generation.

Abstract:
Stochastic reaction networks (SRNs) are a general class of continuous-time Markov jump processes used to model a wide range of systems, including biochemical dynamics in single cells, ecological and epidemiological populations, and queueing or communication networks. Yet analyzing their dynamics remains challenging because these processes are high-dimensional and their transient behavior can vary substantially across different initial molecular or population states. Here we introduce a spectral framework for the stochastic Koopman operator that provides a tractable, low-dimensional representation of SRN dynamics over continuous time, together with computable error estimates. By exploiting the compactness of the Koopman operator, we recover dominant spectral modes directly from simulated or experimental data, enabling efficient prediction of moments, event probabilities, and other summary statistics across all initial states. We further derive continuous-time parameter sensitivities and cross-spectral densities, offering new tools for probing noise structure and frequency-domain behavior. We demonstrate the approach on biologically relevant systems, including synthetic intracellular feedback controllers, stochastic oscillators, and inference of initial-state distributions from high-temporal-resolution flow cytometry. Together, these results establish spectral Koopman analysis as a powerful and general framework for studying stochastic dynamical systems across the biological, ecological, and computational sciences.

Abstract:
Protein inverse folding, the design of an amino acid sequence based on a target 3D structure, is a fundamental problem of computational protein engineering. Existing methods either generate sequences without leveraging external knowledge or relying on protein language models (PLMs). The former omits the evolutionary information stored in protein databases, while the latter is parameter-inefficient and inflexible to adapt to ever-growing protein data. To overcome the above drawbacks, in this paper we propose a novel method, called retrieval-augmented denoising diffusion (RadDiff), for protein inverse folding. Given the target protein backbone, RadDiff uses a hierarchical search strategy to efficiently retrieve structurally similar proteins from large protein databases. The retrieved structures are then aligned residue-by-residue to the target to construct a position-specific amino acid profile, which serves as an evolutionary-informed prior that conditions the denoising process. A lightweight integration module is further designed to incorporate this prior effectively. Experimental results on the CATH, PDB, and TS50 datasets show that RadDiff consistently outperforms existing methods, improving sequence recovery rate by up to 19%. Experimental results also demonstrate that RadDiff generates highly foldable sequences and scales effectively with database size.

Abstract:
The genetic evolution of SARS-CoV-2 has caused recurring epidemic waves, understanding its global dispersal patterns is critical for effective surveillance. We developed the Site-based mutation dynamics - Equal Power Sampling (S-EPS) framework, a phylogenetic-free, bias-correcting framework for profiling viral source-sink dynamics. Applying S-EPS to 6.6 million SARS-CoV-2 genomes (March 2020 - June 2024) from 13 regions worldwide, we identified Africa and the Indian subcontinent as the predominant sources of key mutations. Southeast Asia serves as an early transmission hub, while Russia and South America mainly acted as sinks. Key mutations took longer to establish fitness in source regions than externally. Once an amino acid substitution on the receptor-binding domain reached 1% prevalence in major sources, there is an 80% probability it would spread elsewhere, with a 2-month median lead time (IQR: 1-4). Our findings underscore the importance of genetic surveillance, with S-EPS offering enhanced capability for monitoring emerging viral threats.

Abstract:
RFdiffusion is a popular and well-established model for generation of protein structures. However, this generative process offers limited insight into its internal representations and how they contribute to the final protein structure. Concurrently, recent work in mechanistic interpretability has successfully used Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to discover interpretable features within neural networks. We combine these concepts by applying SAE to the internal representations of RFdiffusion to uncover secondary structure-specific features and establish a relationship between them and generated protein structures. Building on these insights, we introduce a novel steering mechanism that enables precise control of secondary structure formation through a tunable hyperparameter, while simultaneously revealing interpretable block and neuron-level representations within RFdiffusion. Our work pioneers a new framework for making RFdiffusion more interpretable, demonstrating how understanding internal features can be directly translated into precise control over the protein design process.

Abstract:
As COVID-19 transitions into an endemic disease that remains constantly present in the population at a stable level, monitoring its prevalence without invasive measures becomes increasingly important. In this paper, we present a deep neural network estimator for the COVID-19 daily case count based on wastewater surveillance data and other confounding factors. This work builds upon the study by Jiang, Kolozsvary, and Li (2024), which connects the COVID-19 case counts with testing data collected early in the pandemic. Using the COVID-19 testing data and the wastewater surveillance data during the period when both data were highly reliable, one can train an artificial neural network that learns the nonlinear relation between the COVID-19 daily case count and the wastewater viral RNA concentration. From a machine learning perspective, the main challenge lies in addressing temporal feature reliability, as the training data has different reliability over different time periods.

Abstract:
Cells achieve size homeostasis by regulating their division timing based on their size, added size, and cell cycle time. Previous research under steady-state conditions demonstrated the robustness of these mechanisms. However, their dynamic responses in fluctuating environments, such as nutrient depletion due to population growth, remain challenging to fully characterize. Currently, advances in single-cell microscopy have revealed various cellular division strategies whose underlying molecular mechanisms are complex and not always available. This study introduces a novel approach to model cell size dynamics using a piecewise deterministic Markov chain framework, where cell division events are modeled as stochastic jumps determined by a division propensity dependent on both current cell size and added size since birth. We propose a three-parameter characterization for the division process: scale (target added size at division), shape (division stochasticity), and division strategy (relevance of cell size, added size, or cell cycle duration). We derive analytical formulas for the probability of division, and with this probability, we develop a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) framework. We implement a systematic investigation of the accuracy of inference as a function of sample size. The model's performance is studied across various scenarios, including those exhibiting dynamical changes in one or more parameters, suggesting its broad applicability for analyzing new experimental data on cell size regulation in dynamic environments.

Abstract:
Snarls and superbubbles are fundamental pangenome decompositions capturing variant sites. These bubble-like structures underpin key tasks in computational pangenomics, including structural-variant genotyping, distance indexing, haplotype sampling, and variant annotation. Snarls can be quadratically-many in the size of the graph, and since their introduction in 2018 with the vg toolkit, there has been no work on identifying all snarls in linear time. Moreover, while it is known how to find superbubbles in linear time, this result is a highly specialized solution only achieved after a long series of papers.   We present the first algorithm identifying all snarls in linear time. This is based on a new representation of all snarls, of size linear in the input graph size, and which can be computed in linear time. Our algorithm is based on a unified framework that also provides a new linear-time algorithm for finding superbubbles. An observation behind our results is that all such structures are separated from the rest of the graph by two vertices (except for cases which are trivially computable), i.e. their endpoints are a 2-separator of the underlying undirected graph. Based on this, we employ the well-known SPQR tree decomposition, which encodes all 2-separators, to guide a traversal that finds the bubble-like structures efficiently.   We implemented our algorithms in C++ (available at https://github.com/algbio/BubbleFinder) and evaluated them on various pangenomic datasets. Our algorithms outcompete or they are on the same level of existing methods. For snarls, we are up to two times faster than vg, while identifying all snarls. When computing superbubbles, we are up to 50 times faster than BubbleGun. Our SPQR tree framework provides a unifying perspective on bubble-like structures in pangenomics, together with a template for finding other bubble-like structures efficiently.

Abstract:
The brain has evolved to effectively control the body, and in order to understand the relationship we need to model the sensorimotor transformations underlying embodied control. As part of a coordinated effort, we are developing a general-purpose platform for behavior-driven simulation modeling high fidelity behavioral dynamics, biomechanics, and neural circuit architectures underlying embodied control. We present a pipeline for taking kinematics data from the neuroscience lab and creating a pipeline for recapitulating those natural movements in a biomechanical model. We implement a imitation learning framework to perform a dexterous forelimb reaching task with a musculoskeletal model in a simulated physics environment. The mouse arm model is currently training at faster than 1 million training steps per second due to GPU acceleration with JAX and Mujoco-MJX. We present results that indicate that adding naturalistic constraints on energy and velocity lead to simulated musculoskeletal activity that better predict real EMG signals. This work provides evidence to suggest that energy and control constraints are critical to modeling musculoskeletal motor control.

Abstract:
We present an automated approach for identifying and annotating motifs and domains in protein sequences, using pretrained Protein Language Models (PLMs) and Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs), adapted from interpretability research in computer vision. We treat motifs as conceptual entities and represent them through learned CAVs in PLM embedding space by training simple linear classifiers to distinguish motif-containing from non-motif sequences. To identify motif occurrences, we extract embeddings for overlapping sequence windows and compute their inner products with motif CAVs. This scoring mechanism quantifies how strongly each sequence region expresses the motif concept and naturally detects multiple instances of the same motif within the same protein. Using a dataset of sixty-nine well-characterized motifs with curated positive and negative examples, our method achieves over 85\% F1 Score for segments strongly expressing the concept and accurately localizes motif positions across diverse protein families. As each motif is encoded by a single vector, motif detection requires only the pretrained PLM and a lightweight dictionary of CAVs, offering a scalable, interpretable, and computationally efficient framework for automated sequence annotation.

Abstract:
Medically uncontrolled epileptic seizures affect nearly 15 million people worldwide, resulting in enormous economic and psychological burdens. Treatment of medically refractory epilepsy is essential for patients to achieve remission, improve psychological functioning, and enhance social and vocational outcomes. Here, we show a state-of-the-art method that stabilizes fractional dynamical networks modeled from intracranial EEG data, effectively suppressing seizure activity in 34 out of 35 total spontaneous episodes from patients at the University of Pennsylvania and the Mayo Clinic. We perform a multi-scale analysis and show that the fractal behavior and stability properties of these data distinguish between four epileptic states: interictal, pre-ictal, ictal, and post-ictal. Furthermore, the simulated controlled signals exhibit substantial amplitude reduction ($49\%$ average). These findings highlight the potential of fractional dynamics to characterize seizure-related brain states and demonstrate its capability to suppress epileptic activity.

Abstract:
Long-term time-lapse imaging of biological samples requires correcting for focal drift, which would otherwise gradually push the sample out of focus. We present a software-based method that eliminates this time-dependent blur using only a motorized Z-drive, with no additional hardware. The method relies on imaging marks made on the side of the coverslip opposite to the sample. We provide a Beanshell script implementation, evaluate its performance across multiple objectives, and benchmark it against a hardware autofocus system, finding comparable results. Finally, we demonstrate its effectiveness in live imaging of growing bacterial colonies.

Abstract:
Inferring who infected whom in an outbreak is essential for characterising transmission dynamics and guiding public health interventions. However, this task is challenging due to limited surveillance data and the complexity of immunological and social interactions. Instead of a single definitive transmission tree, epidemiologists often consider multiple plausible trees forming \textit{epidemic forests}. Various inference methods and assumptions can yield different epidemic forests, yet no formal test exists to assess whether these differences are statistically significant. We propose such a framework using a chi-square test and permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA). We assessed each method's ability to distinguish simulated epidemic forests generated under different offspring distributions. While both methods achieved perfect specificity for forests with 100+ trees, PERMANOVA consistently outperformed the chi-square test in sensitivity across all epidemic and forest sizes. Implemented in the R package \textit{mixtree}, we provide the first statistical framework to robustly compare epidemic forests.

Abstract:
Research increasingly relies on computational methods to analyze experimental data and predict molecular properties. Current approaches often require researchers to use a variety of tools for statistical analysis and machine learning, creating workflow inefficiencies. We present an integrated platform that combines classical statistical methods with Random Forest classification for comprehensive data analysis that can be used in the biological sciences. The platform implements automated hyperparameter optimization, feature importance analysis, and a suite of statistical tests including t tests, ANOVA, and Pearson correlation analysis. Our methodology addresses the gap between traditional statistical software, modern machine learning frameworks and biology, by providing a unified interface accessible to researchers without extensive programming experience. The system achieves this through automatic data preprocessing, categorical encoding, and adaptive model configuration based on dataset characteristics. Initial testing protocols are designed to evaluate classification accuracy across diverse chemical datasets with varying feature distributions. This work demonstrates that integrating statistical rigor with machine learning interpretability can accelerate biological discovery workflows while maintaining methodological soundness. The platform's modular architecture enables future extensions to additional machine learning algorithms and statistical procedures relevant to bioinformatics.

Abstract:
Hirschsprung Disease is characterized by the absence of ganglion cells in the myenteric plexus. Therefore, their correct identification is crucial for diagnosing Hirschsprung disease. We introduce a three-stage segmentation framework based on a Vision Transformer (ViT-B/16) that mimics the pathologist's diagnostic approach. The framework sequentially segments the muscularis propria, delineates the myenteric plexus, and identifies ganglion cells within anatomically valid regions. 30 whole-slide images of colon tissue were used, each containing expert manual annotations of muscularis, plexus, and ganglion cells at varying levels of certainty. A 5-fold cross-validation scheme was applied to each stage, along with resolution-specific tiling strategies and tailored postprocessing to ensure anatomical consistency. The proposed method achieved a Dice coefficient of 89.9% and a Plexus Inclusion Rate of 100% for muscularis segmentation. Plexus segmentation reached a recall of 94.8%, a precision of 84.2% and a Ganglia Inclusion Rate of 99.7%. For high-certainty ganglion cells, the model achieved 62.1% precision and 89.1% recall, while joint certainty scores yielded 67.0% precision. These results indicate that ViT-based models are effective at leveraging global tissue context and capturing cellular morphology at small scales, even within complex histological tissue structures. This multi-stage methodology has great potential to support digital pathology workflows by reducing inter-observer variability and assisting in the evaluation of Hirschsprung disease. The clinical impact will be evaluated in future work with larger multi-center datasets and additional expert annotations.

Abstract:
Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) results from an impact or concussion to the head with the injury being specifically characterized through pathological degradation at various biological length scales. Following injury, various mechanical modeling techniques have been proposed in the literature that seek to quantify neuronal-scale to tissue-scale metrics of brain damage. Broadly, the two categories of degradation encompass physiological deterioration of neurons and upregulation of chemical entities such as neurotransmitters which causes initiation of downstream pathophysiological effects. Despite the many contributing pathways, in this work, we delineate and model a potential glia-initiated injury pathway that leads to secondary injury. The goal of this work is to demonstrate a continuum framework which models the multiphysics of mechano-chemical interactions underlying TBI. Using a coupled PDE (partial differential equation) formulation and FEM (finite element method) discretization, the framework highlights evolution of field variables which spatio-temporally resolve mechanical metrics and chemical species across neuronal clusters. The modeling domain encompasses microglia, neurons and the extracellular matrix. The continuum framework used to model the mechano-chemical interactions assumes a three dimensional viscoelastic network to capture the mechanical response underlying proteins constituting the neuron microstructure and advection-diffusion equations modeling spatio-temporal evolution of chemical species. We use this framework to numerically estimate key concentrations of chemical species produced by the strain field. In this work, we identify key biomarkers within the labyrinth of molecular pathways and build a framework that captures the core mechano-chemical interactions. This framework is an attempt to quantify secondary injury and thus assist in developing targeted TBI treatments.

Abstract:
The need for effective biomonitoring in wastewater has become clear due to the impracticality of continuously tracking all chemicals and emerging contaminants in the aquatic exposome. Effect-based biomonitoring provides a cost-effective solution. The ToxMate device, which uses videotracking of locomotor behavior in aquatic invertebrates, has proven efficient for real-time detection of micropollutant surges in effluents. To extend the approach, this proof-of-concept study evaluates the potential to formalize behavioral fingerprints from real-time videotracking data to characterize qualitative variations in effluent contamination. We present the first application of a functional data analysis (FDA) framework in ecotoxicology. Data were obtained by simultaneously tracking three sentinel organisms from distinct taxa (a crustacean, an annelid, and a gastropod) during pulse exposures to four chemicals in the laboratory (two metals, one pharmaceutical, and one insecticide). Individual and multispecies responses were analy-zed to determine whether combining species enhances the resolution of contamination fingerprints through multidimensional FDA. Applying the same data-driven approach to field data from a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) revealed four recurring types of micropollution events. This proof of concept demonstrates the potential of behavioral fingerprints to improve wastewater monitoring and reduce pollutant transfer to the environment.

Abstract:
In recent years there has been a paradigm shift from the study of local task-related activation to the organization and functioning of large-scale functional and structural brain networks. However, a long-standing challenge in this large-scale brain network analysis is how to compare network organizations irrespective of their complexity. The maximum spanning tree (MST) has served as a simple, unbiased, standardized representation of complex brain networks and effectively addressed this long-standing challenge. This tree representation, however, has been limited to individual networks. Group-level trees are always constructed from the average network or through a bootstrap procedure. Constructing the group-level tree from the average network introduces bias from individual subjects with outlying connectivities. The bootstrap method can be computationally prohibitive if a good approximation is desired. To address these issues, we propose a novel spectral representation of trees using the spanning tree basis. This spectral representation enables us to compute the average MST and demonstrate that this average tree captures the global properties of all the MSTs in the group and also overlaps with the union of the shortest paths in the functional brain networks.

Blini is a tool for quick lookup of nucleotide sequences in databases, and for quick dereplication of sequence collections. It is meant to help clean and characterize large collections of assembled contigs or long sequences that would otherwise be too big to search with online tools, or too demanding for a local machine to process. Benchmarks on simulated data demonstrate that it is faster than existing tools and requires less RAM, while preserving search and clustering accuracy.

Abstract:
We present Genie-CAT, a tool-augmented large-language-model (LLM) system designed to accelerate scientific hypothesis generation in protein design. Using metalloproteins (e.g., ferredoxins) as a case study, Genie-CAT integrates four capabilities -- literature-grounded reasoning through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), structural parsing of Protein Data Bank files, electrostatic potential calculations, and machine-learning prediction of redox properties -- into a unified agentic workflow. By coupling natural-language reasoning with data-driven and physics-based computation, the system generates mechanistically interpretable, testable hypotheses linking sequence, structure, and function. In proof-of-concept demonstrations, Genie-CAT autonomously identifies residue-level modifications near [Fe--S] clusters that affect redox tuning, reproducing expert-derived hypotheses in a fraction of the time. The framework highlights how AI agents combining language models with domain-specific tools can bridge symbolic reasoning and numerical simulation, transforming LLMs from conversational assistants into partners for computational discovery.

Abstract:
Objectives. The aim of the present study was to develop a fully deep learning model to reduce the intra- and inter-operator reproducibility of sector classification systems for predicting unerupted maxillary canine likelihood of impaction. Methods. Three orthodontists (Os) and three general dental practitioners (GDPs) classified the position of unerupted maxillary canines on 306 radiographs (T0) according to the three different sector classification systems (5-, 4-, and 3-sector classification system). The assessment was repeated after four weeks (T1). Intra- and inter-observer agreement were evaluated with Cohen's K and Fleiss K, and between group differences with a z-test. The same radiographs were tested on different artificial intelligence (AI) models, pre-trained on an extended dataset of 1,222 radiographs. The best-performing model was identified based on its sensitivity and precision. Results. The 3-sector system was found to be the classification method with highest reproducibility, with an agreement (Cohen's K values) between observations (T0 versus T1) for each examiner ranged from 0.80 to 0.92, and an overall agreement of 0.85 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.83-0.87]. The overall inter-observer agreement (Fleiss K) ranged from 0.69 to 0.7. The educational background did not affect either intra- or inter-observer agreement (p>0.05). DenseNet121 proved to be the best-performing model in allocating impacted canines in the three different classes, with an overall accuracy of 76.8%. Conclusion. AI models can be designed to automatically classify the position of unerupted maxillary canines.

In conclusion, partial parallelism was infrequently observed and inconsistently reported in most biomarker assays for neurodegeneration. Narrow dilution ranges and variable methodologies limit generalizability. Transparent reporting of dilution protocols and adherence to established analytical validation guidelines is needed. This systematic review has practical implications for clinical trial design, regulatory approval processes, and the reliability of biomarker-based diagnostics.

Abstract:
Accurate diagnosis of spitzoid tumors (ST) is critical to ensure a favorable prognosis and to avoid both under- and over-treatment. Epigenetic data, particularly DNA methylation, provide a valuable source of information for this task. However, prior studies assume complete data, an unrealistic setting as methylation profiles frequently contain missing entries due to limited coverage and experimental artifacts. Our work challenges these favorable scenarios and introduces ReMAC, an extension of ReMasker designed to tackle classification tasks on high-dimensional data under complete and incomplete regimes. Evaluation on real clinical data demonstrates that ReMAC achieves strong and robust performance compared to competing classification methods in the stratification of ST. Code is available: https://github.com/roshni-mahtani/ReMAC.

Abstract:
Cell migration often exhibits long-range temporal correlations and anomalous diffusion, even in the absence of external guidance cues such as chemical gradients or topographical constraints. These observations raise a fundamental question: do such correlations simply reflect internal cellular processes, or do they enhance a cell's ability to navigate complex environments? In this work, we explore how temporally correlated noise (modeled using fractional Brownian motion) influences chemotactic search dynamics. Through computational experiments, we show that superdiffusive motion, when combined with gradient-driven migration, enables robust exploration of the chemoattractant landscape. Cells reliably reach the global maximum of the concentration field, even in the presence of spatial noise, secondary cues, or irregular signal geometry. We quantify this behavior by analyzing the distribution of first hitting times under varying degrees of temporal correlation. Notably, our results are consistent across diverse conditions, including flat and curved substrates, and scenarios involving both primary and self-generated chemotactic signals. Beyond biological implications, these findings also offer insight into the design of optimization and sampling algorithms that benefit from structured stochasticity.

Abstract:
T cells are central to the adaptive immune response, capable of detecting pathogenic antigens while ignoring healthy tissues with remarkable specificity and sensitivity. Quantitatively understanding how T cell receptors (TCRs) discriminate among antigens requires biophysical models and theoretical analysis of signaling networks. Here, we review current theoretical frameworks of antigen recognition in the context of modern experimental and computational advances. Antigen potency spans a continuum and exhibits nonlinear effects within complex mixtures, challenging discrete classification and simple threshold-based models. This complexity motivates the development of models such as adaptive kinetic proofreading, which integrate both activating and inhibitory signals. Advances in high-throughput technologies now generate large-scale, quantitative datasets, enabling the refinement of such models through statistical and machine learning approaches. This convergence of theory, data, and computation promises deeper insights into immune decision-making and opens new avenues for rational immunotherapy design.

Abstract:
Accurately modeling the relationship between perturbations, transcriptional responses, and phenotypic changes is essential for building an AI Virtual Cell (AIVC). However, existing methods typically constrained to modeling direct associations, such as Perturbation $\rightarrow$ RNA or Perturbation $\rightarrow$ Morphology, overlook the crucial causal link from RNA to morphology. To bridge this gap, we propose TRIDENT, a cascade generative framework that synthesizes realistic cellular morphology by conditioning on both the perturbation and the corresponding gene expression profile. To train and evaluate this task, we construct MorphoGene, a new dataset pairing L1000 gene expression with Cell Painting images for 98 compounds. TRIDENT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving up to 7-fold improvement with strong generalization to unseen compounds. In a case study on docetaxel, we validate that RNA-guided synthesis accurately produces the corresponding phenotype. An ablation study further confirms that this RNA conditioning is essential for the model's high fidelity. By explicitly modeling transcriptome-phenome mapping, TRIDENT provides a powerful in silico tool and moves us closer to a predictive virtual cell.

Abstract:
Alzheimer's disease (AD) emerges from a complex interplay of molecular, cellular, and network-level disturbances that are not easily captured by traditional reductionist frameworks. Conventional analyses of gene expression often rely on thresholded correlation networks or clustering-based module detection, approaches that may obscure nonlinear structure and higher-order organization. Here, we introduce a comparative topological framework that makes use of topological data analysis (TDA) and the Mapper algorithm to detect discontinuities - localized disruptions in the topology of gene co-expression space between healthy and AD brain tissue. Using gene expression data from 3 brain regions, we mapped how AD reshapes the global topology of gene-gene relationships. Discontinuity hotspots were identified via variability-based node scoring and subjected to Gene Ontology Biological Process enrichment analysis. This work illustrates the potential of TDA to uncover disease-relevant structure in high-dimensional transcriptomic data and motivates broader application of shape-based comparative methods in neurodegeneration research and other areas that benefit from comparative analysis.

Abstract:
Deep learning has emerged as a powerful framework for analyzing biomolecular dynamics trajectories, enabling efficient representations that capture essential system dynamics and facilitate mechanistic studies. We propose a neural network architecture incorporating Fourier Transform analysis to process trajectory data, achieving dual objectives: eliminating high-frequency noise while preserving biologically critical slow conformational dynamics, and establishing an isotropic representation space through the last hidden layer for enhanced dynamical quantification. Comparative protein simulations demonstrate our approach generates more uniform feature distributions than linear regression methods, evidenced by smoother state similarity matrices and clearer classification boundaries. Moreover, by using saliency score, we identified key structural determinants linked to effective energy landscapes governing system dynamics. We believe that the fusion of neural network features with physical order parameters creates a robust analytical framework for advancing biomolecular trajectory analysis.

Abstract:
Collapse Lineage Tree (CLTree) is a software tool that annotates, roots, and evaluates phylogenetic trees by using lineages. A recursive algorithm was designed to annotate the branches by the common taxonomic lineage of its descendants in a rooted tree. For an unrooted tree, it determines the root that best conforms to the taxonomic system based on the aforementioned lineage annotations. Based on the lineage annotations of notes, CLTree infers the monophyly of taxonomic units and quantifies the concordance between the phylogenetic tree and the taxonomic system base on Shannon entropy. The core algorithm of CLTree is highly efficient with linear complexity, capable of processing phylogenetic trees with 17,955 terminal nodes within one second. We believe that CLTree will serve as a powerful tool for study of evolution and taxonomy.

Comment: Accepted to IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM) 2025 REU Symposium

Abstract:
Deterministic Lateral Displacement (DLD) devices are widely used in microfluidics for label-free, size-based separation of particles and cells, with particular promise in isolating circulating tumor cells (CTCs) for early cancer diagnostics. This study focuses on the optimization of DLD design parameters, such as row shift fraction, post size, and gap distance, to enhance the selective isolation of lung cancer cells based on their physical properties. To overcome the challenges of rare CTC detection and reduce reliance on computationally intensive simulations, machine learning models including gradient boosting, k-nearest neighbors, random forest, and multilayer perceptron (MLP) regressors are employed. Trained on a large, numerically validated dataset, these models predict particle trajectories and identify optimal device configurations, enabling high-throughput and cost-effective DLD design. Beyond trajectory prediction, the models aid in isolating critical design variables, offering a systematic, data-driven framework for automated DLD optimization. This integrative approach advances the development of scalable and precise microfluidic systems for cancer diagnostics, contributing to the broader goals of early detection and personalized medicine.

Abstract:
Motivation: Drug synergy is strongly influenced by cellular context. Variations in protein interaction landscapes and pathway activities across cell types can reshape how drugs act in combination. However, most existing models overlook this heterogeneity and rely on static or bulk level protein protein interaction networks that ignore cell specific molecular wiring. With the availability of single cell transcriptomic data, it is now possible to reconstruct cell line specific interactomes, offering a new foundation for contextualized drug synergy modeling.   Results: We present SynCell, a contextualized drug synergy framework that integrates drug protein, protein protein, and protein cell line relations within a unified graph architecture. SynCell leverages single cell derived, cell line specific PPI networks to embed the molecular context in which drugs act, and employs graph convolutional learning to model how pharmacological effects propagate through cell specific signaling networks. This formulation treats synergy prediction as a cell line contextualized drug drug interaction problem. Across two large scale benchmarks (NCI ALMANAC and ONeil), SynCell consistently outperforms state of the art baselines including DeepDDS, HypergraphSynergy, and HERMES, especially in predicting synergies involving unseen drugs or novel cell lines. Ablation analyses show that contextualizing PPIs with single cell resolution yields substantial gains in generalization and biological interpretability.

Abstract:
Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) is a technology that measures gene expression profiles within tissue sections while retaining spatial context. It reveals localized gene expression patterns and tissue heterogeneity, both of which are essential for understanding disease etiology. However, its high cost has driven efforts to predict spatial gene expression from whole slide images. Despite recent advancements, current methods still face significant limitations, such as under-exploitation of high-level biological context, over-reliance on exemplar retrievals, and inadequate alignment of heterogeneous modalities. To address these challenges, we propose DKAN, a novel Dual-path Knowledge-Augmented contrastive alignment Network that predicts spatially resolved gene expression by integrating histopathological images and gene expression profiles through a biologically informed approach. Specifically, we introduce an effective gene semantic representation module that leverages the external gene database to provide additional biological insights, thereby enhancing gene expression prediction. Further, we adopt a unified, one-stage contrastive learning paradigm, seamlessly combining contrastive learning and supervised learning to eliminate reliance on exemplars, complemented with an adaptive weighting mechanism. Additionally, we propose a dual-path contrastive alignment module that employs gene semantic features as dynamic cross-modal coordinators to enable effective heterogeneous feature integration. Through extensive experiments across three public ST datasets, DKAN demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art models, establishing a new benchmark for spatial gene expression prediction and offering a powerful tool for advancing biological and clinical research.

Comment: Accepted into NeurIPS 2025 Learning from Time Series for Health workshop

Abstract:
12-lead ECGs with high sampling frequency are the clinical gold standard for arrhythmia detection, but their short-term, spot-check nature often misses intermittent events. Wearable ECGs enable long-term monitoring but suffer from irregular, lower sampling frequencies due to battery constraints, making morphology analysis challenging. We present an end-to-end classification pipeline to address these issues. We train a latent ODE to model continuous ECG waveforms and create robust feature vectors from high-frequency single-channel signals. We construct three latent vectors per waveform via downsampling the initial 360 Hz ECG to 90 Hz and 45 Hz. We then use a gradient boosted tree to classify these vectors and test robustness across frequencies. Performance shows minimal degradation, with macro-averaged AUC-ROC values of 0.984, 0.978, and 0.976 at 360 Hz, 90 Hz, and 45 Hz, respectively, suggesting a way to sidestep the trade-off between signal fidelity and battery life. This enables smaller wearables, promoting long-term monitoring of cardiac health.

Abstract:
Advances in AI have introduced several strong models in computational pathology to usher it into the era of multi-modal diagnosis, analysis, and interpretation. However, the current pathology-specific visual language models still lack capacities in making diagnosis with rigorous reasoning paths as well as handling divergent tasks, and thus challenges of building AI Copilots for real scenarios still exist. Here we introduce TeamPath, an AI system powered by reinforcement learning and router-enhanced solutions based on large-scale histopathology multimodal datasets, to work as a virtual assistant for expert-level disease diagnosis, patch-level information summarization, and cross-modality generation to integrate transcriptomic information for the clinical usage. We also collaborate with pathologists from Yale School of Medicine to demonstrate that TeamPath can assist them in working more efficiently by identifying and correcting expert conclusions and reasoning paths. Overall, TeamPath can flexibly choose the best settings according to the needs, and serve as an innovative and reliable system for information communication across different modalities and experts.

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder associated with the accumulation of misfolded alpha-synuclein aggregates, forming Lewy bodies and neuritic shape used for pathology diagnostics. Automatic analysis of immunohistochemistry histopathological images with Deep Learning provides a promising tool for better understanding the spatial organization of these aggregates. In this study, we develop an automated image processing pipeline to segment and classify these aggregates in whole-slide images (WSIs) of midbrain tissue from PD and incidental Lewy Body Disease (iLBD) cases based on weakly supervised segmentation, robust to immunohistochemical labelling variability, with a ResNet50 classifier. Our approach allows to differentiate between major aggregate morphologies, including Lewy bodies and neurites with a balanced accuracy of $80\%$. This framework paves the way for large-scale characterization of the spatial distribution and heterogeneity of alpha-synuclein aggregates in brightfield immunohistochemical tissue, and for investigating their poorly understood relationships with surrounding cells such as microglia and astrocytes.

Abstract:
Predicting the binding affinity of protein protein complexes directly from sequence remains a challenging problem, particularly in the absence of reliable structural information. Here I present ProtT Affinity, a sequence only model that combines ProtT5 embeddings with a lightweight Transformer architecture. The model is trained and evaluated on homology filtered subsets of the PDBBind database following a curation protocol consistent with prior structure based work. Across two independent test sets,ProtT Affinity reaches Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.628 and 0.459, respectively.Although its performance does not match the strongest structure based methods, it is competitive with several widely used approaches and provides a practical alternative when structural data are missing or uncertain. The results suggest that large protein language models capture features relevant to binding energetics, and that these features can be exploited to approximate affinity trends at scale.

Abstract:
The move towards personalized treatment and digital twins for cancer therapy requires a complete understanding of the mathematical models upon which these optimized simulation-based strategies are formulated. This study investigates the influence of mathematical model selection on the optimization of chemotherapy and radiotherapy protocols. By examining three chemotherapy models (log-kill, Norton-Simon, and Emax), and three radiotherapy models (linear-quadratic, proliferation saturation index, and continuous death-rate), we identify similarities and significant differences in the optimized protocols. We demonstrate how the assumptions built into the model formulations heavily influence optimal treatment dosing and sequencing, potentially leading to contradictory results. Further, we demonstrate how different model forms influence predictions in the adaptive therapy setting. As treatment decisions increasingly rely on simulation-based strategies, unexamined model assumptions can introduce bias, leading to model-dependent recommendations that may not be generalizable. This study highlights the importance of basing model selection on a full analysis of bias, sensitivity, practical parameter identifiability and/or inferred parameter posteriors, as a part of the uncertainty quantification process, rather than solely relying on information criterion. Understanding how model choice impacts predictions guiding personalized treatment planning with sufficient uncertainty quantification analysis, will lead to more robust and generalizable predictions.

Abstract:
Mathematical models support inference and forecasting in ecology and epidemiology, but results depend on the estimation framework. We compare Bayesian and Frequentist approaches across three biological models using four datasets: Lotka-Volterra predator-prey dynamics (Hudson Bay), a generalized logistic model (lung injury and 2022 U.S. mpox), and an SEIUR epidemic model (COVID-19 in Spain). Both approaches use a normal error structure to ensure a fair comparison.   We first assessed structural identifiability to determine which parameters can theoretically be recovered from the data. We then evaluated practical identifiability and forecasting performance using four metrics: mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), 95 percent prediction interval (PI) coverage, and weighted interval score (WIS). For the Lotka-Volterra model with both prey and predator data, we analyzed three scenarios: prey only, predator only, and both.   The Frequentist workflow used QuantDiffForecast (QDF) in MATLAB, which fits ODE models via nonlinear least squares and quantifies uncertainty through parametric bootstrap. The Bayesian workflow used BayesianFitForecast (BFF), which employs Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling via Stan to generate posterior distributions and diagnostics such as the Gelman-Rubin R-hat statistic.   Results show that Frequentist inference performs best when data are rich and fully observed, while Bayesian inference excels when latent-state uncertainty is high and data are sparse, as in the SEIUR COVID-19 model. Structural identifiability clarifies these patterns: full observability benefits both frameworks, while limited observability constrains parameter recovery. This comparison provides guidance for choosing inference frameworks based on data richness, observability, and uncertainty needs.

Abstract:
The application of spectral-shifting films in greenhouses to shift green light to red light has shown variable growth responses across crop species. However, the yield enhancement of crops under altered light quality is related to the collective effects of the specific biophysical characteristics of each species. Considering only one attribute of a crop has limitations in understanding the relationship between sunlight quality adjustments and crop growth performance. Therefore, this study aims to comprehensively link multiple plant phenotypic traits and daily light integral considering the physiological responses of crops to their growth outcomes under SF using artificial intelligence. Between 2021 and 2024, various leafy, fruiting, and root crops were grown in greenhouses covered with either PEF or SF, and leaf reflectance, leaf mass per area, chlorophyll content, daily light integral, and light saturation point were measured from the plants cultivated in each condition. 210 data points were collected, but there was insufficient data to train deep learning models, so a variational autoencoder was used for data augmentation. Most crop yields showed an average increase of 22.5% under SF. These data were used to train several models, including logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, XGBoost, and feedforward neural network (FFNN), aiming to binary classify whether there was a significant effect on yield with SF application. The FFNN achieved a high classification accuracy of 91.4% on a test dataset that was not used for training. This study provide insight into the complex interactions between leaf phenotypic and photosynthetic traits, environmental conditions, and solar spectral components by improving the ability to predict solar spectral shift effects using SF.

Abstract:
Reconstruction of 3D erythrocyte or red blood cell (RBC) morphology from partial observations, such as microscope images, is essential for understanding the physiology of RBC aging and the pathology of various RBC disorders. In this study, we propose a multi-fidelity neural network (MFNN) approach to fuse high-fidelity cross-sections of an RBC, with a morphologically similar low-fidelity reference 3D RBC shape to recover its full 3D surface. The MFNN predictor combines a convolutional neural network trained on low-fidelity reference RBC data with a feedforward neural network that captures nonlinear morphological correlations, and augments training with surface area and volume constraints for regularization in the low-fidelity branch. This approach is theoretically grounded by a topological homeomorphism between a sphere and 3D RBC surfaces, with training data generated by dissipative particle dynamics simulations of stomatocyte-discocyte-echinocyte transformation. Benchmarking across diverse RBC shapes observed in normal and aged populations, our results show that the MFNN predictor can reconstruct complex RBC morphologies with over 95% coordinate accuracy when provided with at least two orthogonal cross-sections. It is observed that informative oblique cross-sections intersecting spicule tips of echinocytes improve both local and global feature reconstruction, highlighting the value of feature-aware sampling. Our study further evaluates the influence of sampling strategies, shape dissimilarity, and noise, showing enhanced robustness under physically constrained training. Altogether, these results demonstrate the capability of MFNN to reconstruct the 3D shape of normal and aged RBCs from partial cross-sections as observed in conventional microscope images, which could facilitate the quantitative analysis of RBC morphological parameters in normal and disease-related RBC samples.

Abstract:
Numerous studies have utilized NCBI data for genomic analysis, gene annotation, and identifying disease-associated variants, yet NCBI's epidemiological potential remains underexplored. This study demonstrates how NCBI datasets can be systematically leveraged to extract and interpret infectious disease patterns across spatial and temporal dimensions. Using Enterobacterales as a case study, we analyzed over 477,000 genomic records and metadata, including collection date, location, host species, and isolation source. We compared trends of Escherichia coli and Salmonella in NCBI data with CDC's National Outbreak Reporting System (NORS). While both datasets showed consistent seasonal peaks and foodborne sources, NCBI data revealed broader host species (e.g., wildlife, environmental reservoirs), greater isolate diversity, and finer spatial-temporal resolution. These insights were enabled by our open-source Python package, EpiNCBI_V1, developed for real-time downloading, filtering, and cleaning of pathogen genomic metadata from NCBI. This work highlights the value of integrating genomic repositories into public health analytics to enhance surveillance, outbreak detection, and cross-species transmission tracking globally.

Abstract:
Deep generative models are rapidly advancing structure-based drug design, offering substantial promise for generating small molecule ligands that bind to specific protein targets. However, most current approaches assume a rigid protein binding pocket, neglecting the intrinsic flexibility of proteins and the conformational rearrangements induced by ligand binding, limiting their applicability in practical drug discovery. Here, we propose Apo2Mol, a diffusion-based generative framework for 3D molecule design that explicitly accounts for conformational flexibility in protein binding pockets. To support this, we curate a dataset of over 24,000 experimentally resolved apo-holo structure pairs from the Protein Data Bank, enabling the characterization of protein structure changes associated with ligand binding. Apo2Mol employs a full-atom hierarchical graph-based diffusion model that simultaneously generates 3D ligand molecules and their corresponding holo pocket conformations from input apo states. Empirical studies demonstrate that Apo2Mol can achieve state-of-the-art performance in generating high-affinity ligands and accurately capture realistic protein pocket conformational changes.

Abstract:
Understanding how systems evolve over time often requires discovering the differential equations that govern their behavior. Automatically learning these equations from experimental data is challenging when the data are noisy or limited, and existing approaches struggle, in particular, with the estimation of unobserved derivatives. Here, we introduce an integral Bayesian symbolic regression method that learns governing equations directly from raw time-series data, without requiring manual assumptions or error-prone derivative estimation. By sampling the space of symbolic differential equations and evaluating them via numerical integration, our method robustly identifies governing equations even from noisy or scarce data. We show that this approach accurately recovers ground-truth models in synthetic benchmarks, and that it makes quasi-optimal predictions of system dynamics for all noise regimes. Applying this method to bacterial growth experiments across multiple species and substrates, we discover novel growth equations that outperform classical models in accurately capturing all phases of microbial proliferation, including lag, exponential, and saturation. Unlike standard approaches, our method reveals subtle shifts in growth dynamics, such as double ramp-ups or non-canonical transitions, offering a deeper, data-driven understanding of microbial physiology.

Abstract:
Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) has become a cornerstone technology in clinical microbiology, enabling rapid and accurate microbial identification. However, the development of data-driven diagnostic models remains limited by the lack of sufficiently large, balanced, and standardized spectral datasets. This study investigates the use of deep generative models to synthesize realistic MALDI-TOF MS spectra, aiming to overcome data scarcity and support the development of robust machine learning tools in microbiology.   We adapt and evaluate three generative models, Variational Autoencoders (MALDIVAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (MALDIGANs), and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (MALDIffusion), for the conditional generation of microbial spectra guided by species labels. Generation is conditioned on species labels, and spectral fidelity and diversity are assessed using diverse metrics.   Our experiments show that synthetic data generated by MALDIVAE, MALDIGAN, and MALDIffusion are statistically and diagnostically comparable to real measurements, enabling classifiers trained exclusively on synthetic samples to reach performance levels similar to those trained on real data. While all models faithfully reproduce the peak structure and variability of MALDI-TOF spectra, MALDIffusion obtains this fidelity at a substantially higher computational cost, and MALDIGAN shows competitive but slightly less stable behaviour. In contrast, MALDIVAE offers the most favorable balance between realism, stability, and efficiency. Furthermore, augmenting minority species with synthetic spectra markedly improves classification accuracy, effectively mitigating class imbalance and domain mismatch without compromising the authenticity of the generated data.

Abstract:
Reliable measurement of glenoid bone loss is essential for operative planning in shoulder instability, but current manual and semi-automated methods are time-consuming and often subject to interreader variability. We developed and validated a fully automated deep learning pipeline for measuring glenoid bone loss on three-dimensional computed tomography (CT) scans using a linear-based, en-face view, best-circle method. Shoulder CT images of 91 patients (average age, 40 years; range, 14-89 years; 65 men) were retrospectively collected along with manual labels including glenoid segmentation, landmarks, and bone loss measurements. The multi-stage algorithm has three main stages: (1) segmentation, where we developed a U-Net to automatically segment the glenoid and humerus; (2) anatomical landmark detection, where a second network predicts glenoid rim points; and (3) geometric fitting, where we applied principal component analysis (PCA), projection, and circle fitting to compute the percentage of bone loss. The automated measurements showed strong agreement with consensus readings and exceeded surgeon-to-surgeon consistency (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) 0.84 vs 0.78), including in low- and high-bone-loss subgroups (ICC 0.71 vs 0.63 and 0.83 vs 0.21, respectively; P < 0.001). For classifying patients into low, medium, and high bone-loss categories, the pipeline achieved a recall of 0.714 for low and 0.857 for high severity, with no low cases misclassified as high or vice versa. These results suggest that our method is a time-efficient and clinically reliable tool for preoperative planning in shoulder instability and for screening patients with substantial glenoid bone loss.

Abstract:
We present BIOMERO 2.0, a major evolution of the BIOMERO framework that transforms OMERO into a FAIR-compliant (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable), provenance-aware bioimaging platform. BIOMERO 2.0 integrates data import, preprocessing, analysis, and workflow monitoring through an OMERO.web plugin and containerized components. The importer subsystem facilitates in-place import using containerized preprocessing and metadata enrichment via forms, while the analyzer subsystem coordinates and tracks containerized analyses on high-performance computing systems via the BIOMERO Python library. All imports and analyses are recorded with parameters, versions, and results, ensuring real-time provenance accessible through integrated dashboards. This dual approach places OMERO at the heart of the bioimaging analysis process: the importer ensures provenance from image acquisition through preprocessing and import into OMERO, while the analyzer records it for downstream processing. These integrated layers enhance OMEROs FAIRification, supporting traceable, reusable workflows for image analysis that bridge the gap between data import, analysis, and sharing.

Abstract:
Biomarker discovery from high-throughput transcriptomic data is crucial for advancing precision medicine. However, existing methods often neglect gene-gene regulatory relationships and lack stability across datasets, leading to conflation of spurious correlations with genuine causal effects. To address these issues, we develop a causal graph neural network (Causal-GNN) method that integrates causal inference with multi-layer graph neural networks (GNNs). The key innovation is the incorporation of causal effect estimation for identifying stable biomarkers, coupled with a GNN-based propensity scoring mechanism that leverages cross-gene regulatory networks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves consistently high predictive accuracy across four distinct datasets and four independent classifiers. Moreover, it enables the identification of more stable biomarkers compared to traditional methods. Our work provides a robust, efficient, and biologically interpretable tool for biomarker discovery, demonstrating strong potential for broad application across medical disciplines.

Abstract:
The genotype-phenotype gap is a persistent barrier to complex trait genetic dissection, worsened by the explosive growth of genomic data (1.5 billion variants identified in the UK Biobank WGS study) alongside persistently scarce and subjective human-defined phenotypes. Digital phenotyping offers a potential solution, yet existing tools fail to balance scalable non-manual phenotype generation and biological interpretability of these quantitative traits. Here we report AIPheno, the first generative AI-driven "phenotype sequencer" that bridges this gap. It enables high-throughput, unsupervised extraction of digital phenotypes from imaging data and unlocks their biological meaning via generative network analysis. AIPheno transforms imaging modalities into a rich source of quantitative traits, dramatically enhancing cross-species genetic discovery, including novel loci such as CCBE1 (humans), KITLG-TMTC3 (domestic pigeons), and SOD2-IGF2R (swine). Critically, its generative module decodes AI-derived phenotypes by synthesizing variant-specific images to yield actionable biological insights. For example, it clarifies how the OCA2-HERC2 locus pleiotropically links pigmentation to retinal vascular traits via vascular visibility modulation. Integrating scalable non-manual phenotyping, enhanced genetic discovery power, and generative mechanistic decoding, AIPheno establishes a transformative closed-loop paradigm. This work addresses the longstanding genotype-phenotype imbalance, redefines digital phenotype utility, and accelerates translation of genetic associations into actionable understanding with profound implications for human health and agriculture.

Abstract:
Predicting single-cell perturbation outcomes directly advances gene function analysis and facilitates drug candidate selection, making it a key driver of both basic and translational biomedical research. However, a major bottleneck in this task is the unpaired nature of single-cell data, as the same cell cannot be observed both before and after perturbation due to the destructive nature of sequencing. Although some neural generative transport models attempt to tackle unpaired single-cell perturbation data, they either lack explicit conditioning or depend on prior spaces for indirect distribution alignment, limiting precise perturbation modeling. In this work, we approximate Schrödinger Bridge (SB), which defines stochastic dynamic mappings recovering the entropy-regularized optimal transport (OT), to directly align the distributions of control and perturbed single-cell populations across different perturbation conditions. Unlike prior SB approximations that rely on bidirectional modeling to infer optimal source-target sample coupling, we leverage Minibatch-OT based pairing to avoid such bidirectional inference and the associated ill-posedness of defining the reverse process. This pairing directly guides bridge learning, yielding a scalable approximation to the SB. We approximate two SB models, one modeling discrete gene activation states and the other continuous expression distributions. Joint training enables accurate perturbation modeling and captures single-cell heterogeneity. Experiments on public genetic and drug perturbation datasets show that our model effectively captures heterogeneous single-cell responses and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract:
Seagrass meadows contribute to the conservation of marine ecosystems, reduction in global warming impacts and pathogen controls. However, the decline in seagrass habitats due to environmental loads has become an urgent global issue. One way to address this issue is to better understand healthy seagrass habitats. Here, we estimate the structural characteristics of symbiotic and metabolic systems in sediments from eight coastal regions of Japan, with each region containing both seagrass-covered areas and adjacent unvegetated areas. Notably, seagrasses commonly maintain a balanced symbiotic relationship characterized by a positive association with cable bacteria (Desulfobulbaceae), nitrogen-cycling bacteria (Hyphomonadaceae), and coral algae (Corallinophycidae) and a negative association with diatoms (Diatomea). Furthermore, seagrass growth conditions influence metabolic pathways by activating nitrogen-related metabolism while attenuating methanogenesis. Our findings highlight the crucial roles of marine plants and their symbiotic systems in ensuring environmental conservation within the context of blue carbon storage across environmental gradients.

Abstract:
Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) has posed a major global health challenge for decades, and forecasting HIV diagnoses continues to be a critical area of research. However, capturing the complex spatial and temporal dependencies of HIV transmission remains challenging. Conventional Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) models rely on a fixed binary adjacency matrix that only encodes geographic adjacency, which is unable to represent interactions between non-contiguous counties. Our study proposes a deep learning architecture Mobility-Aware Transformer-Message Passing Neural Network (MAT-MPNN) framework to predict county-level HIV diagnosis rates across California, Florida, and the New England region. The model combines temporal features extracted by a Transformer encoder with spatial relationships captured through a Mobility Graph Generator (MGG). The MGG improves conventional adjacency matrices by combining geographic and demographic information. Compared with the best-performing hybrid baseline, the Transformer MPNN model, MAT-MPNN reduced the Mean Squared Prediction Error (MSPE) by 27.9% in Florida, 39.1% in California, and 12.5% in New England, and improved the Predictive Model Choice Criterion (PMCC) by 7.7%, 3.5%, and 3.9%, respectively. MAT-MPNN also achieved better results than the Spatially Varying Auto-Regressive (SVAR) model in Florida and New England, with comparable performance in California. These results demonstrate that applying mobility-aware dynamic spatial structures substantially enhances predictive accuracy and calibration in spatiotemporal epidemiological prediction.

Abstract:
This work introduces a novel framework for testing topological variability in weighted networks by combining Hodge decomposition with Wasserstein variance minimization. Traditional approaches that analyze raw edge weights are susceptible to noise driven perturbations, limiting their ability to detect meaningful structural differences between network populations. Network signals are decomposed into various components using combinatorial Hodge theory, then topological disparity is quantified via the 2-Wasserstein distance between persistence diagrams. The test statistic measures variance reduction when comparing within group to between group dispersions in the Wasserstein space. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed method suppresses small random perturbations while maintaining sensitivity to genuine topological differences, particularly when applied to Hodge decomposed flows rather than raw edge weights. The framework is applied to functional brain networks from the Multimodal Treatment of ADHD dataset, comparing cannabis users and non-users

Abstract:
Proteins perform essential biological functions, and accurate classification of their sequences is critical for understanding structure-function relationships, enzyme mechanisms, and molecular interactions. This study presents a deep learning-based framework for functional group classification of protein sequences derived from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Four architectures were implemented: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), CNN-BiLSTM hybrid, and CNN with Attention. Each model was trained using k-mer integer encoding to capture both local and long-range dependencies. Among these, the CNN achieved the highest validation accuracy of 91.8%, demonstrating the effectiveness of localized motif detection. Explainable AI techniques, including Grad-CAM and Integrated Gradients, were applied to interpret model predictions and identify biologically meaningful sequence motifs. The discovered motifs, enriched in histidine, aspartate, glutamate, and lysine, represent amino acid residues commonly found in catalytic and metal-binding regions of transferase enzymes. These findings highlight that deep learning models can uncover functionally relevant biochemical signatures, bridging the gap between predictive accuracy and biological interpretability in protein sequence analysis.

This paper describes GeoPl@ntNet, an interactive web application designed to make Essential Biodiversity Variables accessible and understandable to everyone through dynamic maps and fact sheets. Its core purpose is to allow users to explore high-resolution AI-generated maps of species distributions, habitat types, and biodiversity indicators across Europe. These maps, developed through a cascading pipeline involving convolutional neural networks and large language models, provide an intuitive yet information-rich interface to better understand biodiversity, with resolutions as precise as 50x50 meters. The website also enables exploration of specific regions, allowing users to select areas of interest on the map (e.g., urban green spaces, protected areas, or riverbanks) to view local species and their coverage. Additionally, GeoPl@ntNet generates comprehensive reports for selected regions, including insights into the number of protected species, invasive species, and endemic species.

Abstract:
We developed an explainable deep learning framework integrating protein-protein interaction (PPI) network centrality metrics with node embeddings for cancer therapeutic target prioritization. A high-confidence PPI network was constructed from STRING database interactions, computing six centrality metrics: degree, strength, betweenness, closeness, eigenvector centrality, and clustering coefficient. Node2Vec embeddings captured latent network topology. Combined features trained XGBoost and neural network classifiers using DepMap CRISPR essentiality scores as ground truth. Model interpretability was assessed through GradientSHAP analysis quantifying feature contributions. We developed a novel blended scoring approach combining model probability predictions with SHAP attribution magnitudes for enhanced gene prioritization. Our framework achieved state-of-the-art performance with AUROC of 0.930 and AUPRC of 0.656 for identifying the top 10\% most essential genes. GradientSHAP analysis revealed centrality measures contributed significantly to predictions, with degree centrality showing strongest correlation ($ρ$ = -0.357) with gene essentiality. The blended scoring approach created robust gene prioritization rankings, successfully identifying known essential genes including ribosomal proteins (RPS27A, RPS17, RPS6) and oncogenes (MYC). This study presents a human-based, combinatorial in silico framework successfully integrating network biology with explainable AI for therapeutic target discovery. The framework provides mechanistic transparency through feature attribution analysis while maintaining state-of-the-art predictive performance. Its reproducible design and reliance on human molecular datasets demonstrate a reduction-to-practice example of next-generation, animal-free modeling for cancer therapeutic target discovery and prioritization.

Abstract:
For decades, forensic statisticians have debated whether searching large DNA databases undermines the evidential value of a match. Modern surveillance faces an exponentially harder problem: screening populations across thousands of attributes using threshold rules rather than exact matching. Intuition suggests that requiring many coincidental matches should make false alerts astronomically unlikely. This intuition fails.   Consider a system that monitors 1,000 attributes, each with a 0.5 percent innocent match rate. Matching 15 pre-specified attributes has probability \(10^{-35}\), one in 30 decillion, effectively impossible. But operational systems require no such specificity. They might flag anyone who matches \emph{any} 15 of the 1,000. In a city of one million innocent people, this produces about 226 false alerts. A seemingly impossible event becomes all but guaranteed. This is not an implementation flaw but a mathematical consequence of high-dimensional screening.   We identify fundamental probabilistic limits on screening reliability. Systems undergo sharp transitions from reliable to unreliable with small increases in data scale, a fragility worsened by data growth and correlations. As data accumulate and correlation collapses effective dimensionality, systems enter regimes where alerts lose evidential value even when individual coincidences remain vanishingly rare. This framework reframes the DNA database controversy as a shift between operational regimes. Unequal surveillance exposures magnify failure, making ``structural bias'' mathematically inevitable. These limits are structural: beyond a critical scale, failure cannot be prevented through threshold adjustment or algorithmic refinement.

Abstract:
Timelapse images of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) provide rich information on cell structure and contractile function. However, it is challenging to reproducibly generate tissue samples and conduct scalable experiments with these cells. The two-dimensional cardiac muscle bundle (2DMB) platform helps address these limitations by standardizing tissue geometry, resulting in physiologic, uniaxial contractions of discrete tissues on an elastomeric substrate with stiffness similar to the heart. 2DMBs are highly conducive to sarcomere imaging using fluorescent reporters, but, due to their larger and more physiologic sarcomere displacements and velocities, prior sarcomere-tracking pipelines have been unreliable. Here, we present adaptations to SarcGraph, an open-source Python package for sarcomere detection and tracking, that enable automated analysis of high-frame-rate 2DMB recordings. Key modifications to the pipeline include: 1) switching to a frame-by-frame sarcomere detection approach and automating tissue segmentation with spatial partitioning, 2) performing Gaussian Process Regression for signal denoising, and 3) incorporating an automatic contractile phase detection pipeline. These enhancements enable the extraction of structural organization and functional contractility metrics for both the whole 2DMB tissue and distinct tissue regions, both in a fully automated manner. We complement this software release with a dataset of 130 example movies of baseline and drug-treated samples disseminated through the Harvard Dataverse. By providing open-source tools and datasets, we aim to enable high-throughput analysis of engineered cardiac tissues and advance collective progress within the hiPSC-CM research community.

Abstract:
Motivation: Parameter estimation is a cornerstone of data-driven modeling in systems biology. Yet, constructing such problems in a reproducible and accessible manner remains challenging. The PEtab format has established itself as a powerful community standard to encode parameter estimation problems, promoting interoperability and reusability. However, its reliance on multiple interlinked files - often edited manually - can introduce inconsistencies, and new users often struggle to navigate them. Here, we present PEtab-GUI, an open-source Python application designed to streamline the creation, editing, and validation of PEtab problems through an intuitive graphical user interface. PEtab-GUI integrates all PEtab components, including SBML models and tabular files, into a single environment with live error-checking and customizable defaults. Interactive visualization and simulation capabilities enable users to inspect the relationship between the model and the data. PEtab-GUI lowers the barrier to entry for specifying standardized parameter estimation problems, making dynamic modeling more accessible, especially in educational and interdisciplinary settings.   Availability and Implementation: PEtab-GUI is implemented in Python, open-source under a 3-Clause BSD license. The code, designed to be modular and extensible, is hosted on https://github.com/PEtab-dev/PEtab-GUI and can be installed from PyPI.

Abstract:
Accurate assessment of PD-L1 expression is critical for guiding immunotherapy, yet current immunohistochemistry (IHC) based methods are resource-intensive. We present nnUNet-B: a Bayesian segmentation framework that infers PD-L1 expression directly from H&E-stained histology images using Multimodal Posterior Sampling (MPS). Built upon nnUNet-v2, our method samples diverse model checkpoints during cyclic training to approximate the posterior, enabling both accurate segmentation and epistemic uncertainty estimation via entropy and standard deviation. Evaluated on a dataset of lung squamous cell carcinoma, our approach achieves competitive performance against established baselines with mean Dice Score and mean IoU of 0.805 and 0.709, respectively, while providing pixel-wise uncertainty maps. Uncertainty estimates show strong correlation with segmentation error, though calibration remains imperfect. These results suggest that uncertainty-aware H&E-based PD-L1 prediction is a promising step toward scalable, interpretable biomarker assessment in clinical workflows.

Abstract:
Multimodal deep learning (MDL) has emerged as a transformative approach in computational pathology. By integrating complementary information from multiple data sources, MDL models have demonstrated superior predictive performance across diverse clinical tasks compared to unimodal models. However, the assumption that combining modalities inherently improves performance remains largely unexamined. We hypothesise that multimodal gains depend critically on the predictive quality of individual modalities, and that integrating weak modalities may introduce noise rather than complementary information. We test this hypothesis on a prostate cancer dataset with histopathology, radiology, and clinical data to predict time-to-biochemical recurrence. Our results confirm that combining high-performing modalities yield superior performance compared to unimodal approaches. However, integrating a poor-performing modality with other higher-performing modalities degrades predictive accuracy. These findings demonstrate that multimodal benefit requires selective, performance-guided integration rather than indiscriminate modality combination, with implications for MDL design across computational pathology and medical imaging.

Abstract:
Current cancer screening guidelines cover only a few cancer types and rely on narrowly defined criteria such as age or a single risk factor like smoking history, to identify high-risk individuals. Predictive models using electronic health records (EHRs), which capture large-scale longitudinal patient-level health information, may provide a more effective tool for identifying high-risk groups by detecting subtle prediagnostic signals of cancer. Recent advances in large language and foundation models have further expanded this potential, yet evidence remains limited on how useful HER-based models are compared with traditional risk factors currently used in screening guidelines. We systematically evaluated the clinical utility of EHR-based predictive models against traditional risk factors, including gene mutations and family history of cancer, for identifying high-risk individuals across eight major cancers (breast, lung, colorectal, prostate, ovarian, liver, pancreatic, and stomach), using data from the All of Us Research Program, which integrates EHR, genomic, and survey data from over 865,000 participants. Even with a baseline modeling approach, EHR-based models achieved a 3- to 6-fold higher enrichment of true cancer cases among individuals identified as high risk compared with traditional risk factors alone, whether used as a standalone or complementary tool. The EHR foundation model, a state-of-the-art approach trained on comprehensive patient trajectories, further improved predictive performance across 26 cancer types, demonstrating the clinical potential of EHR-based predictive modeling to support more precise and scalable early detection strategies.

Comment: 35 pages, 8 figures, methodological work on possible methods of analysis of experimental data from biophoton experiments

Abstract:
Ultra-weak photon emission (UPE) from living systems is widely hypothesized to reflect un-derlying self-organization and long-range coordination in biological dynamics. However, distin-guishing biologically driven correlations from trivial stochastic or instrumental effects requires a robust, multi-method framework. In this work, we establish and benchmark a comprehensive anal-ysis pipeline for photon-count time series, combining Distribution Entropy Analysis, Rényi entro-py, Detrended Fluctuation Analysis, its generalization Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis, and tail-statistics characterization. Surrogate signals constructed from Poisson processes, Fractional Gaussian Noise, and Renewal Processes with power-law waiting times are used to validate sensitivity to memory, intermittency, and multifractality. Across all methods, a coherent hierarchy of dynamical regimes is recovered, demonstrating internal methodological consistency. Application to experimental dark-count data and attenuated coherent-laser emission confirm Poisson-like behavior, establishing an essential statistical baseline for UPE studies. The combined results show that this multi-resolution approach reliably separates trivial photon-counting statistics from struc-tured long-range organization, providing a validated methodological foundation for future biological UPE measurements and their interpretation in the context of non-equilibrium statistical physics, information dynamics, and prospective markers of biological coherence.

Abstract:
Molecular property prediction is fundamental to chemical engineering applications such as solvent screening. We present Socrates-Mol, a framework that transforms language models into empirical Bayesian reasoners through context engineering, addressing cold start problems without model fine-tuning. The system implements a reflective-prediction cycle where initial outputs serve as priors, retrieved molecular cases provide evidence, and refined predictions form posteriors, extracting reusable chemical rules from sparse data. We introduce ranking tasks aligned with industrial screening priorities and employ cross-model self-consistency across five language models to reduce variance. Experiments on amine solvent LogP prediction reveal task-dependent patterns: regression achieves 72% MAE reduction and 112% R-squared improvement through self-consistency, while ranking tasks show limited gains due to systematic multi-model biases. The framework reduces deployment costs by over 70% compared to full fine-tuning, providing a scalable solution for molecular property prediction while elucidating the task-adaptive nature of self-consistency mechanisms.

Abstract:
Protein structure is central to biological function, and enabling multimodal protein models requires joint reasoning over sequence, structure, and function. A key barrier is the lack of principled protein structure tokenizers (PSTs): existing approaches fix token size or rely on continuous vector codebooks, limiting interpretability, multi-scale control, and transfer across architectures. We introduce GeoBPE, a geometry-grounded PST that transforms continuous, noisy, multi-scale backbone conformations into discrete ``sentences'' of geometry while enforcing global constraints. Analogous to byte-pair encoding, GeoBPE generates a hierarchical vocabulary of geometric primitives by iteratively (i) clustering Geo-Pair occurrences with k-medoids to yield a resolution-controllable vocabulary; (ii) quantizing each Geo-Pair to its closest medoid prototype; and (iii) reducing drift through differentiable inverse kinematics that optimizes boundary glue angles under an $\mathrm{SE}(3)$ end-frame loss. GeoBPE offers compression ($>$10x reduction in bits-per-residue at similar distortion rate), data efficiency ($>$10x less training data), and generalization (maintains test/train distortion ratio of $1.0-1.1$). It is architecture-agnostic: (a) its hierarchical vocabulary provides a strong inductive bias for coarsening residue-level embeddings from large PLMs into motif- and protein-level representations, consistently outperforming leading PSTs across $12$ tasks and $24$ test splits; (b) paired with a transformer, GeoBPE supports unconditional backbone generation via language modeling; and (c) tokens align with CATH functional families and support expert-interpretable case studies, offering functional meaning absent in prior PSTs.

Abstract:
Histopathologists establish cancer grade by assessing histological structures, such as glands in prostate cancer. Yet, digital pathology pipelines often rely on grid-based tiling that ignores tissue architecture. This introduces irrelevant information and limits interpretability. We introduce histology-informed tiling (HIT), which uses semantic segmentation to extract glands from whole slide images (WSIs) as biologically meaningful input patches for multiple-instance learning (MIL) and phenotyping. Trained on 137 samples from the ProMPT cohort, HIT achieved a gland-level Dice score of 0.83 +/- 0.17. By extracting 380,000 glands from 760 WSIs across ICGC-C and TCGA-PRAD cohorts, HIT improved MIL models AUCs by 10% for detecting copy number variation (CNVs) in genes related to epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMT) and MYC, and revealed 15 gland clusters, several of which were associated with cancer relapse, oncogenic mutations, and high Gleason. Therefore, HIT improved the accuracy and interpretability of MIL predictions, while streamlining computations by focussing on biologically meaningful structures during feature extraction.

Abstract:
Accurate exploration of protein conformational ensembles is essential for uncovering function but remains hard because molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations suffer from high computational costs and energy-barrier trapping. This paper presents Energy Preference Optimization (EPO), an online refinement algorithm that turns a pretrained protein ensemble generator into an energy-aware sampler without extra MD trajectories. Specifically, EPO leverages stochastic differential equation sampling to explore the conformational landscape and incorporates a novel energy-ranking mechanism based on list-wise preference optimization. Crucially, EPO introduces a practical upper bound to efficiently approximate the intractable probability of long sampling trajectories in continuous-time generative models, making it easily adaptable to existing pretrained generators. On Tetrapeptides, ATLAS, and Fast-Folding benchmarks, EPO successfully generates diverse and physically realistic ensembles, establishing a new state-of-the-art in nine evaluation metrics. These results demonstrate that energy-only preference signals can efficiently steer generative models toward thermodynamically consistent conformational ensembles, providing an alternative to long MD simulations and widening the applicability of learned potentials in structural biology and drug discovery.

Abstract:
Codon usage bias has a crucial impact on the translation efficiency and co-translational folding of proteins, necessitating the algorithmic development of codon optimization/harmonization methods, particularly for heterologous recombinant protein expression. Codon harmonization is especially valuable for proteins sensitive to translation rates, because it can potentially replicate native translation speeds, preserving proper folding and maintaining protein activity. This work proposes a Monte Carlo-based codon harmonization algorithm, MOSAIC (Monte Carlo-based Simulated Annealing for Linked Codons), for the harmonization of a set of linked codons, which differs from conventional codon harmonization, by focusing on the codon sets rather than individual ones. Our MOSAIC demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on ribosomal proteins (S18, S15, S10, and L11) as model systems. Among them, the harmonized gene of RP S18 was expressed and compared with the expression of the wild-type gene. The harmonized gene clearly yielded a larger quantity of the protein, from which the amount of the soluble protein was also significant. These results underscore the potential of the linked codon harmonization approach to enhance the expression and functionality of sensitive proteins, setting the stage for more efficient production of recombinant proteins in various biotechnological and pharmaceutical applications.

Abstract:
Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming various domains, including biomedicine and healthcare, and demonstrate remarkable potential from scientific research to new drug discovery. Graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, as a useful application of LLMs, can improve contextual reasoning through structured entity and relationship identification from long-context knowledge, e.g. biomedical literature. Even though many advantages over naive RAGs, most of graph-based RAGs are computationally intensive, which limits their application to large-scale dataset. To address this issue, we introduce fastbmRAG, an fast graph-based RAG optimized for biomedical literature. Utilizing well organized structure of biomedical papers, fastbmRAG divides the construction of knowledge graph into two stages, first drafting graphs using abstracts; and second, refining them using main texts guided by vector-based entity linking, which minimizes redundancy and computational load. Our evaluations demonstrate that fastbmRAG is over 10x faster than existing graph-RAG tools and achieve superior coverage and accuracy to input knowledge. FastbmRAG provides a fast solution for quickly understanding, summarizing, and answering questions about biomedical literature on a large scale. FastbmRAG is public available in https://github.com/menggf/fastbmRAG.

Comment: Preprint submitted to Medical Image Analysis (MedIA)

Abstract:
The sharp rise in medical tomography examinations has created a demand for automated systems that can reliably extract informative features for downstream tasks such as tumor characterization. Although 3D volumes contain richer information than individual slices, effective 3D classification remains difficult: volumetric data encode complex spatial dependencies, and the scarcity of large-scale 3D datasets has constrained progress toward 3D foundation models. As a result, many recent approaches rely on 2D vision foundation models trained on natural images, repurposing them as feature extractors for medical scans with surprisingly strong performance. Despite their practical success, current methods that apply 2D foundation models to 3D scans via slice-based decomposition remain fundamentally limited. Standard slicing along axial, sagittal, and coronal planes often fails to capture the true spatial extent of a structure when its orientation does not align with these canonical views. More critically, most approaches aggregate slice features independently, ignoring the underlying 3D geometry and losing spatial coherence across slices. To overcome these limitations, we propose TomoGraphView, a novel framework that integrates omnidirectional volume slicing with spherical graph-based feature aggregation. Instead of restricting the model to axial, sagittal, or coronal planes, our method samples both canonical and non-canonical cross-sections generated from uniformly distributed points on a sphere enclosing the volume. We publicly share our accessible code base at http://github.com/compai-lab/2025-MedIA-kiechle and provide a user-friendly library for omnidirectional volume slicing at https://pypi.org/project/OmniSlicer.

Abstract:
Medical image segmentation using deep learning (DL) has enabled the development of automated analysis pipelines for large-scale population studies. However, state-of-the-art DL methods are prone to hallucinations, which can result in anatomically implausible segmentations. With manual correction impractical at scale, automated quality control (QC) techniques have to address the challenge. While promising, existing QC methods are organ-specific, limiting their generalizability and usability beyond their original intended task. To overcome this limitation, we propose no-new Quality Control (nnQC), a robust QC framework based on a diffusion-generative paradigm that self-adapts to any input organ dataset. Central to nnQC is a novel Team of Experts (ToE) architecture, where two specialized experts independently encode 3D spatial awareness, represented by the relative spatial position of an axial slice, and anatomical information derived from visual features from the original image. A weighted conditional module dynamically combines the pair of independent embeddings, or opinions to condition the sampling mechanism within a diffusion process, enabling the generation of a spatially aware pseudo-ground truth for predicting QC scores. Within its framework, nnQC integrates fingerprint adaptation to ensure adaptability across organs, datasets, and imaging modalities. We evaluated nnQC on seven organs using twelve publicly available datasets. Our results demonstrate that nnQC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all experiments, including cases where segmentation masks are highly degraded or completely missing, confirming its versatility and effectiveness across different organs.

Abstract:
Diffusion-based models have recently enabled the generation of realistic and diverse protein structures, yet they remain limited in their ability to steer outcomes toward specific functional or biochemical objectives, such as binding affinity or sequence composition. Here we extend the Feynman-Kac (FK) steering framework, an inference-time control approach, to diffusion-based protein design. By coupling FK steering with structure generation, the method guides sampling toward desirable structural or energetic features while maintaining the diversity of the underlying diffusion process. To enable simultaneous generation of both sequence and structure properties, rewards are computed on models refined through ProteinMPNN and all-atom relaxation. Applied to binder design, FK steering consistently improves predicted interface energetics across diverse targets with minimal computational overhead. More broadly, this work demonstrates that inference-time FK control generalizes diffusion-based protein design to arbitrary, non-differentiable, and reward-agnostic objectives, providing a unified and model-independent framework for guided molecular generation.

Abstract:
Ratios of common biomarkers and blood analytes are well established for early detection and predictive purposes. Early risk stratification in critical care is often limited by the delayed availability of complex severity scores. Complete blood count (CBC) parameters, available within hours of admission, may enable rapid prognostication. We conducted an exhaustive and systematic evaluation of CBC-derived ratios for mortality prediction to identify robust, accessible, and generalizable biomarkers. We generated all feasible two-parameter CBC ratios with unit checks and plausibility filters on more than 90,000 ICU admissions (MIMIC-IV). Discrimination was assessed via cross-validated and external AUC, calibration via isotonic regression, and clinical utility with decision-curve analysis. Retrospective validation was performed on eICU-CRD (n = 156530) participants. The ratio of Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW) to Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration (MCHC), denoted RDW:MCHC, emerged as the top biomarker (AUC = 0.699 discovery; 0.662 validation), outperforming RDW and NLR. It achieved near-universal availability (99.9\% vs.\ 35.0\% for NLR), excellent calibration (Hosmer--Lemeshow $p = 1.0$; $\mathrm{ECE} < 0.001$), and preserved performance across diagnostic groups, with only modest attenuation in respiratory cases. Expressed as a logistic odds ratio, each one standard deviation increase in RDW:MCHC nearly quadrupled 30-day mortality odds (OR = 3.81, 95\% CI [3.70, 3.95]). Decision-curve analysis showed positive net benefit at high-risk triage thresholds. A simple, widely available CBC-derived feature (RDW:MCHC) provides consistent, externally validated signal for early mortality risk. While not a substitute for multivariable scores, it offers a pragmatic adjunct for rapid triage when full scoring is impractical.

Abstract:
Radiology is essential to modern healthcare, yet rising demand and staffing shortages continue to pose major challenges. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have the potential to support radiologists and help address these challenges. Given its widespread use and clinical importance, chest X-ray classification is well suited to augment radiologists' workflows. However, most existing approaches rely solely on single-view, image-level inputs, ignoring the structured clinical information and multi-image studies available at the time of reporting. In this work, we introduce CaMCheX, a multimodal transformer-based framework that aligns multi-view chest X-ray studies with structured clinical data to better reflect how clinicians make diagnostic decisions. Our architecture employs view-specific ConvNeXt encoders for frontal and lateral chest radiographs, whose features are fused with clinical indications, history, and vital signs using a transformer fusion module. This design enables the model to generate context-aware representations that mirror reasoning in clinical practice. Our results exceed the state of the art for both the original MIMIC-CXR dataset and the more recent CXR-LT benchmarks, highlighting the value of clinically grounded multimodal alignment for advancing chest X-ray classification.

Abstract:
Quantifying the irreversibility and dissipation of non-equilibrium processes is crucial to understanding their behavior, assessing their possible capabilities, and characterizing their efficiency. We introduce a physical quantity that quantifies the irreversibility of stochastic Langevin systems from the observation of individual molecules' displacements. Categorizing these displacements into a few groups based on their initial and final position allows us to measure irreversibility precisely without the need to know the forces and magnitude of the fluctuations acting on the system. Our model-free estimate of irreversibility is related to entropy production by a conditional fluctuation theorem and provides a lower bound to the average entropy production. We validate the method on single-molecule force spectroscopy experiments of proteins subject to force ramps. We show that irreversibility is sensitive to detailed features of the energy landscape underlying the protein folding dynamics and suggest how our methods can be employed to unveil key properties of protein folding processes.

Abstract:
Variants of Uncertain Significance (VUS) limit the clinical utility of prostate cancer genomics by delaying diagnosis and therapy when evidence for pathogenicity or benignity is incomplete. Progress is further limited by inconsistent annotations across sources and the absence of a prostate-specific benchmark for fair comparison. We introduce Prostate-VarBench, a curated pipeline for creating prostate-specific benchmarks that integrates COSMIC (somatic cancer mutations), ClinVar (expert-curated clinical variants), and TCGA-PRAD (prostate tumor genomics from The Cancer Genome Atlas) into a harmonized dataset of 193,278 variants supporting patient- or gene-aware splits to prevent data leakage. To ensure data integrity, we corrected a Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) issue that merged multiple transcript records, introducing ambiguity in clinical significance fields. We then standardized 56 interpretable features across eight clinically relevant tiers, including population frequency, variant type, and clinical context. AlphaMissense pathogenicity scores were incorporated to enhance missense variant classification and reduce VUS uncertainty. Building on this resource, we trained an interpretable TabNet model to classify variant pathogenicity, whose step-wise sparse masks provide per-case rationales consistent with molecular tumor board review practices. On the held-out test set, the model achieved 89.9% accuracy with balanced class metrics, and the VEP correction yields an 6.5% absolute reduction in VUS.

Abstract:
Healthcare data are generated in many different formats, which makes it difficult to integrate and reuse across institutions and studies. Standardisation is required to enable consistent large-scale analysis. The OMOP-CDM, developed by the OHDSI community, provides one widely adopted standard. Our framework achieves schema-agnostic transformation by extending upon existing literature in using human-readable YAML specification to support both relational (Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL)) and document-based (MongoDB) data sources. It also incorporates critical production readiness features: provenance-aware mapping and support for incremental updates. We validated the pipeline using 2.7 million patient records and 27 million encounters across six hospitals spanning two decades of records. The resulting OMOP-CDM dataset demonstrated an acceptable level of data quality with a 97% overall passing rate based on the OHDSI Data Quality Dashboard check.

Abstract:
Background: Identifying new indications for approved drugs is a complex and time-consuming process that requires extensive knowledge of pharmacology, clinical data, and advanced computational methods. Recently, deep learning (DL) methods have shown their capability for the accurate prediction of drug repositioning. However, implementing DL-based modeling requires in-depth domain knowledge and proficient programming skills. Results: In this application, we introduce DeepDR, the first integrated platform that combines a variety of established DL-based models for disease- and target-specific drug repositioning tasks. DeepDR leverages invaluable experience to recommend candidate drugs, which covers more than 15 networks and a comprehensive knowledge graph that includes 5.9 million edges across 107 types of relationships connecting drugs, diseases, proteins/genes, pathways, and expression from six existing databases and a large scientific corpus of 24 million PubMed publications. Additionally, the recommended results include detailed descriptions of the recommended drugs and visualize key patterns with interpretability through a knowledge graph. Conclusion: DeepDR is free and open to all users without the requirement of registration. We believe it can provide an easy-to-use, systematic, highly accurate, and computationally automated platform for both experimental and computational scientists.

Abstract:
We introduce HAMscope, a compact, snapshot hyperspectral autofluorescence miniscope that enables real-time, label-free molecular imaging in a wide range of biological systems. By integrating a thin polymer diffuser into a widefield miniscope, HAMscope spectrally encodes each frame and employs a probabilistic deep learning framework to reconstruct 30-channel hyperspectral stacks (452 to 703 nm) or directly infer molecular composition maps from single images. A scalable multi-pass U-Net architecture with transformer-based attention and per-pixel uncertainty estimation enables high spatio-spectral fidelity (mean absolute error ~ 0.0048) at video rates. While initially demonstrated in plant systems, including lignin, chlorophyll, and suberin imaging in intact poplar and cork tissues, the platform is readily adaptable to other applications such as neural activity mapping, metabolic profiling, and histopathology. We show that the system generalizes to out-of-distribution tissue types and supports direct molecular mapping without the need for spectral unmixing. HAMscope establishes a general framework for compact, uncertainty-aware spectral imaging that combines minimal optics with advanced deep learning, offering broad utility for real-time biochemical imaging across neuroscience, environmental monitoring, and biomedicine.

Abstract:
For many taxonomic groups, online biodiversity portals used by naturalists and citizen scientists constitute the primary source of distributional information. Over the last decade, site-occupancy models have been advanced as a promising framework to analyse such loosely structured, opportunistically collected datasets. Current approaches often ignore important aspects of the detection process and do not fully capitalise on the information present in these datasets, leaving opportunities for fine-grained spatiotemporal backcasting untouched. We propose a flexible Bayesian spatiotemporal site-occupancy model that aims to mimic the data-generating process that underlies common citizen science datasets sourced from public biodiversity portals, and yields rich biological output. We illustrate the use of the model to a dataset containing over 3M butterfly records in Belgium, collected through the citizen science data portal Observations.be. We show that the proposed approach enables retrospective predictions on the occupancy of species through time and space at high resolution, as well as inference on inter-annual distributional trends, range dynamics, habitat preferences, phenological patterns, detection patterns and observer heterogeneity. The proposed model can be used to increase the value of opportunistically collected data by naturalists and citizen scientists, and can aid the understanding of spatiotemporal dynamics of species for which rigorously collected data are absent or too costly to collect.

Abstract:
Microbial consortia offer significant biotechnological advantages over monocultures for bioproduction. However, industrial deployment is hampered by the lack of scalable architectures to ensure stable coexistence between populations. Existing strategies rely on genetic modifications, which impose metabolic load, or environmental changes, which can reduce production. We present a versatile control architecture to regulate density and composition of a two-strain consortium without genetic engineering or drastic environmental changes. Our bioreactor-based control architecture comprises a mixing chamber where both strains are co-cultured and a reservoir sustaining the slower-growing strain. For both chambers we develop model-based and sim-to-real learning controllers. The control architecture is then validated in vivo on a two-strain Escherichia coli consortium, achieving precise and robust regulation of consortium density and composition, including tracking of time-varying references and recovery from perturbations.

Abstract:
Spatial transcriptomics (ST) measures gene expression at a set of spatial locations in a tissue. Communities of nearby cells that express similar genes form \textit{spatial domains}. Specialized ST clustering algorithms have been developed to identify these spatial domains. These methods often identify spatial domains at a single morphological scale, and interactions across multiple scales are often overlooked. For example, large cellular communities often contain smaller substructures, and heterogeneous frontier regions often lie between homogeneous domains. Topological data analysis (TDA) is an emerging mathematical toolkit that studies the underlying features of data at various geometric scales. It is especially useful for analyzing complex biological datasets with multiscale characteristics. Using TDA, we develop Persistent Homology for Domains at Multiple Scales (PHD-MS) to locate tissue structures that persist across morphological scales. We apply PHD-MS to highlight multiscale spatial domains in several tissue types and ST technologies. We also compare PHD-MS domains against ground-truth domains in expert-annotated tissues, where PHD-MS outperforms traditional clustering approaches. PHD-MS is available as an open-source software package with an interactive graphical user interface for exploring the identified multiscale domains.

Abstract:
Despite growing reference libraries and advanced computational tools, progress in the field of metabolomics remains constrained by low rates of annotating measured spectra. The recent developments of large language models (LLMs) have led to strong performance across a wide range of generation and reasoning tasks, spurring increased interest in LLMs' application to domain-specific scientific challenges, such as mass spectra annotation. Here, we present a novel framework, General Intelligence-based Fragmentation (GIF), that guides pretrained LLMs through spectra simulation using structured prompting and reasoning. GIF utilizes tagging, structured inputs/outputs, system prompts, instruction-based prompts, and iterative refinement. Indeed, GIF offers a structured alternative to ad hoc prompting, underscoring the need for systematic guidance of LLMs on complex scientific tasks. Using GIF, we evaluate current generalist LLMs' ability to use reasoning towards fragmentation and to perform intensity prediction after fine-tuning. We benchmark performance on a novel QA dataset, the MassSpecGym QA-sim dataset, that we derive from the MassSpecGym dataset. Through these implementations of GIF, we find that GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini achieve a cosine similarity of 0.36 and 0.35 between the simulated and true spectra, respectively, outperforming other pretrained models including GPT-5, Llama-3.1, and ChemDFM, despite GPT-5's recency and ChemDFM's domain specialization. GIF outperforms several deep learning baselines. Our evaluation of GIF highlights the value of using LLMs not only for spectra simulation but for enabling human-in-the-loop workflows and structured, explainable reasoning in molecular fragmentation.

Abstract:
Prompt-driven vision foundation models, such as the Segment Anything Model, have recently demonstrated remarkable adaptability in computer vision. However, their direct application to medical imaging remains challenging due to heterogeneous tissue structures, imaging artefacts, and low-contrast boundaries, particularly in tumours and cancer primaries leading to suboptimal segmentation in ambiguous or overlapping lesion regions. Here, we present Segment Any Tumour 3D (SAT3D), a lightweight volumetric foundation model designed to enable robust and generalisable tumour segmentation across diverse medical imaging modalities. SAT3D integrates a shifted-window vision transformer for hierarchical volumetric representation with an uncertainty-aware training pipeline that explicitly incorporates uncertainty estimates as prompts to guide reliable boundary prediction in low-contrast regions. Adversarial learning further enhances model performance for the ambiguous pathological regions. We benchmark SAT3D against three recent vision foundation models and nnUNet across 11 publicly available datasets, encompassing 3,884 tumour and cancer cases for training and 694 cases for in-distribution evaluation. Trained on 17,075 3D volume-mask pairs across multiple modalities and cancer primaries, SAT3D demonstrates strong generalisation and robustness. To facilitate practical use and clinical translation, we developed a 3D Slicer plugin that enables interactive, prompt-driven segmentation and visualisation using the trained SAT3D model. Extensive experiments highlight its effectiveness in improving segmentation accuracy under challenging and out-of-distribution scenarios, underscoring its potential as a scalable foundation model for medical image analysis.

Abstract:
Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy represents a paradigm shift in cancer treatment, yet development timelines of 8-12 years and clinical attrition rates exceeding 40-60% highlight critical inefficiencies in target selection, safety assessment, and molecular optimization. We present Bio AI Agent, a multi-agent artificial intelligence system powered by large language models that enables autonomous CAR-T development through collaborative specialized agents. The system comprises six autonomous agents: Target Selection Agent for multi-parametric antigen prioritization across >10,000 cancer-associated targets, Toxicity Prediction Agent for comprehensive safety profiling integrating tissue expression atlases and pharmacovigilance databases, Molecular Design Agent for rational CAR engineering, Patent Intelligence Agent for freedom-to-operate analysis, Clinical Translation Agent for regulatory compliance, and Decision Orchestration Agent for multi-agent coordination. Retrospective validation demonstrated autonomous identification of high-risk targets including FcRH5 (hepatotoxicity) and CD229 (off-tumor toxicity), patent infringement risks for CD38+SLAMF7 combinations, and generation of comprehensive development roadmaps. By enabling parallel processing, specialized reasoning, and autonomous decision-making superior to monolithic AI systems, Bio AI Agent addresses critical gaps in precision oncology development and has potential to accelerate translation of next-generation immunotherapies from discovery to clinic.

Abstract:
Markerless motion tracking has advanced rapidly in the past 10 years and currently offers powerful opportunities for behavioural, clinical, and biomechanical research. While several specialised toolkits provide high performance for specific tasks, using existing tools still requires substantial technical expertise. There remains a gap in accessible, integrated solutions that deliver sufficient tracking for non-experts across diverse settings.   TrackStudio was developed to address this gap by combining established open-source tools into a single, modular, GUI-based pipeline that works out of the box. It provides automatic 2D and 3D tracking, calibration, preprocessing, feature extraction, and visualisation without requiring any programming skills. We supply a user guide with practical advice for video acquisition, synchronisation, and setup, alongside documentation of common pitfalls and how to avoid them.   To validate the toolkit, we tested its performance across three environments using either low-cost webcams or high-resolution cameras, including challenging conditions for body position, lightning, and space and obstructions. Across 76 participants, average inter-frame correlations exceeded 0.98 and average triangulation errors remained low (<13.6mm for hand tracking), demonstrating stable and consistent tracking. We further show that the same pipeline can be extended beyond hand tracking to other body and face regions. TrackStudio provides a practical, accessible route into markerless tracking for researchers or laypeople who need reliable performance without specialist expertise.

Abstract:
Many proteins useful in modern medicine or bioengineering are challenging to make in the lab, fuse with other proteins in cells, or deliver to tissues in the body, because their sequences are too long. Shortening these sequences typically involves costly, time-consuming experimental campaigns. Ideally, we could instead use modern models of massive databases of sequences from nature to learn how to propose shrunken proteins that resemble sequences found in nature. Unfortunately, these models struggle to efficiently search the combinatorial space of all deletions, and are not trained with inductive biases to learn how to delete. To address this gap, we propose SCISOR, a novel discrete diffusion model that deletes letters from sequences to generate protein samples that resemble those found in nature. To do so, SCISOR trains a de-noiser to reverse a forward noising process that adds random insertions to natural sequences. As a generative model, SCISOR fits evolutionary sequence data competitively with previous large models. In evaluation, SCISOR achieves state-of-the-art predictions of the functional effects of deletions on ProteinGym. Finally, we use the SCISOR de-noiser to shrink long protein sequences, and show that its suggested deletions result in significantly more realistic proteins and more often preserve functional motifs than previous models of evolutionary sequences.

Abstract:
The human brain is a complex system defined by multi-way, higher-order interactions invisible to traditional pairwise network models. Although a diverse array of analytical methods has been developed to address this shortcoming, the field remains fragmented, lacking a unifying conceptual framework that integrates and organizes the rapidly expanding methodological landscape of higher-order brain connectivity. This review provides a synthesis of the methodologies for studying higher-order brain connectivity. We propose a fundamental distinction between implicit paradigms, which quantify the statistical strength of group interactions, and explicit paradigms, which construct higher-order structural representations like hypergraphs and topological data analysis. We trace the evolution of each approach, from early Correlation-of-Correlations and information-theoretic concepts of synergy/redundancy, to the edge-centric paradigm and advanced topological methods. Through a critical analysis of conceptual, statistical, and computational challenges, we argue that the future of the field lies not in a single best method, but in a principled integration of these complementary approaches. This manuscript aims to provide a unified map and a critical perspective to guide researchers toward a robust and insightful understanding of the brain's complex, multi-level architecture.

Abstract:
Functional connectivity has been widely investigated to understand brain disease in clinical studies and imaging-based neuroscience, and analyzing changes in functional connectivity has proven to be valuable for understanding and computationally evaluating the effects on brain function caused by diseases or experimental stimuli. By using Mahalanobis data whitening prior to the use of dimensionality reduction algorithms, we are able to distill meaningful information from fMRI signals about subjects and the experimental stimuli used to prompt them. Furthermore, we offer an interpretation of Mahalanobis whitening as a two-stage de-individualization of data which is motivated by similarity as captured by the Bures distance, which is connected to quantum mechanics. These methods have potential to aid discoveries about the mechanisms that link brain function with cognition and behavior and may improve the accuracy and consistency of Alzheimer's diagnosis, especially in the preclinical stage of disease progression.

Abstract:
Purpose: Since its initial release, the aim of Biodose Tools was to offer an easy-to-use platform to perform the mathematical calculations needed in biological dosimetry. This update 3.7.1, mainly focuses on new features related to large-scale emergency responses, like criticality accidents dose estimation and laboratory networks. Material and Methods: Biodose Tools has been developed using the R programming language. The current version (3.7.1) uses the same external dependencies as version 3.6.1 (released November 2022) while integrating three new external packages to support the new functionalities. Results: Version 3.7.1 introduces different new modules: (a) a characteristic limits module that calculates decision thresholds and detection limits following ISO19238:2023 standards, and offers statistical tests to compare rates between suspected exposure cases and control data; (b) an enhanced dose estimation module which supports multiple dose assessments for dicentric and translocation assays for various exposure scenarios (acute, protracted, and highly protracted) as well as whole and partial-body exposures; (c) a criticality accidents module for multiple dose estimations using dicentrics in mixed gamma-neutron exposure scenarios (e.g., nuclear detonations); and (d) an Interlaboratory comparison module that automates the evaluation and comparison of dose estimates across laboratories. Conclusions: Biodose Tools (biodosetools.reneb.bfs.de) continues to evolve in response to the dynamic needs of the biological dosimetry community, contributing to the preparedness and consistency in emergency response and routine applications.

Abstract:
In biological cells, DNA replication is carried out by the replisome, a protein complex encompassing multiple DNA polymerases. DNA replication is semi-discontinuous: a DNA polymerase synthesizes one (leading) strand of the DNA continuously, and another polymerase synthesizes the other (lagging) strand discontinuously. Complex dynamics of the lagging-strand polymerase within the replisome result in the formation of short interim fragments, known as Okazaki fragments, and gaps between them. Although the semi-discontinuous replication is ubiquitous, a detailed characterization of it remains elusive. In this work, we develop a framework to investigate the semi-discontinuous replication by incorporating stochastic dynamics of the lagging-strand polymerase. Computing the size distribution of Okazaki fragments and gaps, we uncover the significance of the polymerase dissociation in shaping them. We apply the method to the previous experiment on the T4 bacteriophage replication system and identify the key parameters governing the polymerase dynamics. These results reveal that the collisions of lagging-strand polymerase with pre-synthesised Okazaki fragments primarily trigger its dissociation from the lagging strand.

Abstract:
Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) remain a major source of preventable harm, and many clinically important mechanisms are still unknown. Existing models either rely on pharmacologic knowledge graphs (KGs), which fail on unseen drugs, or on electronic health records (EHRs), which are noisy, temporal, and site-dependent. We introduce, to our knowledge, the first system that conditions KG relation scoring on patient-level EHR context and distills that reasoning into an EHR-only model for zero-shot inference. A fusion "Teacher" learns mechanism-specific relations for drug pairs represented in both sources, while a distilled "Student" generalizes to new or rarely used drugs without KG access at inference. Both operate under a shared ontology (set) of pharmacologic mechanisms (drug relations) to produce interpretable, auditable alerts rather than opaque risk scores. Trained on a multi-institution EHR corpus paired with a curated DrugBank DDI graph, and evaluated using a clinically aligned, decision-focused protocol with leakage-safe negatives that avoid artificially easy pairs, the system maintains precision across multi-institutuion test data, produces mechanism-specific, clinically consistent predictions, reduces false alerts (higher precision) at comparable overall detection performance (F1), and misses fewer true interactions compared to prior methods. Case studies further show zero-shot identification of clinically recognized CYP-mediated and pharmacodynamic mechanisms for drugs absent from the KG, supporting real-world use in clinical decision support and pharmacovigilance.

Abstract:
Understanding the growth and form of shapes is one of the most fundamental problems in biology. While many prior works have analyzed the beak shapes of Darwin's finches, other cranial features are relatively less explored. In this work, we develop geometric and statistical methods for analyzing the skull morphology of Darwin's finches and their relatives, focusing on the relationship between their skull dimensions, orbit curvature, and neurocranial geometries. Specifically, by utilizing tools in computational geometry, differential geometry, and numerical optimization, we develop efficient algorithms for quantifying various key geometric features of the skull. We then perform a statistical analysis and discover a strong correlation between skull size and orbit curvature. Based on our findings, we further establish a predictive model that can estimate the orbit curvature using easily obtainable linear skull measurements. Our results show that the predictive model is highly effective and is capable of explaining 85.48\% of the variance (R-squared) in curvature with an average prediction error of only 6.35\%. Altogether, our work provides a quantitative foundation for understanding the functional and evolutionary pressures that shape avian skulls, thereby offering a validated framework for future studies in comparative anatomy and evolutionary biology.

Abstract:
Drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction is of great significance for drug discovery and drug repurposing. With the accumulation of a large volume of valuable data, data-driven methods have been increasingly harnessed to predict DTIs, reducing costs across various dimensions. Therefore, this paper proposes a $\textbf{L}$arge $\textbf{L}$anguage $\textbf{M}$odel and $\textbf{M}$ulti-$\textbf{M}$odel data co-powered $\textbf{D}$rug $\textbf{T}$arget $\textbf{I}$nteraction prediction framework, named LLM$^3$-DTI. LLM$^3$-DTI constructs multi-modal data embedding to enhance DTI prediction performance. In this framework, the text semantic embeddings of drugs and targets are encoded by a domain-specific LLM. To effectively align and fuse multi-modal embedding. We propose the dual cross-attention mechanism and the TSFusion module. Finally, these multi-modal data are utilized for the DTI task through an output network. The experimental results indicate that LLM$^3$-DTI can proficiently identify validated DTIs, surpassing the performance of the models employed for comparison across diverse scenarios. Consequently, LLM$^3$-DTI is adept at fulfilling the task of DTI prediction with excellence. The data and code are available at https://github.com/chaser-gua/LLM3DTI.

Abstract:
Forces transmitted by bones are routinely studied in human biomechanics, but it is challenging to measure them non-invasively, especially outside of the laboratory setting. We introduce a technique for non-invasive, in vivo measurement of tibial compression force using flexural waves propagating in the tibia. Modeling the tibia as an axially compressed Euler-Bernoulli beam, we show that tibial flexural waves have load-dependent frequency spectra. Specifically, under physiological conditions, peak locations in the acceleration amplitude spectrum shift linearly with the compression force on the tibia, and may be used as proxy force measure. We test the validity of this technique using a proof-of-principle wearable system that generates flexural waves via a skin-mounted mechanical transducer and measures the spectra of these waves using a skin-mounted accelerometer. In agreement with beam theory, data from three participants demonstrate linear relationships between tibial compression force and peak frequency location with Pearson correlation coefficients $r=0.88$--$0.97$ for medial-lateral swaying and $r=0.88$--$0.95$ for walking trials. Our flexural wave-based technique could give rise to a new class of wearable sensors for non-invasive physiological load monitoring and measurement, impacting research in human locomotion, sports medicine, and prosthetic design.

Here we analyse cross-sectional data on 300 million laboratory tests from more than a million women in two population-scale cohorts (Israel-Clalit and US-NHANES). We apply a deconvolution algorithm inspired by astronomical image "de-blurring" to align each test to time-from-FMP rather than chronological age. Nearly every assay - spanning endocrine, bone, hepatic, lipid, osmolality, inflammatory and muscular systems - exhibits a jump at FMP that is absent in males and highly concordant between cohorts. Jumps were largest in the sex hormones, followed by bone, toxins, red blood cells, liver, iron, lipids, kidney, and muscle. Changes are mostly detrimental except iron indices and anemia that improve post-menopause, and depression scores that spike only transiently. Hormone-replacement therapy attenuates many of the step-like changes. Sex hormone dysregulation occurs more than 10 years prior to FMP. These findings reveal the step-like dysregulation across physiology caused by loss of sex hormones and establish deconvolution as a general strategy for disentangling age-related transitions in large, noisy datasets.

Abstract:
Accurate prediction of protein-ligand binding affinity plays a pivotal role in accelerating the discovery of novel drugs and vaccines, particularly for gastrointestinal (GI) diseases such as gastric ulcers, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis. Traditional computational models often rely on structural information alone and thus fail to capture the genetic determinants that influence disease mechanisms and therapeutic responses. To address this gap, we propose GastroDL-Fusion, a dual-modal deep learning framework that integrates protein-ligand complex data with disease-associated gene sequence information for drug and vaccine development. In our approach, protein-ligand complexes are represented as molecular graphs and modeled using a Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN), while gene sequences are encoded into biologically meaningful embeddings via a pre-trained Transformer (ProtBERT/ESM). These complementary modalities are fused through a multi-layer perceptron to enable robust cross-modal interaction learning. We evaluate the model on benchmark datasets of GI disease-related targets, demonstrating that GastroDL-Fusion significantly improves predictive performance over conventional methods. Specifically, the model achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.12 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.75, outperforming CNN, BiLSTM, GIN, and Transformer-only baselines. These results confirm that incorporating both structural and genetic features yields more accurate predictions of binding affinities, providing a reliable computational tool for accelerating the design of targeted therapies and vaccines in the context of gastrointestinal diseases.

Abstract:
The NIH Human BioMolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP) Data Portal (https://portal.hubmapconsortium.org/) serves as a comprehensive repository for multi-modal spatial and single-cell data from healthy human tissues. This resource facilitates the NIH HuBMAP consortium's mission to create a widely accessible multi-scale spatial atlas of the healthy human body at single-cell resolution. As of October 2025, the portal hosts 5,032 datasets from 22 different data types spanning 27 organ classes across 310 donors. The portal's infrastructure and user interfaces enable efficient visualization and analysis directly in web browsers through integrated collaborative Jupyter workspaces and interactive Vitessce visualizations for over 1,500 non-spatial, 2D, and 3D spatial datasets. Uniform processing pipelines and rigorous quality control processes ensure comparability of results from different laboratories, organs, and donors for large-scale analyses, while externally processed, community-contributed datasets (EPICs) provide complementary perspectives. The portal interface supports both metadata- and data-driven search functionalities, bulk downloads, and integrated data collections, including supplementary data and visualizations for consortium publications.

Abstract:
The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into pathology is advancing precision medicine by improving diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient outcomes. Digitised whole-slide images (WSIs) capture rich spatial and morphological information vital for understanding disease biology, yet their gigapixel scale and variability pose major challenges for standardisation and analysis. Robust preprocessing, covering tissue detection, tessellation, stain normalisation, and annotation parsing is critical but often limited by fragmented and inconsistent workflows. We present PySlyde, a lightweight, open-source Python toolkit built on OpenSlide to simplify and standardise WSI preprocessing. PySlyde provides an intuitive API for slide loading, annotation management, tissue detection, tiling, and feature extraction, compatible with modern pathology foundation models. By unifying these processes, it streamlines WSI preprocessing, enhances reproducibility, and accelerates the generation of AI-ready datasets, enabling researchers to focus on model development and downstream analysis.

Abstract:
Transformer-based deep learning models have shown promise for disease risk prediction using electronic health records(EHRs), but modeling temporal dependencies remains a key challenge due to irregular visit intervals and lack of uniform structure. We propose a Bi-Positional Embedding Transformer Encoder or BiPETE for single-disease prediction, which integrates rotary positional embeddings to encode relative visit timing and sinusoidal embeddings to preserve visit order. Without relying on large-scale pretraining, BiPETE is trained on EHR data from two mental health cohorts-depressive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-to predict the risk of alcohol and substance use disorders (ASUD). BiPETE outperforms baseline models, improving the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) by 34% and 50% in the depression and PTSD cohorts, respectively. An ablation study further confirms the effectiveness of the dual positional encoding strategy. We apply the Integrated Gradients method to interpret model predictions, identifying key clinical features associated with ASUD risk and protection, such as abnormal inflammatory, hematologic, and metabolic markers, as well as specific medications and comorbidities. Overall, these key clinical features identified by the attribution methods contribute to a deeper understanding of the risk assessment process and offer valuable clues for mitigating potential risks. In summary, our study presents a practical and interpretable framework for disease risk prediction using EHR data, which can achieve strong performance.

Abstract:
Determining the binding pose of a ligand to a protein, known as molecular docking, is a fundamental task in drug discovery. Generative approaches promise faster, improved, and more diverse pose sampling than physics-based methods, but are often hindered by chemically implausible outputs, poor generalisability, and high computational cost. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel fragmentation scheme, leveraging inductive biases from structural chemistry, to decompose ligands into rigid-body fragments. Building on this decomposition, we present SigmaDock, an SE(3) Riemannian diffusion model that generates poses by learning to reassemble these rigid bodies within the binding pocket. By operating at the level of fragments in SE(3), SigmaDock exploits well-established geometric priors while avoiding overly complex diffusion processes and unstable training dynamics. Experimentally, we show SigmaDock achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching Top-1 success rates (RMSD<2 & PB-valid) above 79.9% on the PoseBusters set, compared to 12.7-30.8% reported by recent deep learning approaches, whilst demonstrating consistent generalisation to unseen proteins. SigmaDock is the first deep learning approach to surpass classical physics-based docking under the PB train-test split, marking a significant leap forward in the reliability and feasibility of deep learning for molecular modelling.

Abstract:
We explore the recently introduced persistent reachability homology (PRH) of digraph data, i.e. data in the form of directed graphs. In particular, we study the effectiveness of PRH in network classification task in a key neuroscience problem: epilepsy detection. PRH is a variation of the persistent homology of digraphs, more traditionally based on the directed flag complex (DPH). A main advantage of PRH is that it considers the condensations of the digraphs appearing in the persistent filtration and thus is computed from smaller digraphs. We compare the effectiveness of PRH to that of DPH and we show that PRH outperforms DPH in the classification task. We use the Betti curves and their integrals as topological features and implement our pipeline on support vector machine.

Abstract:
The turn of the millennium has seen a growing interest in the study of live cells by infrared (IR) spectroscopy, driven by the versatility, wealth of molecular information, and potential for high-throughput screening of the technique. Measurements on individual cells, either isolated or within a multi-cellular structure, provide information that is not available from ensemble samples. The present review discusses the use of infrared (IR) microscopy to analyse live single cells from a biochemical perspective, seeking information on real-time processes. The emphasis is on the use of the technique to quantify metabolic turnover, with the aim of providing a complementary method for metabolomics, and for toxicological and pharmacological studies. The work highlights the methodological advances and proof-of-concept experiments that took place over the past few years in this direction. It discusses current advantages and limitations of the technique, including the possibility of detecting specific biomolecules and their reactivity, and it concludes with a brief outline of future perspectives.

Abstract:
The classification of diabetes and prediabetes by static glucose thresholds obscures the pathophysiological dysglycemia heterogeneity, primarily driven by insulin resistance (IR), beta-cell dysfunction, and incretin deficiency. This review demonstrates that continuous glucose monitoring and wearable technologies enable a paradigm shift towards non-invasive, dynamic metabolic phenotyping. We show evidence that machine learning models can leverage high-resolution glucose data from at-home, CGM-enabled oral glucose tolerance tests to accurately predict gold-standard measures of muscle IR and beta-cell function. This personalized characterization extends to real-world nutrition, where an individual's unique postprandial glycemic response (PPGR) to standardized meals, such as the relative glucose spike to potatoes versus grapes, could serve as a biomarker for their metabolic subtype. Moreover, integrating wearable data reveals that habitual diet, sleep, and physical activity patterns, particularly their timing, are uniquely associated with specific metabolic dysfunctions, informing precision lifestyle interventions. The efficacy of dietary mitigators in attenuating PPGR is also shown to be phenotype-dependent. Collectively, this evidence demonstrates that CGM can deconstruct the complexity of early dysglycemia into distinct, actionable subphenotypes. This approach moves beyond simple glycemic control, paving the way for targeted nutritional, behavioral, and pharmacological strategies tailored to an individual's core metabolic defects, thereby paving the way for a new era of precision diabetes prevention.

Abstract:
Accurate and efficient registration of whole slide images (WSIs) is essential for high-resolution, nuclei-level analysis in multi-stained tissue slides. We propose a novel coarse-to-fine framework CORE for accurate nuclei-level registration across diverse multimodal whole-slide image (WSI) datasets. The coarse registration stage leverages prompt-based tissue mask extraction to effectively filter out artefacts and non-tissue regions, followed by global alignment using tissue morphology and ac- celerated dense feature matching with a pre-trained feature extractor. From the coarsely aligned slides, nuclei centroids are detected and subjected to fine-grained rigid registration using a custom, shape-aware point-set registration model. Finally, non-rigid alignment at the cellular level is achieved by estimating a non-linear dis- placement field using Coherent Point Drift (CPD). Our approach benefits from automatically generated nuclei that enhance the accuracy of deformable registra- tion and ensure precise nuclei-level correspondence across modalities. The pro- posed model is evaluated on three publicly available WSI registration datasets, and two private datasets. We show that CORE outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in terms of generalisability, precision, and robustness in bright-field and immunofluorescence microscopy WSIs

Abstract:
Computer vision methods are increasingly used for the automated analysis of large volumes of video data collected through camera traps, drones, or direct observations of animals in the wild. While recent advances have focused primarily on detecting individual actions, much less work has addressed the detection and annotation of interactions -- a crucial aspect for understanding social and individualized animal behavior. Existing open-source annotation tools support either behavioral labeling without localization of individuals, or localization without the capacity to capture interactions. To bridge this gap, we present SILVI, an open-source labeling software that integrates both functionalities. SILVI enables researchers to annotate behaviors and interactions directly within video data, generating structured outputs suitable for training and validating computer vision models. By linking behavioral ecology with computer vision, SILVI facilitates the development of automated approaches for fine-grained behavioral analyses. Although developed primarily in the context of animal behavior, SILVI could be useful more broadly to annotate human interactions in other videos that require extracting dynamic scene graphs. The software, along with documentation and download instructions, is available at: https://gitlab.gwdg.de/kanbertay/interaction-labelling-app.

Abstract:
Medical image labels are often organized by taxonomies (e.g., organ - tissue - subtype), yet standard self-supervised learning (SSL) ignores this structure. We present a hierarchy-preserving contrastive framework that makes the label tree a first-class training signal and an evaluation target. Our approach introduces two plug-in objectives: Hierarchy-Weighted Contrastive (HWC), which scales positive/negative pair strengths by shared ancestors to promote within-parent coherence, and Level-Aware Margin (LAM), a prototype margin that separates ancestor groups across levels. The formulation is geometry-agnostic and applies to Euclidean and hyperbolic embeddings without architectural changes. Across several benchmarks, including breast histopathology, the proposed objectives consistently improve representation quality over strong SSL baselines while better respecting the taxonomy. We evaluate with metrics tailored to hierarchy faithfulness: HF1 (hierarchical F1), H-Acc (tree-distance-weighted accuracy), and parent-distance violation rate. We also report top-1 accuracy for completeness. Ablations show that HWC and LAM are effective even without curvature, and combining them yields the most taxonomy-aligned representations. Taken together, these results provide a simple, general recipe for learning medical image representations that respect the label tree and advance both performance and interpretability in hierarchy-rich domains.

Abstract:
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is intrinsically heterogeneous, and typical clinical outcome measures like the Glasgow Coma Scale complicate this diversity. The large variability in severity and patient outcomes render it difficult to link structural damage to functional deficits. The Federal Interagency Traumatic Brain Injury Research (FITBIR) repository contains large-scale multi-site magnetic resonance imaging data of varying resolutions and acquisition parameters (25 shared studies with 7,693 sessions that have age, sex and TBI status defined - 5,811 TBI and 1,882 controls). To reveal shared pathways of injury of TBI through imaging, we analyzed T1-weighted images from these sessions by first harmonizing to a local dataset and segmenting 132 regions of interest (ROIs) in the brain. After running quality assurance, calculating the volumes of the ROIs, and removing outliers, we calculated the z-scores of volumes for all participants relative to the mean and standard deviation of the controls. We regressed out sex, age, and total brain volume with a multivariate linear regression, and we found significant differences in 37 ROIs between subjects with TBI and controls (p < 0.05 with independent t-tests with false discovery rate correction). We found that differences originated in 1) the brainstem, occipital pole and structures posterior to the orbit, 2) subcortical gray matter and insular cortex, and 3) cerebral and cerebellar white matter using independent component analysis and clustering the component loadings of those with TBI.

Abstract:
We present a framework that combines Large Language Models with computational image analytics for non-invasive, zero-shot prediction of IDH mutation status in brain gliomas. For each subject, coregistered multi-parametric MRI scans and multi-class tumor segmentation maps were processed to extract interpretable semantic (visual) attributes and quantitative features, serialized in a standardized JSON file, and used to query GPT 4o and GPT 5 without fine-tuning. We evaluated this framework on six publicly available datasets (N = 1427) and results showcased high accuracy and balanced classification performance across heterogeneous cohorts, even in the absence of manual annotations. GPT 5 outperformed GPT 4o in context-driven phenotype interpretation. Volumetric features emerged as the most important predictors, supplemented by subtype-specific imaging markers and clinical information. Our results demonstrate the potential of integrating LLM-based reasoning with computational image analytics for precise, non-invasive tumor genotyping, advancing diagnostic strategies in neuro-oncology.

Abstract:
Ovarian cancer remains one of the most lethal gynecological malignancies, largely due to late diagnosis and extensive heterogeneity across subtypes. Current diagnostic methods are limited in their ability to reveal underlying genomic variations essential for precision oncology. This study introduces a novel hybrid deep learning pipeline that integrates quantitative nuclear morphometry with deep convolutional image features to perform ovarian cancer subtype classification and gene mutation inference directly from Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) histopathological images. Using $\sim45,000$ image patches sourced from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and public datasets, a fusion model combining a ResNet-50 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) encoder and a Vision Transformer (ViT) was developed. This model successfully captured both local morphological texture and global tissue context. The pipeline achieved a robust overall subtype classification accuracy of $84.2\%$ (Macro AUC of $0.87 \pm 0.03$). Crucially, the model demonstrated the capacity for gene mutation inference with moderate-to-high accuracy: $AUC_{TP53} = 0.82 \pm 0.02$, $AUC_{BRCA1} = 0.76 \pm 0.04$, and $AUC_{ARID1A} = 0.73 \pm 0.05$. Feature importance analysis established direct quantitative links, revealing that nuclear solidity and eccentricity were the dominant predictors for TP53 mutation. These findings validate that quantifiable histological phenotypes encode measurable genomic signals, paving the way for cost-effective, precision histopathology in ovarian cancer triage and diagnosis.

Abstract:
Computational antibody design holds immense promise for therapeutic discovery, yet existing generative models are fundamentally limited by two core challenges: (i) a lack of dynamical consistency, which yields physically implausible structures, and (ii) poor generalization due to data scarcity and structural bias. We introduce FP-AbDiff, the first antibody generator to enforce Fokker-Planck Equation (FPE) physics along the entire generative trajectory. Our method minimizes a novel FPE residual loss over the mixed manifold of CDR geometries (R^3 x SO(3)), compelling locally-learned denoising scores to assemble into a globally coherent probability flow. This physics-informed regularizer is synergistically integrated with deep biological priors within a state-of-the-art SE(3)-equivariant diffusion framework. Rigorous evaluation on the RAbD benchmark confirms that FP-AbDiff establishes a new state-of-the-art. In de novo CDR-H3 design, it achieves a mean Root Mean Square Deviation of 0.99 Å when superposing on the variable region, a 25% improvement over the previous state-of-the-art model, AbX, and the highest reported Contact Amino Acid Recovery of 39.91%. This superiority is underscored in the more challenging six-CDR co-design task, where our model delivers consistently superior geometric precision, cutting the average full-chain Root Mean Square Deviation by ~15%, and crucially, achieves the highest full-chain Amino Acid Recovery on the functionally dominant CDR-H3 loop (45.67%). By aligning generative dynamics with physical laws, FP-AbDiff enhances robustness and generalizability, establishing a principled approach for physically faithful and functionally viable antibody design.

Abstract:
Fingerprint analysis and fingerprint identification have been the most widely used tools for human identification. To this day, various models have been proposed to explain how fingerprints are formed, ranging from the fibroblast model, which focuses on cell-collagen interactions, to the buckling of thin layers model, both yielding significant results. In this work, we present a reaction-diffusion model of Schnakenberg type, featuring an anisotropic diffusion matrix that follows the ridge orientations supplied by other traditional fingerprint-generation models, and notably yet allows minutiae -- i.e. characteristic microstructures embedded in fingerprints -- to emerge. The statistical analysis of the minutiae distribution in a randomly generated fingerprint collection is consistent with observations in real fingerprints. The model can numerically generate fingerprint-like patterns corresponding to the four basic classifications -- arches, ulnar loops, radial loops, and whorls -- as well as a variety of derived forms. The generated patterns emerge on a convex domain that mimics the geometry of a fingertip, exhibiting the diverse types of minutiae typically analyzed in fingerprint identification and showing strong agreement with those observed in human fingerprints. This model also provides insight into how levels of certainty in human identification can be achieved when based on minutiae positions. All the algorithms are implemented in an open source software named GenCHSin.

Abstract:
High-dimensional tissue imaging generates highly complex 3D data containing multiple biomarkers, making it challenging to identify biologically relevant regions without an expert user specifying manual labels for regions of interest. We introduce an approach to automatically identifying regions of interest (ROIs) in the 3D microscopy data. Our approach is based on a novel self-supervised multi-layer graph attention network (SSGAT), coupled with a React interactive interface wrapped around Vitessce. SSGAT employs an adversarial self-supervised learning objective to identify meaningful immune microenvironments through marker interactions. Our method reveals complex spatial bioreactions that can be visually assessed to assess their distribution across tissue.

In addition, phospho-proteomics is of particular interest since the dysregulation of these post-translational modifications (PTMs) has been implicated in various diseases such as cancer. We therefore assessed the feasibility of low input phospho-proteomics via phospho-bulk titration and low-input starting material. We found that there was identification of more phospho-peptides through phospho-bulk titration because of sample loss during preparation of low input starting material. Additionally, we explored various lysis buffers and boiling times for efficiency of decrosslinking formalin-fixed cells since cells and tissues are often fixed for preservation and sorting via FACS. We found that boiling in 0.05M Tris pH 7.6 with 5% SDS for 60 min yielded the highest number of phospho-peptides. Lastly, we applied Evotips Pure and phospho-bulk titration to treated Jurkat cells and identified 7 phospho-sites involved in T-cell stimulation.

Abstract:
EEG-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) frequently face spatial specificity limitations in detecting single-trial P300 potentials, a neurophysiological hallmark leveraged for both BCI control and neurodegenerative disease diagnostics. We present a novel framework combining eLORETA source localization with cross-subject functional connectivity to identify stable regions of interest (ROIs) across sessions. Analyzing 62-channel EEG data from 31 subjects (63 sessions, 2,520 trials), we demonstrate that phase-lagged connectivity metrics can reliably isolate task-relevant hubs in deeper cortical-subcortical structures like the insula and parietal regions - critical for Alzheimer's disease biomarkers. By integrating spatially stable ROIs with dynamic temporal agreement, our hybrid classification systematically outperforms whole-brain approaches in different frequency bands (up to 5.4% depending on the connectivity method and the spectral range) while maintaining millisecond-level temporal precision.   To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to establish cross-subject ROI consensus through source-space connectivity, bypassing scalp EEG's depth constraints to probe Alzheimer's-relevant networks. The framework's robustness to noise and compatibility with portable systems offer significant potential for global deployment in early neurodegenerative disease detection. Future integration of individualized anatomical data or adaptive parameter optimization could refine this tool for clinical deployment, enhancing the current max accuracy of 81.57% in the 1-15 Hz range.

Abstract:
Predicting interspecies interactions is a key challenge in microbial ecology, as these interactions are critical to determining the structure and activity of microbial communities. In this work, we used data on monoculture growth capabilities, interactions with other species, and phylogeny to predict a negative or positive effect of interactions. More precisely, we used one of the largest available pairwise interaction datasets to train our models, comprising over 7,500 interactions be- tween 20 species from two taxonomic groups co-cultured under 40 distinct carbon conditions, with a primary focus on the work of Nestor et al.[28 ]. In this work, we propose Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as a powerful classifier to predict the direction of the effect. We construct edge-graphs of pairwise microbial interactions in order to leverage shared information across individual co-culture experiments, and use GNNs to predict modes of interaction. Our model can not only predict binary interactions (positive/negative) but also classify more complex interaction types such as mutualism, competition, and parasitism. Our initial results were encouraging, achieving an F1-score of 80.44%. This significantly outperforms comparable methods in the literature, including conventional Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) models, which reported an F1-score of 72.76%.

Abstract:
We introduce a framework combining geometric modeling with disease progression analysis to investigate tau deposition in Alzheimer's disease (AD) using positron emission tomography (PET) data. Focusing on the hippocampus, we construct a principal surface that captures the spatial distribution and morphological changes of tau pathology. By projecting voxels onto this surface, we quantify tau coverage, intensity, and thickness through bidirectional projection distances and interpolated standardized uptake value ratios (SUVR). This low-dimensional embedding preserves spatial specificity while mitigating multiple comparison issues. Covariate effects are analyzed using a two-stage regression model with inverse probability weighting to adjust for signal sparsity and selection bias. Using the SuStaIn model, we identify subtypes and stages of AD, revealing distinct tau dynamics: the limbic-predominant subtype shows age-related nonlinear accumulation in coverage and thickness, whereas the posterior subtype exhibits uniform SUVR increases across disease progression. Model-based predictions show that hippocampal tau deposition follows a structured spatial trajectory expanding bidirectionally with increasing thickness, while subtype differences highlight posterior hippocampal involvement consistent with whole-brain patterns. Finally, directional signal patterns on the principal surface reveal contamination from the choroid plexus, demonstrating the broader applicability of the proposed framework across modalities including amyloid PET.

Abstract:
Background and objective: Prior probability shift between training and deployment datasets challenges deep learning-based medical image classification. Standard correction methods reweight posterior probabilities to adjust prior bias, yet their benefit is inconsistent. We developed a reliability framework identifying when prior correction helps or harms performance in pathological cell image analysis. Methods: We analyzed 303 colorectal cancer specimens with CD103/CD8 immunostaining, yielding 185,432 annotated cell images across 16 cell types. ResNet models were trained under varying bias ratios (1.1-20$\times$). Feature separability was quantified using cosine similarity-based likelihood quality scores, reflecting intra- versus inter-class distinctions in learned feature spaces. Multiple linear regression, ANOVA, and generalized additive models (GAMs) evaluated associations among feature separability, prior bias, sample adequacy, and F1 performance. Results: Feature separability dominated performance ($β= 1.650$, $p < 0.001$), showing 412-fold stronger impact than prior bias ($β= 0.004$, $p = 0.018$). GAM analysis showed strong predictive power ($R^2 = 0.876$) with mostly linear trends. A quality threshold of 0.294 effectively identified cases requiring correction (AUC = 0.610). Cell types scoring $>0.5$ were robust without correction, whereas those $<0.3$ consistently required adjustment. Conclusion: Feature extraction quality, not bias magnitude, governs correction benefit. The proposed framework provides quantitative guidance for selective correction, enabling efficient deployment and reliable diagnostic AI.

Abstract:
Nanopore protein sequencing produces long, noisy ionic current traces in which key molecular phases, such as protein capture and translocation, are embedded. Capture phases mark the successful entry of a protein into the pore and serve as both a checkpoint and a signal that a channel merits further analysis. However, manual identification of capture phases is time-intensive, often requiring several days for expert reviewers to annotate the data due to the need for domain-specific interpretation of complex signal patterns. To address this, a lightweight one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN) was developed and trained to detect capture phases in down-sampled signal windows. Evaluated against CNN-LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) hybrids, histogram-based classifiers, and other CNN variants using run-level data splits, our best model, CaptureNet-Deep, achieved an F1 score of 0.94 and precision of 93.39% on held-out test data. The model supports low-latency inference and is integrated into a dashboard for Oxford Nanopore experiments, reducing the total analysis time from several days to under thirty minutes. These results show that efficient, real-time capture detection is possible using simple, interpretable architectures and suggest a broader role for lightweight ML models in sequencing workflows.

Abstract:
The key to successful drug design lies in the correct comprehension of protein-ligand interactions. Within the current knowledge paragm, these interactions can be described from both thermodynamic and kinetic perspectives. In recent years, many deep learning models have emerged for predicting the thermodynamic properties of protein-ligand interactions. However, there is currently no mature model for predicting kinetic properties, primarily due to lack of kinetic data. To tackle this problem, we have developed a graph neural network model called STELLAR-koff (Structure-based TransfEr Learning for Ligand Activity Regression) to predict protein-ligand dissociation rate constant. Unlike traditional protein-ligand property prediction models, which typically use a single complex conformation as input, STELLAR-koff employs transfer learning to transform multiple ligand conformations within the protein into a protein ligand interaction landscape, and uses this landscape as the primary input for the model. In addition, we expanded the PDBbind koff dataset from 680 to 1,197 entries and employed the augmented dataset for model training and testing. When tested through five-fold cross-validation, STELLAR-koff achieved Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.729 surpassing or being on pair with most of the published prediction methods. Tested on external set, STELLAR-koff demonstrated strong predictive performance on unseen protein, achieving a Pearson of 0.838 on the focal adhesion kinase in particular. Experimental validation on cyclin-dependent kinase also demonstrated the effectiveness of STELLAR-koff in real drug discovering scenarios. We believe this study provides an effective tool for predicting protein-ligand dissociation rate constant and offers new insight for the future development of this field.

Abstract:
Understanding the evolution of cellular microenvironments in spatiotemporal data is essential for deciphering tissue development and disease progression. While experimental techniques like spatial transcriptomics now enable high-resolution mapping of tissue organization across space and time, current methods that model cellular evolution operate at the single-cell level, overlooking the coordinated development of cellular states in a tissue. We introduce NicheFlow, a flow-based generative model that infers the temporal trajectory of cellular microenvironments across sequential spatial slides. By representing local cell neighborhoods as point clouds, NicheFlow jointly models the evolution of cell states and spatial coordinates using optimal transport and Variational Flow Matching. Our approach successfully recovers both global spatial architecture and local microenvironment composition across diverse spatiotemporal datasets, from embryonic to brain development.

Abstract:
Detecting Lévy flights of cells has been a challenging problem in experiments. The challenge lies in accessing data in spatiotemporal scales across orders of magnitude, which is necessary for reliably extracting a power-law scaling. Differential dynamic microscopy has been shown to be a powerful method that allows one to acquire statistics of cell motion across scales, which is a potentially versatile method for detecting Lévy walks in biological systems. In this article, we extend the differential dynamic microscopy method to self-propelled Lévy particles, whose run-time distribution has a algebraic tail. We validate our protocol using synthetic imaging data and show that a reliable detection of active Lévy particles requires accessing length scales of one order of magnitude larger than its persistence length. Applying the protocol to experimental data of E. coli and E. gracilis, we find that E. coli does not exhibit a signature of Lévy walks, while E. gracilis is better described as active Lévy particles.

Abstract:
Data-driven discovery of model equations is a powerful approach for understanding the behavior of dynamical systems in many scientific fields. In particular, the ability to learn mathematical models from data would benefit systems biology, where the complex nature of these systems often makes a bottom up approach to modeling unfeasible. In recent years, sparse estimation techniques have gained prominence in system identification, primarily using parametric paradigms to efficiently capture system dynamics with minimal model complexity. In particular, the Sindy algorithm has successfully used sparsity to estimate nonlinear systems by extracting from a library of functions only a few key terms needed to capture the dynamics of these systems. However, parametric models often fall short in accurately representing certain nonlinearities inherent in complex systems. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel framework that integrates sparse parametric estimation with nonparametric techniques. It captures nonlinearities that Sindy cannot describe without requiring a priori information about their functional form. That is, without expanding the library of functions to include the one that is trying to be discovered. We illustrate our approach on several examples related to estimation of complex biological phenomena.

Abstract:
Mathematical oncology is a rapidly evolving interdisciplinary field that uses mathematical models to enhance our understanding of cancer dynamics, including tumor growth, metastasis, and treatment response. Tumor-immune interactions play a crucial role in cancer biology, influencing tumor progression and the effectiveness of immunotherapy and targeted treatments. However, studying tumor dynamics in isolation often fails to capture the complex interplay between cancer cells and the immune system, which is critical to disease progression and therapeutic efficacy. Mathematical models that incorporate tumor-immune interactions offer valuable insights into these processes, providing a framework for analyzing immune escape, treatment response, and resistance mechanisms. In this review, we provide an overview of mathematical models that describe tumor-immune dynamics, highlighting their applications in understanding tumor growth, evaluating treatment strategies, and predicting immune responses. We also discuss the strengths and limitations of current modeling approaches and propose future directions for the development of more comprehensive and predictive models of tumor-immune interactions. We aim to offer a comprehensive guide to the state of mathematical modeling in tumor immunology, emphasizing its potential to inform clinical decision-making and improve cancer therapies.

Abstract:
The impact of thermal stress on beneficial symbiosis, in the face of rapid climate change, remains poorly understood. We investigate this using the model system, Euprymna scolopes, the Hawaiian Bobtail Squid, and its bioluminescent symbiont, Vibrio fischeri, which enables the squid to camouflage itself through counter-illumination. Successful colonisation of the squid by V. fischeri must occur hours after hatching and is mediated by fluid flow due to respiration within the squid mantle cavity. To study this process, we develop a mathematical model using the Method of Regularised Stokeslets to simulate the flow and resulting bacterial trajectories within the squid. We explore how thermal stress, mediated by physiological changes in respiration, ciliary dynamics, and internal geometry, affects this early colonisation by analysing the time bacteria spend in regions crucial to the establishment of symbiosis in these simulations. A variance-based sensitivity analysis of physiologically relevant parameters on these metrics demonstrates that changes in the breath cycle significantly impact and reduce the time bacteria spend in the critical zone within the squid, hindering colonisation.

Abstract:
Diffusion models have emerged as a leading framework in generative modeling, poised to transform the traditionally slow and costly process of drug discovery. This review provides a systematic comparison of their application in designing two principal therapeutic modalities: small molecules and therapeutic peptides. We dissect how the unified framework of iterative denoising is adapted to the distinct molecular representations, chemical spaces, and design objectives of each modality. For small molecules, these models excel at structure-based design, generating novel, pocket-fitting ligands with desired physicochemical properties, yet face the critical hurdle of ensuring chemical synthesizability. Conversely, for therapeutic peptides, the focus shifts to generating functional sequences and designing de novo structures, where the primary challenges are achieving biological stability against proteolysis, ensuring proper folding, and minimizing immunogenicity. Despite these distinct challenges, both domains face shared hurdles: the scarcity of high-quality experimental data, the reliance on inaccurate scoring functions for validation, and the crucial need for experimental validation. We conclude that the full potential of diffusion models will be unlocked by bridging these modality-specific gaps and integrating them into automated, closed-loop Design-Build-Test-Learn (DBTL) platforms, thereby shifting the paradigm from mere chemical exploration to the on-demand engineering of novel~therapeutics.

Abstract:
Spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies can be used to align transcriptomes with histopathological morphology, presenting exciting new opportunities for biomolecular discovery. Using ST data, we construct a novel framework, GeneFlow, to map transcriptomics onto paired cellular images. By combining an attention-based RNA encoder with a conditional UNet guided by rectified flow, we generate high-resolution images with different staining methods (e.g. H&E, DAPI) to highlight various cellular/tissue structures. Rectified flow with high-order ODE solvers creates a continuous, bijective mapping between transcriptomics and image manifolds, addressing the many-to-one relationship inherent in this problem. Our method enables the generation of realistic cellular morphology features and spatially resolved intercellular interactions from observational gene expression profiles, provides potential to incorporate genetic/chemical perturbations, and enables disease diagnosis by revealing dysregulated patterns in imaging phenotypes. Our rectified flow-based method outperforms diffusion-based baseline method in all experiments. Code can be found at https://github.com/wangmengbo/GeneFlow.

Abstract:
Ferrohydrodynamic microfluidics relies on magnetic field gradients to manipulate diamagnetic particles in ferrofluid-filled microenvironments. It has emerged as a promising tool for label-free manipulation of bioparticles, including their separation and phenotyping. This perspective reviews recent progress in the development and applications of ferrofluid-based microfluidic platforms for multiscale bioparticle separation, ranging from micron-scale cells to submicron extracellular vesicles. We highlight the fundamental physical principles for ferrohydrodynamic manipulation, including the dominant magnetic buoyancy force resulting from the interaction of ferrofluids and particles. We then describe how these principles enable high-resolution size-based bioparticle separation, subcellular bioparticle enrichment, and phenotypic screening based on physical traits. We also discuss key challenges in ferrohydrodynamic microfluidics from the aspects of ferrofluid biocompatibility, system throughput, and nanoparticle depletion. Finally, we outline future research directions involving machine learning, 3D printing, and multiplexed detection. These insights chart a path for advancing ferrofluid-based technologies in precision biomedicine, diagnostics, and cellular engineering.

Abstract:
Background: Despite high in-silico performance (AUC >0.80), 85% of AI cancer biomarkers fail clinical translation, exposing a critical algorithm-to-outcome gap. Methods: We introduce the Algorithm-to-Outcome Concordance (AOC) framework, integrating model accuracy (AUC), clinical correlation (Corr), and trial heterogeneity. We validated AOC across 6 neoantigen vaccine trials (2017-2025) and 3 independent melanoma immunotherapy cohorts (n=188 patients). Results: AOC ranged 0.18-0.79 across trials, with failed trials (ORR <15%) showing AOC <0.40. External validation revealed unstable algorithm-outcome correlation (C-index: 0.49-0.61, p>0.05), demonstrating the necessity of explicit concordance assessment. Conclusions: AOC provides a quantitative framework for pre-trial risk assessment and adaptive trial design. Prospective validation is underway in KEYNOTE-942 extension studies.

Abstract:
In control problems and basic scientific modeling, it is important to compare observations with dynamical simulations. For example, comparing two neural systems can shed light on the nature of emergent computations in the brain and deep neural networks. Recently, Ostrow et al. (2023) introduced Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA), a method to measure the similarity of two systems based on their recurrent dynamics rather than geometry or topology. However, DSA does not consider how inputs affect the dynamics, meaning that two similar systems, if driven differently, may be classified as different. Because real-world dynamical systems are rarely autonomous, it is important to account for the effects of input drive. To this end, we introduce a novel metric for comparing both intrinsic (recurrent) and input-driven dynamics, called InputDSA (iDSA). InputDSA extends the DSA framework by estimating and comparing both input and intrinsic dynamic operators using a variant of Dynamic Mode Decomposition with control (DMDc) based on subspace identification. We demonstrate that InputDSA can successfully compare partially observed, input-driven systems from noisy data. We show that when the true inputs are unknown, surrogate inputs can be substituted without a major deterioration in similarity estimates. We apply InputDSA on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) trained with Deep Reinforcement Learning, identifying that high-performing networks are dynamically similar to one another, while low-performing networks are more diverse. Lastly, we apply InputDSA to neural data recorded from rats performing a cognitive task, demonstrating that it identifies a transition from input-driven evidence accumulation to intrinsically-driven decision-making. Our work demonstrates that InputDSA is a robust and efficient method for comparing intrinsic dynamics and the effect of external input on dynamical systems.

Abstract:
Collective behaviors in cellular systems are regulated not only by biochemical signalling pathways but also by intercellular mechanical forces, whose quantification in contractile monolayers remains poorly understood. Here, by integrating traction force microscopy and numerical simulations, we reconstruct the stress distribution in C2C12 myoblast monolayers to reveal the roles of local mechanical forces in determining the collective cellular structures. We find that contractile monolayers exhibit positive maximum and negative minimum principal stresses, reflecting the intrinsic anisotropy of active tension. Distinct stress patterns emerge around topological defects, coinciding with singularities in cell alignment, density, and morphology, indicating a strong coupling between mechanical forces and structural organization. Moreover, tensile stresses are preferentially transmitted along the cell elongation axis and compressive stresses transversely, demonstrating that local stress guides cell arrangement. This mechanical guidance appears to be universal among contractile systems, as observed also in bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells. Together, our work establishes a quantitative framework for characterizing mechanical anisotropy in active cellular monolayers and reveals a general principle of force-structure coupling, providing a physical basis for understanding how mechanics governs myogenesis, morphogenesis, and collective organization in contractile cellular systems.

Abstract:
Traditional non-biological storage media, such as hard drives, face limitations in both storage density and lifespan due to the rapid growth of data in the big data era. Mirror-image peptides composed of D-amino acids have emerged as a promising biological storage medium due to their high storage density, structural stability, and long lifespan. The sequencing of mirror-image peptides relies on \textit{de-novo} technology. However, its accuracy is limited by the scarcity of tandem mass spectrometry datasets and the challenges that current algorithms encounter when processing these peptides directly. This study is the first to propose improving sequencing accuracy indirectly by optimizing the design of mirror-image peptide sequences. In this work, we introduce DBond, a deep neural network based model that integrates sequence features, precursor ion properties, and mass spectrometry environmental factors for the prediction of mirror-image peptide bond cleavage. In this process, sequences with a high peptide bond cleavage ratio, which are easy to sequence, are selected. The main contributions of this study are as follows. First, we constructed MiPD513, a tandem mass spectrometry dataset containing 513 mirror-image peptides. Second, we developed the peptide bond cleavage labeling algorithm (PBCLA), which generated approximately 12.5 million labeled data based on MiPD513. Third, we proposed a dual prediction strategy that combines multi-label and single-label classification. On an independent test set, the single-label classification strategy outperformed other methods in both single and multiple peptide bond cleavage prediction tasks, offering a strong foundation for sequence optimization.

Abstract:
Diabetic retinopathy (DR), a microvascular complication of diabetes and a leading cause of preventable blindness, is projected to affect more than 130 million individuals worldwide by 2030. Early identification is essential to reduce irreversible vision loss, yet current diagnostic workflows rely on methods such as fundus photography and expert review, which remain costly and resource-intensive. This, combined with DR's asymptomatic nature, results in its underdiagnosis rate of approximately 25 percent. Although convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated strong performance in medical imaging tasks, limited interpretability and the absence of uncertainty quantification restrict clinical reliability. Therefore, in this study, a deep ensemble learning framework integrated with uncertainty estimation is introduced to improve robustness, transparency, and scalability in DR detection. The ensemble incorporates seven CNN architectures-ResNet-50, DenseNet-121, MobileNetV3 (Small and Large), and EfficientNet (B0, B2, B3)- whose outputs are fused through an accuracy-weighted majority voting strategy. A probability-weighted entropy metric quantifies prediction uncertainty, enabling low-confidence samples to be excluded or flagged for additional review. Training and validation on 35,000 EyePACS retinal fundus images produced an unfiltered accuracy of 93.70 percent (F1 = 0.9376). Uncertainty-filtering later was conducted to remove unconfident samples, resulting in maximum-accuracy of 99.44 percent (F1 = 0.9932). The framework shows that uncertainty-aware, accuracy-weighted ensembling improves reliability without hindering performance. With confidence-calibrated outputs and a tunable accuracy-coverage trade-off, it offers a generalizable paradigm for deploying trustworthy AI diagnostics in high-risk care.

Abstract:
Advances in single-cell sequencing have enabled high-resolution profiling of diverse molecular modalities, while integrating unpaired multi-omics single-cell data remains challenging. Existing approaches either rely on pair information or prior correspondences, or require computing a global pairwise coupling matrix, limiting their scalability and flexibility. In this paper, we introduce a scalable and flexible generative framework called single-cell Multi-omics Regularized Disentangled Representations (scMRDR) for unpaired multi-omics integration. Specifically, we disentangle each cell's latent representations into modality-shared and modality-specific components using a well-designed $β$-VAE architecture, which are augmented with isometric regularization to preserve intra-omics biological heterogeneity, adversarial objective to encourage cross-modal alignment, and masked reconstruction loss strategy to address the issue of missing features across modalities. Our method achieves excellent performance on benchmark datasets in terms of batch correction, modality alignment, and biological signal preservation. Crucially, it scales effectively to large-level datasets and supports integration of more than two omics, offering a powerful and flexible solution for large-scale multi-omics data integration and downstream biological discovery.

Abstract:
Mapping habitat quality, based on factors like host availability and environmental suitability, is a common approach to determining which locations are important for the spread of a species. Mapping habitat connectivity takes geographic analyses a step further, evaluating the potential roles of locations in biological invasions, pandemics, or species conservation. Locations with high habitat quality may play a minor role in species spread if they are geographically isolated. Yet, a location with lower habitat quality may play a major role in a species' spread if it acts as a bridge between regions that would otherwise be physically fragmented.   Here we introduce the geohabnet R package, which evaluates the potential importance of locations for the spread of species through habitat landscapes. geohabnet incorporates key factors such as dispersal probabilities and habitat availability in a network framework, for better understanding habitat connectivity for host-dependent species, such as pathogens, arthropod pests, or pollinators.   geohabnet uses publicly available or user-provided datasets, six network centrality metrics, and a user-selected geographic scale. We provide examples using geohabnet for surveillance prioritization of emerging plant pests in Africa and the Americas. These examples illustrate how users can apply geohabnet for their species of interest and generate maps of the estimated importance of geographic locations for species spread.   geohabnet provides a quick, open-source, and reproducible baseline to quantify a species' habitat connectivity across a wide range of geographic scales and evaluates potential scenarios for the expansion of a species through habitat landscapes. geohabnet supports biosecurity programs, invasion science, and conservation biology when prioritizing management efforts for transboundary pathogens, pests, or endangered species.

Abstract:
Geographic atrophy (GA) is a key biomarker of dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) traditionally identified through color fundus photography. Hyper-transmission defects (hyperTDs), a feature highly correlated with GA, have recently gained prominence in optical coherence tomography (OCT) research. OCT offers cross-sectional imaging of the retina, leading to the development of the terms complete retinal pigment epithelium and outer retinal atrophy (cRORA) to describe specific patterns of structural degeneration. Within the definitions of cRORA three critical lesions are implicated: inner nuclear layer and outer plexiform layer (INL-OPL) subsidence, ellipsoid zone and retinal pigment epithelium (EZ-RPE) disruption, and hyperTDs. To enable the automated quantification of retinal atrophy progression, we propose an AI-based model that segments INL-OPL subsidence, EZ-RPE disruption, and hyperTDs. Additionally, we developed an algorithm that leverages these segmentation results to distinguish cRORA from hyperTDs in the absence of GA. We evaluated our approach on a comprehensive dataset of eyes with AMD and healthy eyes, achieving mean voxel-level F1-scores of 0.76/0.13 (mean/standard deviation) for INL-OPL subsidence, 0.64/0.15 for EZ-RPE disruption, and 0.69/0.04 for hyperTDs. For distinguishing cRORA from hyperTDs, we achieved an average pixel-level F1-score of 0.80/0.12 for segment cRORA from hyperTDs. This method demonstrates significant advances in the quantitative analysis of retinal atrophy, offering a promising tool for improved AMD diagnosis and disease progression monitoring.

Abstract:
Diffusion MRI has revealed important insights into white matter microstructure, but its application to gray matter remains comparatively less explored. Here, we investigate whether global patterns of gray-matter microstructure can be captured through neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) and whether such patterns are predictive of cognitive performance. Our findings demonstrate that PCA-based global indicators of gray-matter microstructure provide complementary markers of structure-function relationships, extending beyond region-specific analyses. Our results suggest that general microstructure factors may serve as robust, interpretable biomarkers for studying cognition and cortical organization at the population level. Using diffusion MRI and behavioral data from the Human Connectome Project Young Adult study, we derived region-averaged NODDI parameters and applied principal component analysis (PCA) to construct general gray-matter microstructure factors. We found that the factor derived from isotropic volume fraction explained substantial inter-individual variability and was significantly correlated with specific cognitive scores collected from the NIH Toolbox. In particular, the isotropic volume fraction factor was linked to reading and vocabulary performance and to cognitive fluidity.

Abstract:
Accurately predicting the three-dimensional structures of protein-ligand complexes remains a fundamental challenge in computational drug discovery that limits the pace and success of therapeutic design. Deep learning methods have recently shown strong potential as structural prediction tools, achieving promising accuracy across diverse biomolecular systems. However, their performance and utility are constrained by scarce experimental data, inefficient architectures, physically invalid poses, and the limited ability to exploit auxiliary information available at inference. To address these issues, we introduce Pearl (Placing Every Atom in the Right Location), a foundation model for protein-ligand cofolding at scale. Pearl addresses these challenges with three key innovations: (1) training recipes that include large-scale synthetic data to overcome data scarcity; (2) architectures that incorporate an SO(3)-equivariant diffusion module to inherently respect 3D rotational symmetries, improving generalization and sample efficiency, and (3) controllable inference, including a generalized multi-chain templating system supporting both protein and non-polymeric components as well as dual unconditional/conditional modes. Pearl establishes a new state-of-the-art performance in protein-ligand cofolding. On the key metric of generating accurate (RMSD < 2 Å) and physically valid poses, Pearl surpasses AlphaFold 3 and other open source baselines on the public Runs N' Poses and PoseBusters benchmarks, delivering 14.5% and 14.2% improvements, respectively, over the next best model. In the pocket-conditional cofolding regime, Pearl delivers $3.6\times$ improvement on a proprietary set of challenging, real-world drug targets at the more rigorous RMSD < 1 Å threshold. Finally, we demonstrate that model performance correlates directly with synthetic dataset size used in training.

Abstract:
Artificial intelligence in medicine is built to serve the average patient. By minimizing error across large datasets, most systems deliver strong aggregate accuracy yet falter at the margins: patients with rare variants, multimorbidity, or underrepresented demographics. This average patient fallacy erodes both equity and trust. We propose a different design: a multi-agent ecosystem for N-of-1 decision support. In this environment, agents clustered by organ systems, patient populations, and analytic modalities draw on a shared library of models and evidence synthesis tools. Their results converge in a coordination layer that weighs reliability, uncertainty, and data density before presenting the clinician with a decision-support packet: risk estimates bounded by confidence ranges, outlier flags, and linked evidence. Validation shifts from population averages to individual reliability, measured by error in low-density regions, calibration in the small, and risk--coverage trade-offs. Anticipated challenges include computational demands, automation bias, and regulatory fit, addressed through caching strategies, consensus checks, and adaptive trial frameworks. By moving from monolithic models to orchestrated intelligence, this approach seeks to align medical AI with the first principle of medicine: care that is transparent, equitable, and centered on the individual.

Abstract:
Proteins are traditionally optimized through the costly construction and measurement of many mutants. Active Learning-assisted Directed Evolution (ALDE) alleviates that cost by predicting the best improvements and iteratively testing mutants to inform predictions. However, existing ALDE methods face a critical limitation: selecting the highest-predicted mutants in each round yields homogeneous training data insufficient for accurate prediction models in subsequent rounds. Here we present FolDE, an ALDE method designed to maximize end-of-campaign success. In simulations across 20 protein targets, FolDE discovers 23% more top 10% mutants than the best baseline ALDE method (p=0.005) and is 55% more likely to find top 1% mutants. FolDE achieves this primarily through naturalness-based warm-starting, which augments limited activity measurements with protein language model outputs to improve activity prediction. We also introduce a constant-liar batch selector, which improves batch diversity; this is important in multi-mutation campaigns but had limited effect in our benchmarks. The complete workflow is freely available as open-source software, making efficient protein optimization accessible to any laboratory.

Abstract:
Accurate quantification in positron emission tomography (PET) is essential for accurate diagnostic results and effective treatment tracking. A major issue encountered in PET imaging is attenuation. Attenuation refers to the diminution of photon detected as they traverse biological tissues before reaching detectors. When such corrections are absent or inadequate, this signal degradation can introduce inaccurate quantification, making it difficult to differentiate benign from malignant conditions, and can potentially lead to misdiagnosis. Typically, this correction is done with co-computed Computed Tomography (CT) imaging to obtain structural data for calculating photon attenuation across the body. However, this methodology subjects patients to extra ionizing radiation exposure, suffers from potential spatial misregistration between PET/CT imaging sequences, and demands costly equipment infrastructure. Emerging advances in neural network architectures present an alternative approach via synthetic CT image synthesis. Our investigation reveals that Conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) can generate high quality CT images from non attenuation corrected PET images in order to correct attenuation. By utilizing all three orthogonal views from non-attenuation-corrected PET images, the DDPM approach combined with ensemble voting generates higher quality pseudo-CT images with reduced artifacts and improved slice-to-slice consistency. Results from a study of 159 head scans acquired with the Siemens Biograph Vision PET/CT scanner demonstrate both qualitative and quantitative improvements in pseudo-CT generation. The method achieved a mean absolute error of 32 $\pm$ 10.4 HU on the CT images and an average error of (1.48 $\pm$ 0.68)\% across all regions of interest when comparing PET images reconstructed using the attenuation map of the generated pseudo-CT versus the true CT.

Abstract:
Understanding the relationship between antibody sequence, structure and function is essential for the design of antibody-based therapeutics and research tools. Recently, machine learning (ML) models mostly based on the application of large language models to sequence information have been developed to predict antibody properties. Yet there are open directions to incorporate structural information, not only to enhance prediction but also to offer insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms. This chapter provides an overview of these approaches and describes two ML frameworks that integrate structural data (via graph representations) with neural networks to predict properties of antibodies: ANTIPASTI predicts binding affinity (a global property) whereas INFUSSE predicts residue flexibility (a local property). We survey the principles underpinning these models; the ways in which they encode structural knowledge; and the strategies that can be used to extract biologically relevant statistical signals that can help discover and disentangle molecular determinants of the properties of interest.

Abstract:
Non-invasive colorectal cancer (CRC) screening represents a key opportunity to improve colonoscopy participation rates and reduce CRC mortality. This study explores the potential of the gut-liver axis for predicting colorectal neoplasia through liver-derived radiomic features extracted from routine CT images as a novel opportunistic screening approach. In this retrospective study, we analyzed data from 1,997 patients who underwent colonoscopy and abdominal CT. Patients either had no colorectal neoplasia (n=1,189) or colorectal neoplasia (n_total=808; adenomas n=423, CRC n=385). Radiomics features were extracted from 3D liver segmentations using the Radiomics Processing ToolKit (RPTK), which performed feature extraction, filtering, and classification. The dataset was split into training (n=1,397) and test (n=600) cohorts. Five machine learning models were trained with 5-fold cross-validation on the 20 most informative features, and the best model ensemble was selected based on the validation AUROC. The best radiomics-based XGBoost model achieved a test AUROC of 0.810, clearly outperforming the best clinical-only model (test AUROC: 0.457). Subclassification between colorectal cancer and adenoma showed lower accuracy (test AUROC: 0.674). Our findings establish proof-of-concept that liver-derived radiomics from routine abdominal CT can predict colorectal neoplasia. Beyond offering a pragmatic, widely accessible adjunct to CRC screening, this approach highlights the gut-liver axis as a novel biomarker source for opportunistic screening and sparks new mechanistic hypotheses for future translational research.

Abstract:
Accurate protein function prediction requires integrating heterogeneous intrinsic signals (e.g., sequence and structure) with noisy extrinsic contexts (e.g., protein-protein interactions and GO term annotations). However, two key challenges hinder effective fusion: (i) cross-modal distributional mismatch among embeddings produced by pre-trained intrinsic encoders, and (ii) noisy relational graphs of extrinsic data that degrade GNN-based information aggregation. We propose Diffused and Aligned Multi-modal Protein Embedding (DAMPE), a unified framework that addresses these through two core mechanisms. First, we propose Optimal Transport (OT)-based representation alignment that establishes correspondence between intrinsic embedding spaces of different modalities, effectively mitigating cross-modal heterogeneity. Second, we develop a Conditional Graph Generation (CGG)-based information fusion method, where a condition encoder fuses the aligned intrinsic embeddings to provide informative cues for graph reconstruction. Meanwhile, our theoretical analysis implies that the CGG objective drives this condition encoder to absorb graph-aware knowledge into its produced protein representations. Empirically, DAMPE outperforms or matches state-of-the-art methods such as DPFunc on standard GO benchmarks, achieving AUPR gains of 0.002-0.013 pp and Fmax gains 0.004-0.007 pp. Ablation studies further show that OT-based alignment contributes 0.043-0.064 pp AUPR, while CGG-based fusion adds 0.005-0.111 pp Fmax. Overall, DAMPE offers a scalable and theoretically grounded approach for robust multi-modal protein representation learning, substantially enhancing protein function prediction.

Abstract:
Prenatal maternal stress (PS) is a risk factor for adverse offspring neurodevelopment. Heart rate variability (HRV) complexity provides a non-invasive marker of maternal autonomic regulation and may be influenced by mind--body interventions such as Yoga. In this quasi-randomized controlled trial, 28 chronically stressed pregnant women were followed from the second trimester until birth: 14 participated in weekly Hatha Yoga with electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings, and 14 received standard obstetric care with monthly ECGs. Group allocation was based on availability, with participants unaware of their assignment at enrollment. HRV complexity was assessed first with Sample Entropy and Entropy Rate and then expanded to 94 HRV metrics spanning temporal, frequency, nonlinear, and information-theoretical domains. All metrics were covariate-adjusted (maternal age, BMI, gestational age), standardized, and analyzed using timepoint-specific principal component analysis (PCA). From this, a unified HRV index was derived. Analyses revealed that HRV metric relationships changed dynamically across pregnancy, with PCA loadings shifting from frequency toward complexity measures in late gestation. The mixed effects model identified a significant time x group interaction effect (p = 0.041). These findings suggest a restructuring of HRV signal-analytical domains with advancing pregnancy attributable to Yoga and highlight the utility of advanced HRV analysis frameworks for future, larger trials.

Abstract:
Understanding how creativity is represented in the brain's intrinsic functional architecture remains a central challenge in cognitive neuroscience. While resting-state fMRI studies have revealed large-scale network correlates of creative potential, electroencephalography (EEG) offers a temporally precise and scalable approach to capture the fast oscillatory dynamics that underlie spontaneous neural organization. In this study, we used a data-driven network approach to examine whether resting-state EEG connectivity patterns differentiate individuals according to their creative abilities. Creativity was evaluated by: The Inventory of Creative Activities and Achievements (ICAA), The Divergent Association Task (DAT), The Matchstick Arithmetic Puzzles Task (MAPT) and Self-rating (SR) of creative ability in 30 healthy young adults. Graph-theoretical analyses were applied to functional connectivity matrices and clustered based on graph similarity. Two distinct participant clusters emerged, differing systematically across multiple dimensions of creativity. Cluster 1, characterized by consistently higher performance across multiple creativity variables (ICAA, DAT, MAPT and SR), showed broad alpha-band hypoconnectivity, relatively preserved left frontal connectivity and greater network modularity. Cluster 0, associated with lower creativity scores, exhibited stronger overall connectivity strength, reduced modularity and higher local clustering. These findings suggest that resting-state EEG connectivity patterns can index stable cognitive traits such as creativity. More broadly, they point to an intrinsic neural signature of adaptive brain function marked by efficient yet flexible network organization that may support creative and adaptive cognition.

Abstract:
Background: Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD) affects ~33% of U.S. adults and is the most common chronic liver disease. Although often asymptomatic, progression can lead to cirrhosis. Early detection is important, as lifestyle interventions can prevent disease progression. We developed a fair, rigorous, and reproducible MASLD prediction model and compared it to prior methods using a large electronic health record database.   Methods: We evaluated LASSO logistic regression, random forest, XGBoost, and a neural network for MASLD prediction using clinical feature subsets, including the top 10 SHAP-ranked features. To reduce disparities in true positive rates across racial and ethnic subgroups, we applied an equal opportunity postprocessing method.   Results: This study included 59,492 patients in the training data, 24,198 in the validating data, and 25,188 in the testing data. The LASSO logistic regression model with the top 10 features was selected for its interpretability and comparable performance. Before fairness adjustment, the model achieved AUROC of 0.84, accuracy of 78%, sensitivity of 72%, specificity of 79%, and F1-score of 0.617. After equal opportunity postprocessing, accuracy modestly increased to 81% and specificity to 94%, while sensitivity decreased to 41% and F1-score to 0.515, reflecting the fairness trade-off.   Conclusions: We developed the MASER prediction model (MASLD Static EHR Risk Prediction), a LASSO logistic regression model which achieved competitive performance for MASLD prediction (AUROC 0.836, accuracy 77.6%), comparable to previously reported ensemble and tree-based models. Overall, this approach demonstrates that interpretable models can achieve a balance of predictive performance and fairness in diverse patient populations.

Abstract:
Chromatin sensitive partial wave spectroscopic (csPWS) microscopy enables label free detection of nanoscale chromatin packing alterations that occur before visible cellular transformation. However, manual nuclear segmentation limits population scale analysis needed for biomarker discovery in early cancer detection. The lack of annotated csPWS imaging data prevents direct use of standard deep learning methods. We present CFU Net, a hierarchical segmentation architecture trained with a three stage curriculum on synthetic multimodal data. CFU Net achieves near perfect performance on held out synthetic test data that represent diverse spectroscopic imaging conditions without manual annotations (Dice 0.9879, IoU 0.9895). Our approach uses physics based rendering that incorporates empirically supported chromatin packing statistics, Mie scattering models, and modality specific noise, combined with a curriculum that progresses from adversarial RGB pretraining to spectroscopic fine tuning and histology validation. CFU Net integrates five architectural elements (ConvNeXt backbone, Feature Pyramid Network, UNet plus plus dense connections, dual attention, and deep supervision) that together improve Dice over a baseline UNet by 8.3 percent. We demonstrate deployment ready INT8 quantization with 74.9 percent compression and 0.15 second inference, giving a 240 times throughput gain over manual analysis. Applied to more than ten thousand automatically segmented nuclei from synthetic test data, the pipeline extracts chromatin biomarkers that distinguish normal from pre cancerous tissue with large effect sizes (Cohens d between 1.31 and 2.98), reaching 94 percent classification accuracy. This work provides a general framework for synthetic to real transfer learning in specialized microscopy and open resources for community validation on clinical specimens.

Abstract:
Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) enables structural characterization of biomolecules under near-native conditions. Existing approaches for interpreting the resulting three-dimensional volumes are computationally expensive and have difficulty interpreting density associated with small proteins/complexes. To explore alternate approaches for identifying proteins in cryo-ET data we pursued a Graph Network and topologically invariant approach. Here, we report on a fast algorithm that distinguishes volumes containing protein density from noise by searching for nuances of evolutionarily conversed motifs and the geometrical characteristics of protein structure. GRIP-Tomo 2.0 is a machine-learning pipeline that extracts interpretable topological features of protein structures within noisy experimental backgrounds. Compared to version 1.0, the new pipeline includes three upgrades that significantly improve performance including synthetic tomogram generation simulating realistic noise, graph-based persistent feature extraction as protein fingerprints, and high-performance computing acceleration. GRIP-Tomo 2.0 achieves over 90% accuracy in distinguishing proteins from noise for synthetic datasets and over 80% accuracy for real datasets, which represents a foundational step toward advancing cryo-ET workflows and empowering automated detection of both small and large proteins for visual proteomics.

Abstract:
An accurate prediction of protein-nucleic acid binding affinity is vital for deciphering genomic processes, yet existing approaches often struggle in reconciling high accuracy with interpretability and computational efficiency. In this study, we introduce commutative algebra prediction (CAP), which couples persistent Stanley-Reisner theory with advanced sequence embedding for predicting protein-nucleic acid binding affinities. CAP encodes proteins through transformer-learned embeddings that retain long-range evolutionary context and represents DNA and RNA with $\textit{k}$-mer algebra embeddings derived from persistent facet ideals, which capture fine-scale nucleotide geometry. We demonstrate that CAP surpasses the SVSBI protein-nucleic acid benchmark and, in a further test, maintains reasonable performance on newly curated protein-RNA and protein-nucleic acid datasets. Leveraging only primary sequences, CAP generalizes to any protein-nucleic acid pair with minimal preprocessing, enabling genome-scale analyses without 3D structural data and promising faster virtual screening for drug discovery and protein engineering.

Abstract:
Single-cell technologies generate high-dimensional point clouds of cells, enabling detailed characterization of complex patient states and treatment responses. Yet each patient is represented by an irregular point cloud rather than a simple vector, making it difficult to directly quantify and compare biological differences between individuals. Nonlinear methods such as kernels and neural networks achieve predictive accuracy but act as black boxes, offering little biological interpretability.   To address these limitations, we adapt the Linear Optimal Transport (LOT) framework to this setting, embedding irregular point clouds into a fixed-dimensional Euclidean space while preserving distributional structure. This embedding provides a principled linear representation that preserves optimal transport geometry while enabling downstream analysis. It also forms a registration between any two patients, enabling direct comparison of their cellular distributions. Within this space, LOT enables: (i) \textbf{accurate and interpretable classification} of COVID-19 patient states, where classifier weights map back to specific markers and spatial regions driving predictions; and (ii) \textbf{synthetic data generation} for patient-derived organoids, exploiting the linearity of the LOT embedding. LOT barycenters yield averaged cellular profiles representing combined conditions or samples, supporting drug interaction testing.   Together, these results establish LOT as a unified framework that bridges predictive performance, interpretability, and generative modeling. By transforming heterogeneous point clouds into structured embeddings directly traceable to the original data, LOT opens new opportunities for understanding immune variation and treatment effects in high-dimensional biological systems.

Abstract:
Machine-learning methods in biochemistry commonly represent molecules as graphs of pairwise intermolecular interactions for property and structure predictions. Most methods operate on a single graph, typically the minimal free energy (MFE) structure, for low-energy ensembles (conformations) representative of structures at thermodynamic equilibrium. We introduce a thermodynamically parameterized exponential-family random graph (ERGM) embedding that models molecules as Boltzmann-weighted ensembles of interaction graphs. We evaluate this embedding on SELEX datasets, where experimental biases (e.g., PCR amplification or sequencing noise) can obscure true aptamer-ligand affinity, producing anomalous candidates whose observed abundance diverges from their actual binding strength. We show that the proposed embedding enables robust community detection and subgraph-level explanations for aptamer ligand affinity, even in the presence of biased observations. This approach may be used to identify low-abundance aptamer candidates for further experimental evaluation.

Abstract:
The rapid generation of whole-slide images (WSIs) in dermatopathology necessitates automated methods for efficient processing and accurate classification. This study evaluates the performance of two foundation models, UNI and Virchow2, as feature extractors for classifying WSIs into three diagnostic categories: melanocytic, basaloid, and squamous lesions. Patch-level embeddings were aggregated into slide-level features using a mean-aggregation strategy and subsequently used to train multiple machine learning classifiers, including logistic regression, gradient-boosted trees, and random forest models. Performance was assessed using precision, recall, true positive rate, false positive rate, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) on the test set. Results demonstrate that patch-level features extracted using Virchow2 outperformed those extracted via UNI across most slide-level classifiers, with logistic regression achieving the highest accuracy (90%) for Virchow2, though the difference was not statistically significant. The study also explored data augmentation techniques and image normalization to enhance model robustness and generalizability. The mean-aggregation approach provided reliable slide-level feature representations. All experimental results and metrics were tracked and visualized using WandB.ai, facilitating reproducibility and interpretability. This research highlights the potential of foundation models for automated WSI classification, providing a scalable and effective approach for dermatopathological diagnosis while paving the way for future advancements in slide-level representation learning.

Abstract:
This paper introduces an innovative Electronic Health Record (EHR) foundation model that integrates Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS) as a foundational data modality, moving beyond traditional EHR-only approaches to build more holistic health profiles. Leveraging the extensive and diverse data from the All of Us (AoU) Research Program, this multimodal framework aims to learn complex relationships between clinical data and genetic predispositions. The methodology extends advancements in generative AI to the EHR foundation model space, enhancing predictive capabilities and interpretability. Evaluation on AoU data demonstrates the model's predictive value for the onset of various conditions, particularly Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), and illustrates the interplay between PRS and EHR data. The work also explores transfer learning for custom classification tasks, showcasing the architecture's versatility and efficiency. This approach is pivotal for unlocking new insights into disease prediction, proactive health management, risk stratification, and personalized treatment strategies, laying the groundwork for more personalized, equitable, and actionable real-world evidence generation in healthcare.

Abstract:
Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) data analysis requires adaptable software solutions to meet diverse analytical needs. We present eMZed 3, a modern Python framework for flexible and interactive analysis of LC-MS/MS data. eMZed 3 enables users to develop scalable workflows tailored to their specific requirements while leveraging Python's extensive ecosystem of libraries. Building on its predecessor, eMZed 3 is now Python 3-based and includes substantial enhancements, including support for chromatogram-based LC-MS data, a new SQLite-based backend supporting optional out-of-memory processing, and rich interactive visualization tools. Compared to the previous version, eMZed 3 is now split into three packages: emzed (core functionalities), emzed-gui (interactive data visualization), and emzed-spyder (an integrated development environment). This modular architecture allows straightforward integration of the emzed core library into headless Python environments, including computational notebooks (such as Jupyter) or high-performance computing clusters. eMZed 3 incorporates well-established libraries such as OpenMS, and is highly suited for both targeted and untargeted metabolomics. Overall, eMZed 3 supports the efficient development of scalable and reproducible LC-MS data analysis and is accessible to both novice and advanced programmers.   Availability and Implementation: eMZed 3 and its documentation are freely available at https://emzed.ethz.ch, the source code is hosted at https://gitlab.com/groups/emzed3.

Abstract:
Kinetic modeling enables \textit{in vivo} quantification of tracer uptake and glucose metabolism in [${}^{18}$F]Fluorodeoxyglucose ([${}^{18}$F]FDG) dynamic positron emission tomography (dPET) imaging of mice. However, kinetic modeling requires the accurate determination of the arterial input function (AIF) during imaging, which is time-consuming and invasive. Recent studies have shown the efficacy of using deep learning to directly predict the input function, surpassing established methods such as the image-derived input function (IDIF). In this work, we trained a physics-informed deep learning-based input function prediction model (PIDLIF) to estimate the AIF directly from the PET images, incorporating a kinetic modeling loss during training. The proposed method uses a two-tissue compartment model over two regions, the myocardium and brain of the mice, and is trained on a dataset of 70 [${}^{18}$F]FDG dPET images of mice accompanied by the measured AIF during imaging. The proposed method had comparable performance to the network without a physics-informed loss, and when sudden movement causing blurring in the images was simulated, the PIDLIF model maintained high performance in severe cases of image degradation. The proposed physics-informed method exhibits an improved robustness that is promoted by physically constraining the problem, enforcing consistency for out-of-distribution samples. In conclusion, the PIDLIF model offers insight into the effects of leveraging physiological distribution mechanics in mice to guide a deep learning-based AIF prediction network in images with severe degradation as a result of blurring due to movement during imaging.

Abstract:
While recent sound event detection (SED) systems can identify baleen whale calls in marine audio, challenges related to false positive and minority-class detection persist. We propose the boundary proposal network (BPN), which extends an existing lightweight SED system. The BPN is inspired by work in image object detection and aims to reduce the number of false positive detections. It achieves this by using intermediate latent representations computed within the backbone classification model to gate the final output. When added to an existing SED system, the BPN achieves a 16.8 % absolute increase in precision, as well as 21.3 % and 9.4 % improvements in the F1-score for minority-class d-calls and bp-calls, respectively. We further consider two approaches to the selection of post-processing hyperparameters: a forward-search and a backward-search. By separately optimising event-level and frame-level hyperparameters, these two approaches lead to considerable performance improvements over parameters selected using empirical methods. The complete WhaleVAD-BPN system achieves a cross-validated development F1-score of 0.475, which is a 9.8 % absolute improvement over the baseline.

Abstract:
Understanding the flexibility of protein-nucleic acid complexes, often characterized by atomic B-factors, is essential for elucidating their structure, dynamics, and functions, such as reactivity and allosteric pathways. Traditional models such as Gaussian Network Models (GNM) and Elastic Network Models (ENM) often fall short in capturing multiscale interactions, especially in large or complex biomolecular systems. In this work, we apply the Persistent Sheaf Laplacian (PSL) framework for the B-factor prediction of protein-nucleic acid complexes. The PSL model integrates multiscale analysis, algebraic topology, combinatoric Laplacians, and sheaf theory for data representation. It reveals topological invariants in its harmonic spectra and captures the homotopic shape evolution of data with its non-harmonic spectra. Its localization enables accurate B-factor predictions. We benchmark our method on three diverse datasets, including protein-RNA and nucleic-acid-only structures, and demonstrate that PSL consistently outperforms existing models such as GNM and multiscale FRI (mFRI), achieving up to a 21% improvement in Pearson correlation coefficient for B-factor prediction. These results highlight the robustness and adaptability of PSL in modeling complex biomolecular interactions and suggest its potential utility in broader applications such as mutation impact analysis and drug design.

Abstract:
Accurate measures of musculoskeletal forces are critical for clinicians, biomechanists, and engineers, yet direct measurement is highly invasive and current estimation methods remain limited in accuracy. Here, we demonstrate the application of ultra-wideband radar to non-invasively estimate musculoskeletal forces by measuring changes in the electromagnetic properties of contracting muscles, in muscles with different structural properties, during various static and dynamic conditions, and in the presence of fatigue. First, we show that ultra-wideband radar scans of muscle can reliably track isometric force in a unipennate knee extensor (vastus lateralis) and a bipennate ankle dorsiflexor (tibialis anterior). Next, we integrate radar signals within machine-learning and linear models to estimate musculoskeletal forces during fatiguing isometric, and dynamic knee extension contractions, with exceptional accuracy (test R2>0.984; errors<3.3%). Finally, we identify frequency-dependent effects of musculoskeletal forces on ultra-wideband radar signals, that are independent of physiological and structural features known to influence muscle force. Together, these findings establish ultra-wideband radar as a powerful, non-invasive approach for quantifying in vivo musculoskeletal forces, with transformative potential for wearable assistive technologies, biomechanics, and rehabilitation.

Abstract:
Repurposing existing drugs to treat new diseases is a cost-effective alternative to de novo drug development, but there are millions of potential drug-disease combinations to be considered with only a small fraction being viable. In silico predictions of drug-disease associations can be invaluable for reducing the size of the search space. In this work we present a novel network of drugs and the diseases they treat, compiled using a combination of existing textual and machine-readable databases, natural-language processing tools, and hand curation, and analyze it using network-based link prediction methods to identify potential drug-disease combinations. We measure the efficacy of these methods using cross-validation tests and find that several methods, particularly those based on graph embedding and network model fitting, achieve impressive prediction performance, significantly better than previous approaches, with area under the ROC curve above 0.95 and average precision almost a thousand times better than chance.

Abstract:
Species distribution models (SDMs), which aim to predict species occurrence based on environmental variables, are widely used to monitor and respond to biodiversity change. Recent deep learning advances for SDMs have been shown to perform well on complex and heterogeneous datasets, but their effectiveness remains limited by spatial biases in the data. In this paper, we revisit deep SDMs from a Bayesian perspective and introduce BATIS, a novel and practical framework wherein prior predictions are updated iteratively using limited observational data. Models must appropriately capture both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty to effectively combine fine-grained local insights with broader ecological patterns. We benchmark an extensive set of uncertainty quantification approaches on a novel dataset including citizen science observations from the eBird platform. Our empirical study shows how Bayesian deep learning approaches can greatly improve the reliability of SDMs in data-scarce locations, which can contribute to ecological understanding and conservation efforts.

Abstract:
High-throughput phenotypic screens generate vast microscopy image datasets that push the limits of generative models due to their large dimensionality. Despite the growing popularity of general-purpose models trained on natural images for microscopy data analysis, their suitability in this domain has not been quantitatively demonstrated. We present the first systematic evaluation of Stable Diffusion's variational autoencoder (SD-VAE) for reconstructing Cell Painting images, assessing performance across a large dataset with diverse molecular perturbations and cell types. We find that SD-VAE reconstructions preserve phenotypic signals with minimal loss, supporting its use in microscopy workflows. To benchmark reconstruction quality, we compare pixel-level, embedding-based, latent-space, and retrieval-based metrics for a biologically informed evaluation. We show that general-purpose feature extractors like InceptionV3 match or surpass publicly available bespoke models in retrieval tasks, simplifying future pipelines. Our findings offer practical guidelines for evaluating generative models on microscopy data and support the use of off-the-shelf models in phenotypic drug discovery.

Abstract:
Application of machine learning techniques enables segmentation of functional tissue units in histology whole-slide images (WSIs). We built a pipeline to apply previously validated segmentation models of kidney structures and extract quantitative features from these structures. Such quantitative analysis also requires qualitative inspection of results for quality control, exploration, and communication. We extend the Vitessce web-based visualization tool to enable visualization of segmentations of multiple types of functional tissue units, such as, glomeruli, tubules, arteries/arterioles in the kidney. Moreover, we propose a standard representation for files containing multiple segmentation bitmasks, which we define polymorphically, such that existing formats including OME-TIFF, OME-NGFF, AnnData, MuData, and SpatialData can be used. We demonstrate that these methods enable researchers and the broader public to interactively explore datasets containing multiple segmented entities and associated features, including for exploration of renal morphometry of biopsies from the Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP) and the Human Biomolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP).

Abstract:
Accurate segmentation and precise morphological analysis of neuronal cells in fluorescence microscopy images are crucial steps in neuroscience and biomedical imaging applications. However, this process is labor-intensive and time-consuming, requiring significant manual effort and expertise to ensure reliable outcomes. This work presents a pipeline for neuron instance segmentation and measurement based on a high-resolution dataset of stem-cell-derived neurons. The proposed method uses YOLOv8, trained on manually annotated microscopy images. The model achieved high segmentation accuracy, exceeding 97%. In addition, the pipeline utilized both ground truth and predicted masks to extract biologically significant features, including cell length, width, area, and grayscale intensity values. The overall accuracy of the extracted morphological measurements reached 75.32%, further supporting the effectiveness of the proposed approach. This integrated framework offers a valuable tool for automated analysis in cell imaging and neuroscience research, reducing the need for manual annotation and enabling scalable, precise quantification of neuron morphology.

Abstract:
Early identification of sensitive cancer cell lines is essential for accelerating biomarker discovery and elucidating drug mechanism of action. Given the efficiency and low cost of small-scale drug screens relative to extensive omics profiling, we compared drug-response panel (DRP) descriptors against omics features for predictive capacity using gradient boosting tree models across the GDSC and CCLE drug response datasets. DRP descriptors consistently outperformed omics data across key performance metrics, with variable performance across different drugs. Using complementary explainability approaches, we confirmed known MAPK-inhibitor sensitivity signatures, and identified novel potential biomarker candidates for MEK1/2 and BTK/MNK inhibitors. Lastly, to demonstrate the utility of this approach in distinguishing phenotypes, we applied our models to the breast cancer line MCF7 versus the non-tumorigenic MCF10A, and successfully identified compounds that selectively inhibit MCF7 while sparing the non-tumorigenic MCF10A. This methodology, developed using focused drug and cell line panels, supports early-stage drug development by facilitating rational cell line selection and compound prioritisation, enabling more efficient biomarker identification and candidate assessment.

Multi-omics data integration is crucial for understanding complex diseases, yet limited sample sizes, noise, and heterogeneity often reduce predictive power. To address these challenges, we introduce Omics-GAN, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based framework designed to generate high-quality synthetic multi-omics profiles while preserving biological relationships. We evaluated Omics-GAN on three omics types (mRNA, miRNA, and DNA methylation) using the ROSMAP cohort for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and TCGA datasets for colon and liver cancer. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier with repeated 5-fold cross-validation demonstrated that synthetic datasets consistently improved prediction accuracy compared to original omics profiles. The AUC of SVM for mRNA improved from 0.72 to 0.74 in AD, and from 0.68 to 0.72 in liver cancer. Synthetic miRNA enhanced classification in colon cancer from 0.59 to 0.69, while synthetic methylation data improved performance in liver cancer from 0.64 to 0.71. Boxplot analyses confirmed that synthetic data preserved statistical distributions while reducing noise and outliers. Feature selection identified significant genes overlapping with original datasets and revealed additional candidates validated by GO and KEGG enrichment analyses. Finally, molecular docking highlighted potential drug repurposing candidates, including Nilotinib for AD, Atovaquone for liver cancer, and Tecovirimat for colon cancer. Omics-GAN enhances disease prediction, preserves biological fidelity, and accelerates biomarker and drug discovery, offering a scalable strategy for precision medicine applications.

Abstract:
Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder that necessitates novel therapeutic innovations due to its gradual progression and the onset of various metabolic complications. Research indicates that Ficus religiosa is a conventional medicinal plant that generates bioactive phytochemicals with potential antidiabetic properties. The investigation employs ecosystem-based computational approaches utilizing artificial intelligence to investigate and evaluate compounds derived from Ficus religiosa that exhibit antidiabetic properties. A comprehensive computational procedure incorporated machine learning methodologies, molecular docking techniques, and ADMET prediction systems to assess phytochemical efficacy against the significant antidiabetic enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4). DeepBindGCN and the AutoDock software facilitated the investigation of binding interactions via deep learning technology. Flavonoids and alkaloids have emerged as attractive phytochemicals due to their strong binding interactions and advantageous pharmacological effects, as indicated by the study. The introduction of AI accelerated screening procedures and enhanced accuracy rates, demonstrating its efficacy in researching plant-based antidiabetic agents. The scientific foundation now facilitates future experimental validation of natural product therapies tailored for diabetic management.

Abstract:
Tissue dynamics play a crucial role in biological processes ranging from inflammation to morphogenesis. However, these noisy multicellular dynamics are notoriously hard to predict. Here, we introduce a biomimetic machine learning framework capable of inferring noisy multicellular dynamics directly from experimental movies. This generative model combines graph neural networks, normalizing flows and WaveNet algorithms to represent tissues as neural stochastic differential equations where cells are edges of an evolving graph. Cell interactions are encoded in a dual signaling graph capable of handling signaling cascades. The dual graph architecture of our neural networks reflects the architecture of the underlying biological tissues, substantially reducing the amount of data needed for training, compared to convolutional or fully-connected neural networks. Taking epithelial tissue experiments as a case study, we show that our model not only captures stochastic cell motion but also predicts the evolution of cell states in their division cycle. Finally, we demonstrate that our method can accurately generate the experimental dynamics of developmental systems, such as the fly wing, and cell signaling processes mediated by stochastic ERK waves, paving the way for its use as a digital twin in bioengineering and clinical contexts.

Abstract:
AlphaFold has transformed protein structure prediction, but emerging applications such as virtual ligand screening, proteome-wide folding, and de novo binder design demand predictions at a massive scale, where runtime and memory costs become prohibitive. A major bottleneck lies in the Pairformer backbone of AlphaFold3-style models, which relies on computationally expensive triangular primitives-especially triangle attention-for pairwise reasoning. We introduce Pairmixer, a streamlined alternative that eliminates triangle attention while preserving higher-order geometric reasoning capabilities that are critical for structure prediction. Pairmixer substantially improves computational efficiency, matching state-of-the-art structure predictors across folding and docking benchmarks, delivering up to 4x faster inference on long sequences while reducing training cost by 34%. Its efficiency alleviates the computational burden of downstream applications such as modeling large protein complexes, high-throughput ligand and binder screening, and hallucination-based design. Within BoltzDesign, for example, Pairmixer delivers over 2x faster sampling and scales to sequences ~30% longer than the memory limits of Pairformer.

Abstract:
A fundamental challenge in protein design is the trade-off between generating structural diversity while preserving motif biological function. Current state-of-the-art methods, such as partial diffusion in RFdiffusion, often fail to resolve this trade-off: small perturbations yield motifs nearly identical to the native structure, whereas larger perturbations violate the geometric constraints necessary for biological function. We introduce Protein Generation with Embedding Learning (PGEL), a general framework that learns high-dimensional embeddings encoding sequence and structural features of a target motif in the representation space of a diffusion model's frozen denoiser, and then enhances motif diversity by introducing controlled perturbations in the embedding space. PGEL is thus able to loosen geometric constraints while satisfying typical design metrics, leading to more diverse yet viable structures. We demonstrate PGEL on three representative cases: a monomer, a protein-protein interface, and a cancer-related transcription factor complex. In all cases, PGEL achieves greater structural diversity, better designability, and improved self-consistency, as compared to partial diffusion. Our results establish PGEL as a general strategy for embedding-driven protein generation allowing for systematic, viable diversification of functional motifs.

Abstract:
Personalized oncology aims to tailor treatment strategies to the unique molecular and clinical profiles of individual patients, moving beyond the traditional paradigm of treating the disease not the patient. Achieving this vision requires the integration and interpretation of vast, heterogeneous biomedical data within a meaningful scientific framework. Knowledge graphs, structured according to biomedical ontologies, offer a powerful approach to contextualize and interconnect diverse datasets, enabling more precise and informed clinical decision-making.   We present ECKO (Explainable Clinical Knowledge for Oncology), a comprehensive knowledge graph that integrates 33 biomedical ontologies and aggregates data from multiple studies to create a unified resource optimized for data-driven clinical applications in oncology. Designed to support personalized drug recommendations, ECKO facilitates the identification of optimal therapeutic options by linking patient-specific molecular data to relevant pharmacological knowledge. It provides transparent, interpretable explanations for drug recommendations, fostering greater trust and understanding among clinicians and researchers. This resource represents a significant advancement toward explainable, scalable, and clinically actionable personalized medicine in oncology, with potential applications in biomarker discovery, treatment optimization, and translational research.

Abstract:
Feature selection is a combinatorial optimization problem that is NP-hard. Conventional approaches often employ heuristic or greedy strategies, which are prone to premature convergence and may fail to capture subtle yet informative features. This limitation becomes especially critical in high-dimensional datasets, where complex and interdependent feature relationships prevail. We introduce the HeFS (Helper-Enhanced Feature Selection) framework to refine feature subsets produced by existing algorithms. HeFS systematically searches the residual feature space to identify a Helper Set - features that complement the original subset and improve classification performance. The approach employs a biased initialization scheme and a ratio-guided mutation mechanism within a genetic algorithm, coupled with Pareto-based multi-objective optimization to jointly maximize predictive accuracy and feature complementarity. Experiments on 18 benchmark datasets demonstrate that HeFS consistently identifies overlooked yet informative features and achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods, including in challenging domains such as gastric cancer classification, drug toxicity prediction, and computer science applications.

Abstract:
Quantification of protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) fluorescence in human brain tumours has the potential to significantly improve patient outcomes in neuro-oncology, but represents a formidable imaging challenge. Protoporphyrin is a biological molecule which interacts with the tissue micro-environment to form two photochemical states in glioma. Each exhibits markedly different quantum efficiencies, with distinct but overlapping emission spectra that also overlap with tissue autofluorescence. Fluorescence emission is known to be distorted by the intrinsic optical properties of tissue, coupled with marked intra-tumoural heterogeneity as a hallmark of glioma tumours. Existing quantitative fluorescence systems are developed and validated using simplified phantoms that do not simultaneously mimic the complex interactions between fluorophores and tissue optical properties or micro-environment. Consequently, existing systems risk introducing systematic errors into PpIX quantification when used in tissue. In this work, we introduce a novel pipeline for quantification of PpIX in glioma, which robustly differentiates both emission states from background autofluorescence without reliance on a priori spectral information, and accounts for variations in their quantum efficiency. Unmixed PpIX emission forms are then corrected for wavelength-dependent optical distortions and weighted for accurate quantification. Significantly, this pipeline is developed and validated using novel tissue-mimicking phantoms replicating the optical properties of glioma tissues and photochemical variability of PpIX fluorescence in glioma. Our workflow achieves strong correlation with ground-truth PpIX concentrations (R2 = 0.918+-0.002), demonstrating its potential for robust, quantitative PpIX fluorescence imaging in clinical settings.

Abstract:
Accurate early prediction of in-hospital mortality in intensive care units (ICUs) is essential for timely clinical intervention and efficient resource allocation. This study develops and evaluates machine learning models that integrate both structured clinical data and unstructured textual information, specifically discharge summaries and radiology reports, from the MIMIC-IV database. We used LASSO and XGBoost for feature selection, followed by a multivariate logistic regression trained on the top features identified by both models. Incorporating textual features using TF-IDF and BERT embeddings significantly improved predictive performance. The final logistic regression model, which combined structured and textual input, achieved an AUC of 0.918, compared to 0.753 when using structured data alone, a relative improvement 22%. The analysis of the decision curve demonstrated a superior standardized net benefit in a wide range of threshold probabilities (0.2-0.8), confirming the clinical utility of the model. These results underscore the added prognostic value of unstructured clinical notes and support their integration into interpretable feature-driven risk prediction models for ICU patients.

Abstract:
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) disrupts thalamocortical connectivity, contributing to cognitive impairment and post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE). This study presents a novel tractography-based framework that leverages diffusion maps to capture microstructural and organizational changes in thalamic white matter pathways. By analyzing individual streamline characteristics, we identified significant associations between diffusion map embeddings and functional outcomes (GOSE scores), highlighting potential biomarkers for injury severity and recovery trajectories. Our findings suggest that fine-grained geometric features of white matter tracts may provide a more sensitive marker for TBI-related alterations.

Abstract:
The dynamics of tumor-immune interactions within a complex tumor microenvironment are typically modeled using a system of ordinary differential equations or partial differential equations. These models introduce some unknown parameters that need to be estimated accurately and efficiently from the limited and noisy experimental data. Moreover, due to the intricate biological complexity and limitations in experimental measurements, tumor-immune dynamics are not fully understood, and therefore, only partial knowledge of the underlying physics may be available, resulting in unknown or missing terms within the system of equations. In this study, we develop a cancer biology-informed neural network model(CBINN) to infer the unknown parameters in the system of equations as well as to discover the missing physics from sparse and noisy measurements. We test the performance of the CBINN model on three distinct nonlinear compartmental tumor-immune models and evaluate its robustness across multiple synthetic noise levels. By harnessing these highly nonlinear dynamics, our CBINN framework effectively estimates the unknown model parameters and uncovers the underlying physical laws or mathematical structures that govern these biological systems, even from scattered and noisy measurements. The models chosen here represent the dynamic patterns commonly observed in compartmental models of tumor-immune interactions, thereby validating the generalizability and efficacy of our methodology.

Abstract:
Protein-protein docking tools help in studying interactions between proteins, and are essential for drug, vaccine, and therapeutic development. However, the accuracy of a docking tool depends on a robust scoring function that can reliably differentiate between native and non-native complexes. PIsToN is a state-of-the-art deep learning-based scoring function that uses Vision Transformers in its architecture. Recently, the Mamba architecture has demonstrated exceptional performance in both natural language processing and computer vision, often outperforming Transformer-based models in their domains. In this study, we introduce PUMBA (Protein-protein interface evaluation with Vision Mamba), which improves PIsToN by replacing its Vision Transformer backbone with Vision Mamba. This change allows us to leverage Mamba's efficient long-range sequence modeling for sequences of image patches. As a result, the model's ability to capture both global and local patterns in protein-protein interface features is significantly improved. Evaluation on several widely-used, large-scale public datasets demonstrates that PUMBA consistently outperforms its original Transformer-based predecessor, PIsToN.

Abstract:
Modeling dynamical systems and unraveling their underlying causal relationships is central to many domains in the natural sciences. Various physical systems, such as those arising in cell biology, are inherently high-dimensional and stochastic in nature, and admit only partial, noisy state measurements. This poses a significant challenge for addressing the problems of modeling the underlying dynamics and inferring the network structure of these systems. Existing methods are typically tailored either for structure learning or modeling dynamics at the population level, but are limited in their ability to address both problems together. In this work, we address both problems simultaneously: we present StructureFlow, a novel and principled simulation-free approach for jointly learning the structure and stochastic population dynamics of physical systems. We showcase the utility of StructureFlow for the tasks of structure learning from interventions and dynamical (trajectory) inference of conditional population dynamics. We empirically evaluate our approach on high-dimensional synthetic systems, a set of biologically plausible simulated systems, and an experimental single-cell dataset. We show that StructureFlow can learn the structure of underlying systems while simultaneously modeling their conditional population dynamics -- a key step toward the mechanistic understanding of systems behavior.

Abstract:
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk stratification remains a major challenge due to its multifactorial nature and limited availability of high-quality labeled datasets. While genomic and electrophysiological data such as SNP variants and ECG phenotypes are increasingly accessible, effectively integrating these modalities in low-label settings is non-trivial. This challenge arises from the scarcity of well-annotated multimodal datasets and the high dimensionality of biological signals, which limit the effectiveness of conventional supervised models. To address this, we present a few-label multimodal framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to combine genetic and electrophysiological information for cardiovascular risk stratification. Our approach incorporates a pseudo-label refinement strategy to adaptively distill high-confidence labels from weakly supervised predictions, enabling robust model fine-tuning with only a small set of ground-truth annotations. To enhance the interpretability, we frame the task as a Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning problem, prompting the model to produce clinically relevant rationales alongside predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that the integration of multimodal inputs, few-label supervision, and CoT reasoning improves robustness and generalizability across diverse patient profiles. Experimental results using multimodal SNP variants and ECG-derived features demonstrated comparable performance to models trained on the full dataset, underscoring the promise of LLM-based few-label multimodal modeling for advancing personalized cardiovascular care.

Abstract:
Current spinal pain management procedures, such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and epidural steroid injection (ESI), rely on fluoroscopy for needle placement which exposes patients and physicians to ionizing radiation. In this paper, we investigate a radiation-free surgical navigation system for spinal pain management procedures that combines magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with fiducial ArUco marker-based augmented reality (AR). High-resolution MRI scans of a lumbar spinal phantom were obtained and assembled as a surface mesh. Laplacian smoothing algorithms were then applied to smoothen the surface and improve the model fidelity. A commercially available stereo camera (ZED2) was used to track single or dual fiducial ArUco markers on the patient to determine the patient's real-time pose. Custom AR software was applied to overlay the MRI image onto the patient, allowing the physician to see not only the outer surface of the patient but also the complete anatomy of the patient below the surface. Needle-insertion trials on a 3D-printed 3-vertebra phantom showed that dual-ArUco marker tracking increased the accuracy of needle insertions and reduced the average needle misplacement distance compared to single-ArUco marker procedures. The average needle misplacement is comparable to the average deviation of 2 mm for conventional epidural techniques using fluoroscopy. Our radiation-free system demonstrates promise to serve as an alternative to fluoroscopy by improving image-guided spinal navigation.

Abstract:
The transport and localization of RNA molecules, crucial for cellular function and development, involve a combination of diffusion and active transport mechanisms. Here, we are motivated by understanding the dynamics of RNA in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) is an experimental technique that is widely used to investigate the dynamics of molecular movement within cells by observing the recovery of fluorescence intensity in a photobleached region over time. To advance the understanding of RNA dynamics, we develop a reaction-diffusion-advection partial differential equation (PDE) model integrating both transport and diffusion mechanisms. We propose a pipeline for identifiability analysis to assess the model's ability to uniquely determine parameter values from observed FRAP data. Based on profile likelihood analysis and reparametrization, we examine the relationship between non- identifiable parameters, which improves the robustness of parameter estimation. We find out that the identifiability of the four parameters of interest is not exactly the same in different regions of the cell. Specifically, transport velocity and diffusion coefficient are identifiable in all regions of the cell, while some combinations of binding rate and unbinding rate are found to be identifiable near the nucleus.

Abstract:
Recent advances in protein structure prediction, such as AlphaFold, have demonstrated the power of deep neural architectures like the Evoformer for capturing complex spatial and evolutionary constraints on protein conformation. However, the depth of the Evoformer, comprising 48 stacked blocks, introduces high computational costs and rigid layerwise discretization. Inspired by Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs), we propose a continuous-depth formulation of the Evoformer, replacing its 48 discrete blocks with a Neural ODE parameterization that preserves its core attention-based operations. This continuous-time Evoformer achieves constant memory cost (in depth) via the adjoint method, while allowing a principled trade-off between runtime and accuracy through adaptive ODE solvers. Benchmarking on protein structure prediction tasks, we find that the Neural ODE-based Evoformer produces structurally plausible predictions and reliably captures certain secondary structure elements, such as alpha-helices, though it does not fully replicate the accuracy of the original architecture. However, our model achieves this performance using dramatically fewer resources, just 17.5 hours of training on a single GPU, highlighting the promise of continuous-depth models as a lightweight and interpretable alternative for biomolecular modeling. This work opens new directions for efficient and adaptive protein structure prediction frameworks.

Abstract:
Spatial transcriptomics allows researchers to visualize and analyze gene expression within the precise location of tissues or cells. It provides spatially resolved gene expression data but often lacks cellular resolution, necessitating cell type deconvolution to infer cellular composition at each spatial location. In this paper we propose BASIN for cell type deconvolution, which models deconvolution as a nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) problem incorporating graph Laplacian prior. Rather than find a deterministic optima like other recent methods, we propose a matrix variate Bayesian NMF method with nonnegativity and sparsity priors, in which the variables are maintained in their matrix form to derive a more efficient matrix normal posterior. BASIN employs a Gibbs sampler to approximate the posterior distribution of cell type proportions and other parameters, offering a distribution of possible solutions, enhancing robustness and providing inherent uncertainty quantification. The performance of BASIN is evaluated on different spatial transcriptomics datasets and outperforms other deconvolution methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency. The results also show the effect of the incorporated priors and reflect a truncated matrix normal distribution as we expect.

Abstract:
We propose CITE V.1, an agentic, evidence-grounded framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide transparent and reproducible interpretations of RNA-seq clusters. Unlike existing enrichment-based approaches that reduce results to broad statistical associations and LLM-only models that risk unsupported claims or fabricated citations, CITE V.1 transforms cluster interpretation by producing biologically coherent explanations explicitly anchored in the biomedical literature. The framework orchestrates three specialized agents: a Retriever that gathers domain knowledge from PubMed and UniProt, an Interpreter that formulates functional hypotheses, and Critics that evaluate claims, enforce evidence grounding, and qualify uncertainty through confidence and reliability indicators. Applied to Salmonella enterica RNA-seq data, CITE V.1 generated biologically meaningful insights supported by the literature, while an LLM-only Gemini baseline frequently produced speculative results with false citations. By moving RNA-seq analysis from surface-level enrichment to auditable, interpretable, and evidence-based hypothesis generation, CITE V.1 advances the transparency and reliability of AI in biomedicine.

Abstract:
Emergency departments worldwide face rising patient volumes, workforce shortages, and variability in triage decisions that threaten the delivery of timely and accurate care. Current triage methods rely primarily on vital signs, routine laboratory values, and clinicians' judgment, which, while effective, often miss emerging biological signals that could improve risk prediction for infection typing or antibiotic administration in acute conditions. To address this challenge, we introduce TriAgent, a large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent framework that couples automated biomarker discovery with deep research for literature-grounded validation and novelty assessment. TriAgent employs a supervisor research agent to generate research topics and delegate targeted queries to specialized sub-agents for evidence retrieval from various data sources. Findings are synthesized to classify biomarkers as either grounded in existing knowledge or flagged as novel candidates, offering transparent justification and highlighting unexplored pathways in acute care risk stratification. Unlike prior frameworks limited to existing routine clinical biomarkers, TriAgent aims to deliver an end-to-end framework from data analysis to literature grounding to improve transparency, explainability and expand the frontier of potentially actionable clinical biomarkers. Given a user's clinical query and quantitative triage data, TriAgent achieved a topic adherence F1 score of 55.7 +/- 5.0%, surpassing the CoT-ReAct agent by over 10%, and a faithfulness score of 0.42 +/- 0.39, exceeding all baselines by more than 50%. Across experiments, TriAgent consistently outperformed state-of-the-art LLM-based agentic frameworks in biomarker justification and literature-grounded novelty assessment.

Abstract:
Identifying the effects of mechanical ventilation strategies and protocols in critical care requires analyzing data from heterogeneous patient-ventilator systems within the context of the clinical decision-making environment. This research develops a framework to help understand the consequences of mechanical ventilation (MV) and adjunct care decisions on patient outcome from observations of critical care patients receiving MV. Developing an understanding of and improving critical care respiratory management requires the analysis of existing secondary-use clinical data to generate hypotheses about advantageous variations and adaptations of current care. This work introduces a perspective of the joint patient-ventilator-care systems (so-called J6) to develop a scalable method for analyzing data and trajectories of these complex systems. To that end, breath behaviors are analyzed using evolutionary game theory (EGT), which generates the necessary quantitative precursors for deeper analysis through probabilistic and stochastic machinery such as reinforcement learning. This result is one step along the pathway toward MV optimization and personalization. The EGT-based process is analytically validated on synthetic data to reveal potential caveats before proceeding to real-world ICU data applications that expose complexities of the data-generating process J6. The discussion includes potential developments toward a state transition model for the simulating effects of MV decision using empirical and game-theoretic elements.

Abstract:
Viruses are microscopic infectious agents that require a host cell for replication. Viral replication occurs in several stages, and the completion time for each stage varies due to differences in the cellular environment. Thus, the time to complete each stage in viral replication is a random variable. However, no analytic expression exists for the viral population at the cellular level when the completion time for each process constituting viral replication is a random variable. This paper presents a simplified model of viral replication, treating each stage as a renewal process with independently and identically distributed completion times. Using the proposed model, we derive an analytical formula for viral populations at the cellular level, based on viewing viral replication as a birth-death process. The mean viral count is expressed via probability density functions representing the completion time for each step in the replication process. This work validates the results with stochastic simulations. This study provides a new quantitative framework for understanding viral infection dynamics.

Abstract:
In neuroscience, methods from information geometry (IG) have been successfully applied in the modelling of binary vectors from spike train data, using the orthogonal decomposition of the Kullback-Leibler divergence and mutual information to isolate different orders of interaction between neurons. While spike train data is well-approximated with a binary model, here we apply these IG methods to data from electroencephalography (EEG), a continuous signal requiring appropriate discretization strategies. We developed and compared three different binarization methods and used them to identify third-order interactions in an experiment involving imagined motor movements. The statistical significance of these interactions was assessed using phase-randomized surrogate data that eliminated higher-order dependencies while preserving the spectral characteristics of the original signals. We validated our approach by implementing known second- and third-order dependencies in a forward model and quantified information attenuation at different steps of the analysis. This revealed that the greatest loss in information occurred when going from the idealized binary case to enforcing these dependencies using oscillatory signals. When applied to the real EEG dataset, our analysis detected statistically significant third-order interactions during the task condition despite the relatively sparse data (45 trials per condition). This work demonstrates that IG methods can successfully extract genuine higher-order dependencies from continuous neural recordings when paired with appropriate binarization schemes.

Comment: accepted to BioImage Computing workshop @ ICCV 2025

Abstract:
Quantitative analysis of multidimensional biological images is useful for understanding complex cellular phenotypes and accelerating advances in biomedical research. As modern microscopy generates ever-larger 2D and 3D datasets, existing computational approaches are increasingly limited by their scalability, efficiency, and integration with modern scientific computing workflows. Existing bioimage analysis tools often lack application programmable interfaces (APIs), do not support graphics processing unit (GPU) acceleration, lack broad 3D image processing capabilities, and/or have poor interoperability for compute-heavy workflows. Here, we introduce cubic, an open-source Python library that addresses these challenges by augmenting widely used SciPy and scikit-image APIs with GPU-accelerated alternatives from CuPy and RAPIDS cuCIM. cubic's API is device-agnostic and dispatches operations to GPU when data reside on the device and otherwise executes on CPU, seamlessly accelerating a broad range of image processing routines. This approach enables GPU acceleration of existing bioimage analysis workflows, from preprocessing to segmentation and feature extraction for 2D and 3D data. We evaluate cubic both by benchmarking individual operations and by reproducing existing deconvolution and segmentation pipelines, achieving substantial speedups while maintaining algorithmic fidelity. These advances establish a robust foundation for scalable, reproducible bioimage analysis that integrates with the broader Python scientific computing ecosystem, including other GPU-accelerated methods, enabling both interactive exploration and automated high-throughput analysis workflows. cubic is openly available at https://github$.$com/alxndrkalinin/cubic

Abstract:
Dengue remains one of Brazil's major epidemiological challenges, marked by strong intra-urban inequalities and the influence of climatic and socio-environmental factors. This study analyzed confirmed dengue cases in Recife from 2015 to 2024 using a Bayesian hierarchical spatio-temporal model implemented in R-INLA, combining a BYM2 spatial structure with an RW1 temporal component. Covariates included population density, household size, income, drainage channels, lagged precipitation, and mean temperature. Population density and household size had positive effects on dengue risk, while income and channel presence were protective. Lagged precipitation increased risk, and higher temperatures showed an inverse association, suggesting thermal thresholds for vector activity. The model achieved good fit (DIC=65817; WAIC=64506) and stable convergence, with moderate residual spatial autocorrelation (phi=0.06) and a smooth temporal trend between 2016 and 2019. Spatio-temporal estimates revealed persistent high-risk clusters in northern and western Recife, overlapping with areas of higher density and social vulnerability. Beyond reproducing historical patterns, the Bayesian model supports probabilistic forecasting and early warning systems. Compared with classical models (GLM, SAR, GWR, GTWR), INLA explicitly integrates uncertainty and spatial-temporal dependence, offering credible interval inference for decision-making in urban health management.

Abstract:
We develop and validate a novel spherical radiomics framework for predicting key molecular biomarkers using multiparametric MRI. Conventional Cartesian radiomics extract tumor features on orthogonal grids, which do not fully capture the tumor's radial growth patterns and can be insensitive to evolving molecular signatures. In this study, we analyzed GBM radiomic features on concentric 2D shells, which were then mapped onto 2D planes for radiomics analysis. Radiomic features were extracted using PyRadiomics from four different regions in GBM. Feature selection was performed using ANOVA F-statistics. Classification was conducted with multiple machine-learning models. Model interpretability was evaluated through SHAP analysis, clustering analysis, feature significance profiling, and comparison between radiomic patterns and underlying biological processes. Spherical radiomics consistently outperformed conventional 2D and 3D Cartesian radiomics across all prediction tasks. The best framework reached an AUC of 0.85 for MGMT, 0.80 for EGFR, 0.80 for PTEN, and 0.83 for survival prediction. GLCM-derived features were identified as the most informative predictors. Radial transition analysis using the Mann-Whitney U-test demonstrates that transition slopes between T1-weighted contrast-enhancing and T2/FLAIR hyperintense lesion regions, as well as between T2 intense lesion and a 2 cm peritumoral expansion region, are significantly associated with biomarker status. Furthermore, the observed radiomic changes along the radial direction closely reflected known biological characteristics. Radiomic features extracted on the spherical surfaces at varying radial distances to the GBM tumor centroid are better correlated with important tumor molecular markers and patient survival than the conventional Cartesian analysis.

Abstract:
When modeling complex, hierarchical, and time-dynamic systems, such as biological systems, good computational tools are essential. Current tools, while powerful, often lack comprehensive frameworks for modular model composition, hierarchical system building, and time-dependent input handling, particularly within the Python ecosystem. We present SUND (Simulation Using Nonlinear Dynamic models), a Python toolbox designed to address these challenges. SUND provides a unified framework for defining, combining, and simulating multi-level time-dynamic systems. The toolbox enables users to define models with interconnectable inputs and outputs, facilitating the construction of complex systems from simpler, reusable components. It supports time-dependent functions and piecewise constant inputs, enabling intuitive simulation of various experimental conditions such as multiple dosing schemes. We demonstrate the toolbox's capabilities through simulation of a multi-level human glucose-insulin system model, showcasing its flexibility in handling multiple temporal scales, and levels of biological detail. SUND is open-source, easily extensible, and available at PyPI (https://pypi.org/project/sund/) and at Gitlab (https://gitlab.liu.se/ISBgroup/projects/sund/).

Abstract:
Objective: Quantitative real-time PCR is widely used for gene expression analysis, yet inconsistencies in data storage and reporting limit reproducibility. While MIQE guidelines define the minimal information required for publication, they do not specify structured digital storage formats compatible with long-term reanalysis. This work presents qLOOK (qPCR-LOg-boOK), a tool for standardized digital storage and reproducible analysis of qPCR experiments. Results: qLOOK is a modular R-based system that extracts data from Thermo Fisher/ABI .EDS files, formats it into a structured table (qLOOK_Data.xlsx), performs normalization and statistical analysis, and generates a log file (qLOOK_Summary.txt) recording reference genes, calibrators, and analytical parameters. All required R libraries are automatically installed and loaded, allowing researchers without coding experience to use the scripts. By preserving the qLOOK_Data table and the qLOOK_Summary log, users can reproduce or extend analyses without reprocessing raw files. While currently limited to .EDS files, the modular design allows adaptation to additional qPCR formats in the future. Besides providing an easy and transparent approach to analyze qPCR experiments, qLOOK also provides a minimal, standardized, and transparent solution for digital documentation, enhancing reproducibility, supporting long-term data stewardship, and facilitating integration into electronic laboratory notebooks or publication supplementary material.

Abstract:
This study introduces a Holographic Agglutination Assay for quantifying levels of the immunoglobulin protein IgA in biological samples. This is the first example of a label-free and bead-free assay that quantifies protein agglutinates by direct detection using Total Holographic Characterization. A proof-of-concept assay for human serum immunoglobulins is demonstrated using Jacalin, the galactose-specific plant lectin, to induce selective agglutination.   By analyzing the size, refractive index, and number of particles in an assay sample, we obtain a reproducible and quantitative measurement of galactosylated immunoglobulins in a given sample. The assay is calibrated for a physiologically relevant reference interval of IgA concentrations in a 10x diluted emulated biological sample from low (80 mg/dL, 5 μM) to high (320 mg/dL, 20 μM) levels. The assay clearly distinguishes samples containing IgA from samples containing IgG.   More broadly, this study introduces a platform for creating lectin-mediated Holographic Agglutination Assays to monitor levels of immunoglobulins in biological samples. The ability to quantify immunoglobulin levels efficiently in clinical samples is likely to be valuable for diagnostics and will provide a basis for assaying other proteins that can be induced to agglutinate.

Abstract:
Oral mucosal diseases such as leukoplakia, oral lichen planus, and recurrent   aphthous ulcers exhibit diverse and overlapping visual features,   making diagnosis challenging for non-specialists. While vision-language   models (VLMs) have shown promise in medical image interpretation,   their application in oral healthcare remains underexplored due to   the lack of large-scale, well-annotated datasets. In this work, we present   \textbf{OralGPT}, the first domain-specific two-stage vision-language   framework designed for oral mucosal disease diagnosis and captioning.   In Stage 1, OralGPT learns visual representations and disease-related   concepts from classification labels. In Stage 2, it enhances its language   generation ability using long-form expert-authored captions. To   overcome the annotation bottleneck, we propose a novel similarity-guided   data augmentation strategy that propagates descriptive knowledge from   expert-labeled images to weakly labeled ones. We also construct the   first benchmark dataset for oral mucosal diseases, integrating multi-source   image data with both structured and unstructured textual annotations.   Experimental results on four common oral conditions demonstrate that   OralGPT achieves competitive diagnostic performance while generating   fluent, clinically meaningful image descriptions. This study   provides a foundation for language-assisted diagnostic tools in oral   healthcare.

Abstract:
Purpose: To improve the accuracy of multiparametric estimation, including myelin water fraction (MWF) quantification, and reduce scan time in 3D-QALAS by optimizing sequence parameters, using a self-supervised multilayer perceptron network. Methods: We jointly optimize flip angles, T2 preparation durations, and sequence gaps for T1 recovery using a self-supervised MLP trained to minimize a Cramer-Rao bound-based loss function, with explicit constraints on total scan time. The optimization targets white matter, gray matter, and myelin water tissues, and its performance was validated through simulation, phantom, and in vivo experiments. Results: Building on our previously proposed MWF-QALAS method for simultaneous MWF, T1, and T2 mapping, the optimized sequence reduces the number of readouts from six to five and achieves a scan time nearly one minute shorter, while also yielding higher T1 and T2 accuracy and improved MWF maps. This sequence enables simultaneous multiparametric quantification, including MWF, at 1 mm isotropic resolution within 3 minutes and 30 seconds. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that optimizing sequence parameters using a self-supervised MLP network improved T1, T2 and MWF estimation accuracy, while reducing scan time.

Abstract:
Modeling cellular responses to genetic and chemical perturbations remains a central challenge in single-cell biology. Existing data-driven framework have advanced perturbation prediction through variational autoencoders, chemically conditioned autoencoders, and large-scale transformer pretraining. However, these models are prone to local optima in the nonconvex Waddington landscape of cell fate decisions, where poor initialization can trap trajectories in spurious lineages or implausible differentiation outcomes. While executable gene regulatory networks complement these approaches, automated design frameworks incorporate biological priors through multi-agent optimization. Yet, an approach that is completely data-driven with well-designed initialization to escape local optima and converge to a proper lineage remains elusive. In this work, we introduce a multistage reinforcement learning algorithm tailored for single-cell perturbation modeling. We first compute an explicit natural gradient update using Fisher-vector products and a conjugate gradient solver, scaled by a KL trust-region constraint to provide a safe, curvature-aware the first step for the policy. Starting with these preconditioned parameters, we then apply a second phase of proximal policy optimization (PPO) with clipped surrogates, exploiting minibatch efficiency to refine the policy. We demonstrate that this initialization substantially improves generalization on Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and Single-cell ATAC sequencing (scATAC-seq) pertubation analysis.

Abstract:
Phylogenetic inference, the task of reconstructing how related sequences evolved from common ancestors, is a central task in evolutionary genomics. The current state-of-the-art methods exploit probabilistic models of sequence evolution along phylogenetic trees, by searching for the tree maximizing the likelihood of observed sequences, or by estimating the posterior of the tree given the sequences in a Bayesian framework. Both approaches typically require to compute likelihoods, which is only feasible under simplifying assumptions such as independence of the evolution at the different positions of the sequence, and even then remains a costly operation. Here we present Phyloformer 2, the first likelihood-free inference method for posterior distributions over phylogenies. Phyloformer 2 exploits a novel encoding for pairs of sequences that makes it more scalable than previous approaches, and a parameterized probability distribution factorized over a succession of subtree merges. The resulting network provides accurate estimates of the posterior distribution, and outperforms both state-of-the-art maximum likelihood methods and a previous likelihood-free method for point estimation. It opens the way to fast and accurate phylogenetic inference under realistic models of sequence evolution.

Abstract:
mRNA design and optimization are important in synthetic biology and therapeutic development, but remain understudied in machine learning. Systematic optimization of mRNAs is hindered by the scarce and imbalanced data as well as complex sequence-function relationships. We present RNAGenScape, a property-guided manifold Langevin dynamics framework that iteratively updates mRNA sequences within a learned latent manifold. RNAGenScape combines an organized autoencoder, which structures the latent space by target properties for efficient and biologically plausible exploration, with a manifold projector that contracts each step of update back to the manifold. RNAGenScape supports property-guided optimization and smooth interpolation between sequences, while remaining robust under scarce and undersampled data, and ensuring that intermediate products are close to the viable mRNA manifold. Across three real mRNA datasets, RNAGenScape improves the target properties with high success rates and efficiency, outperforming various generative or optimization methods developed for proteins or non-biological data. By providing continuous, data-aligned trajectories that reveal how edits influence function, RNAGenScape establishes a scalable paradigm for controllable mRNA design and latent space exploration in mRNA sequence modeling.

Abstract:
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data simulation is limited by classical methods that rely on linear correlations, failing to capture the intrinsic, nonlinear dependencies. No existing simulator jointly models gene-gene and cell-cell interactions. We introduce qSimCells, a novel quantum computing-based simulator that employs entanglement to model intra- and inter-cellular interactions, generating realistic single-cell transcriptomes with cellular heterogeneity. The core innovation is a quantum kernel that uses a parameterized quantum circuit with CNOT gates to encode complex, nonlinear gene regulatory network (GRN) as well as cell-cell communication topologies with explicit causal directionality. The resulting synthetic data exhibits non-classical dependencies: standard correlation-based analyses (Pearson and Spearman) fail to recover the programmed causal pathways and instead report spurious associations driven by high baseline gene-expression probabilities. Furthermore, applying cell-cell communication detection to the simulated data validates the true mechanistic links, revealing a robust, up to 75-fold relative increase in inferred communication probability only when quantum entanglement is active. These results demonstrate that the quantum kernel is essential for producing high-fidelity ground-truth datasets and highlight the need for advanced inference techniques to capture the complex, non-classical dependencies inherent in gene regulation.

Abstract:
Mammalian tissue architecture is central to biological function, and its disruption is a hallmark of disease. Medical imaging techniques can generate large point cloud datasets that capture changes in the cellular composition of such tissues with disease progression. However, regions of interest (ROIs) are usually defined by quadrat-based methods that ignore intrinsic structure and risk fragmenting meaningful features. Here, we introduce TopROI, a topology-informed, network-based method for partitioning point clouds into ROIs that preserves both local geometry and higher-order architecture. TopROI integrates geometry-informed networks with persistent homology, combining cell neighbourhoods and multiscale cycles to guide community detection. Applied to synthetic point clouds that mimic glandular structure, TopROI outperforms quadrat-based and purely geometric partitions by maintaining biologically plausible ROI geometry and better preserving ground-truth structures. Applied to cellular point clouds obtained from human colorectal cancer biopsies, TopROI generates ROIs that preserve crypt-like structures and enable persistent homology analysis of individual regions. This study reveals a continuum of architectural changes from healthy mucosa to carcinoma, reflecting progressive disorganisation in tissue structure. TopROI thus provides a principled and flexible framework for defining biologically meaningful ROIs in large point clouds, enabling more accurate quantification of tissue organization and new insights into structural changes associated with disease progression.

Abstract:
Neurodegeneration, characterized by the progressive loss of neuronal structure or function, is commonly assessed in clinical practice through reductions in cortical thickness or brain volume, as visualized by structural MRI. While informative, these conventional approaches lack the statistical sophistication required to fully capture the spatially correlated and heterogeneous nature of neurodegeneration, which manifests both in healthy aging and in neurological disorders. To address these limitations, brain age gap has emerged as a promising data-driven biomarker of brain health. The brain age gap prediction (BAGP) models estimate the difference between a person's predicted brain age from neuroimaging data and their chronological age. The resulting brain age gap serves as a compact biomarker of brain health, with recent studies demonstrating its predictive utility for disease progression and severity. However, practical adoption of BAGP models is hindered by their methodological obscurities and limited generalizability across diverse clinical populations. This tutorial article provides an overview of BAGP and introduces a principled framework for this application based on recent advancements in graph signal processing (GSP). In particular, we focus on graph neural networks (GNNs) and introduce the coVariance neural network (VNN), which leverages the anatomical covariance matrices derived from structural MRI. VNNs offer strong theoretical grounding and operational interpretability, enabling robust estimation of brain age gap predictions. By integrating perspectives from GSP, machine learning, and network neuroscience, this work clarifies the path forward for reliable and interpretable BAGP models and outlines future research directions in personalized medicine.

Noninvasive prediction of HER2 status from dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) could streamline diagnostics and reduce reliance on biopsy. However, preprocessing high-dynamic-range DCE-MRI into standardized 8-bit RGB format for pretrained neural networks is nontrivial, and normalization strategy significantly affects model performance. We benchmarked intensity normalization strategies using a Triple-Head Dual-Attention ResNet that processes RGB-fused temporal sequences from three DCE phases. Trained on a multicenter cohort (n=1,149) from the I-SPY trials and externally validated on BreastDCEDL_AMBL (n=43 lesions), our model outperformed transformer-based architectures, achieving 0.75 accuracy and 0.74 AUC on I-SPY test data. N4 bias field correction slightly degraded performance. Without fine-tuning, external validation yielded 0.66 AUC, demonstrating cross-institutional generalizability. These findings highlight the effectiveness of dual-attention mechanisms in capturing transferable spatiotemporal features for HER2 stratification, advancing reproducible deep learning biomarkers in breast cancer imaging.

Abstract:
Cellular image segmentation is essential for quantitative biology yet remains difficult due to heterogeneous modalities, morphological variability, and limited annotations. We present GenCellAgent, a training-free multi-agent framework that orchestrates specialist segmenters and generalist vision-language models via a planner-executor-evaluator loop (choose tool $\rightarrow$ run $\rightarrow$ quality-check) with long-term memory. The system (i) automatically routes images to the best tool, (ii) adapts on the fly using a few reference images when imaging conditions differ from what a tool expects, (iii) supports text-guided segmentation of organelles not covered by existing models, and (iv) commits expert edits to memory, enabling self-evolution and personalized workflows. Across four cell-segmentation benchmarks, this routing yields a 15.7\% mean accuracy gain over state-of-the-art baselines. On endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria from new datasets, GenCellAgent improves average IoU by 37.6\% over specialist models. It also segments novel objects such as the Golgi apparatus via iterative text-guided refinement, with light human correction further boosting performance. Together, these capabilities provide a practical path to robust, adaptable cellular image segmentation without retraining, while reducing annotation burden and matching user preferences.

Abstract:
Chemical pretrained models, sometimes referred to as foundation models, are receiving considerable interest for drug discovery applications. The general chemical knowledge extracted from self-supervised training has the potential to improve predictions for critical drug discovery endpoints, including on-target potency and ADMET properties. Multi-task learning has previously been successfully leveraged to improve predictive models. Here, we show that enabling multitasking in finetuning of chemical pretrained graph neural network models such as Kinetic GROVER Multi-Task (KERMT), an enhanced version of the GROVER model, and Knowledge-guided Pre-training of Graph Transformer (KGPT) significantly improves performance over non-pretrained graph neural network models. Surprisingly, we find that the performance improvement from finetuning KERMT in a multitask manner is most significant at larger data sizes. Additionally, we publish two multitask ADMET data splits to enable more accurate benchmarking of multitask deep learning methods for drug property prediction. Finally, we provide an accelerated implementation of the KERMT model on GitHub, unlocking large-scale pretraining, finetuning, and inference in industrial drug discovery workflows.

Abstract:
Extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling is central to a wide variety of healthy and diseased tissue processes. Unfortunately, predicting ECM remodeling under various chemical and mechanical conditions has proven to be excessively challenging, due in part to its complex regulation by intracellular and extracellular molecular reaction networks that are spatially and temporally dynamic. We introduce ECMSim, which is a highly interactive, real-time, and web application designed to simulate heterogeneous matrix remodeling. The current model simulates cardiac scar tissue with configurable input conditions using a large-scale model of the cardiac fibroblast signaling network. Cardiac fibrosis is a major component of many forms of heart failure. ECMSim simulates over 1.3 million equations simultaneously in real time that include more than 125 species and more than 200 edges in each cell in a 100*100 spatial array (10,000 cells), which accounts for inputs, receptors, intracellular signaling cascades, ECM production, and feedback loops, as well as molecular diffusion. The algorithm is represented by a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that are coupled with ECM molecular diffusion. The equations are solved on demand using compiled C++ and the WebAssembly standard. The platform includes brush-style cell selection to target a subset of cells with adjustable input molecule concentrations, parameter sliders to adjust parameters on demand, and multiple coupled real-time visualizations of network dynamics at multiple scales. Implementing ECMSim in standard web technologies enables a fully functional application that combines real-time simulation, visual interaction, and model editing. The software enables the investigation of pathological or experimental conditions, hypothetical scenarios, matrix remodeling, or the testing of the effects of an experimental drug(s) with a target receptor.

Abstract:
DSC-MRI perfusion is a medical imaging technique for diagnosing and prognosing brain tumors and strokes. Its analysis relies on mathematical deconvolution, but noise or motion artifacts in a clinical environment can disrupt this process, leading to incorrect estimate of perfusion parameters. Although deep learning approaches have shown promising results, their calibration typically rely on third-party deconvolution algorithms to generate reference outputs and are bound to reproduce their limitations.   To adress this problem, we propose a physics-informed autoencoder that leverages an analytical model to decode the perfusion parameters and guide the learning of the encoding network. This autoencoder is trained in a self-supervised fashion without any third-party software and its performance is evaluated on a database with glioma patients. Our method shows reliable results for glioma grading in accordance with other well-known deconvolution algorithms despite a lower computation time. It also achieved competitive performance even in the presence of high noise which is critical in a medical environment.

Abstract:
Lightweight inference is critical for biomolecular structure prediction and downstream tasks, enabling efficient real-world deployment and inference-time scaling for large-scale applications. While AF3 and its variants (e.g., Protenix, Chai-1) have advanced structure prediction results, they suffer from critical limitations: high inference latency and cubic time complexity with respect to token count, both of which restrict scalability for large biomolecular complexes. To address the core challenge of balancing model efficiency and prediction accuracy, we introduce three key innovations: (1) compressing non-scalable operations to mitigate cubic time complexity, (2) removing redundant blocks across modules to reduce unnecessary overhead, and (3) adopting a few-step sampler for the atom diffusion module to accelerate inference. Building on these design principles, we develop Protenix-Mini+, a highly lightweight and scalable variant of the Protenix model. Within an acceptable range of performance degradation, it substantially improves computational efficiency. For example, in the case of low-homology single-chain proteins, Protenix-Mini+ experiences an intra-protein LDDT drop of approximately 3% relative to the full Protenix model -- an acceptable performance trade-off given its substantially 90%+ improved computational efficiency.

Abstract:
Prostate cancer (PCa) remains a significant global health concern among men, particularly due to the lethality of its more aggressive variants. Despite therapeutic advancements that have enhanced survival for many patients, high grade PCa continues to contribute substantially to cancer related mortality. Emerging evidence points to the MYB proto-oncogene as a critical factor in promoting tumor progression, therapeutic resistance, and disease relapse. Notably, differential expression patterns have been observed, with markedly elevated MYB levels in tumor tissues from Black men relative to their White counterparts potentially offering insight into documented racial disparities in clinical outcomes. This study investigates the association between MYB expression and key oncogenic features, including androgen receptor (AR) signaling, disease progression, and the risk of biochemical recurrence. Employing a multimodal approach that integrates histopathological examination, quantitative digital imaging, and analyses of public transcriptomic datasets, our findings suggest that MYB overexpression is strongly linked to adverse prognosis. These results underscore MYB's potential as a prognostic biomarker and as a candidate for the development of individualized therapeutic strategies.

Abstract:
High-resolution spatial transcriptomics (HR-ST) technologies offer unprecedented insights into tissue architecture but lack standardized frameworks for histological annotation. We present ST2HE, a cross-platform generative framework that synthesizes virtual hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) images directly from HR-ST data. ST2HE integrates nuclei morphology and spatial transcript coordinates using a one-step diffusion model, enabling histologically faithful image generation across diverse tissue types and HR-ST platforms. Conditional and tissue-independent variants support both known and novel tissue contexts. Evaluations on breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and Kaposi's sarcoma demonstrate ST2HE's ability to preserve morphological features and support downstream annotations of tissue histology and phenotype classification. Ablation studies reveal that larger context windows, balanced loss functions, and multi-colored transcript visualization enhance image fidelity. ST2HE bridges molecular and histological domains, enabling interpretable, scalable annotation of HR-ST data and advancing computational pathology.

Abstract:
The lack of standardization in seizure forecasting slows progress in the field and limits the clinical translation of forecasting models. In this work, we introduce a Python-based framework aimed at streamlining the development, assessment, and documentation of individualized seizure forecasting algorithms.   The framework automates data labeling, cross-validation splitting, forecast post-processing, performance evaluation, and reporting. It supports various forecasting horizons and includes a model card that documents implementation details, training and evaluation settings, and performance metrics. Three different models were implemented as a proof-of-concept. The models leveraged features extracted from time series data and seizure periodicity. Model performance was assessed using time series cross-validation and key deterministic and probabilistic metrics.   Implementation of the three models was successful, demonstrating the flexibility of the framework. The results also emphasize the importance of careful model interpretation due to variations in probability scaling, calibration, and subject-specific differences. Although formal usability metrics were not recorded, empirical observations suggest reduced development time and methodological consistency, minimizing unintentional variations that could affect the comparability of different approaches.   As a proof-of-concept, this validation is inherently limited, relying on a single-user experiment without statistical analyses or replication across independent datasets. At this stage, our objective is to make the framework publicly available to foster community engagement, facilitate experimentation, and gather feedback. In the long term, we aim to contribute to the establishment of a consensus on a standardized methodology for the development and validation of seizure forecasting algorithms in people with epilepsy.

Abstract:
As clinical data are becoming increasingly available, machine learning methods have been employed to extract knowledge from them and predict clinical events. While promising, approaches suffer from at least two main issues: low availability of labelled data and data heterogeneity leading to missing values. This work proposes the use of self-supervised auto-encoders to efficiently address these challenges. We apply our methodology to a clinical dataset from patients with ischaemic heart disease. Patient data is embedded in a latent space, built using unlabelled data, which is then used to train a neural network classifier to predict cardiovascular death. Results show improved balanced accuracy compared to applying the classifier directly to the raw data, demonstrating that this solution is promising, especially in conditions where availability of unlabelled data could increase.

Abstract:
Conflicting clinical trial results on omega-3 highly unsaturated fatty acids (n-3 HUFA) have prompted uncertainty about their cardioprotective effects. While the VITAL trial found no overall cardiovascular benefit from n-3 HUFA supplementation, its substantial African American (AfAm) enrollment provided a unique opportunity to explore racial differences in response to n-3 HUFA supplementation. The current observational study aimed to simulate randomized clinical trial (RCT) conditions by matching 3,766 AfAm and 15,553 non-Hispanic White (NHW) individuals from the VITAL trial utilizing propensity score matching to address the limitations related to differences in confounding variables between the two groups. Within matched groups (3,766 AfAm and 3,766 NHW), n-3 HUFA supplementation's impact on myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality was assessed. A weighted decision tree analysis revealed belonging to the n-3 supplementation group as the most significant predictor of MI among AfAm but not NHW. Further logistic regression using the LASSO method and bootstrap estimation of standard errors indicated n-3 supplementation significantly lowered MI risk in AfAm (OR 0.17, 95% CI [0.048, 0.60]), with no such effect in NHW. This study underscores the critical need for future RCT to explore racial disparities in MI risk associated with n-3 HUFA supplementation and highlights potential causal differences between supplementation health outcomes in AfAm versus NHW populations.

Abstract:
Electrode density optimization in electroencephalography (EEG)-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) requires balancing practical usability against signal fidelity, particularly for source localization. Reducing electrodes enhances portability but its effects on neural source reconstruction quality and source connectivity - treated as proxies to BCI performance - remain understudied. We address this gap through systematic evaluation of 62-, 32-, and 16-channel configurations using a fixed, fully automated processing pipeline applied to the well-characterized P300 potential. This approach's rationale is to minimize variability and bias inherent to EEG analysis by leveraging the P300's stimulus-locked reproducibility and pipeline standardization. Analyzing 63 sessions (31 subjects) from the Eye-BCI dataset with rigorous artifact correction and channel validation, we demonstrate: (1) Progressive degradation in source reconstruction quality with sparser configurations, including obscured deep neural generators and spatiotemporal distortions; (2) A novel sqrt(Re) scaling law linking electrode reduction ratio (Re) to localization accuracy - a previously unquantified relationship to the best of our knowledge; (3) While reduced configurations preserve basic P300 topography and may suffice for communicative BCIs, higher-density channels are essential for reliable deep source reconstruction. Overall, this study establishes a first step towards quantitative benchmarks for electrode selection, with critical implications for clinical BCIs requiring anatomical precision in applications like neurodegenerative disease monitoring, where compromised spatial resolution could mask pathological signatures. Most importantly, the sqrt(Re) scaling law may provide the first principled method to determine the minimal electrode density required based on acceptable error margins or expected effect sizes.

Abstract:
Electroencephalography (EEG) provides a non-invasive window into brain activity, enabling Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) for communication and control. However, their performance is limited by signal fidelity issues, among which the choice of re-referencing strategy is a pervasive but often overlooked preprocessing bias. Addressing controversies about its necessity and optimal choice, we adopted a quantified approach to evaluate four strategies - no re-referencing, Common Average Reference (CAR), small Laplacian, and large Laplacian - using 62-channels EEG (31 subjects, 2,520 trials). To our knowledge, this is the first study systematically quantifying their impact on single-trial P300 classification accuracy. Our controlled pipeline isolated re-referencing effects for source-space reconstruction (eLORETA with Phase Lag Index) and anatomically constrained classification. The large Laplacian resolves distributed P3b networks while maintaining P3a specificity, achieving the best P300 peak classification accuracy (81.57% hybrid method; 75.97% majority regions of interest). Performance follows a consistent and statistically significant hierarchy: large Laplacian > CAR > no re-reference > small Laplacian, providing a foundation for unified methodological evaluation.

Abstract:
A probabilistic clustering algorithm is proposed for the analysis of forensic DNA mixtures in which individual cells are isolated and short tandem repeats are amplified using the polymerase chain reaction to generate single cell electropherograms. The task of the algorithm is to use the peak height information in the electropherograms to group the cells according to their contributors. Using a recently developed experimental set of individual cell electropherograms, a large set of simulations shows that the proposed clustering algorithm has excellent performance in correctly grouping single cells, and for assigning likelihood ratios for persons of interest (of known genotype).

Abstract:
Proteins are essential biological macromolecules that execute life functions. Local motifs within protein structures, such as active sites, are the most critical components for linking structure to function and are key to understanding protein evolution and enabling protein engineering. Existing computational methods struggle to identify and compare these local structures, which leaves a significant gap in understanding protein structures and harnessing their functions. This study presents PLASMA, the first deep learning framework for efficient and interpretable residue-level protein substructure alignment. We reformulate the problem as a regularized optimal transport task and leverage differentiable Sinkhorn iterations. For a pair of input protein structures, PLASMA outputs a clear alignment matrix with an interpretable overall similarity score. Through extensive quantitative evaluations and three biological case studies, we demonstrate that PLASMA achieves accurate, lightweight, and interpretable residue-level alignment. Additionally, we introduce PLASMA-PF, a training-free variant that provides a practical alternative when training data are unavailable. Our method addresses a critical gap in protein structure analysis tools and offers new opportunities for functional annotation, evolutionary studies, and structure-based drug design. Reproducibility is ensured via our official implementation at https://github.com/ZW471/PLASMA-Protein-Local-Alignment.git.

Abstract:
Designing protein sequences that fold into a target three-dimensional structure, known as the inverse folding problem, is central to protein engineering but remains challenging due to the vast sequence space and the importance of local structural constraints. Existing deep learning approaches achieve strong recovery rates, yet they lack explicit mechanisms to reuse fine-grained structure-sequence patterns that are conserved across natural proteins. We present PRISM, a multimodal retrieval-augmented generation framework for inverse folding that retrieves fine-grained representations of potential motifs from known proteins and integrates them with a hybrid self-cross attention decoder. PRISM is formulated as a latent-variable probabilistic model and implemented with an efficient approximation, combining theoretical grounding with practical scalability. Across five benchmarks (CATH-4.2, TS50, TS500, CAMEO 2022, and the PDB date split), PRISM establishes new state of the art in both perplexity and amino acid recovery, while also improving foldability metrics (RMSD, TM-score, pLDDT), demonstrating that fine-grained multimodal retrieval is a powerful and efficient paradigm for protein sequence design.

Abstract:
Synthetic molecular communication (MC) in the cardiovascular system (CVS) is a key enabler for many envisioned medical applications in the human body, such as targeted drug delivery, early cancer detection, and continuous health monitoring. The design of MC systems for such applications requires suitable models for the signaling molecule propagation through complex vessel networks (VNs). Existing theoretical models offer limited analytical tractability and lack closed-form solutions, making the analysis of large-scale VNs either infeasible or not insightful. To overcome these limitations, in this paper, we propose a novel closed-form physical model, termed MIGHT, for advection-diffusion-driven transport of signaling molecules through complex VNs. The model represents the received molecule flux as a weighted sum of inverse Gaussian (IG) distributions, parameterized by physical properties of the network. The proposed model is validated by comparison with an existing convolution-based model and finite-element simulations. Further, we show that the model can be applied for the reduction of large VNs to simplified representations preserving the essential transport dynamics and for estimating representative VN based on received signals from unknown VNs.

Abstract:
Recent breakthroughs in generative modeling have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in molecular generation, yet the integration of comprehensive biomedical knowledge into these models has remained an untapped frontier. In this study, we introduce K-DREAM (Knowledge-Driven Embedding-Augmented Model), a novel framework that leverages knowledge graphs to augment diffusion-based generative models for drug discovery. By embedding structured information from large-scale knowledge graphs, K-DREAM directs molecular generation toward candidates with higher biological relevance and therapeutic suitability. This integration ensures that the generated molecules are aligned with specific therapeutic targets, moving beyond traditional heuristic-driven approaches. In targeted drug design tasks, K-DREAM generates drug candidates with improved binding affinities and predicted efficacy, surpassing current state-of-the-art generative models. It also demonstrates flexibility by producing molecules designed for multiple targets, enabling applications to complex disease mechanisms. These results highlight the utility of knowledge-enhanced generative models in rational drug design and their relevance to practical therapeutic development.

Abstract:
Multi-view pose estimation is essential for quantifying animal behavior in scientific research, yet current methods struggle to achieve accurate tracking with limited labeled data and suffer from poor uncertainty estimates. We address these challenges with a comprehensive framework combining novel training and post-processing techniques, and a model distillation procedure that leverages the strengths of these techniques to produce a more efficient and effective pose estimator. Our multi-view transformer (MVT) utilizes pretrained backbones and enables simultaneous processing of information across all views, while a novel patch masking scheme learns robust cross-view correspondences without camera calibration. For calibrated setups, we incorporate geometric consistency through 3D augmentation and a triangulation loss. We extend the existing Ensemble Kalman Smoother (EKS) post-processor to the nonlinear case and enhance uncertainty quantification via a variance inflation technique. Finally, to leverage the scaling properties of the MVT, we design a distillation procedure that exploits improved EKS predictions and uncertainty estimates to generate high-quality pseudo-labels, thereby reducing dependence on manual labels. Our framework components consistently outperform existing methods across three diverse animal species (flies, mice, chickadees), with each component contributing complementary benefits. The result is a practical, uncertainty-aware system for reliable pose estimation that enables downstream behavioral analyses under real-world data constraints.

Comment: 17 pages, The NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on AI Virtual Cells and Instruments: A New Era in Drug Discovery and Development (AI4D3 2025), San Diego, California, USA, 2025

Abstract:
The role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is growing in every stage of drug development. Nevertheless, a major challenge in drug discovery AI remains: Drug pharmacokinetic (PK) and Drug-Target Interaction (DTI) datasets collected in different studies often exhibit limited overlap, creating data overlap sparsity. Thus, data curation becomes difficult, negatively impacting downstream research investigations in high-throughput screening, polypharmacy, and drug combination. We propose xImagand-DKI, a novel SMILES/Protein-to-Pharmacokinetic/DTI (SP2PKDTI) diffusion model capable of generating an array of PK and DTI target properties conditioned on SMILES and protein inputs that exhibit data overlap sparsity. We infuse additional molecular and genomic domain knowledge from the Gene Ontology (GO) and molecular fingerprints to further improve our model performance. We show that xImagand-DKI-generated synthetic PK data closely resemble real data univariate and bivariate distributions, and can adequately fill in gaps among PK and DTI datasets. As such, xImagand-DKI is a promising solution for data overlap sparsity and may improve performance for downstream drug discovery research tasks.

Abstract:
Generative modeling becomes increasingly data-intensive in high-dimensional spaces. In molecular science, where data collection is expensive and important events are rare, compression to lower-dimensional manifolds is especially important for various downstream tasks, including generation. We combine a time-lagged information bottleneck designed to characterize molecular important representations and a diffusion model in one joint training objective. The resulting protocol, which we term Diffusive State Predictive Information Bottleneck (D-SPIB), enables the balancing of representation learning and generation aims in one flexible architecture. Additionally, the model is capable of combining temperature information from different molecular simulation trajectories to learn a coherent and useful internal representation of thermodynamics. We benchmark D-SPIB on multiple molecular tasks and showcase its potential for exploring physical conditions outside the training set.

Abstract:
In experiments probing human vision at the few-photon level, precise alignment of the eye is necessary such that stimuli reach the highest-density rod region of the retina. However, in literature there seems to be no consensus on the optimal eye alignment for such experiments. Typically, experiments are performed by presenting stimuli nasally or temporally, but the angle under which the few-photon pulses are presented varies between 7 deg and 23 deg. Here we combine a $3$-dimensional eye model with retinal rod density measurements from literature in a ray tracing simulation to study the optimal eye alignment conditions and necessary alignment precision. We find that stimuli, directed at the eye's nodal point, may be best presented under an inferior angle of 13.1 deg with respect to the visual axis. Defining a target area on the retina with a radius of 0.5 mm around the optimum location, we find the horizontal and vertical angular precision should be better than 0.85 deg given a horizontal and vertical translational precision of 1 mm and a depth translational precision of 5 mm.

Abstract:
Untargeted metabolomics using LC-MS/MS offers the potential to comprehensively profile the chemical diversity of biological samples. However, the process is fundamentally limited by the "identification bottleneck," where only a small fraction of detected features can be annotated using existing spectral libraries, leaving the majority of data uncharacterized and unused. In addition, the inherently low reproducibility of LC-MS/MS instruments introduces alignment errors between runs, making feature alignment across large datasets both error-prone and challenging. To overcome these constraints, we developed a deep learning method that eliminates the requirement for metabolite identification and reduces the influence of alignment inaccuracies. Here, we propose MS2toImg, a method that converts raw LC-MS/MS data into a two-dimensional images representing the global fragmentation pattern of each sample. These images are then used as direct input for a convolutional neural network (CNN), enabling end-to-end prediction of biological activity without explicit feature engineering or alignment. Our approach was validated using wild soybean samples and multiple bioactivity assays (e.g., DPPH, elastase inhibition). The MS2toImg-CNN model outperformed conventional machine learning baselines (e.g., Random Forest, PCA), demonstrating robust classification accuracy across diverse tasks. By transforming raw spectral data into images, our framework is inherently less sensitive to alignment errors caused by low instrument reproducibility, as it leverages the overall fragmentation landscape rather than relying on precise feature matching. This identification-free, image-based approach enables more robust and scalable bioactivity prediction from untargeted metabolomics data, offering a new paradigm for high-throughput functional screening in complex biological systems.

Abstract:
European grapevine (\textit{Vitis vinifera} L.) is a climate-sensitive perennial whose flowering and ripening govern yield and quality. Phenological records from monitoring programs are typically collected at irregular intervals, so true transition dates are interval-censored, and many site-years are right-censored. We develop a reproducible workflow that treats phenology as a time-to-event outcome: Status \& Intensity observations from the USA-NPN are converted to interval bounds, linked to NASA POWER daily weather, and analyzed with parametric accelerated failure time (AFT) models (Weibull and log-logistic). To avoid outcome-dependent bias from aggregating weather up to the event date, antecedent conditions are summarized in fixed pre-season windows and standardized; quality-control filters ensure adequate within-window data coverage. Applied to flowering and ripening of \textit{V.~vinifera}, the framework yields interpretable time-ratio effects and publication-ready tables and figures. Warmer pre-season conditions are associated with earlier ripening, whereas flowering responses are modest and uncertain in these data; precipitation plays, at most, a secondary role. The approach demonstrates how interval-censored survival models with exogenous weather windows can extract robust climate signals from citizen-science phenology while preserving observation uncertainty, and it generalizes readily to other species and networks.

Abstract:
Biological processes rely on finely tuned homo- and heteromeric interactions between (biomacro)molecules. The strength of an interaction, typically given by the dissociation constant (KD), plays a crucial role in basic research and must be monitored throughout the development of drugs and agrochemicals. An ideal method for KD determination is applicable to various analytes with a large range of affinities, tolerates complex matrix compositions, does not require labeling, and simultaneously provides information on the structural integrity of the binding partners. Native mass spectrometry meets these criteria but typically struggles with homooligomeric complexes due to overlapping mass signals. To overcome this, we resolve monomer/dimer contributions to overlapping MS-peaks by separately analyzing the charge state distribution of each oligomeric species via sample dilution and covalent crosslinking. Following this approach, we show that quantitative Laser-Induced Liquid Bead Ion Desorption mass spectrometry (qLILBID-MS) accurately captures the affinities of Bovine Serum Albumin and chemically induced dimers of Tryparedoxin, an oxidoreductase from human pathogenic Trypanosoma brucei parasites, with various molecular glues and homodimer affinities. Conveniently, qLILBID-MS requires a fraction of sample used by other methods such as isothermal titration calorimetry and yields previously inaccessible protein homodimer KDs in the high micromolar range, which allowed us to monitor the gradual decrease in homodimer affinity via mutation of crucial dimer interface contacts. Overall, qLILBID-MS is a sensitive, robust, fast, scalable, and cost-effective alternative to quantify protein/protein interactions that can accelerate contemporary drug discovery workflows, e.g. the efficient screening for proximity inducing molecules like proteolysis targeting chimera and molecular glues.

Abstract:
Predicting species distributions using occupancy models accounting for imperfect detection is now commonplace in ecology. Recently, modelling spatial and temporal autocorrelation was proposed to alleviate the lack of replication in occupancy data, which often prevents model identifiability. However, how such models perform in highly heterogeneous datasets where missing or single-visit data dominates remains an open question. Motivated by an heterogeneous fine-scale butterfly occupancy dataset, we evaluate the performance of a multi-season occupancy model with spatial and temporal random effects to a skewed (Poisson) distribution of the number of surveys per site, overlap of covariates between occupancy and detection submodels, and spatiotemporal clustering of observations. Results showed that the model is robust to heterogeneous data and covariate overlap. However, when spatiotemporal gaps were added, site occupancy was biased towards the average occupancy, itself overestimated. Random effects did not correct the influence of gaps, due to identifiability issues of variance and autocorrelation parameters. Occupancy analysis of two butterfly species further confirmed these results. Overall, multi-season occupancy models with autocorrelation are robust to heterogeneous data and covariate overlap, but still present identifiability issues and are challenged by severe data gaps, which compromise predictions even in data-rich areas.

Comment: 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)

Abstract:
In single-cell perturbation prediction, a central task is to forecast the effects of perturbing a gene unseen in the training data. The efficacy of such predictions depends on two factors: (1) the similarity of the target gene to those covered in the training data, which informs model (epistemic) uncertainty, and (2) the quality of the corresponding training data, which reflects data (aleatoric) uncertainty. Both factors are critical for determining the reliability of a prediction, particularly as gene perturbation is an inherently stochastic biochemical process. In this paper, we propose PRESCRIBE (PREdicting Single-Cell Response wIth Bayesian Estimation), a multivariate deep evidential regression framework designed to measure both sources of uncertainty jointly. Our analysis demonstrates that PRESCRIBE effectively estimates a confidence score for each prediction, which strongly correlates with its empirical accuracy. This capability enables the filtering of untrustworthy results, and in our experiments, it achieves steady accuracy improvements of over 3% compared to comparable baselines.

Abstract:
The forces generated by action potentials in muscle cells shuttle blood, food and waste products throughout the luminal structures of the body. Although non-invasive electrophysiological techniques exist, most mechanosensors cannot access luminal structures non-invasively. Here we introduce non-toxic ingestible mechanosensors to enable the quantitative study of luminal forces and apply them to study feeding in living Caenorhabditis elegans roundworms. These optical 'microgauges' comprise NaY0.8Yb0.18Er0.02F4@NaYF4 upconverting nanoparticles embedded in polystyrene microspheres. Combining optical microscopy and atomic force microscopy to study microgauges in vitro, we show that force evokes a linear and hysteresis-free change in the ratio of emitted red to green light. With fluorescence imaging and non-invasive electrophysiology, we show that adult C. elegans generate bite forces during feeding on the order of 10 micronewtons and that the temporal pattern of force generation is aligned with muscle activity in the feeding organ. Moreover, the bite force we measure corresponds to Hertzian contact stresses in the pressure range used to lyse the bacterial food of the worm. Microgauges have the potential to enable quantitative studies that investigate how neuromuscular stresses are affected by aging, genetic mutations and drug treatments in this organ and other luminal organs.

Abstract:
Predicting the fitness impact of mutations is central to protein engineering but constrained by limited assays relative to the size of sequence space. Protein language models (pLMs) trained with masked language modeling (MLM) exhibit strong zero-shot fitness prediction; we provide a unifying view by interpreting natural evolution as implicit reward maximization and MLM as inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), in which extant sequences act as expert demonstrations and pLM log-odds serve as fitness estimates. Building on this perspective, we introduce EvoIF, a lightweight model that integrates two complementary sources of evolutionary signal: (i) within-family profiles from retrieved homologs and (ii) cross-family structural-evolutionary constraints distilled from inverse folding logits. EvoIF fuses sequence-structure representations with these profiles via a compact transition block, yielding calibrated probabilities for log-odds scoring. On ProteinGym (217 mutational assays; >2.5M mutants), EvoIF and its MSA-enabled variant achieve state-of-the-art or competitive performance while using only 0.15% of the training data and fewer parameters than recent large models. Ablations confirm that within-family and cross-family profiles are complementary, improving robustness across function types, MSA depths, taxa, and mutation depths. The codes will be made publicly available at https://github.com/aim-uofa/EvoIF.

Abstract:
This paper introduces the Single-Cell Perturbation Prediction Diffusion Model (scPPDM), the first diffusion-based framework for single-cell drug-response prediction from scRNA-seq data. scPPDM couples two condition channels, pre-perturbation state and drug with dose, in a unified latent space via non-concatenative GD-Attn. During inference, factorized classifier-free guidance exposes two interpretable controls for state preservation and drug-response strength and maps dose to guidance magnitude for tunable intensity. Evaluated on the Tahoe-100M benchmark under two stringent regimes, unseen covariate combinations (UC) and unseen drugs (UD), scPPDM sets new state-of-the-art results across log fold-change recovery, delta correlations, explained variance, and DE-overlap. Representative gains include +36.11%/+34.21% on DEG logFC-Spearman/Pearson in UD over the second-best model. This control interface enables transparent what-if analyses and dose tuning, reducing experimental burden while preserving biological specificity.

Abstract:
Protein structure prediction has advanced significantly with the introduction of AlphaFold3, a diffusion-based model capable of predicting complex biomolecular interactions across proteins, nucleic acids, small molecules, and ions. While AlphaFold3 demonstrates high accuracy in folded proteins, its performance on intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), which comprise 30 to 40 percent of the human proteome and play critical roles in transcription, signaling, and disease, remains less explored. This study evaluated AlphaFold3's predictions of IDPs with a focus on intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) using 72 proteins curated from the DisProt database. Predictions were generated across multiple random seeds and ensemble outputs, and residue-level pLDDT scores were compared with experimental disorder annotations. Our analysis reveals that 32 percent of residues are misaligned with DisProt, with percent representing hallucinations where AlphaFold3 incorrectly predicts order in disordered regions or vice versa. Additionally, 10 percent of residues exhibited context-driven misalignment, suggesting that AlphaFold3 implicitly incorporates stable structural assumptions. Importantly, 18 percent of residues associated with biological processes showed hallucinations, raising concerns about downstream implications in drug discovery and disease research. These findings highlight the limitations of AlphaFold3 in modeling IDRs, the need for refined hallucination metrics beyond the pLDDT, and the importance of integrating experimental disorder data to improve prediction reliability.

Abstract:
Valvular heart disease is prevalent and a major contributor to heart failure. Valve leaflet strain is a promising metric for evaluating the mechanics underlying the initiation and progression of valvular pathology. However, robust and generalizable methods for noninvasively quantifying valvular strain from clinically acquired patient images remain limited. In this work, we present a novel feature-tracking framework for quantifying leaflet strain in atrioventricular valves using 3D echocardiographic images of pediatric and adult patients. Our method demonstrated superior accuracy in the assessment of anatomical deformation and strain of heart valves compared to other point-based approaches, as verified against a finite element benchmark. Further, our approach can robustly track inter-phase deformation of valves across highly variable morphologies without parameter tuning. Our analysis revealed that a median and interquartile range of the 1st principal strain greater than 0.5 is associated with leaflet billow (prolapse). Further investigation of the biomechanical signatures of heart valve disease has the potential to enhance prognostic assessment and longitudinal evaluation of valvular disease.

Abstract:
Protein sequence alignment is a cornerstone of bioinformatics, traditionally approached using dynamic programming (DP) algorithms that find an optimal sequential path. This paper introduces UniOTalign, a novel framework that recasts alignment from a fundamentally different perspective: global matching via Optimal Transport (OT). Instead of finding a path, UniOTalign computes an optimal flow or transport plan between two proteins, which are represented as distributions of residues in a high-dimensional feature space. We leverage pre-trained Protein Language Models (PLMs) to generate rich, context-aware embeddings for each residue. The core of our method is the Fused Unbalanced Gromov-Wasserstein (FUGW) distance, which finds a correspondence that simultaneously minimizes feature dissimilarity and preserves the internal geometric structure of the sequences. This approach naturally handles sequences of different lengths and is particularly powerful for aligning proteins with nonsequential similarities, such as domain shuffling or circular permutations, which are challenging for traditional DP methods. UniOTalign therefore offers a new, mathematically principled, global matching paradigm for protein alignment, moving beyond the limitations of path-finding algorithms.

Abstract:
Early recurrence (ER) prediction after curative-intent resection remains a critical challenge in the clinical management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Although contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) with full multi-phase acquisition is recommended in clinical guidelines and routinely performed in many tertiary centers, complete phase coverage is not consistently available across all institutions. In practice, single-phase portal venous (PV) scans are often used alone, particularly in settings with limited imaging resources, variations in acquisition protocols, or patient-related factors such as contrast intolerance or motion artifacts. This variability results in a mismatch between idealized model assumptions and the practical constraints of real-world deployment, underscoring the need for methods that can effectively leverage limited multi-phase data. To address this challenge, we propose a Dual-Branch Prototype-guided (DuoProto) framework that enhances ER prediction from single-phase CT by leveraging limited multi-phase data during training. DuoProto employs a dual-branch architecture: the main branch processes single-phase images, while the auxiliary branch utilizes available multi-phase scans to guide representation learning via cross-domain prototype alignment. Structured prototype representations serve as class anchors to improve feature discrimination, and a ranking-based supervision mechanism incorporates clinically relevant recurrence risk factors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DuoProto outperforms existing methods, particularly under class imbalance and missing-phase conditions. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the dual-branch, prototype-guided design. Our framework aligns with current clinical application needs and provides a general solution for recurrence risk prediction in HCC, supporting more informed decision-making.

Abstract:
Surgical video datasets are essential for scene understanding, enabling procedural modeling and intra-operative support. However, these datasets are often heavily imbalanced, with rare actions and tools under-represented, which limits the robustness of downstream models. We address this challenge with $SurgiFlowVid$, a sparse and controllable video diffusion framework for generating surgical videos of under-represented classes. Our approach introduces a dual-prediction diffusion module that jointly denoises RGB frames and optical flow, providing temporal inductive biases to improve motion modeling from limited samples. In addition, a sparse visual encoder conditions the generation process on lightweight signals (e.g., sparse segmentation masks or RGB frames), enabling controllability without dense annotations. We validate our approach on three surgical datasets across tasks including action recognition, tool presence detection, and laparoscope motion prediction. Synthetic data generated by our method yields consistent gains of 10-20% over competitive baselines, establishing $SurgiFlowVid$ as a promising strategy to mitigate data imbalance and advance surgical video understanding methods.

Abstract:
Live-cell imaging (LCI) technology enables the detailed spatio-temporal characterization of living cells at the single-cell level, which is critical for advancing research in the life sciences, from biomedical applications to bioprocessing. High-throughput setups with tens to hundreds of parallel cell cultivations offer the potential for robust and reproducible insights. However, these insights are obscured by the large amount of LCI data recorded per experiment. Recent advances in state-of-the-art deep learning methods for cell segmentation and tracking now enable the automated analysis of such large data volumes, offering unprecedented opportunities to systematically study single-cell dynamics. The next key challenge lies in integrating these powerful tools into accessible, flexible, and user-friendly workflows that support routine application in biological research. In this work, we present acia-workflows, a platform that combines three key components: (1) the Automated live-Cell Imaging Analysis (acia) Python library, which supports the modular design of image analysis pipelines offering eight deep learning segmentation and tracking approaches; (2) workflows that assemble the image analysis pipeline, its software dependencies, documentation, and visualizations into a single Jupyter Notebook, leading to accessible, reproducible and scalable analysis workflows; and (3) a collection of application workflows showcasing the analysis and customization capabilities in real-world applications. Specifically, we present three workflows to investigate various types of microfluidic LCI experiments ranging from growth rate comparisons to precise, minute-resolution quantitative analyses of individual dynamic cells responses to changing oxygen conditions. Our collection of more than ten application workflows is open source and publicly available at https://github.com/JuBiotech/acia-workflows.

Abstract:
Wuchereria bancrofti, the parasitic roundworm responsible for lymphatic filariasis, permanently disables over 36 million people and places 657 million at risk across 39 countries. A major bottleneck for drug discovery is the lack of functional annotation for more than 90 percent of the W. bancrofti dark proteome, leaving many potential targets unidentified. In this work, we present a novel computational pipeline that converts W. bancrofti's unannotated amino acid sequence data into precise four-level Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers and drug candidates. We utilized a DEtection TRansformer to estimate the probability of enzymatic function, fine-tuned a hierarchical nearest neighbor EC predictor on 4,476 labeled parasite proteins, and applied rejection sampling to retain only four-level EC classifications at 100 percent confidence. This pipeline assigned precise EC numbers to 14,772 previously uncharacterized proteins and discovered 543 EC classes not previously known in W. bancrofti. A qualitative triage emphasizing parasite-specific targets, chemical tractability, biochemical importance, and biological plausibility prioritized six enzymes across five separate strategies: anti-Wolbachia cell-wall inhibition, proteolysis blockade, transmission disruption, purinergic immune interference, and cGMP-signaling destabilization. We curated a 43-compound library from ChEMBL and BindingDB and co-folded across multiple protein conformers with Boltz-2. All six targets exhibited at least moderately strong predicted binding affinities below 1 micromolar, with moenomycin analogs against peptidoglycan glycosyltransferase and NTPase inhibitors showing promising nanomolar hits and well-defined binding pockets. While experimental validation remains essential, our results provide the first large-scale functional map of the W. bancrofti dark proteome and accelerate early-stage drug development for the species.

Abstract:
Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) is emerging as a potentially transformative paradigm for modeling complex biomedical systems by integrating parameterized physical laws with data-driven methods. Here, we review three main classes of PIML frameworks: physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), and neural operators (NOs), highlighting their growing role in biomedical science and engineering. We begin with PINNs, which embed governing equations into deep learning models and have been successfully applied to biosolid and biofluid mechanics, mechanobiology, and medical imaging among other areas. We then review NODEs, which offer continuous-time modeling, especially suited to dynamic physiological systems, pharmacokinetics, and cell signaling. Finally, we discuss deep NOs as powerful tools for learning mappings between function spaces, enabling efficient simulations across multiscale and spatially heterogeneous biological domains. Throughout, we emphasize applications where physical interpretability, data scarcity, or system complexity make conventional black-box learning insufficient. We conclude by identifying open challenges and future directions for advancing PIML in biomedical science and engineering, including issues of uncertainty quantification, generalization, and integration of PIML and large language models.

Abstract:
We study a stochastic model of a copolymerization process that has been extensively investigated in the physics literature. The main questions of interest include: (i) what are the criteria for transience, null recurrence, and positive recurrence in terms of the system parameters; (ii) in the transient regime, what are the limiting fractions of the different monomer types; and (iii) in the transient regime, what is the speed of growth of the polymer? Previous studies in the physics literature have addressed these questions using heuristic methods. Here, we utilize rigorous mathematical arguments to derive the results from the physics literature. Moreover, the techniques developed allow us to generalize to the copolymerization process with finitely many monomer types. We expect that the mathematical methods used and developed in this work will also enable the study of even more complex models in the future.

Abstract:
Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a common tool for monitoring cardiopulmonary health. Relying on absorption or reflectance of light by hemoglobin in the blood, the measured PPG waveform can be analyzed per heart beat using physiological assumptions to extract metrics ranging from heart rate to specific blood oxygenation (SpO2). This has led to the widespread use of PPG for bedside clinical monitoring to wearable consumer health monitoring. However, PPG is notoriously noisy and the measured absorption or reflectance of light is sensitive to factors such as body movement and contact with the skin. To reduce the noise in the PPG-derived SpO2, we developed combined traditional methods of estimating SpO2 from the PPG waveform with a new method to extract changes in SpO2 from the PPG waveform in a Kalman filter, and demonstrated its ability to better estimate SpO2 in humans undergoing controlled hypoxia (down to 14% atmospheric oxygen). The Kalman filter reduced variability in SpO2 to 4.30%SpO2 compared to the beat-to-beat SpO2 variability of 12.59%SpO2. This mirrored current methods of window-averaging the beat-to-beat SpO2, with a 30s window-average reducing SpO2 variability to 4.73%. However, current window-average methods also introduce delays, with 10s and 30s window-averaging introducing delays of 5s and 14s respectively compared to the beat-to-beat SpO2. The Kalman filter reduced this delay to within 3s of the beat-to-beat SpO2, highlighting its ability to reduce noise while maintaining SpO2 dynamics. This capability is particularly useful in reliably detecting clinically meaningful, but transient, hypoxic states, such as those observed during apnea.

Abstract:
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is highly heterogeneous, with five-year survival rates dropping from $\sim$90% in localized disease to $\sim$15% with distant metastases. Disease progression is shaped not only by tumor-intrinsic alterations but also by the reorganization of the tumor microenvironment (TME). Metabolic, compositional, and spatial changes contribute to this progression, but considered individually they lack context and often fail as therapeutic targets. Understanding their coordination could reveal processes to alter the disease course. Here, we combined multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI) with machine learning to profile metabolic, functional and spatial states of 522 colorectal lesions with single-cell resolution. We observed recurrent stage-specific remodeling marked by a lymphoid-to-myeloid shift, stromal-cancer cooperation, and malignant metabolic shifts. Spatial organization of epithelial, stromal, and immune compartments provided stronger stratification of disease stage than tumor-intrinsic changes or bulk immune infiltration alone. To systematically model these coordinated changes, we condensed multimodal features into 10 latent factors of TME organization. These factors tracked disease progression, were conserved across cohorts, and revealed frequent multicellular metabolic niches and distinct, non-exclusive TME trajectories. Our framework MuVIcell exposes the elements that together drive CRC progression by grouping co-occurring changes across cell types and feature classes into coordinated multicellular programs. This creates a rational basis to therapeutically target TME reorganization. Importantly, the framework is scalable and flexible, offering a resource for studying multicellular organization in other solid tumors.

Title: Bridging Clinical Narratives and ACR Appropriateness Guidelines: A Multi-Agent RAG System for Medical Imaging Decisions

Abstract:
The selection of appropriate medical imaging procedures is a critical and complex clinical decision, guided by extensive evidence-based standards such as the ACR Appropriateness Criteria (ACR-AC). However, the underutilization of these guidelines, stemming from the difficulty of mapping unstructured patient narratives to structured criteria, contributes to suboptimal patient outcomes and increased healthcare costs. To bridge this gap, we introduce a multi-agent cognitive architecture that automates the translation of free-text clinical scenarios into specific, guideline-adherent imaging recommendations. Our system leverages a novel, domain-adapted dense retrieval model, ColBERT, fine-tuned on a synthetically generated dataset of 8,840 clinical scenario-recommendation pairs to achieve highly accurate information retrieval from the ACR-AC knowledge base. This retriever identifies candidate guidelines with a 93.9% top-10 recall, which are then processed by a sequence of LLM-based agents for selection and evidence-based synthesis. We evaluate our architecture using GPT-4.1 and MedGemma agents, demonstrating a state-of-the-art exact match accuracy of 81%, meaning that in 81% of test cases the predicted procedure set was identical to the guideline's reference set, and an F1-score of 0.879. This represents a 67-percentage-point absolute improvement in accuracy over a strong standalone GPT-4.1 baseline, underscoring the contribution that our architecture makes to a frontier model. These results were obtained on a challenging test set with substantial lexical divergence from the source guidelines. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/demo-iclr-B567/

Abstract:
Medical imaging has revolutionized diagnosis, yet unnecessary procedures are rising, exposing patients to radiation and stress, limiting equitable access, and straining healthcare systems. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria, developed through extensive multidisciplinary review, provide evidence-based guidance but remain underutilized. Leveraging advances in LLM reasoning, we introduce a Reasoning Agent trained with Reinforcement Learning (RL), specifically Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), to replicate expert clinical reasoning from the ACR Criteria. We present a novel RL approach for structured medical reasoning, systematically comparing reasoning-focused reward functions and evidence integration strategies. Our lightweight 8B model, MedReason-Embed, improves macro F1 by 18% over baseline, shows stronger reasoning alignment, and outperforms both larger and alternatively trained models, showing that reasoning-based supervision enables efficient, trustworthy clinical AI. Building on this, we design a modular end-to-end agentic architecture that automates imaging referrals: mapping diagnoses to ICD codes, retrieving PubMed evidence, and recommending optimal procedures. Crucially, the ability to generalize beyond static ACR guidelines not only enables clinicians to handle out-of-distribution cases, but also supports scaling the guideline development process itself, potentially reducing the significant effort required to create and update them. This work shows the potential of reasoning-focused RL within agentic architectures to deliver transparent, scalable, and reliable clinical decision support.

Abstract:
Correlated motions of proteins underpin many physiological mechanisms, such as substrate binding, signal transduction, enzymatic activity and allostery. These motions arise from low frequency collective movements of biomolecules and have mostly been studied using molecular dynamics simulations. Here, we present the effects of two different empirical energy force fields used for molecular dynamics simulations on correlated motions -- the non-polarizable CHARMM 36m additive force field and the polarizable Drude-2019 force field. The study was conducted on two proteins, ubiquitin - a small protein with a well-described dynamic - and the nuclear receptor protein PPAR___. The ligand binding domain of PPAR___ was of particular interest since its function is to regulate transcription through ligand and coregulator protein binding. It has been previously shown that a dynamical network of correlated motions ensures the transmission of information related to PPAR___ ligand binding. We present the results of classical MD simulations where we analyze the results in terms of residue fluctuations, residue correlation maps, community network analysis and hydrophobic cluster analysis. We find that RMS fluctuations tend to be greater and correlated motions are less intense with Drude-2019 force field than with the non-polarizable all atom additive force field. Analysis of large hydrophobic clusters in the respective proteins show a greater loss of native contacts in the simulations using the Drude-2019 force field than in the simulations using the all atom force additive force field. Our results provide the first quantification of the impact of using a polarizable force field in computational studies that focus on correlated motions.

Abstract:
Multicellular tissues, such as the epithelium coating a developing embryo, often combine complex tissue shapes with heterogeneity in the spatial arrangement of individual cells. Discrete approximations, such as the cell vertex model, can accommodate these geometric features, but techniques for analysis of such models are underdeveloped. Here, we express differential operators defined on a network representing a monolayer of confluent cells in the framework of discrete exterior calculus, considering scalar fields defined over cell vertices and centres and vector fields defined over cell edges. We achieve this by defining Hodge stars, wedge products and musical isomorphisms that are appropriate for a disordered monolayer for which cell edges and links between cell centres are not orthogonal, as is generic for epithelia. We use this framework to evaluate the harmonic vector field arising in an ablated monolayer, demonstrating an approximate 1/\textit{r} scaling of the upper bound of the field's amplitude, where \textit{r} is the distance from the ablation. Using a vertex model that incorporates osmotic effects, we then calculate the mechanical response of a monolayer in a jammed state to ablation. Perturbation displacements exhibit long-range coherence, monopolar and quadrupolar features, and an approximate 1/\textit{r} near-hole upper-bound scaling, implicating the harmonic field. The upper bounds on perturbation stress amplitudes scale approximately like 1/\textit{r}$^2$, a feature relevant to long-range mechanical signalling.

Abstract:
Low-energy molecular conformers generation (MCG) is a foundational yet challenging problem in drug discovery. Denoising-based methods include diffusion and flow-matching methods that learn mappings from a simple base distribution to the molecular conformer distribution. However, these approaches often suffer from error accumulation during sampling, especially in the low SNR steps, which are hard to train. To address these challenges, we propose a flow-matching refiner for the MCG task. The proposed method initializes sampling from mixed-quality outputs produced by upstream denoising models and reschedules the noise scale to bypass the low-SNR phase, thereby improving sample quality. On the GEOM-QM9 and GEOM-Drugs benchmark datasets, the generator-refiner pipeline improves quality with fewer total denoising steps while preserving diversity.

Abstract:
Optical microscopy is one of the most widely used techniques in research studies for life sciences and biomedicine. These applications require reliable experimental pipelines to extract valuable knowledge from the measured samples and must be supported by image quality assessment (IQA) to ensure correct processing and analysis of the image data. IQA methods are implemented with variable complexity. However, while most quality metrics have a straightforward implementation, they might be time consuming and computationally expensive when evaluating a large dataset. In addition, quality metrics are often designed for well-defined image features and may be unstable for images out of the ideal domain. To overcome these limitations, recent works have proposed deep learning-based IQA methods, which can provide superior performance, increased generalizability and fast prediction. Our method, named $\mathrmμ$DeepIQA, is inspired by previous studies and applies a deep convolutional neural network designed for IQA on natural images to optical microscopy measurements. We retrained the same architecture to predict individual quality metrics and global quality scores for optical microscopy data. The resulting models provide fast and stable predictions of image quality by generalizing quality estimation even outside the ideal range of standard methods. In addition, $\mathrmμ$DeepIQA provides patch-wise prediction of image quality and can be used to visualize spatially varying quality in a single image. Our study demonstrates that optical microscopy-based studies can benefit from the generalizability of deep learning models due to their stable performance in the presence of outliers, the ability to assess small image patches, and rapid predictions.

Abstract:
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful technique for enriching Large Language Models (LLMs) with external knowledge, allowing for factually grounded responses, a critical requirement in high-stakes domains such as healthcare. However, the efficacy of RAG systems is fundamentally restricted by the performance of their retrieval module, since irrelevant or semantically misaligned documents directly compromise the accuracy of the final generated response. General-purpose dense retrievers can struggle with the nuanced language of specialised domains, while the high accuracy of in-domain models is often achieved at prohibitive computational costs. In this work, we aim to address this trade-off by developing and evaluating a two-stage retrieval architecture that combines a lightweight ModernBERT bidirectional encoder for efficient initial candidate retrieval with a ColBERTv2 late-interaction model for fine-grained re-ranking. We conduct comprehensive evaluations of our retriever module performance and RAG system performance in the biomedical context, fine-tuning the IR module using 10k question-passage pairs from PubMedQA. Our analysis of the retriever module confirmed the positive impact of the ColBERT re-ranker, which improved Recall@3 by up to 4.2 percentage points compared to its retrieve-only counterpart. When integrated into the biomedical RAG, our IR module leads to a state-of-the-art average accuracy of 0.4448 on the five tasks of the MIRAGE question-answering benchmark, outperforming strong baselines such as MedCPT (0.4436). Our ablation studies reveal that this performance is critically dependent on a joint fine-tuning process that aligns the retriever and re-ranker; otherwise, the re-ranker might degrade the performance.

Abstract:
T cell receptor (TCR) recognition of peptide-MHC (pMHC) complexes is a central component of adaptive immunity, with implications for vaccine design, cancer immunotherapy, and autoimmune disease. While recent advances in machine learning have improved prediction of TCR-pMHC binding, the most effective approaches are black-box transformer models that cannot provide a rationale for predictions. Post-hoc explanation methods can provide insight with respect to the input but do not explicitly model biochemical mechanisms (e.g. known binding regions), as in TCR-pMHC binding. ``Explain-by-design'' models (i.e., with architectural components that can be examined directly after training) have been explored in other domains, but have not been used for TCR-pMHC binding. We propose explainable model layers (TCR-EML) that can be incorporated into protein-language model backbones for TCR-pMHC modeling. Our approach uses prototype layers for amino acid residue contacts drawn from known TCR-pMHC binding mechanisms, enabling high-quality explanations for predicted TCR-pMHC binding. Experiments of our proposed method on large-scale datasets demonstrate competitive predictive accuracy and generalization, and evaluation on the TCR-XAI benchmark demonstrates improved explainability compared with existing approaches.

Abstract:
Arterial aneurysm (Fig.1) is a bulb-shape local expansion of human arteries, the rupture of which is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in US. Therefore, the prediction of arterial aneurysm rupture is of great significance for aneurysm management and treatment selection. The prediction of aneurysm rupture depends on the analysis of the time series of aneurysm growth history. However, due to the long time scale of aneurysm growth, the time series of aneurysm growth is not always accessible. We here proposed a method to reconstruct the aneurysm growth time series directly from patient parameters. The prediction is based on data pairs of [patient parameters, patient aneurysm growth time history]. To obtain the mapping from patient parameters to patient aneurysm growth time history, we first apply autoencoder to obtain a compact representation of the time series for each patient. Then a mapping is learned from patient parameters to the corresponding compact representation of time series via a five-layer neural network. Moving average and convolutional output layer are implemented to explicitly taking account the time dependency of the time series.   Apart from that, we also propose to use prior knowledge about the mechanism of aneurysm growth to improve the time series reconstruction results. The prior physics-based knowledge is incorporated as constraints for the optimization problem associated with autoencoder. The model can handle both algebraic and differential constraints. Our results show that including physical model information about the data will not significantly improve the time series reconstruction results if the training data is error-free. However, in the case of training data with noise and bias error, incorporating physical model constraints can significantly improve the predicted time series.

Abstract:
High-resolution imaging provides dense trajectories of migrating cells, flocking animals, and synthetic active particles, from which interaction laws can be determined with a wide variety of methods. Yet, distinguishing whether front-back or lateral biases seen in such data reflect intrinsic anisotropy in the interaction kernel or emergent correlations that are nevertheless produced by isotropic pairwise interaction forces remains an open challenge. We resolve this ambiguity by deriving a linear partial differential equation that connects measurable two-point velocity correlations to an unknown, distance- and angle-dependent interaction kernel. Turing-like instabilities can occur which allows for dipolar or quadrupolar patterns to arise even when agents interact according to an underlying attraction-repulsion law that is angle-independent. We then show that incorporating a weak velocity-alignment force can interfere with anisotropic pattern formation by suppressing dipolar patterns. We validate these predictions with agent-based simulations and provide design guidance for experiments that seek to discriminate intrinsic anisotropy from emergent effects.

Abstract:
The development of multicellular organisms entails a deep connection between time-dependent biochemical processes taking place at the subcellular level, and the resulting macroscopic phenotypes that arise in populations of up to trillions of cells. A statistical mechanics of developmental processes would help to understand how microscopic genotypes map onto macroscopic phenotypes, a general goal across biology. Here we follow this approach, hypothesizing that development should be understood as a thermodynamic transition between non-equilibrium states. We test this hypothesis in the context of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, a model organism used widely in genetics and developmental biology for over a century. Applying a variety of information-theoretic measures to public transcriptomics datasets of whole fly embryos during development, we show that the global temporal dynamics of gene expression can be understood as a process that probabilistically guides embryonic dynamics across macroscopic phenotypic stages. In particular, we demonstrate signatures of irreversibility in the information complexity of transcriptomic dynamics, as measured mainly by the permutation entropy of indexed ensembles (PI entropy). Our results show that the dynamics of PI entropy correlate strongly with developmental stages. Overall, this is a test case in applying information complexity analysis to relate the statistical mechanics of biomarkers to macroscopic developmental dynamics.

Abstract:
Hidden Markov models (HMMs) have been used increasingly to understand how movement patterns of animals arise from behavioural states. An animal is assumed to transition between behavioural states through time, as described by transition probabilities. Within each state, the movement typically follows a discrete-time random walk, where steps between successive observed locations are described in terms of step lengths (related to speed) and turning angles (related to tortuosity). HMMs are discrete-time models, and most of their outputs strongly depend on the temporal resolution of data. We compile known theoretical results about scale dependence in Markov chains and correlated random walks, which are the most common components of HMMs for animal movement. We also illustrate this phenomenon using simulations covering a wide range of biological scenarios. The scale dependence affects not only all model parameters, i.e., the transition probabilities and the movement parameters within each behavioural state, but also the overall classification of movement patterns into states. This highlights the importance of carefully considering the time resolution when drawing conclusions from the results of analysis. In addition, scale dependence generally precludes the analysis of tracking data collected at irregular time intervals, and the comparison (or combination) of data sets with different sampling rates. HMMs remain a valuable tool to answer questions about animal movement and behaviour, as long as these limitations are well understood.

Abstract:
Designing mRNA sequences is a major challenge in developing next-generation therapeutics, since it involves exploring a vast space of possible nucleotide combinations while optimizing sequence properties like stability, translation efficiency, and protein expression. While Generative Flow Networks are promising for this task, their training is hindered by sparse, long-horizon rewards and multi-objective trade-offs. We propose Curriculum-Augmented GFlowNets (CAGFN), which integrate curriculum learning with multi-objective GFlowNets to generate de novo mRNA sequences. CAGFN integrates a length-based curriculum that progressively adapts the maximum sequence length guiding exploration from easier to harder subproblems. We also provide a new mRNA design environment for GFlowNets which, given a target protein sequence and a combination of biological objectives, allows for the training of models that generate plausible mRNA candidates. This provides a biologically motivated setting for applying and advancing GFlowNets in therapeutic sequence design. On different mRNA design tasks, CAGFN improves Pareto performance and biological plausibility, while maintaining diversity. Moreover, CAGFN reaches higher-quality solutions faster than a GFlowNet trained with random sequence sampling (no curriculum), and enables generalization to out-of-distribution sequences.

Abstract:
Viral infections trigger complex immune responses with heterogeneous outcomes shaped by nonlinear feedbacks. An ordinary differential equation model is developed to investigate immune response dynamics during viral infection, incorporating six modules: viral load, innate immunity, cellular immunity, humoral immunity, immune suppression, and IL-6 levels. Bifurcation analysis reveals that under continuous viral exposure, when viral clearance rate and intrinsic viral death rate satisfy specific conditions, the system exhibits up to five stable equilibria. This indicates that different health and disease states may coexist depending on initial conditions, while severe inflammation mainly arises from strong activation of cellular immunity, highlighting the complexity of immune responses. Simulations of finite-time viral exposure demonstrate multi-timescale recovery characteristics: viral load and IL-6 levels decline rapidly, whereas humoral immune activation and immunosuppression show delayed and sustained patterns. Furthermore, analysis of infectious period and disease duration also indicates that during transition from early acute response to chronic disease, viral replication rate plays a critical role, while immune response intensity is sensitive to both viral clearance and immune self-activation. Subsystem analysis identifies the three-component subsystem of viral load, innate immunity, and cellular immunity as core drivers of bistability and oscillations, while humoral immunity, immune suppression, and IL-6 primarily modulate response amplitude and timing. This work establishes a theoretical framework for analyzing immune response and chronic risks through feedback dynamical modelling, providing insights for intervention strategies.

Abstract:
Nanopore sequencing technologies continue to advance rapidly, offering critical benefits such as real-time analysis, the ability to sequence extremely long DNA fragments (up to millions of bases in a single read), and the option to selectively stop sequencing a molecule before completion. Traditionally, the raw electrical signals generated during sequencing are converted into DNA sequences through a process called basecalling, which typically relies on large neural network models. Raw signal analysis has emerged as a promising alternative to these resource-intensive approaches. While attempts have been made to benchmark conventional basecalling methods, existing evaluation frameworks 1) overlook raw signal analysis techniques, 2) lack the flexibility to accommodate new raw signal analysis tools easily, and 3) fail to include the latest improvements in nanopore datasets. Our goal is to provide an extensible benchmarking framework that enables designing and comparing new methods for raw signal analysis. To this end, we introduce RawBench, the first flexible framework for evaluating raw nanopore signal analysis techniques. RawBench provides modular evaluation of three core pipeline components: 1) reference genome encoding (using different pore models), 2) signal encoding (through various segmentation methods), and 3) representation matching (via different data structures). We extensively evaluate raw signal analysis techniques in terms of 1) quality and performance for read mapping, 2) quality and performance for read classification, and 3) quality of raw signal analysis-assisted basecalling. Our evaluations show that raw signal analysis can achieve competitive quality while significantly reducing resource requirements, particularly in settings where real-time processing or edge deployment is necessary.

Abstract:
Understanding the relationship between nerve anatomy and the functional outcomes of electrical stimulation is critical for optimizing neural interface design. In this study, we conducted acute experiments on four pigs in which epineural cuff electrodes with multiple contacts were placed around upper limb nerves. A subset of electrical stimulation configurations -- previously identified via computational study -- was applied, and the resulting evoked electromyographic (EMG) responses were recorded from target muscles. Muscle recruitment curves were extracted and analysed offline to quantify activation patterns. Following the electrophysiological experiments, the stimulated nerves were harvested and processed for histological analysis to visualize fascicular organization and distribution. This work presents preliminary results from the combined analysis of muscle activation profiles and fascicle anatomy in one animal. Our findings aim to inform the design of stimulation strategies by linking electrode configuration to selective muscle recruitment, ultimately contributing to more effective neuromodulation and neuroprosthetic applications.

Abstract:
Multimodal protein language models deliver strong performance on mutation-effect prediction, but training such models from scratch demands substantial computational resources. In this paper, we propose a fine-tuning framework called InstructPLM-mu and try to answer a question: \textit{Can multimodal fine-tuning of a pretrained, sequence-only protein language model match the performance of models trained end-to-end? } Surprisingly, our experiments show that fine-tuning ESM2 with structural inputs can reach performance comparable to ESM3. To understand how this is achieved, we systematically compare three different feature-fusion designs and fine-tuning recipes. Our results reveal that both the fusion method and the tuning strategy strongly affect final accuracy, indicating that the fine-tuning process is not trivial. We hope this work offers practical guidance for injecting structure into pretrained protein language models and motivates further research on better fusion mechanisms and fine-tuning protocols.

Abstract:
Low vision involves a range of visual impairments that significantly impact daily activities, particularly navigation in urban environments. Individuals with low vision often develop adaptive strategies to compensate for visual deficits, relying on head movements to bring objects into their remaining functional field of vision. Research suggests that they focus on road surface markings and building edges to aid in wayfinding and collision avoidance. However, urban navigation presents additional challenges, as obstacles, moving hazards, and tripping dangers may enter their visual loss field, increasing the risk of injury. Traditional eye movement studies are typically conducted in controlled laboratory settings with fixed head positions, limiting the understanding of head-eye coordination in real-world environments. To bridge this gap, we designed a naturalistic, "free-head" experiment using eye-tracking technology to examine head and eye movement patterns during urban navigation. Participants with low vision were compared to a control cohort without visual impairment to test the hypothesis that eye and head movements become decoupled in visually impaired individuals. Findings indicate that individuals with peripheral field loss exhibit significant eye-head decoupling, while those with acuity loss demonstrate more synchronized movements. Results for individuals with central field loss were inconclusive but revealed distinct movement patterns. These insights provide valuable direction for rehabilitation strategies, assistive-mobility technologies, and urban design improvements. By expanding research on eye-head coordination, this study contributes to the development of interventions that enhance safety, mobility, and independence for individuals with low vision in complex urban environments.

Abstract:
Blood transfusion remains a cornerstone of modern medicine, saving countless lives daily. Yet the quality of transfused blood varies dramatically among donors-a critical factor often overlooked in clinical practice. Rapid, benchtop, and cost-effective methods for evaluating stored red blood cells (RBCs) at the site of transfusion are lacking, with concerns persisting about the association between metabolic signatures of stored RBC quality and transfusion outcomes. Recent studies utilizing metabolomics approaches to evaluate stored erythrocytes find that donor biology (e.g., genetics, age, lifestyle factors) underlies the heterogeneity associated with blood storage and transfusion. The appreciation of donor-intrinsic factors provides opportunities for precision transfusion medicine approaches for the evaluation of storage quality and prediction of transfusion efficacy. Here we propose a new platform, the Surface Acoustic Wave Hemolysis Assay (SAW-HA), for on-site evaluation of stored RBCs utilizing SAW Hemolysis Temperature (SAWHT) as a marker for RBC quality. We report SAWHT as a mechanism-dependent reproducible methodology for evaluating stored human RBCs up to 42 days. Our results define unique signatures for SAW hemolysis and metabolic profiles in RBCs from two of the six donors in which high body mass index (BMI) and RBC triglycerides associated with increased susceptibility to hemolysis. Metabolic age of the stored RBCs - a recently appreciated predictor of post-transfusion efficacy-reveal that RBCs from the two low SAWHT units were characterized by disrupted redox control, deficient tryptophan metabolism, and high BMI. Together, these findings indicate the potential of the SAW-HA as a point-of-care analysis for transfusion medicine.

Abstract:
In-context learners like TabPFN are promising for biomolecule efficacy prediction, where established molecular feature sets and relevant experimental results can serve as powerful contextual examples. However, their performance is highly sensitive to the provided context, making strategies like post-hoc ensembling of models trained on different data subsets a viable approach. An open question is how to select the best models for the ensemble without access to ground truth labels. In this study, we investigate an uncertainty-guided strategy for model selection. We demonstrate on an siRNA knockdown efficacy task that a TabPFN model using straightforward sequence-based features can surpass specialized state-of-the-art predictors. We also show that the model's predicted inter-quantile range (IQR), a measure of its uncertainty, has a negative correlation with true prediction error. We developed the OligoICP method, which selects and averages an ensemble of models with the lowest mean IQR for siRNA efficacy prediction, achieving superior performance compared to naive ensembling or using a single model trained on all available data. This finding highlights model uncertainty as a powerful, label-free heuristic for optimizing biomolecule efficacy predictions.

Abstract:
Bioinformatics tools are essential for complex computational biology tasks, yet their integration with emerging AI-agent frameworks is hindered by incompatible interfaces, heterogeneous input-output formats, and inconsistent parameter conventions. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides a standardized framework for tool-AI communication, but manually converting hundreds of existing and rapidly growing specialized bioinformatics tools into MCP-compliant servers is labor-intensive and unsustainable. Here, we present BioinfoMCP, a unified platform comprising two components: BioinfoMCP Converter, which automatically generates robust MCP servers from tool documentation using large language models, and BioinfoMCP Benchmark, which systematically validates the reliability and versatility of converted tools across diverse computational tasks. We present a platform of 38 MCP-converted bioinformatics tools, extensively validated to show that 94.7% successfully executed complex workflows across three widely used AI-agent platforms. By removing technical barriers to AI automation, BioinfoMCP enables natural-language interaction with sophisticated bioinformatics analyses without requiring extensive programming expertise, offering a scalable path to intelligent, interoperable computational biology.

Abstract:
Automated semantic segmentation of whole-slide images (WSIs) stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) is essential for large-scale artificial intelligence-based biomarker analysis in breast cancer. However, existing public datasets for breast cancer segmentation lack the morphological diversity needed to support model generalizability and robust biomarker validation across heterogeneous patient cohorts. We introduce BrEast cancEr hisTopathoLogy sEgmentation (BEETLE), a dataset for multiclass semantic segmentation of H&E-stained breast cancer WSIs. It consists of 587 biopsies and resections from three collaborating clinical centers and two public datasets, digitized using seven scanners, and covers all molecular subtypes and histological grades. Using diverse annotation strategies, we collected annotations across four classes - invasive epithelium, non-invasive epithelium, necrosis, and other - with particular focus on morphologies underrepresented in existing datasets, such as ductal carcinoma in situ and dispersed lobular tumor cells. The dataset's diversity and relevance to the rapidly growing field of automated biomarker quantification in breast cancer ensure its high potential for reuse. Finally, we provide a well-curated, multicentric external evaluation set to enable standardized benchmarking of breast cancer segmentation models.

Abstract:
Effective recognition of foreign antigens by the adaptive immune system relies on T cells being activated by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in lymph nodes. Here, diffusing T cells may encounter cognate APCs that present matching antigen fragments or non-cognate ones that do not; they are also subject to degradation. We develop a stochastic model in which T cell-APCs interact via a sequence of recognition steps, represented as a multistage Markov chain. T cells are successfully activated only if the terminal state associated with a cognate APC is reached. We compute the probability of successful activation in the presence of interfering non-cognate APCs, T cell degradation, and lymph node exit, and analyze the mean first-passage time to activation. We also incorporate a kinetic proofreading mechanism that enables state resetting, and show how this enhances specificity toward cognate APCs.

Abstract:
Image denoising is a fundamental problem in computer vision and medical imaging. However, real-world images are often degraded by structured noise with strong anisotropic correlations that existing methods struggle to remove. Most data-driven approaches rely on large datasets with high-quality labels and still suffer from limited generalizability, whereas existing zero-shot methods avoid this limitation but remain effective only for independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) noise. To address this gap, we propose Median2Median (M2M), a zero-shot denoising framework designed for structured noise. M2M introduces a novel sampling strategy that generates pseudo-independent sub-image pairs from a single noisy input. This strategy leverages directional interpolation and generalized median filtering to adaptively exclude values distorted by structured artifacts. To further enlarge the effective sampling space and eliminate systematic bias, a randomized assignment strategy is employed, ensuring that the sampled sub-image pairs are suitable for Noise2Noise training. In our realistic simulation studies, M2M performs on par with state-of-the-art zero-shot methods under i.i.d. noise, while consistently outperforming them under correlated noise. These findings establish M2M as an efficient, data-free solution for structured noise suppression and mark the first step toward effective zero-shot denoising beyond the strict i.i.d. assumption.

Abstract:
Objective: To develop an explainable multimodal large language model (MM-LLM) that (1) screens optic nerve head (ONH) OCT circle scans for quality and (2) generates structured clinical reports that include glaucoma diagnosis and sector-wise retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thinning assessments. Design: Retrospective cohort study of 1,310 subjects contributing 43,849 Spectralis ONH OCT circle scans (1,331 glaucomatous and 867 healthy eyes) from the DIGS and ADAGES cohorts. Methods: A MM-LLM (Llama 3.2 Vision-Instruct model) was fine-tuned to generate clinical descriptions of OCT imaging data. Training data included paired OCT images and automatically generated, structured clinical reports that described global and sectoral RNFL thinning. Poor-quality scans were labeled as unusable and paired with a fixed refusal statement. The model was evaluated on a held-out test set for three tasks: quality assessment, glaucoma detection, and RNFL thinning classification across seven anatomical sectors. Evaluation metrics included accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and F1-score. Model description quality was also evaluated using standard text evaluation metrics. Results: The model achieved 0.90 accuracy and 0.98 specificity for quality triage. For glaucoma detection, accuracy was 0.86 (sensitivity 0.91, specificity 0.73, F1-score 0.91). RNFL thinning prediction accuracy ranged from 0.83 to 0.94, with highest performance in global and temporal sectors. Text generation scores showed strong alignment with reference reports (BLEU: 0.82; ROUGE-1: 0.94; ROUGE-2: 0.87; ROUGE-L: 0.92; BERTScore-F1: 0.99). Conclusions: The fine-tuned MM-LLM generated accurate clinical descriptions based on OCT imaging. The model achieved high accuracy in identifying image quality issues and detecting glaucoma. The model also provided sectoral descriptions of RNFL thinning to help support clinical OCT evaluation.

Abstract:
The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in early-stage drug discovery offers unprecedented opportunities for exploring chemical space and accelerating hit-to-lead optimization. However, docking optimization in generative approaches is computationally expensive and may lead to inaccurate results. Here, we present a novel generative framework that balances pharmacophore similarity to reference compounds with structural diversity from active molecules. The framework allows users to provide custom reference sets, including FDA-approved drugs or clinical candidates, and guides the \textit{de novo} generation of potential therapeutics. We demonstrate its applicability through a case study targeting estrogen receptor modulators and antagonists for breast cancer. The generated compounds maintain high pharmacophoric fidelity to known active molecules while introducing substantial structural novelty, suggesting strong potential for functional innovation and patentability. Comprehensive evaluation of the generated molecules against common drug-like properties confirms the robustness and pharmaceutical relevance of the approach.

Abstract:
Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and biomedical foundation models (BioFMs) have achieved strong results in biological text reasoning, molecular modeling, and single-cell analysis, yet they remain siloed in disjoint embedding spaces, limiting cross-modal reasoning. We present BIOVERSE (Biomedical Vector Embedding Realignment for Semantic Engagement), a two-stage approach that adapts pretrained BioFMs as modality encoders and aligns them with LLMs through lightweight, modality-specific projection layers. The approach first aligns each modality to a shared LLM space through independently trained projections, allowing them to interoperate naturally, and then applies standard instruction tuning with multi-modal data to bring them together for downstream reasoning. By unifying raw biomedical data with knowledge embedded in LLMs, the approach enables zero-shot annotation, cross-modal question answering, and interactive, explainable dialogue. Across tasks spanning cell-type annotation, molecular description, and protein function reasoning, compact BIOVERSE configurations surpass larger LLM baselines while enabling richer, generative outputs than existing BioFMs, establishing a foundation for principled multi-modal biomedical reasoning.

Abstract:
Learning stochastic models of dynamical systems underlying observed data is of interest in many scientific fields. Here we propose a novel method for this task, based on the framework of variational autoencoders for dynamical systems. The method estimates from the data both the system state trajectories and noise time series. This approach allows to perform multi-step system evolution and supports a teacher forcing strategy, alleviating limitations of autoencoder-based approaches for stochastic systems. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach on six test problems, covering simulated and experimental data. We further show the effects of the teacher forcing interval on the nature of the internal dynamics, and compare it to the deterministic models with equivalent architecture.

Abstract:
Rare-disease diagnosis remains one of the most pressing challenges in digital health, hindered by extreme data scarcity, privacy concerns, and the limited resources of edge devices. This paper proposes the Adaptive Federated Few-Shot Rare-Disease Diagnosis (AFFR) framework, which integrates three pillars: (i) few-shot federated optimization with meta-learning to generalize from limited patient samples, (ii) energy-aware client scheduling to mitigate device dropouts and ensure balanced participation, and (iii) secure aggregation with calibrated differential privacy to safeguard sensitive model updates. Unlike prior work that addresses these aspects in isolation, AFFR unifies them into a modular pipeline deployable on real-world clinical networks. Experimental evaluation on simulated rare-disease detection datasets demonstrates up to 10% improvement in accuracy compared with baseline FL, while reducing client dropouts by over 50% without degrading convergence. Furthermore, privacy-utility trade-offs remain within clinically acceptable bounds. These findings highlight AFFR as a practical pathway for equitable and trustworthy federated diagnosis of rare conditions.

Abstract:
Simulating in silico cellular responses to interventions is a promising direction to accelerate high-content image-based assays, critical for advancing drug discovery and gene editing. To support this, we introduce MorphGen, a state-of-the-art diffusion-based generative model for fluorescent microscopy that enables controllable generation across multiple cell types and perturbations. To capture biologically meaningful patterns consistent with known cellular morphologies, MorphGen is trained with an alignment loss to match its representations to the phenotypic embeddings of OpenPhenom, a state-of-the-art biological foundation model. Unlike prior approaches that compress multichannel stains into RGB images -- thus sacrificing organelle-specific detail -- MorphGen generates the complete set of fluorescent channels jointly, preserving per-organelle structures and enabling a fine-grained morphological analysis that is essential for biological interpretation. We demonstrate biological consistency with real images via CellProfiler features, and MorphGen attains an FID score over 35% lower than the prior state-of-the-art MorphoDiff, which only generates RGB images for a single cell type. Code is available at https://github.com/czi-ai/MorphGen.

Abstract:
We introduce DeepFHT, a survival-analysis framework that couples deep neural networks with first hitting time (FHT) distributions from stochastic process theory. Time to event is represented as the first passage of a latent diffusion process to an absorbing boundary. A neural network maps input variables to physically meaningful parameters including initial condition, drift, and diffusion, within a chosen FHT process such as Brownian motion, both with drift and driftless. This yields closed- form survival and hazard functions and captures time-varying risk without assuming proportional- hazards. We compare DeepFHT with Cox regression using synthetic and real-world datasets. The method achieves predictive accuracy on par with the state-of-the-art approach, while maintaining a physics- based interpretable parameterization that elucidates the relation between input features and risk. This combination of stochastic process theory and deep learning provides a principled avenue for modeling survival phenomena in complex systems

Abstract:
Accurate cell nuclei segmentation is critical for downstream tasks in kidney pathology and remains a major challenge due to the morphological diversity and imaging variability of renal tissues. While our prior work has evaluated early-generation AI cell foundation models in this domain, the effectiveness of recent cell foundation models remains unclear. In this study, we benchmark advanced AI cell foundation models (2025), including CellViT++ variants and Cellpose-SAM, against three widely used cell foundation models developed prior to 2024, using a diverse large-scale set of kidney image patches within a human-in-the-loop rating framework. We further performed fusion-based ensemble evaluation and model agreement analysis to assess the segmentation capabilities of the different models. Our results show that CellViT++ [Virchow] yields the highest standalone performance with 40.3% of predictions rated as "Good" on a curated set of 2,091 challenging samples, outperforming all prior models. In addition, our fused model achieves 62.2% "Good" predictions and only 0.4% "Bad", substantially reducing segmentation errors. Notably, the fusion model (2025) successfully resolved the majority of challenging cases that remained unaddressed in our previous study. These findings demonstrate the potential of AI cell foundation model development in renal pathology and provide a curated dataset of challenging samples to support future kidney-specific model refinement.

Abstract:
Genetic nurture effects and assortative mating (AM) occur across many human behaviors and can bias estimates from traditional genetic models. These influences are typically studied univariately, within the same trait. However, estimation of cross-trait genetic nurture effects and cross-trait AM remains underexplored due to the absence of suitable approaches. To address this, we developed a multivariate extension of the SEM-PGS model for datasets with genotyped and phenotyped parents and offspring, enabling joint estimation of within-trait and cross-trait genetic and environmental influences. By integrating haplotypic polygenic scores (PGS) into a structural equation modeling framework, the model simultaneously estimates same-trait and cross-trait direct effects, genetic nurture, vertical transmission, and assortative mating. We also provide the first formal description of how copaths can be used to model multivariate assortative mating and derive the corresponding parameter expectations in matrix form. Forward-time Monte Carlo simulations under varying conditions of r^2_PGS and N_trio demonstrate that the model yields unbiased estimates of both within-trait and cross-trait effects when assumptions are met. The precision of estimates was adequate with large sample sizes (N_trio > 16k) and improved as PGS predictive power increased. In addition, our simulation results show that failing to model cross-trait effects biases within-trait estimates, underscoring the importance of incorporating cross-trait effects. The multivariate SEM-PGS model offers a powerful and flexible tool for disentangling gene-environment interplay and advancing the understanding of familial influences on human traits.

Abstract:
Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) aims to extract non-contact physiological signals from facial videos and has shown great potential. However, existing rPPG approaches struggle to bridge the gap between source and target domains. Recent test-time adaptation (TTA) solutions typically optimize rPPG model for the incoming test videos using self-training loss under an unrealistic assumption that the target domain remains stationary. However, time-varying factors like weather and lighting in dynamic environments often cause continual domain shifts. The erroneous gradients accumulation from these shifts may corrupt the model's key parameters for physiological information, leading to catastrophic forgetting. Therefore, We propose a physiology-related parameters freezing strategy to retain such knowledge. It isolates physiology-related and domain-related parameters by assessing the model's uncertainty to current domain and freezes the physiology-related parameters during adaptation to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Moreover, the dynamic domain shifts with various non-physiological characteristics may lead to conflicting optimization objectives during TTA, which is manifested as the over-adapted model losing its adaptability to future domains. To fix over-adaptation, we propose a preemptive gradient modification strategy. It preemptively adapts to future domains and uses the acquired gradients to modify current adaptation, thereby preserving the model's adaptability. In summary, we propose a stable continual test-time adaptation (CTTA) framework for rPPG measurement, called \textbf{PhysRAP}, which \textbf{R}emembers the past, \textbf{A}dapts to the present, and \textbf{P}reempts the future. Extensive experiments show its state-of-the-art performance, especially in domain shifts. The code is available at https://github.com/xjtucsy/PhysRAP.

Abstract:
MacroB12 interference presents a significant challenge in the diagnosis of Vitamin B12 status, potentially masking true deficiency. To establish robust predictors and quantify the utility of pre-polyethylene glycol (PEG) B12 levels, we conducted a retrospective analysis of 875 individuals with hypercobalaminaemia (greater than 1000 pg/mL), using multiple imputation to handle missing data. Multivariable regression modelling revealed that MacroB12 positivity (less than 30% PEG recovery) was independently associated with a profile suggestive of autoimmunity, including older age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.03 per year, P<0.001) and a Rheumatologic/Autoimmune diagnosis (aOR 2.96, P=0.01). We also identified a counterintuitive haematological signature, with higher haemoglobin (aOR 1.14, P=0.02) and Mean Corpuscular Volume (aOR 1.04, P=0.01) predicting MacroB12. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis of pre-PEG B12 concentration yielded only moderate discriminatory power (Area Under the Curve [AUC] = 0.744, 95% CI 0.707-0.782). The optimal threshold of 1584.0 pg/mL (sensitivity 71.3%, specificity 69.7%) serves to stratify clinical suspicion, but its performance confirms that it cannot replace definitive confirmatory testing. Our findings define a clinical and laboratory phenotype for suspected MacroB12 but highlight that confirmatory PEG precipitation remains essential for accurate diagnosis, particularly in older patients and those with autoimmune disease.

Abstract:
Assessing the practical identifiability of epidemic models is essential for determining whether parameters can be meaningfully estimated from observed data. Monte Carlo (MC) methods provide an accessible and intuitive framework; however, their standard implementation - perturbing deterministic trajectories with independent Gaussian noise - rests on assumptions poorly suited to epidemic processes, which are inherently stochastic, temporally correlated, and highly variable, especially in small populations or under slow transmission. In this study, we investigate the structure of stochastic variability in the classic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model across a range of epidemiological regimes, and assess whether it can be represented within the independent Gaussian noise framework. We show that continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) trajectories consistently exhibit super-Poissonian variability and strong temporal dependence. Through coverage analysis, we further demonstrate that independent Gaussian noise systematically underestimates the variability of the underlying stochastic process, leading to overly optimistic conclusions about parameter identifiability. In addition, we propose a hybrid simulation approach that introduces time- and amplitude-dependent variability into deterministic ODE trajectories, preserving computational efficiency while capturing key features of epidemic stochasticity. Our findings highlight the limitations of the standard MC algorithm and provide a pathway for incorporating more realistic noise structures into epidemic inference.

Abstract:
Genetic mutations can disrupt protein structure, stability, and solubility, contributing to a wide range of diseases. Existing predictive models often lack interpretability and fail to integrate physical and chemical interactions critical to molecular mechanisms. Moreover, current approaches treat disease association, stability changes, and solubility alterations as separate tasks, limiting model generalizability. In this study, we introduce a unified framework based on multiscale commutative algebra to capture intrinsic physical and chemical interactions for the first time. Leveraging Persistent Stanley-Reisner Theory, we extract multiscale algebraic invariants to build a Commutative Algebra neural Network (CANet). Integrated with transformer features and auxiliary physical features, we apply CANet to tackle three key domains for the first time: disease-associated mutations, mutation-induced protein stability changes, and solubility changes upon mutations. Across six benchmark tasks, CANet and its gradient boosting tree counterpart, CATree, consistently attain state-of-the-art performance, achieving up to 7.5% improvement in predictive accuracy. Our approach offers multiscale, mechanistic, interpretable,and generalizable models for predicting disease-mutation associations.

Abstract:
Detecting anomalies in irregularly sampled multi-variate time-series is challenging, especially in data-scarce settings. Here we introduce an anomaly detection framework for irregularly sampled time-series that leverages neural jump ordinary differential equations (NJODEs). The method infers conditional mean and variance trajectories in a fully path dependent way and computes anomaly scores. On synthetic data containing jump, drift, diffusion, and noise anomalies, the framework accurately identifies diverse deviations. Applied to infant gut microbiome trajectories, it delineates the magnitude and persistence of antibiotic-induced disruptions: revealing prolonged anomalies after second antibiotic courses, extended duration treatments, and exposures during the second year of life. We further demonstrate the predictive capabilities of the inferred anomaly scores in accurately predicting antibiotic events and outperforming diversity-based baselines. Our approach accommodates unevenly spaced longitudinal observations, adjusts for static and dynamic covariates, and provides a foundation for inferring microbial anomalies induced by perturbations, offering a translational opportunity to optimize intervention regimens by minimizing microbial disruptions.

Abstract:
The 1mm roundworm C. elegans is a model organism used in many sub-areas of biology to investigate different types of biological processes. In order to complement the n-vivo analysis with computer-based investigations, several methods have been proposed to simulate the worm behaviour. These methods extract discrete behavioural units from the flow of the worm movements using different types of tracking techniques. Nevertheless, these techniques require a clear view of the entire worm body, which is not always achievable. For example, this happens in high density worm conditions, which are particularly informative to understand the influence of the social context on the single worm behaviour. In this paper, we illustrate and evaluate a method to extract behavioural units from recordings of C. elegans movements which do not necessarily require a clear view of the entire worm body. Moreover, the behavioural units are defined by an unsupervised automatic pipeline which frees the process from predefined assumptions that inevitably bias the behavioural analysis. The behavioural units resulting from the automatic method are interpreted by comparing them with hand-designed behavioural units. The effectiveness of the automatic method is evaluated by measuring the extent to which the movement of a simulated worm, with an agent-based model, matches the movement of a natural worm. Our results indicate that spatio-temporal locomotory patterns emerge even from single point worm tracking. Moreover, we show that such patterns represent a fundamental aspect of the behavioural classification process.

Abstract:
Recovering unbiased properties from biased or perturbed simulations is a central challenge in rare-event sampling. Classical Girsanov Reweighting (GR) offers a principled solution by yielding exact pathwise probability ratios between perturbed and reference processes. However, the variance of GR weights grows rapidly with time, rendering it impractical for long-horizon reweighting. We introduce Marginal Girsanov Reweighting (MGR), which mitigates variance explosion by marginalizing over intermediate paths, producing stable and scalable weights for long-timescale dynamics. Experiments demonstrate that MGR (i) accurately recovers kinetic properties from umbrella-sampling trajectories in molecular dynamics, and (ii) enables efficient Bayesian parameter inference for stochastic differential equations with temporally sparse observations.

Abstract:
Molecular foundation models are rapidly advancing scientific discovery, but their unreliability on out-of-distribution (OOD) samples severely limits their application in high-stakes domains such as drug discovery and protein design. A critical failure mode is chemical hallucination, where models make high-confidence yet entirely incorrect predictions for unknown molecules. To address this challenge, we introduce Molecular Preference-Aligned Instance Ranking (Mole-PAIR), a simple, plug-and-play module that can be flexibly integrated with existing foundation models to improve their reliability on OOD data through cost-effective post-training. Specifically, our method formulates the OOD detection problem as a preference optimization over the estimated OOD affinity between in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples, achieving this goal through a pairwise learning objective. We show that this objective essentially optimizes AUROC, which measures how consistently ID and OOD samples are ranked by the model. Extensive experiments across five real-world molecular datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the OOD detection capabilities of existing molecular foundation models, achieving up to 45.8%, 43.9%, and 24.3% improvements in AUROC under distribution shifts of size, scaffold, and assay, respectively.

Abstract:
Machine learning has markedly advanced de novo peptide sequencing (DNS) for mass spectrometry-based proteomics. DNS tools offer a reliable way to identify peptides without relying on reference databases, extending proteomic analysis and unlocking applications into less-charted regions of the proteome. However, they still face a key limitation. DNS tools lack principled methods for estimating false discovery rates (FDR) and instead rely on model-specific confidence scores that are often miscalibrated. This limits trust in results, hinders cross-model comparisons and reduces validation success. Here we present Winnow, a model-agnostic framework for estimating FDR from calibrated DNS outputs. Winnow maps raw model scores to calibrated confidences using a neural network trained on peptide-spectrum match (PSM)-derived features. From these calibrated scores, Winnow computes PSM-specific error metrics and an experiment-wide FDR estimate using a novel decoy-free FDR estimator. It supports both zero-shot and dataset-specific calibration, enabling flexible application via direct inference, fine-tuning, or training a custom model. We demonstrate that, when applied to InstaNovo predictions, Winnow's calibrator improves recall at fixed FDR thresholds, and its FDR estimator tracks true error rates when benchmarked against reference proteomes and database search. Winnow ensures accurate FDR control across datasets, helping unlock the full potential of DNS.

Abstract:
Bayesian optimization is a natural candidate for the engineering of antibody therapeutic properties, which is often iterative and expensive. However, finding the optimal choice of surrogate model for optimization over the highly structured antibody space is difficult, and may differ depending on the property being optimized. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, no prior works have attempted to incorporate structural information into antibody Bayesian optimization. In this work, we explore different approaches to incorporating structural information into Bayesian optimization, and compare them to a variety of sequence-only approaches on two different antibody properties, binding affinity and stability. In addition, we propose the use of a protein language model-based ``soft constraint,'' which helps guide the optimization to promising regions of the space. We find that certain types of structural information improve data efficiency in early optimization rounds for stability, but have equivalent peak performance. Moreover, when incorporating the protein language model soft constraint we find that the data efficiency gap is diminished for affinity and eliminated for stability, resulting in sequence-only methods that match the performance of structure-based methods, raising questions about the necessity of structure in Bayesian optimization for antibodies.

Abstract:
Identifying DNA- (DBPs) and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) is crucial for the understanding of cell function, molecular interactions as well as regulatory functions. Owing to their high similarity, most of the existing approaches face challenges in differentiating between DBPs and RBPs leading to high cross-prediction errors. Moreover, identifying proteins which bind to both DNA and RNA (DRBPs) is also quite a challenging task. In this regard, we propose a novel framework viz. LAMP-PRo which is based on pre-trained protein language model (PLM), attention mechanisms and multi-label learning to mitigate these issues. First, pre-trained PLM such ESM-2 is used for embedding the protein sequences followed by convolutional neural network (CNN). Subsequently multi-head self-attention mechanism is applied for the contextual information while label-aware attention is used to compute class-specific representations by attending to the sequence in a way that is tailored to each label (DBP, RBP and non-NABP) in a multi-label setup. We have also included a novel cross-label attention mechanism to explicitly capture dependencies between DNA- and RNA-binding proteins, enabling more accurate prediction of DRBP. Finally, a linear layer followed by a sigmoid function are used for the final prediction. Extensive experiments are carried out to compare LAMP-PRo with the existing methods wherein the proposed model shows consistent competent performance. Furthermore, we also provide visualization to showcase model interpretability, highlighting which parts of the sequence are most relevant for a predicted label. The original datasets are available at http://bliulab.net/iDRBP\_MMC and the codes are available at https://github.com/NimishaGhosh/LAMP-PRo.

Abstract:
Agent-based simulation is an indispensable paradigm for studying complex systems. These systems can comprise billions of agents, requiring the computing resources of multiple servers to simulate. Unfortunately, the state-of-the-art platform, BioDynaMo, does not scale out across servers due to its shared-memory-based implementation.   To overcome this key limitation, we introduce TeraAgent, a distributed agent-based simulation engine. A critical challenge in distributed execution is the exchange of agent information across servers, which we identify as a major performance bottleneck. We propose two solutions: 1) a tailored serialization mechanism that allows agents to be accessed and mutated directly from the receive buffer, and 2) leveraging the iterative nature of agent-based simulations to reduce data transfer with delta encoding.   Built on our solutions, TeraAgent enables extreme-scale simulations with half a trillion agents (an 84x improvement), reduces time-to-result with additional compute nodes, improves interoperability with third-party tools, and provides users with more hardware flexibility.

Abstract:
Advancements in tools like Shapely 2.0 and Triton can significantly improve the efficiency of spatial similarity computations by enabling faster and more scalable geometric operations. However, for extremely large datasets, these optimizations may face challenges due to the sheer volume of computations required. To address this, we propose a framework that reduces the number of clusters requiring verification, thereby decreasing the computational load on these systems. The framework integrates dynamic similarity index thresholding, supervised scheduling, and recall-constrained optimization to efficiently identify clusters with the highest spatial similarity while meeting user-defined precision and recall requirements. By leveraging Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to dynamically determine similarity thresholds and machine learning models to prioritize clusters, our approach achieves substantial reductions in computational cost without sacrificing accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of the method, offering a practical solution for large-scale geospatial analysis.

Abstract:
13C-based metabolic flux analysis (13C-MFA) is a cornerstone of quantitative systems biology, yet its increasing data complexity and methodological diversity place high demands on simulation software. We introduce 13CFLUX(v3), a third-generation simulation platform that combines a high-performance C++ engine with a convenient Python interface. The software delivers substantial performance gains across isotopically stationary and nonstationary analysis workflows, while remaining flexible to accommodate diverse labeling strategies and analytical platforms. Its open-source availability facilitates seamless integration into computational ecosystems and community-driven extension. By supporting multi-experiment integration, multi-tracer studies, and advanced statistical inference such as Bayesian analysis, 13CFLUX provides a robust and extensible framework for modern fluxomics research.

Abstract:
We present InfoVAE-Med3D, a latent-representation learning approach for 3D brain MRI that targets interpretable biomarkers of cognitive decline. Standard statistical models and shallow machine learning often lack power, while most deep learning methods behave as black boxes. Our method extends InfoVAE to explicitly maximize mutual information between images and latent variables, producing compact, structured embeddings that retain clinically meaningful content. We evaluate on two cohorts: a large healthy-control dataset (n=6527) with chronological age, and a clinical multiple sclerosis dataset from Charles University in Prague (n=904) with age and Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) scores. The learned latents support accurate brain-age and SDMT regression, preserve key medical attributes, and form intuitive clusters that aid interpretation. Across reconstruction and downstream prediction tasks, InfoVAE-Med3D consistently outperforms other VAE variants, indicating stronger information capture in the embedding space. By uniting predictive performance with interpretability, InfoVAE-Med3D offers a practical path toward MRI-based biomarkers and more transparent analysis of cognitive deterioration in neurological disease.

Abstract:
Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) is a rapidly escalating global health crisis. While genomic sequencing enables rapid prediction of resistance phenotypes, current computational methods have limitations. Standard machine learning models treat the genome as an unordered collection of features, ignoring the sequential context of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs). State-of-the-art sequence models like Transformers are often too data-hungry and computationally expensive for the moderately-sized datasets that are typical in this domain. To address these challenges, we propose AMR-EnsembleNet, an ensemble framework that synergistically combines sequence-based and feature-based learning. We developed a lightweight, custom 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to efficiently learn predictive sequence motifs from high-dimensional SNP data. This sequence-aware model was ensembled with an XGBoost model, a powerful gradient boosting system adept at capturing complex, non-local feature interactions. We trained and evaluated our framework on a benchmark dataset of 809 E. coli strains, predicting resistance across four antibiotics with varying class imbalance. Our 1D CNN-XGBoost ensemble consistently achieved top-tier performance across all the antibiotics, reaching a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.926 for Ciprofloxacin (CIP) and the highest Macro F1-score of 0.691 for the challenging Gentamicin (GEN) AMR prediction. We also show that our model consistently focuses on SNPs within well-known AMR genes like fusA and parC, confirming it learns the correct genetic signals for resistance. Our work demonstrates that fusing a sequence-aware 1D CNN with a feature-based XGBoost model creates a powerful ensemble, overcoming the limitations of using either an order-agnostic or a standalone sequence model.

Abstract:
$\textit{Salmonella}$ expresses bacterial microcompartments (MCPs) upon 1,2-propanediol exposure. MCPs are nanoscale protein-bound shells that encase enzymes for the cofactor-dependent 1,2-propanediol metabolism. They are hypothesized to limit exposure to the toxic intermediate, propionaldehyde, decrease cofactor involvement in competing reactions, and enhance flux. We construct a mass-action mathematical model of purified MCPs and calibrate parameters to measured metabolite concentrations. We constrain mass-action kinetic parameters to previously estimated Michaelis-Menten parameters. We identified two distinct fits with different dynamics in the pathway product, propionate, but similar goodness of fit. Across fits, we inferred that the MCP 1,2-propanediol and propionaldehyde permeability should be greater than $10^{-6}$ and $10^{-8}$ m/s, respectively. Our results identify parameter ranges consistent with prevailing theories that MCPs impose preferential diffusion to 1,2-propanediol over propionaldehyde, and sequester toxic propionaldehyde away from the cell cytosol. The bimodality of the posterior distribution arises from bimodality in the estimated coenzyme-A (CoA) permeability and inhibition rates. The MCP permeability to CoA was inferred to be either less than $10^{-8.8}$ m/s or greater than $10^{-7.3}$ m/s. In a high CoA permeability environment with low rates of CoA inhibition, enzymes produced metabolites by recycling (NAD+)/(NADH). In a low CoA permeability environment with high rates of CoA inhibition, enzymes required external NAD+/H to produce metabolites. Dynamics are consistent with prevailing hypotheses about MCP function to sequester toxic propionaldehyde, and additional collection of data points between 6 and 24 hours or characterization of enzyme inhibition rates could further reduce uncertainty and provide better permeability estimates.

Title: Twin Peaks: Dual-Head Architecture for Structure-Free Prediction of Protein-Protein Binding Affinity and Mutation Effects

Abstract:
We present a novel dual-head deep learning architecture for protein-protein interaction modeling that enables simultaneous prediction of binding affinity ($ΔG$) and mutation-induced affinity changes ($ΔΔG$) using only protein sequence information. Our approach offers a significant advancement over existing methods by employing specialized prediction heads that operate on a shared representation network, allowing direct and optimized prediction of both values. To ensure robust generalization, we integrated complementary datasets from SKEMPI v2 and PDBbind with a rigorous protein domain-based splitting strategy that prevents information leakage between training and validation sets. Our architecture combines transformer-based encoders with a novel cross-attention mechanism that processes paired protein sequences directly, without requiring any structural information. The network embeds input sequences using ESM3 representations, then employs a learnable sliced window embedding layer to manage variable-length sequences efficiently. A multi-layer transformer encoder with bidirectional self-attention captures intra-protein patterns, while cross-attention layers enable explicit modeling of interactions between protein pairs. This shared representation network feeds into separate $ΔG$ and $ΔΔG$ prediction heads, allowing task-specific optimization while leveraging common features. The model achieves $ΔΔG$ validation of Pearson correlation at 0.485, while maintaining strong $ΔG$ predictions (Pearson: 0.638). While existing approaches require protein structure data and binding interface information, our model eliminates these constraints. This provides a critical advantage for the numerous proteins with unknown structures or those challenging to crystallize, such as viral and intrinsically disordered proteins.

Abstract:
Electronic health records (EHRs) provide a powerful basis for predicting the onset of health outcomes. Yet EHRs primarily capture in-clinic events and miss aspects of daily behavior and lifestyle containing rich health information. Consumer wearables, by contrast, continuously measure activity, heart rate, and sleep, and more, offering complementary signals that can fill this gap. Despite this potential, there has been little systematic evaluation of the benefit that wearable data can bring to health outcome prediction on top of EHRs. In this study, we present an extensible framework for multimodal health outcome prediction that integrates EHR and wearable data streams. Using data from the All of Us Program, we systematically compared the combination of different encoding methods on EHR and wearable data, including the traditional feature engineering approach, as well as foundation model embeddings. Across ten clinical outcomes, wearable integration consistently improved model performance relative to EHR-only baselines, e.g., average delta AUROC +5.8% for major depressive disorder, +10.7% for hypertension, and +12.2% for diabetes. On average across all ten outcomes, fusing EHRs with wearable features shows 8.9% improvement in AUROC. To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale evaluation of wearable-EHR fusion, underscoring the utility of wearable-derived signals in complementing EHRs and enabling more holistic, personalized health outcome predictions. Meanwhile, our analysis elucidates future directions for optimizing foundation models for wearable data and its integration with EHR data.

Abstract:
Proteomics data is essential to pathogenic understanding of a disease phenotype. In cancer, analysis of molecular signatures enables precision medicine through the identification of biological processes that drive individualized tumor progression, therapeutic resistance, and clinical heterogeneity. Recent advances in multimodal large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capacity to integrate and reason across heterogeneous data modalities. However, performing multi-modal language modeling for molecular understanding of patient-specific proteomics remains a significant challenge due to two barriers: (1) the lack of instruction-tuning datasets that enable clinical interpretation from proteomics data, and (2) the absence of language modeling architectures designed to capture the rich heterogeneity of molecular data. In this work, we introduce CPTAC-PROTSTRUCT, the first instruction tuning dataset for molecular understanding of oncology, comprising over 400k open-ended examples derived from individualized proteomic profiles curated from the largest national proteomics cancer study (CPTAC). Additionally, we propose KRONOS (Knowledge Representation of patient Omics Networks in Oncology via Structured tuning), a novel graph-LLM framework that leverages molecular interaction topology with proteomics to learn patient-specific graph representations for enhanced clinical reasoning. We show that KRONOS achieves competitive performance across benchmark clinical tasks, including molecular classification, temporal trajectory modeling, and tumor stage prediction from proteomics data. Ultimately, this approach empowers LLMs to understand patient-level pathogenesis, advancing precision medicine through more accurate diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment stratification.

Abstract:
The Vendi score (VS), a diversity metric recently conceived in the context of machine learning, with applications in a wide range of fields, has a few distinct advantages over the metrics commonly used in ecology. It is classification-independent, incorporates abundance information, and has a tunable sensitivity to rare/abundant types. Using rich COVID-19 sequence data as a paradigm, we develop methods for applying the VS to time-resolved sequence data. We show how the VS allows for characterization of the overall diversity of circulating viruses and for discernment of emerging variants prior to formal identification. Furthermore, applying the VS to phylogenetic trees provides a convenient overview of within-clade diversity which can aid viral variant detection.

Abstract:
We develop a physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework for parameter estimation in fractional-order SEIRD epidemic models. By embedding the Caputo fractional derivative into the network residuals via the L1 discretization scheme, our method simultaneously reconstructs epidemic trajectories and infers both epidemiological parameters and the fractional memory order $α$. The fractional formulation extends classical integer-order models by capturing long-range memory effects in disease progression, incubation, and recovery. Our framework learns the fractional memory order $α$ as a trainable parameter while simultaneously estimating the epidemiological rates $(β, σ, γ, μ)$. A composite loss combining data misfit, physics residuals, and initial conditions, with constraints on positivity and population conservation, ensures both accuracy and biological consistency. Tests on synthetic Mpox data confirm reliable recovery of $α$ and parameters under noise, while applications to COVID-19 show that optimal $α\in (0, 1]$ captures memory effects and improves predictive performance over the classical SEIRD model. This work establishes PINNs as a robust tool for learning memory effects in epidemic dynamics, with implications for forecasting, control strategies, and the analysis of non-Markovian epidemic processes.

Abstract:
Accurate and scalable machine-learned inter-atomic potentials (MLIPs) are essential for molecular simulations ranging from drug discovery to new material design. Current state-of-the-art models enforce roto-translational symmetries through equivariant neural network architectures, a hard-wired inductive bias that can often lead to reduced flexibility, computational efficiency, and scalability. In this work, we introduce TransIP: Transformer-based Inter-Atomic Potentials, a novel training paradigm for interatomic potentials achieving symmetry compliance without explicit architectural constraints. Our approach guides a generic non-equivariant Transformer-based model to learn SO(3)-equivariance by optimizing its representations in the embedding space. Trained on the recent Open Molecules (OMol25) collection, a large and diverse molecular dataset built specifically for MLIPs and covering different types of molecules (including small organics, biomolecular fragments, and electrolyte-like species), TransIP effectively learns symmetry in its latent space, providing low equivariance error. Further, compared to a data augmentation baseline, TransIP achieves 40% to 60% improvement in performance across varying OMol25 dataset sizes. More broadly, our work shows that learned equivariance can be a powerful and efficient alternative to augmentation-based MLIP models.

Abstract:
Diffuse optics has the potential to offer a substantial advancement in fetal health monitoring via enabling continuous measurement of fetal blood oxygen saturation (fSpO$_2$). Aiming to enhance the sensing accuracy and to elucidate the foundational limits of Transabdominal Fetal Oximetry (TFO) via diffuse optics, we introduce a theoretical derivation, and a comprehensive pipeline for fSpO$_2$ estimation from non-invasively sensed diffuse light intensity values, which are leveraged to analyze datasets obtained through both simulations and in-vivo experiments in gold standard large animal model of pregnancy. We propose the Exponential Pulsation Ratio (EPR) as a key feature, and develop machine-learning models to fuse the information collected across multiple detectors. Our proposed method demonstrates a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 4.81% and 6.85% with a Pearson's r correlation of 0.81 (p<0.001) and 0.71 (p<0.001) for estimation of fSpO$_2$ in simulated dataset and in-vivo dataset, respectively. Across both datasets, our method outperforms the existing approaches, enhancing the accuracy of the fSpO$_2$ estimation and demonstrates its viability as a supplemental technology for intrapartum fetal monitoring.

Abstract:
Advances in computational pathology increasingly rely on extracting meaningful representations from Whole Slide Images (WSIs) to support various clinical and biological tasks. In this study, we propose a generalizable deep learning framework that integrates the Mamba architecture with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for enhanced WSI analysis. Our method is designed to capture both local spatial relationships and long-range contextual dependencies, offering a flexible architecture for digital pathology analysis. Mamba modules excels in capturing long-range global dependencies, while GNNs emphasize fine-grained short-range spatial interactions. To effectively combine these complementary signals, we introduce an adaptive fusion strategy that uses an entropy-based confidence weighting mechanism. This approach dynamically balances contributions from both branches by assigning higher weight to the branch with more confident (lower-entropy) predictions, depending on the contextual importance of local versus global information for different downstream tasks. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on a representative task: predicting gene fusion and mutation status from WSIs. Our framework, SlideMamba, achieves an area under the precision recall curve (PRAUC) of 0.751 \pm 0.05, outperforming MIL (0.491 \pm 0.042), Trans-MIL (0.39 \pm 0.017), Mamba-only (0.664 \pm 0.063), GNN-only (0.748 \pm 0.091), and a prior similar work GAT-Mamba (0.703 \pm 0.075). SlideMamba also achieves competitive results across ROC AUC (0.738 \pm 0.055), sensitivity (0.662 \pm 0.083), and specificity (0.725 \pm 0.094). These results highlight the strength of the integrated architecture, enhanced by the proposed entropy-based adaptive fusion strategy, and suggest promising potential for application of spatially-resolved predictive modeling tasks in computational pathology.

Abstract:
In this work, we propose a novel method for calibrating Windkessel (WK) parameters in a dimensionally reduced 1D-0D coupled blood flow model. To this end, we design a data-driven neural network (NN)trained on simulated blood pressures in the left brachial artery. Once trained, the NN emulates the pressure pulse waves across the entire simulated domain, i.e., over time, space and varying WK parameters, with negligible error and computational effort. To calibrate the WK parameters on a measured pulse wave, the NN is extended by dummy neurons and retrained only on these. The main objective of this work is to assess the effectiveness of the method in various scenarios -- particularly, when the exact measurement location is unknown or the data are affected by noise.

Abstract:
Ensemble forecasts have become a cornerstone of large-scale disease response, underpinning decision making at agencies such as the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Their growing use reflects the goal of combining multiple models to improve accuracy and stability versus using a single model. However, recent experience shows these benefits are not guaranteed. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the CDC's multi-model forecasting ensemble outperformed the best single model by only 1%, and CDC flu forecasting ensembles have often ranked below multiple individual models.   This raises a key question: why are ensembles underperforming? We posit that a central reason is that both model developers and ensemble builders typically focus on stand-alone accuracy. Models are fit to minimize their own forecasting error, and ensembles are often weighted according to those same scores. However, most epidemic forecasts are built from a small set of approaches and trained on the same surveillance data, leading to highly correlated errors. This redundancy limits the benefit of ensembling and may explain why large ensembles sometimes deliver only marginal gains.   To realize the potential of ensembles, both modelers and ensemblers should prioritize models that contribute complementary information rather than replicating existing approaches. Ensembles built with this principle in mind move beyond size for its own sake toward true diversity, producing forecasts that are more robust and more valuable for epidemic preparedness and response.

Abstract:
Understanding disease dynamics is crucial for managing wildlife populations and assessing spillover risk to domestic animals and humans, but infection data on free-ranging animals are difficult to obtain. Because pathogen and parasite infections can alter host movement, infection status may be inferred from animal trajectories. We present a hidden Markov model (HMM) framework that links observed movement behaviors to unobserved infection states, consistent with epidemiological compartmental models (e.g., susceptible, infected, recovered, dead). Using movement data from 84 reintroduced scimitar-horned oryx (Oryx dammah), 38 confirmed dead in the field and 6 sampled for disease testing, we demonstrate how HMMs can incorporate epidemiological structure through (1) constrained transition probabilities (e.g., to preclude or allow recovery), (2) covariate effects on transmission, and (3) hierarchically structured HMMs (HHMMs) for multi-scale transitions. Comparing veterinary diagnostic reports with model outputs, we found that HMMs with epidemiological constraints successfully identified infection-associated reductions in movement, whereas unconstrained models failed to capture disease progression. Simulations further showed that constrained HMMs accurately classified susceptible, infected, and recovered states. By illustrating flexible formulations and a workflow for model selection, we provide a transferable approach for detecting infection from movement data. This framework can enhance wildlife disease surveillance, guide population management, and improve understanding of disease dynamics.

Abstract:
Retrosynthesis planning enables the discovery of viable synthetic routes for target molecules, playing a crucial role in domains like drug discovery and materials design. Multi-step retrosynthetic planning remains computationally challenging due to exponential search spaces and inference costs. While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate chemical reasoning capabilities, their application to synthesis planning faces constraints on efficiency and cost. To address these challenges, we introduce AOT*, a framework that transforms retrosynthetic planning by integrating LLM-generated chemical synthesis pathways with systematic AND-OR tree search. To this end, AOT* atomically maps the generated complete synthesis routes onto AND-OR tree components, with a mathematically sound design of reward assignment strategy and retrieval-based context engineering, thus enabling LLMs to efficiently navigate in the chemical space. Experimental evaluation on multiple synthesis benchmarks demonstrates that AOT* achieves SOTA performance with significantly improved search efficiency. AOT* exhibits competitive solve rates using 3-5$\times$ fewer iterations than existing LLM-based approaches, with the efficiency advantage becoming more pronounced on complex molecular targets.

Abstract:
Polygenic risk scores can be used to model the individual genetic liability for human traits. Current methods primarily focus on modeling the mean of a phenotype neglecting the variance. However, genetic variants associated with phenotypic variance can provide important insights to gene-environment interaction studies. To overcome this, we propose snpboostlss, a cyclical gradient boosting algorithm for a Gaussian location-scale model to jointly derive sparse polygenic models for both the mean and the variance of a quantitative phenotype. To improve computational efficiency on high-dimensional and large-scale genotype data (large n and large p), we only consider a batch of most relevant variants in each boosting step. We investigate the effect of statins therapy (the environmental factor) on low-density lipoprotein in the UK Biobank cohort using the new snpboostlss algorithm. We are able to verify the interaction between statins usage and the polygenic risk scores for phenotypic variance in both cross sectional and longitudinal analyses. Particularly, following the spirit of target trial emulation, we observe that the treatment effect of statins is more substantial in people with higher polygenic risk scores for phenotypic variance, indicating gene-environment interaction. When applying to body mass index, the newly constructed polygenic risk scores for variance show significant interaction with physical activity and sedentary behavior. Therefore, the polygenic risk scores for phenotypic variance derived by snpboostlss have potential to identify individuals that could benefit more from environmental changes (e.g. medical intervention and lifestyle changes).

Abstract:
Inspired by the effectiveness of genetic algorithms and the importance of synthesizability in molecular design, we present SynGA, a simple genetic algorithm that operates directly over synthesis routes. Our method features custom crossover and mutation operators that explicitly constrain it to synthesizable molecular space. By modifying the fitness function, we demonstrate the effectiveness of SynGA on a variety of design tasks, including synthesizable analog search and sample-efficient property optimization, for both 2D and 3D objectives. Furthermore, by coupling SynGA with a machine learning-based filter that focuses the building block set, we boost SynGA to state-of-the-art performance. For property optimization, this manifests as a model-based variant SynGBO, which employs SynGA and block filtering in the inner loop of Bayesian optimization. Since SynGA is lightweight and enforces synthesizability by construction, our hope is that SynGA can not only serve as a strong standalone baseline but also as a versatile module that can be incorporated into larger synthesis-aware workflows in the future.

Abstract:
Infectious diseases continue to pose a serious threat to public health, underscoring the urgent need for effective computational approaches to screen novel anti-infective agents. Oligopeptides have emerged as promising candidates in antimicrobial research due to their structural simplicity, high bioavailability, and low susceptibility to resistance. Despite their potential, computational models specifically designed to predict associations between oligopeptides and infectious diseases remain scarce. This study introduces a prompt-guided graph-based contrastive learning framework (PGCLODA) to uncover potential associations. A tripartite graph is constructed with oligopeptides, microbes, and diseases as nodes, incorporating both structural and semantic information. To preserve critical regions during contrastive learning, a prompt-guided graph augmentation strategy is employed to generate meaningful paired views. A dual encoder architecture, integrating Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and Transformer, is used to jointly capture local and global features. The fused embeddings are subsequently input into a multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier for final prediction. Experimental results on a benchmark dataset indicate that PGCLODA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in AUROC, AUPRC, and accuracy. Ablation and hyperparameter studies confirm the contribution of each module. Case studies further validate the generalization ability of PGCLODA and its potential to uncover novel, biologically relevant associations. These findings offer valuable insights for mechanism-driven discovery and oligopeptide-based drug development. The source code of PGCLODA is available online at https://github.com/jjnlcode/PGCLODA.

Abstract:
Agentic AI is rapidly advancing in healthcare and biomedical research. However, in medical image analysis, their performance and adoption remain limited due to the lack of a robust ecosystem, insufficient toolsets, and the absence of real-time interactive expert feedback. Here we present "TissueLab", a co-evolving agentic AI system that allows researchers to ask direct questions, automatically plan and generate explainable workflows, and conduct real-time analyses where experts can visualize intermediate results and refine them. TissueLab integrates tool factories across pathology, radiology, and spatial omics domains. By standardizing inputs, outputs, and capabilities of diverse tools, the system determines when and how to invoke them to address research and clinical questions. Across diverse tasks with clinically meaningful quantifications that inform staging, prognosis, and treatment planning, TissueLab achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with end-to-end vision-language models (VLMs) and other agentic AI systems such as GPT-5. Moreover, TissueLab continuously learns from clinicians, evolving toward improved classifiers and more effective decision strategies. With active learning, it delivers accurate results in unseen disease contexts within minutes, without requiring massive datasets or prolonged retraining. Released as a sustainable open-source ecosystem, TissueLab aims to accelerate computational research and translational adoption in medical imaging while establishing a foundation for the next generation of medical AI.

Abstract:
Estimating, understanding, and communicating uncertainty is fundamental to statistical epidemiology, where model-based estimates regularly inform real-world decisions. However, sources of uncertainty are rarely formalised, and existing classifications are often defined inconsistently. This lack of structure hampers interpretation, model comparison, and targeted data collection. Connecting ideas from machine learning, information theory, experimental design, and health economics, we present a first-principles decision-theoretic framework that defines uncertainty as the expected loss incurred by making an estimate based on incomplete information, arguing that this is a highly useful and practically relevant definition for epidemiology. We show how reasoning about future data leads to a notion of expected uncertainty reduction, which induces formal definitions of reducible and irreducible uncertainty. We demonstrate our approach using a case study of SARS-CoV-2 wastewater surveillance in Aotearoa New Zealand, estimating the uncertainty reduction if wastewater surveillance were expanded to the full population. We then connect our framework to relevant literature from adjacent fields, showing how it unifies and extends many of these ideas and how it allows these ideas to be applied to a wider range of models. Altogether, our framework provides a foundation for more reliable, consistent, and policy-relevant uncertainty quantification in infectious disease epidemiology.

Abstract:
Efficient design of genomic perturbation experiments is crucial for accelerating drug discovery and therapeutic target identification, yet exhaustive perturbation of the human genome remains infeasible due to the vast search space of potential genetic interactions and experimental constraints. Bayesian optimization (BO) has emerged as a powerful framework for selecting informative interventions, but existing approaches often fail to exploit domain-specific biological prior knowledge. We propose Biology-Informed Bayesian Optimization (BioBO), a method that integrates Bayesian optimization with multimodal gene embeddings and enrichment analysis, a widely used tool for gene prioritization in biology, to enhance surrogate modeling and acquisition strategies. BioBO combines biologically grounded priors with acquisition functions in a principled framework, which biases the search toward promising genes while maintaining the ability to explore uncertain regions. Through experiments on established public benchmarks and datasets, we demonstrate that BioBO improves labeling efficiency by 25-40%, and consistently outperforms conventional BO by identifying top-performing perturbations more effectively. Moreover, by incorporating enrichment analysis, BioBO yields pathway-level explanations for selected perturbations, offering mechanistic interpretability that links designs to biologically coherent regulatory circuits.

Abstract:
Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has shown remarkable success in hematological malignancies, yet patient responses remain highly variable and the roles of CD4 and CD8 subsets are not fully understood. We present an extended mathematical framework of CAR-T cell dynamics that explicitly models CD4 helper and CD8 cytotoxic lineages and their interactions with tumor antigen burden. Building on the Kirouac et al. (2023) model of antigen-regulated memory, effector, and exhaustion transitions, our system of differential equations incorporates cytokine-mediated modulation of CD8 proliferation, cytotoxicity, and memory regeneration by CD4 T cells. Sensitivity analyses identify effector proliferation burst size, antigen turnover, and CD8 expansion rates as dominant determinants of treatment outcome. Virtual patient simulations reproduce clinical findings that a 1:1 CD4:CD8 ratio enhances CAR-T expansion and tumor clearance relative to CD8-only products. Finally, we integrate a feed-forward neural network trained on noisy virtual patient data to improve predictive robustness, and apply SHAP analysis to interpret the network predictions and compare them with mechanistic sensitivity analyses. This work highlights the synergistic roles of CD4 and CD8 CAR-T cells and provides a quantitative foundation for optimizing treatments and patient stratification.

Abstract:
Peripheral blood smears remain a cornerstone in the diagnosis of hematological neoplasms, offering rapid and valuable insights that inform subsequent diagnostic steps. However, since neoplastic transformations typically arise in the bone marrow, they may not manifest as detectable aberrations in peripheral blood, presenting a diagnostic challenge. In this paper, we introduce cAItomorph, an explainable transformer-based AI model, trained to classify hematological malignancies based on peripheral blood cytomorphology. Our data comprises peripheral blood single-cell images from 6115 patients with diagnoses confirmed by cytomorphology, cytogenetics, molecular genetics, and immunophenotyping from bone marrow samples, and 495 healthy controls, eight coarse classes. cAItomorph leverages the DinoBloom hematology foundation model and aggregates image encodings via a transformer-based architecture into a single vector. It achieves an overall accuracy of 0.72 in eight disease classification, with F1 scores of 0.76 for acute leukemia, 0.80 for myeloproliferative neoplasms and 0.94 for healthy cases. The overall accuracy increases to 0.87 in top-2 predictions. cAItomorph achieves high sensitivity for acute leukemia cases in external test sets. By analyzing attention heads, we demonstrate clinically relevant cell-level attentions in both internal and external test sets. Moreover, our model's calibrated prediction probabilities reduce the false discovery rate from 13.5% to 8.7% without missing any acute leukemia cases, thereby decreasing the number of unnecessary bone marrow aspirations based on peripheral blood smears. This study highlights the potential of AI-assisted diagnostics in hematological malignancies, illustrating how models trained on real-world data could enhance diagnostic accuracy and reduce invasive procedures.

Abstract:
Advances in genomic medicine accelerate the identi cation of mutations in disease-associated genes, but the pathogenicity of many mutations remains unknown, hindering their use in diagnostics and clinical decision-making. Predictive AI models are generated to combat this issue, but current tools display low accuracy when tested against functionally validated datasets. We show that integrating detailed conformational data extracted from molecular dynamics simulations (MDS) into advanced AI-based models increases their predictive power. We carry out an exhaustive mutational analysis of the disease gene PMM2 and subject structural models of each variant to MDS. AI models trained on this dataset outperform existing tools when predicting the known pathogenicity of mutations. Our best performing model, a neuronal networks model, also predicts the pathogenicity of several PMM2 mutations currently considered of unknown signi cance. We believe this model helps alleviate the burden of unknown variants in genomic medicine.

Abstract:
The ongoing opioid crisis highlights the urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies that can be rapidly deployed. This study presents a novel approach to identify potential repurposable drugs for the treatment of opioid addiction, aiming to bridge the gap between transcriptomic data analysis and drug discovery. Speciffcally, we perform a meta-analysis of seven transcriptomic datasets related to opioid addiction by differential gene expression (DGE) analysis, and propose a novel multiscale topological differentiation to identify key genes from a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network derived from DEGs. This method uses persistent Laplacians to accurately single out important nodes within the PPI network through a multiscale manner to ensure high reliability. Subsequent functional validation by pathway enrichment and rigorous data curation yield 1,865 high-conffdence targets implicated in opioid addiction, which are cross-referenced with DrugBank to compile a repurposing candidate list. To evaluate drug-target interactions, we construct predictive models utilizing two natural language processing-derived molecular embeddings and a conventional molecular ffngerprint. Based on these models, we prioritize compounds with favorable binding afffnity proffles, and select candidates that are further assessed through molecular docking simulations to elucidate their receptor-level interactions. Additionally, pharmacokinetic and toxicological evaluations are performed via ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity) proffling, providing a multidimensional assessment of druggability and safety. This study offers a generalizable approach for drug repurposing in other complex diseases beyond opioid addiction.

Abstract:
Computational models provide crucial insights into complex biological processes such as cancer evolution, but their mechanistic nature often makes them nonlinear and parameter-rich, complicating calibration. We systematically evaluate parameter probability distributions in cell migration models using Bayesian calibration across four complementary strategies: parametric and surrogate models, each with and without explicit model discrepancy. This approach enables joint analysis of parameter uncertainty, predictive performance, and interpretability. Applied to a real data experiment of glioblastoma progression in microfluidic devices, surrogate models achieve higher computational efficiency and predictive accuracy, whereas parametric models yield more reliable parameter estimates due to their mechanistic grounding. Incorporating model discrepancy exposes structural limitations, clarifying where model refinement is necessary. Together, these comparisons offer practical guidance for calibrating and improving computational models of complex biological systems.

Abstract:
Accurate classification of blood cells plays a key role in improving automated blood analysis for both medical and veterinary applications. This work presents a two-stage deep clustering method for classifying blood cells from high-dimensional signal data. In the first stage, red blood cells (RBCs) and platelets (PLTs) are separated using a combination of an improved autoencoder and the IDEC algorithm. The second stage further classifies RBC subtypes, pure RBCs, reticulocytes, and clumped RBCs, through a variational deep embedding (VaDE) approach. Due to the lack of detailed cell-level labels, soft classification probabilities are generated from sample-level data to approximate the true distributions. The aim is to contribute to the development of low-cost, automated blood analysis systems suitable for veterinary and biomedical use. Initial results indicate this method shows promise in effectively distinguishing different blood cell populations, even with limited supervision.

Abstract:
Electroencephalography (EEG)-based wearable brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) face challenges due to low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and non-stationary neural activity. We introduce in this manuscript a mathematically rigorous framework that combines data-driven noise interval evaluation with advanced SNR visualization to address these limitations. Analysis of the publicly available Eye-BCI multimodal dataset demonstrates the method's ability to recover canonical P300 characteristics across frequency bands (delta: 0.5-4 Hz, theta: 4-7.5 Hz, broadband: 1-15 Hz), with precise spatiotemporal localization of both P3a (frontocentral) and P3b (parietal) subcomponents. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically assess the impact of noise interval selection on EEG signal quality. Cross-session correlations for four different choices of noise intervals spanning from early to late pre-stimulus phases also indicate that alertness and task engagement states modulate noise interval sensitivity, suggesting broader applications for adaptive BCI systems. While validated in healthy participants, our results represent a first step towards providing clinicians with an interpretable tool for detecting neurophysiological abnormalities and provides quantifiable metrics for system optimization.

Abstract:
Protein folding models have achieved groundbreaking results typically via a combination of integrating domain knowledge into the architectural blocks and training pipelines. Nonetheless, given the success of generative models across different but related problems, it is natural to question whether these architectural designs are a necessary condition to build performant models. In this paper, we introduce SimpleFold, the first flow-matching based protein folding model that solely uses general purpose transformer blocks. Protein folding models typically employ computationally expensive modules involving triangular updates, explicit pair representations or multiple training objectives curated for this specific domain. Instead, SimpleFold employs standard transformer blocks with adaptive layers and is trained via a generative flow-matching objective with an additional structural term. We scale SimpleFold to 3B parameters and train it on approximately 9M distilled protein structures together with experimental PDB data. On standard folding benchmarks, SimpleFold-3B achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines, in addition SimpleFold demonstrates strong performance in ensemble prediction which is typically difficult for models trained via deterministic reconstruction objectives. Due to its general-purpose architecture, SimpleFold shows efficiency in deployment and inference on consumer-level hardware. SimpleFold challenges the reliance on complex domain-specific architectures designs in protein folding, opening up an alternative design space for future progress.

Abstract:
We present a novel information-preserving Chaos Game Representation (CGR) method, also called Reverse-CGR (R-CGR), for biological sequence analysis that addresses the fundamental limitation of traditional CGR approaches - the loss of sequence information during geometric mapping. Our method introduces complete sequence recovery through explicit path encoding combined with rational arithmetic precision control, enabling perfect sequence reconstruction from stored geometric traces. Unlike purely geometric approaches, our reversibility is achieved through comprehensive path storage that maintains both positional and character information at each step. We demonstrate the effectiveness of R-CGR on biological sequence classification tasks, achieving competitive performance compared to traditional sequence-based methods while providing interpretable geometric visualizations. The approach generates feature-rich images suitable for deep learning while maintaining complete sequence information through explicit encoding, opening new avenues for interpretable bioinformatics analysis where both accuracy and sequence recovery are essential.

Abstract:
Research done using model organisms has been fundamental to the biological understanding of human genes, diseases and phenotypes. Model organisms provide tractable systems for experiments to enhance understanding of biological mechanisms conserved across the evolutionary tree. Decades of model organism research has generated vast amounts of data; however, this data is split across many domains, organisms, and biological fields of research. Knowledge graphs (KGs) are a computational way to aggregate and compile disparate information in a parsable format. By unifying data across studies, organisms and time points, KG researchers can create novel targeted hypotheses. Here we demonstrate how model organisms are connected to humans and other organisms through genes, diseases and phenotypes allowing for a broader understanding of genetic biology than just one organism alone can provide. Utilizing resources such as the Monarch KG is a great way to reduce redundant experiments and find directions previously unexplored.

This article reviews the evolving field of radiobiology, emphasizing the need for advanced multiscale, mechanistic models to optimize radiopharmaceutical therapies (RPT). While the traditional linear-quadratic (LQ) model underpins external beam radiation therapy (EBRT), RPT's unique biological and spatial complexities demand new approaches. First-principles simulations of DNA damage, repair, and multicellular responses are crucial for understanding therapeutic efficacy and toxicity. The integration of these models into personalized, digital twin frameworks promises transformative clinical applications, but progress depends on deep mechanistic insights, experimental validation, and balancing model complexity with practicality for clinical use.

Abstract:
We present a new 10-meter map of dominant tree species in Swedish forests accompanied by pixel-level uncertainty estimates. The tree species classification is based on spatiotemporal metrics derived from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite data, combined with field observations from the Swedish National Forest Inventory. We apply an extreme gradient boosting model with Bayesian optimization to relate field observations to satellite-derived features and generate the final species map. Classification uncertainty is quantified using Shannon's entropy of the predicted class probabilities, which provide a spatially explicit measure of model confidence. The final model achieved an overall accuracy of 85% (F1 score = 0.82, Matthews correlation coefficient = 0.81), and mapped species distributions showed strong agreement with official forest statistics (r = 0.96).

Abstract:
In this study, we introduce a sensitivity analysis methodology for stochastic systems in chemistry, where dynamics are often governed by random processes. Our approach is based on gradient estimation via finite differences, averaging simulation outcomes, and analyzing variability under intrinsic noise. We characterize gradient uncertainty as an angular range within which all plausible gradient directions are expected to lie. This uncertainty measure adaptively guides the number of simulations performed for each nominal-perturbation pair of points in order to minimize unnecessary computations while maintaining robustness.   Systematically exploring a range of parameter values across the parameter space, rather than focusing on a single value, allows us to identify not only sensitive parameters but also regions of parameter space associated with different levels of sensitivity. These results are visualized through vector field plots to offer an intuitive representation of local sensitivity across parameter space. Additionally, global sensitivity coefficients are computed to capture overall trends.   Flexibility regarding the choice of output observable measures is another key feature of our method: while traditional sensitivity analyses often focus on species concentrations, our framework allows for the definition of a large range of problem-specific observables. This makes it broadly applicable in diverse chemical and biochemical scenarios. We demonstrate our approach on two systems: classical Michaelis-Menten kinetics and a rule-based model of the formose reaction, using the cheminformatics software MØD for Gillespie-based stochastic simulations.

Abstract:
Locomotor behavioural responses are increasingly recognized as sensitive and ecologically relevant indicators for assessing aquatic organism exposure to contaminants. They often occur at concentrations lower than those causing physiological damage, yet their consequences for organisms' fitness and population dynamics remain unclear. Moreover, it is still uncertain how these behavioural endpoints align with traditional toxicological apical endpoints used to assess species sensitivities in risk assessment. This study evaluates the correlation between thresholds triggering locomotor reactions with LC50 values across 19 freshwater and 12 marine invertebrate species exposed to the insecticide imidacloprid and the metal copper. Behavioural responses were measured via videotracking during pulse exposure assays, while 96h acute tests provided species-specific LC50 values for copper. Results reveal strong discrepancies: some highly sensitive species showed no locomotor changes, whereas others tolerant to lethality displayed strong movement responses. For instance, freshwater annelids and gastropods responded markedly to imidacloprid, while marine shrimps exhibited hyperactivity under low copper levels. These findings indicate that relying solely on lethality-based data may underestimate the fraction of species affected by contamination. Integrating behavioural endpoints into population risk assessment frameworks is therefore crucial to better protect aquatic biodiversity.

Abstract:
The challenge of translating vast, multimodal biological data into predictive and mechanistic understanding of cellular function is a central theme in modern biology. Virtual cells, or digital cellular twins, have emerged as a critical paradigm to meet this challenge by creating integrative computational models of cellular processes. This review synthesizes the evolution and current state of the virtual cell, from foundational mechanistic frameworks like the Virtual Cell that employ deterministic and stochastic simulations to the recent transformative impact of artificial intelligence and foundation models. We examine the core technological pillars required to build these models, including the integration of various data types, such as single-cell and spatial omics, the spectrum of modeling approaches, and the bioengineering principles that connect simulation to application. We further discuss key applications, frameworks for model benchmarking and validation, and the significant hurdles that remain, including computational scalability, parameter inference, and ethical considerations, which provides a roadmap for development of predictive virtual cells that promise to revolutionize biomedical research and clinical practice.

Abstract:
T cell receptor (TCR) recognition of peptide-MHC (pMHC) complexes is fundamental to adaptive immunity and central to the development of T cell-based immunotherapies. While transformer-based models have shown promise in predicting TCR-pMHC interactions, most lack a systematic and explainable approach to architecture design. We present an approach that uses a new post-hoc explainability method to inform the construction of a novel encoder-decoder transformer model. By identifying the most informative combinations of TCR and epitope sequence inputs, we optimize cross-attention strategies, incorporate auxiliary training objectives, and introduce a novel early-stopping criterion based on explanation quality. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance while simultaneously improving explainability, robustness, and generalization. This work establishes a principled, explanation-driven strategy for modeling TCR-pMHC binding and offers mechanistic insights into sequence-level binding behavior through the lens of deep learning.

Abstract:
Inferring synaptic connectivity from neural population activity is a fundamental challenge in computational neuroscience, complicated by partial observability and mismatches between inference models and true circuit dynamics. In this study, we propose a graph-based neural inference model that simultaneously predicts neural activity and infers latent connectivity by modeling neurons as interacting nodes in a graph. The architecture features two distinct modules: one for learning structural connectivity and another for predicting future spiking activity via a graph neural network (GNN). Our model accommodates unobserved neurons through auxiliary nodes, allowing for inference in partially observed circuits. We evaluate this approach using synthetic data generated from ring attractor network models and real spike recordings from head direction cells in mice. Across a wide range of conditions, including varying recurrent connectivity, external inputs, and incomplete observations, our model reliably resolves spurious correlations and recovers accurate weight profiles. When applied to real data, the inferred connectivity aligns with theoretical predictions of continuous attractor models. These results highlight the potential of GNN-based models to infer latent neural circuitry through self-supervised structure learning, while leveraging the spike prediction task to flexibly link connectivity and dynamics across both simulated and biological neural systems.

Abstract:
Networks constitute fundamental organizational structures across biological systems, although conventional graph-theoretic analyses capture exclusively pairwise interactions, thereby omitting the intricate higher-order relationships that characterize network complexity. This work proposes a unified framework for heat kernel smoothing on simplicial complexes, extending classical signal processing methodologies from vertices and edges to cycles and higher-dimensional structures. Through Hodge Laplacian, a discrete heat kernel on a finite simplicial complex $\mathcal{K}$ is constructed to smooth signals on $k$-simplices via the boundary operator $\partial_k$. Computationally efficient sparse algorithms for constructing boundary operators are developed to implement linear diffusion processes on $k$-simplices. The methodology generalizes heat kernel smoothing to $k$-simplices, utilizing boundary structure to localize topological features while maintaining homological invariance. Simulation studies demonstrate qualitative signal enhancement across vertex and edge domains following diffusion processes. Application to parcellated human brain functional connectivity networks reveals that simplex-space smoothing attenuates spurious connections while amplifying coherent anatomical architectures, establishing practical significance for computational neuroscience applications.

Existing positional encoding methods demand predefined token/feature order, rendering them unsuitable for real-world data with non-sequential yet causally-related features. To address this limitation, we propose CAPE, a novel method that identifies underlying causal structure over non-sequential features as a weighted directed acyclic graph (DAG) using generalized structural equation modeling. The DAG is then embedded in hyperbolic space where its geometric structure is well-preserved using a hyperboloid model-based approach that effectively captures two important causal graph properties (causal strength & causal specificity). This step yields causality-aware positional encodings for the features, which are converted into their rotary form for integrating with transformer's self-attention mechanism. Theoretical analysis reveals that CAPE-generated rotary positional encodings possess three valuable properties for enhanced self-attention, including causal distance-induced attenuation, causal generality-induced attenuation, and robustness to positional disturbances. We evaluate CAPE over both synthetic and real-word datasets, empirically demonstrating its theoretical properties and effectiveness in enhancing transformer for data with non-sequential features.

Abstract:
Antibiotics are a vital class of drugs closely associated with the prevention and treatment of bacterial infections. Accurate prediction of molecular antimicrobial activity remains a key challenge in the pursuit of novel antibiotic candidates. However, laboratory-based antimicrobial compounds identification is costly, time-consuming, and prone to rediscovering known antibiotics, highlighting the urgent need for efficient and accurate computational models. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) have significantly enhanced the ability to explore chemical space and identify potential antimicrobial compounds. In this study, we particularly emphasize deep learning models and employ five chemistry language models tailored for chemical data to encode small molecules. Our model incorporates a unique capsule network architecture and introduces innovations in loss function selection and feature processing modules, demonstrating superior performance in predicting inhibitory activities against Escherichia coli and Acinetobacter baumannii. We conducted a series of ablation studies to elucidate the contributions of network design and input features. Case studies validated the usability and effectiveness of our model.To facilitate accessibility, we developed an intuitive web portal to disseminate this novel tool. Our results indicate that the proposed approach offers improved predictive accuracy and enhanced interpretability, underscoring the potential of interpretable artificial intelligence methods in accelerating antibiotic discovery and addressing the urgent challenge of antimicrobial resistance.

Abstract:
Integration and analysis of multi-omics data provide valuable insights for cancer subtype classification. However, such data are inherently heterogeneous, high-dimensional, and exhibit complex intra- and inter-modality dependencies. Recent advances in graph neural networks (GNNs) offer powerful tools for modeling such structure. Yet, most existing methods rely on prior knowledge or predefined similarity networks to construct graphs, which are often undirected or unweighted, failing to capture the directionality and strength of biological interactions. Interpretability at both the modality and feature levels also remains limited. To address these challenges, we propose TF-DWGNet, a novel Graph Neural Network framework that combines tree-based Directed Weighted graph construction with Tensor Fusion for multiclass cancer subtype classification. TF-DWGNet introduces two key innovations: a supervised tree-based approach for constructing directed, weighted graphs tailored to each omics modality, and a tensor fusion mechanism that captures unimodal, bimodal, and trimodal interactions using low-rank decomposition for efficiency. TF-DWGNet enables modality-specific representation learning, joint embedding fusion, and interpretable subtype prediction. Experiments on real-world cancer datasets show that TF-DWGNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple metrics and statistical tests. Moreover, it provides biologically meaningful insights by ranking influential features and modalities. These results highlight TF-DWGNet's potential for effective and interpretable multi-omics integration in cancer research.

Abstract:
Neuroimaging provides rich measurements of brain structure and neural activity, but turning these data into mechanistic insight remains difficult. Statistical models quantify associations without much considerations for how they arise, whereas bio-realistic models directly embody candidate mechanisms but remain hard to deploy rigorously without specialized training. We present a framework that recasts modeling choices as testable mechanistic hypotheses and supplies a simple protocol for rejecting inappropriate model specifications, such as under-/over-parameterization or invalid simplifying assumptions, based on predefined criteria before any parameter inference. The key idea is expected model behavior under feature generalization constraints: instead of judging a model solely by how well it fits a specific target feature of interest Y at an optimal parameter set, we evaluate the model's expected Y output when the model is constrained to reproduce a broader, or distinct, feature Z over the entire parameter space. We then assess whether a mirror statistical model, derived from the model's expected Y outputs, to the empirical statistical model using standard statistics. In synthetic experiments with known ground truth (Wilson Cowan dynamics), the framework correctly rejects mis-specified hypotheses, penalizes unnecessary degrees of freedom, and preserves valid specifications. This provides a practical, hypothesis-first route to using mechanistic models for neuroimaging without requiring expert-level methodology.

Abstract:
Small interfering RNA (siRNA) is a short double-stranded RNA molecule (about 21-23 nucleotides) with the potential to cure diseases by silencing the function of target genes. Due to its well-understood mechanism, many siRNA-based drugs have been evaluated in clinical trials. However, selecting effective binding regions and designing siRNA sequences requires extensive experimentation, making the process costly. As genomic resources and publicly available siRNA datasets continue to grow, data-driven models can be leveraged to better understand siRNA-mRNA interactions. To fully exploit such data, curating high-quality siRNA datasets is essential to minimize experimental errors and noise. We propose siDPT: siRNA efficacy Prediction via Debiased Preference-Pair Transformer, a framework that constructs a preference-pair dataset and designs an siRNA-mRNA interactive transformer with debiased ranking objectives to improve siRNA inhibition prediction and generalization. We evaluate our approach using two public datasets and one newly collected patent dataset. Our model demonstrates substantial improvement in Pearson correlation and strong performance across other metrics.

Abstract:
Single-cell RNA-seq provides detailed molecular snapshots of individual cells but is notoriously noisy. Variability stems from biological differences, PCR amplification bias, limited sequencing depth, and low capture efficiency, making it challenging to adapt computational pipelines to heterogeneous datasets or evolving technologies. As a result, most studies still rely on principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, valued for its interpretability and robustness. Here, we improve upon PCA with a Random Matrix Theory (RMT)-based approach that guides the inference of sparse principal components using existing sparse PCA algorithms. We first introduce a novel biwhitening method, inspired by the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm, that simultaneously stabilizes variance across genes and cells. This enables the use of an RMT-based criterion to automatically select the sparsity level, rendering sparse PCA nearly parameter-free. Our mathematically grounded approach retains the interpretability of PCA while enabling robust, hands-off inference of sparse principal components. Across seven single-cell RNA-seq technologies and four sparse PCA algorithms, we show that this method systematically improves the reconstruction of the principal subspace and consistently outperforms PCA-, autoencoder-, and diffusion-based methods in cell-type classification tasks.

Abstract:
Kaplan--Meier curves are widely used in medical research to evaluate the performance of biomarkers and predict patient outcomes. These curves are often shown without error bands, and even when error bands are provided, they typically only account for the statistical uncertainty resulting from the finite number of patients in the study. In reality, other sources of uncertainty affect the measurements as well. As datasets grow, the statistical uncertainty on the number of patients no longer dominates the overall uncertainty, and other uncertainties are increasingly important to model. The KoMbine package, developed based on procedures used in particle physics, provides the first method to propagate both statistical and systematic uncertainties through the Kaplan--Meier curve estimation processes.

Abstract:
This study compares the predictive capacity of the Dynamic Habitat Index (DHI) - a remote sensing (RS)-based measure of habitat productivity and variability - against traditional land-use/land-cover (LULC) metrics in species distribution modelling (SDM) applications. RS and LULC-based SDMs were built using distribution data for eleven bird, amphibian, and mammal species in Île-de-France. Predictor variables were derived from Sentinel-2 RS data and LULC classifications, with the latter incorporating Euclidean distance to habitat types. Ensemble SDMs were built using nine algorithms and evaluated with the Continuous Boyce Index (CBI) and a calibrated AUC. Habitat suitability scores and their binary transformations were assessed using niche overlap indices (Schoener, Warren, and Spearman rank correlation coefficient). Both RS and LULC approaches exhibited similar predictive accuracy overall. After binarisation however, the resulting niche maps diverged significantly. While LULC-based models exhibited spatial constraints (habitat suitability decreased as distance from recorded occurrences increased), RS-based models, which used continuous data, were not affected by geographic bias or distance effects. These results underscore the need to account for spatial biases in LULC-based SDMs. The DHI may offer a more spatially neutral alternative, making it a promising predictor for modelling species niches at regional scales.

Abstract:
Many critical healthcare decisions are challenged by the inability to measure key underlying parameters. Glaucoma, a leading cause of irreversible blindness driven by elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), provides a stark example. The primary determinant of IOP, a tissue property called trabecular meshwork permeability, cannot be measured in vivo, forcing clinicians to depend on indirect surrogates. This clinical challenge is compounded by a broader computational one: developing predictive models for such ill-posed inverse problems is hindered by a lack of ground-truth data and prohibitive cost of large-scale, high-fidelity simulations. We address both challenges with an end-to-end framework to noninvasively estimate unmeasurable variables from sparse, routine data. Our approach combines a multi-stage artificial intelligence architecture to functionally separate the problem; a novel data generation strategy we term PCDS that obviates the need for hundreds of thousands of costly simulations, reducing the effective computational time from years to hours; and a Bayesian engine to quantify predictive uncertainty. Our framework deconstructs a single IOP measurement into its fundamental components from routine inputs only, yielding estimates for the unmeasurable tissue permeability and a patient's outflow facility. Our noninvasively estimated outflow facility achieved excellent agreement with state-of-the-art tonography with precision comparable to direct physical instruments. Furthermore, the newly derived permeability biomarker demonstrates high accuracy in stratifying clinical cohorts by disease risk, highlighting its diagnostic potential. More broadly, our framework establishes a generalizable blueprint for solving similar inverse problems in other data-scarce, computationally-intensive domains.

Abstract:
UK woodlands, forests, and urban treescapes are under threat from invasive species, exacerbated by climate change, trade, and transport. Invasive tree pests debilitate their host and disrupt forest ecosystems, thus it is imperative to quantitatively model and predict their spread. Addressing this, we model the spread of an invasive pest using a spatiotemporal reaction-diffusion equation, representing the spatial distribution as a population density field. We solve this intractable equation numerically and, from the solution, we determine first arrival times of the pest at locations in the field. The adopted model permits us to obtain the expansion rate of pest spread directly from the model parameters, which we infer in the Bayesian paradigm, using a Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme. We apply our framework to the ongoing spread of oak processionary moth in the UK, an outbreak which continues to grow despite management efforts. We demonstrate that our approach effectively captures the spread of the pest and that this has occurred at a non-constant expansion rate. The proposed framework is a powerful tool for quantitatively modelling the spread of an invasive tree pest and could underpin future prediction and management approaches.

Abstract:
Biological sequence design (DNA, RNA, or peptides) with desired functional properties has applications in discovering novel nanomaterials, biosensors, antimicrobial drugs, and beyond. One common challenge is the ability to optimize complex high-dimensional properties such as target emission spectra of DNA-mediated fluorescent nanoparticles, photo and chemical stability, and antimicrobial activity of peptides across target microbes. Existing models rely on simple binary labels (e.g., binding/non-binding) rather than high-dimensional complex properties. To address this gap, we propose a geometry-preserving variational autoencoder framework, called PrIVAE, which learns latent sequence embeddings that respect the geometry of their property space. Specifically, we model the property space as a high-dimensional manifold that can be locally approximated by a nearest neighbor graph, given an appropriately defined distance measure. We employ the property graph to guide the sequence latent representations using (1) graph neural network encoder layers and (2) an isometric regularizer. PrIVAE learns a property-organized latent space that enables rational design of new sequences with desired properties by employing the trained decoder. We evaluate the utility of our framework for two generative tasks: (1) design of DNA sequences that template fluorescent metal nanoclusters and (2) design of antimicrobial peptides. The trained models retain high reconstruction accuracy while organizing the latent space according to properties. Beyond in silico experiments, we also employ sampled sequences for wet lab design of DNA nanoclusters, resulting in up to 16.1-fold enrichment of rare-property nanoclusters compared to their abundance in training data, demonstrating the practical utility of our framework.

Abstract:
Digital pathology has emerged as a transformative approach to tissue analysis, offering unprecedented opportunities for objective, quantitative assessment of histopathological features. However, the complexity of implementing artificial intelligence (AI) solutions in pathology workflows has limited widespread adoption. Here we present ORCA (Optimized Research and Clinical Analytics), a comprehensive no-code AI platform specifically designed for digital pathology applications. ORCA addresses critical barriers to AI adoption by providing an intuitive interface that enables pathologists and researchers to train, deploy, and validate custom AI models without programming expertise. The platform integrates advanced deep learning architectures with clinical workflow management, supporting applications from tissue classification and cell segmentation to spatial distribution scoring and novel biomarker discovery. We demonstrate ORCA's capabilities through validation studies across multiple cancer types, showing significant improvements in analytical speed, reproducibility, and clinical correlation compared to traditional manual assessment methods. Our results indicate that ORCA successfully democratizes access to state-of-the-art AI tools in pathology, potentially accelerating biomarker discovery and enhancing precision medicine initiatives.

Abstract:
We present a probabilistic framework for modeling structured spatiotemporal dynamics from sparse observations, focusing on cardiac motion. Our approach integrates neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), graph neural networks (GNNs), and neural processes into a unified model that captures uncertainty, temporal continuity, and anatomical structure. We represent dynamic systems as spatiotemporal multiplex graphs and model their latent trajectories using a GNN-parameterized vector field. Given the sparse context observations at node and edge levels, the model infers a distribution over latent initial states and control variables, enabling both interpolation and extrapolation of trajectories. We validate the method on three synthetic dynamical systems (coupled pendulum, Lorenz attractor, and Kuramoto oscillators) and two real-world cardiac imaging datasets - ACDC (N=150) and UK Biobank (N=526) - demonstrating accurate reconstruction, extrapolation, and disease classification capabilities. The model accurately reconstructs trajectories and extrapolates future cardiac cycles from a single observed cycle. It achieves state-of-the-art results on the ACDC classification task (up to 99% accuracy), and detects atrial fibrillation in UK Biobank subjects with competitive performance (up to 67% accuracy). This work introduces a flexible approach for analyzing cardiac motion and offers a foundation for graph-based learning in structured biomedical spatiotemporal time-series data.

Abstract:
Recent advances in spatial omics technologies have revolutionized our ability to study biological systems with unprecedented resolution. By preserving the spatial context of molecular measurements, these methods enable comprehensive mapping of cellular heterogeneity, tissue architecture, and dynamic biological processes in developmental biology, neuroscience, oncology, and evolutionary studies. This review highlights a systematic overview of the continuous advancements in both technology and computational algorithms that are paving the way for a deeper, more systematic comprehension of the structure and mechanisms of mammalian tissues and organs by using spatial multi-omics. Our viewpoint demonstrates how advanced machine learning algorithms and multi-omics integrative modeling can decode complex biological processes, including the spatial organization and topological relationships of cells during organ development, as well as key molecular signatures and regulatory networks underlying tumorigenesis and metastasis. Finally, we outline future directions for technological innovation and modeling insights of spatial omics in precision medicine.

Abstract:
Despite significant medical advancements, cancer remains the second leading cause of death, with over 600,000 deaths per year in the US. One emerging field, pathway analysis, is promising but still relies on manually derived wet lab data, which is time-consuming to acquire. This work proposes an efficient, effective end-to-end framework for Artificial Intelligence (AI) based pathway analysis that predicts both cancer severity and mutation progression, thus recommending possible treatments. The proposed technique involves a novel combination of time-series machine learning models and pathway analysis. First, mutation sequences were isolated from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Database. Then, a novel preprocessing algorithm was used to filter key mutations by mutation frequency. This data was fed into a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that predicted cancer severity. Then, the model probabilistically used the RNN predictions, information from the preprocessing algorithm, and multiple drug-target databases to predict future mutations and recommend possible treatments. This framework achieved robust results and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves (a key statistical metric) with accuracies greater than 60%, similar to existing cancer diagnostics. In addition, preprocessing played an instrumental role in isolating important mutations, demonstrating that each cancer stage studied may contain on the order of a few-hundred key driver mutations, consistent with current research. Heatmaps based on predicted gene frequency were also generated, highlighting key mutations in each cancer. Overall, this work is the first to propose an efficient, cost-effective end-to-end framework for projecting cancer progression and providing possible treatments without relying on expensive, time-consuming wet lab work.

Abstract:
Fontan palliation for univentricular congenital heart disease progresses to hemodynamic failure with complex flow patterns poorly characterized by conventional 2D imaging. Current assessment relies on fluoroscopic angiography, providing limited 3D geometric information essential for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis and surgical planning.   A multi-step AI pipeline was developed utilizing Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash (2.5B parameters) for systematic, iterative processing of fluoroscopic angiograms through transformer-based neural architecture. The pipeline encompasses medical image preprocessing, vascular segmentation, contrast enhancement, artifact removal, and virtual hemodynamic flow visualization within 2D projections. Final views were processed through Tencent's Hunyuan3D-2mini (384M parameters) for stereolithography file generation.   The pipeline successfully generated geometrically optimized 2D projections from single-view angiograms after 16 processing steps using a custom web interface. Initial iterations contained hallucinated vascular features requiring iterative refinement to achieve anatomically faithful representations. Final projections demonstrated accurate preservation of complex Fontan geometry with enhanced contrast suitable for 3D conversion. AI-generated virtual flow visualization identified stagnation zones in central connections and flow patterns in branch arteries. Complete processing required under 15 minutes with second-level API response times.   This approach demonstrates clinical feasibility of generating CFD-suitable geometries from routine angiographic data, enabling 3D generation and rapid virtual flow visualization for cursory insights prior to full CFD simulation. While requiring refinement cycles for accuracy, this establishes foundation for democratizing advanced geometric and hemodynamic analysis using readily available imaging data.

Abstract:
Multimodal data provides heterogeneous information for a holistic understanding of the tumor microenvironment. However, existing AI models often struggle to harness the rich information within multimodal data and extract poorly generalizable representations. Here we present MICE (Multimodal data Integration via Collaborative Experts), a multimodal foundation model that effectively integrates pathology images, clinical reports, and genomics data for precise pan-cancer prognosis prediction. Instead of conventional multi-expert modules, MICE employs multiple functionally diverse experts to comprehensively capture both cross-cancer and cancer-specific insights. Leveraging data from 11,799 patients across 30 cancer types, we enhanced MICE's generalizability by coupling contrastive and supervised learning. MICE outperformed both unimodal and state-of-the-art multi-expert-based multimodal models, demonstrating substantial improvements in C-index ranging from 3.8% to 11.2% on internal cohorts and 5.8% to 8.8% on independent cohorts, respectively. Moreover, it exhibited remarkable data efficiency across diverse clinical scenarios. With its enhanced generalizability and data efficiency, MICE establishes an effective and scalable foundation for pan-cancer prognosis prediction, holding strong potential to personalize tailored therapies and improve treatment outcomes.

Abstract:
The ability of virus shells to encapsulate a wide range of functional cargoes, especially multiple cargoes - siRNAs, enzymes, and chromophores - has made them an essential tool in biotechnology for advancing drug delivery applications and developing innovative new materials. Here we present a mechanistic study of the processes and pathways that lead to multiple cargo encapsulation in the co-assembly of virus shell proteins with ligand-coated nanoparticles. Based on the structural identification of different intermediates, enabled by the contrast in electron microscopy provided by the metal nanoparticles that play the cargo role, we find that multiple cargo encapsulation occurs by self-assembly via a specific ``assembly line'' pathway that is different from previously described \emph{in vitro} assembly mechanisms of virus-like particles (VLP). The emerging model explains observations that are potentially important for delivery applications, for instance, the pronounced nanoparticle size selectivity.

Abstract:
The macroscopic (population-level) dynamics of chemotactic cell movement -- arising from underlying microscopic (individual-based) models -- are often described by parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs) governing the spatio-temporal evolution of cell concentrations. In certain cases, these macroscopic PDEs can be analytically derived from microscopic models, thereby elucidating the dependence of PDE coefficients on the parameters of the underlying individual-based dynamics. However, such analytical derivations are not always feasible, particularly for more complex or nonlinear microscopic models. In these instances, neural networks offer a promising alternative for estimating the coefficients of macroscopic PDEs directly from data generated by microscopic simulations. In this work, three microscopic models of chemotaxis are investigated. The macroscopic chemotaxis sensitivity is estimated using neural networks, thereby bridging the gap between individual-level behaviours and population-level descriptions. The results are compared with macroscopic PDEs, which can be derived for each model in certain parameter regimes.

Abstract:
TRPM4 is overexpressed in prostate cancer (PCa) associated with metastasis or recurrence. There is paucity of information pertaining to TRPM4 characterization and functions at single-cell level in PCa. This study introduces the CEP-IP framework, a novel explainable machine learning approach for the identification of biologically relevant cell subpopulations in single-cell transcriptomics of pairwise genes. The framework combines cell explanatory power (CEP) classification with inflection point (IP) analysis to assign model performance into individual cells, while stratifying transcriptional space into distinct regions. To demonstrate the CEP-IP framework, generalized additive model (GAM) was applied to model relationships between TRPM4 and co-expressed genes in aggressive PCa and benign prostate cells from scRNA-seq data. Genes were identified using Spearman-Kendall dual-filter. Seven ribosomal genes (RPL10, RPL27, RPL28, RPS2, RPS8, RPS12, RPS26; averaged as Ribo gene set) passed dual-filtering specifically in PCa cells. TRPM4-Ribo modeling outperformed alternative cancer gene sets (deviance explained FDR<0.05). The CEP-IP framework identified top-ranked explanatory power (TREP) cells and stratified them using IP analysis into pre-IP and post-IP regions, creating four distinct cell subpopulations per patient. Gene Ontology analysis revealed pre-IP TREP cells enriched for immune-related processes, while post-IP TREP cells enriched for ribosomal, translation, and cell adhesion pathways. In conclusion, the explainable CEP-IP framework allows for the identification of cancer cell subpopulations with distinctive biology and therapeutic implications, applicable to any pairwise gene analysis.

Abstract:
Glioblastoma is the most prevalent primary brain malignancy, distinguished by its highly invasive behavior and exceptionally high rates of recurrence. Conventional radiation therapy, which employs uniform treatment margins, fails to account for patient-specific anatomical and biological factors that critically influence tumor cell migration. To address this limitation, numerous computational models of glioblastoma growth have been developed, enabling generation of tumor cell distribution maps extending beyond radiographically visible regions and thus informing more precise treatment strategies. However, despite encouraging preliminary findings, the clinical adoption of these growth models remains limited. To bridge this translational gap and accelerate both model development and clinical validation, we introduce PREDICT-GBM, a comprehensive integrated pipeline and dataset for modeling and evaluation. This platform enables systematic benchmarking of state-of-the-art tumor growth models using an expert-curated clinical dataset comprising 255 subjects with complete tumor segmentations and tissue characterization maps. Our analysis demonstrates that personalized radiation treatment plans derived from tumor growth predictions achieved superior recurrence coverage compared to conventional uniform margin approaches for two of the evaluated models. This work establishes a robust platform for advancing and systematically evaluating cutting-edge tumor growth modeling approaches, with the ultimate goal of facilitating clinical translation and improving patient outcomes.

Abstract:
Drug repurposing has historically been an economically infeasible process for identifying novel uses for abandoned drugs. Modern machine learning has enabled the identification of complex biochemical intricacies in candidate drugs; however, many studies rely on simplified datasets with known drug-disease similarities. We propose a machine learning pipeline that uses unsupervised deep embedded clustering, combined with supervised graph neural network link prediction to identify new drug-disease links from multi-omic data. Unsupervised autoencoder and cluster training reduced the dimensionality of omic data into a compressed latent embedding. A total of 9,022 unique drugs were partitioned into 35 clusters with a mean silhouette score of 0.8550. Graph neural networks achieved strong statistical performance, with a prediction accuracy of 0.901, receiver operating characteristic area under the curve of 0.960, and F1-Score of 0.901. A ranked list comprised of 477 per-cluster link probabilities exceeding 99 percent was generated. This study could provide new drug-disease link prospects across unrelated disease domains, while advancing the understanding of machine learning in drug repurposing studies.

Abstract:
Bright-field microscopy, a cost-effective solution for live-cell culture, is often the only resource available, along with standard CPUs, for many low-budget labs. The inherent challenges of bright-field images -- their noisiness, low contrast, and dynamic morphology -- coupled with a lack of GPU resources and complex software interfaces, hinder the desired research output. This article presents a novel microscopy image analysis framework designed for low-budget labs equipped with a standard CPU desktop. The Python-based program enables cytometric analysis of live, unstained cells in culture through an advanced computer vision and machine learning pipeline. Crucially, the framework operates on label-free data, requiring no manually annotated training data or training phase. It is accessible via a user-friendly, cross-platform GUI that requires no programming skills, while also providing a scripting interface for programmatic control and integration by developers. The end-to-end workflow performs semantic and instance segmentation, feature extraction, analysis, evaluation, and automated report generation. Its modular architecture supports easy maintenance and flexible integration while supporting both single-image and batch processing. Validated on several unstained cell types from the public dataset of livecells, the framework demonstrates superior accuracy and reproducibility compared to contemporary tools like Cellpose and StarDist. Its competitive segmentation speed on a CPU-based platform highlights its significant potential for basic research and clinical applications -- particularly in cell transplantation for personalised medicine and muscle regeneration therapies. The access to the application is available for reproducibility

Abstract:
Moving animal groups consist of many distinct individuals but can operate and function as one unit when performing different tasks. Effectively evading unexpected predator attacks is one primary task for many moving groups. The current explanation for predator evasion responses in moving animal groups require the individuals in the groups interact via (velocity) alignment. However, experiments have shown that some animals do not use alignment. This suggests that another explanation for the predator evasion capacity in at least these species is needed. Here we establish that effective collective predator evasion does not require alignment, it can be induced via attraction and repulsion alone. We also show that speed differences between individuals that have directly observed the predator and those that have not influence evasion success and the speed of the collective evasion process, but are not required to induce the phenomenon. Our work here adds collective predator evasion to a number of phenomena previously thought to require alignment interactions that have recently been shown to emerge from attraction and repulsion alone. Based on our findings we suggest experiments and make predictions that may lead to a deeper understanding of not only collective predator evasion, but also collective motion in general.

Abstract:
Complex patterns emerge across a wide range of biological systems. While such patterns often exhibit remarkable robustness, variation and irregularity exist at multiple scales and can carry important information about the underlying agent interactions driving collective dynamics. Many methods for quantifying biological patterns focus on large-scale, characteristic features (such as stripe width or spot number), but questions remain on how to characterize messy patterns. In the case of cellular patterns that emerge during development or regeneration, understanding where patterns are most susceptible to variability may help shed light on cell behavior and the tissue environment. Motivated by these challenges, we introduce methods based on topological data analysis to classify and quantify messy patterns arising from agent-based interactions, by extracting meaningful biological interpretations from persistence barcode summaries. To compute persistent homology, our methods rely on a sweeping-plane filtration which, in comparison to the Vietoris--Rips filtration, is more rarely applied to biological systems. We demonstrate how results from the sweeping-plane filtration can be interpreted to quantify stripe patterns (with and without interruptions) by analyzing in silico zebrafish skin patterns, and we generate new quantitative predictions about which pattern features may be most robust or variable. Our work provides an automated framework for quantifying features and irregularities in spot and stripe patterns and highlights how different approaches to persistent homology can provide complementary insight into biological systems.

Abstract:
Three-dimensional X-ray histology techniques offer a non-invasive alternative to conventional 2D histology, enabling volumetric imaging of biological tissues without the need for physical sectioning or chemical staining. However, the inherent greyscale image contrast of X-ray tomography limits its biochemical specificity compared to traditional histological stains. Within digital pathology, deep learning-based virtual staining has demonstrated utility in simulating stained appearances from label-free optical images. In this study, we extend virtual staining to the X-ray domain by applying cross-modality image translation to generate artificially stained slices from synchrotron-radiation-based micro-CT scans. Using over 50 co-registered image pairs of micro-CT and toluidine blue-stained histology from bone-implant samples, we trained a modified CycleGAN network tailored for limited paired data. Whole slide histology images were downsampled to match the voxel size of the CT data, with on-the-fly data augmentation for patch-based training. The model incorporates pixelwise supervision and greyscale consistency terms, producing histologically realistic colour outputs while preserving high-resolution structural detail. Our method outperformed Pix2Pix and standard CycleGAN baselines across SSIM, PSNR, and LPIPS metrics. Once trained, the model can be applied to full CT volumes to generate virtually stained 3D datasets, enhancing interpretability without additional sample preparation. While features such as new bone formation were able to be reproduced, some variability in the depiction of implant degradation layers highlights the need for further training data and refinement. This work introduces virtual staining to 3D X-ray imaging and offers a scalable route for chemically informative, label-free tissue characterisation in biomedical research.

Abstract:
Large-scale single-cell and Perturb-seq investigations routinely involve clustering cells and subsequently annotating each cluster with Gene-Ontology (GO) terms to elucidate the underlying biological programs. However, both stages, resolution selection and functional annotation, are inherently subjective, relying on heuristics and expert curation. We present HYPOGENEAGENT, a large language model (LLM)-driven framework, transforming cluster annotation into a quantitatively optimizable task. Initially, an LLM functioning as a gene-set analyst analyzes the content of each gene program or perturbation module and generates a ranked list of GO-based hypotheses, accompanied by calibrated confidence scores. Subsequently, we embed every predicted description with a sentence-embedding model, compute pair-wise cosine similarities, and let the agent referee panel score (i) the internal consistency of the predictions, high average similarity within the same cluster, termed intra-cluster agreement (ii) their external distinctiveness, low similarity between clusters, termed inter-cluster separation. These two quantities are combined to produce an agent-derived resolution score, which is maximized when clusters exhibit simultaneous coherence and mutual exclusivity. When applied to a public K562 CRISPRi Perturb-seq dataset as a preliminary test, our Resolution Score selects clustering granularities that exhibit alignment with known pathway compared to classical metrics such silhouette score, modularity score for gene functional enrichment summary. These findings establish LLM agents as objective adjudicators of cluster resolution and functional annotation, thereby paving the way for fully automated, context-aware interpretation pipelines in single-cell multi-omics studies.

Abstract:
Background: Investigational New Drug (IND) application preparation is time-intensive and expertise-dependent, slowing early clinical development. Objective: To evaluate whether a large language model (LLM) platform (AutoIND) can reduce first-draft composition time while maintaining document quality in regulatory submissions. Methods: Drafting times for IND nonclinical written summaries (eCTD modules 2.6.2, 2.6.4, 2.6.6) generated by AutoIND were directly recorded. For comparison, manual drafting times for IND summaries previously cleared by the U.S. FDA were estimated from the experience of regulatory writers ($\geq$6 years) and used as industry-standard benchmarks. Quality was assessed by a blinded regulatory writing assessor using seven pre-specified categories: correctness, completeness, conciseness, consistency, clarity, redundancy, and emphasis. Each sub-criterion was scored 0-3 and normalized to a percentage. A critical regulatory error was defined as any misrepresentation or omission likely to alter regulatory interpretation (e.g., incorrect NOAEL, omission of mandatory GLP dose-formulation analysis). Results: AutoIND reduced initial drafting time by $\sim$97% (from $\sim$100 h to 3.7 h for 18,870 pages/61 reports in IND-1; and to 2.6 h for 11,425 pages/58 reports in IND-2). Quality scores were 69.6\% and 77.9\% for IND-1 and IND-2. No critical regulatory errors were detected, but deficiencies in emphasis, conciseness, and clarity were noted. Conclusions: AutoIND can dramatically accelerate IND drafting, but expert regulatory writers remain essential to mature outputs to submission-ready quality. Systematic deficiencies identified provide a roadmap for targeted model improvements.

Abstract:
Timely and robust influenza incidence forecasting is critical for public health decision-making. This paper presents MAESTRO (Multi-modal Adaptive Estimation for Temporal Respiratory Disease Outbreak), a novel, unified framework that synergistically integrates advanced spectro-temporal modeling with multi-modal data fusion, including surveillance, web search trends, and meteorological data. By adaptively weighting heterogeneous data sources and decomposing complex time series patterns, the model achieves robust and accurate forecasts. Evaluated on over 11 years of Hong Kong influenza data (excluding the COVID-19 period), MAESTRO demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, achieving a superior model fit with an R-square of 0.956. Extensive ablations confirm the significant contributions of its multi-modal and spectro-temporal components. The modular and reproducible pipeline is made publicly available to facilitate deployment and extension to other regions and pathogens, presenting a powerful tool for epidemiological forecasting.

Abstract:
Background: Parkinson's disease remains a major neurodegenerative disorder with high misdiagnosis rates, primarily due to reliance on clinical rating scales. Recent studies have demonstrated a strong association between gut microbiota and Parkinson's disease, suggesting that microbial composition may serve as a promising biomarker. Although deep learning models based ongut microbiota show potential for early prediction, most approaches rely on single classifiers and often overlook inter-strain correlations or temporal dynamics. Therefore, there is an urgent need for more robust feature extraction methods tailored to microbiome data. Methods: We proposed BDPM (A Machine Learning-Based Feature Extractor for Parkinson's Disease Classification via Gut Microbiota Analysis). First, we collected gut microbiota profiles from 39 Parkinson's patients and their healthy spouses to identify differentially abundant taxa. Second, we developed an innovative feature selection framework named RFRE (Random Forest combined with Recursive Feature Elimination), integrating ecological knowledge to enhance biological interpretability. Finally, we designed a hybrid classification model to capture temporal and spatial patterns in microbiome data.

Abstract:
Quantitative proteomics plays a central role in uncovering regulatory mechanisms, identifying disease biomarkers, and guiding the development of precision therapies. These insights are often obtained through complex Bayesian models, whose inference procedures are computationally intensive, especially when applied at scale to biological datasets. This limits the accessibility of advanced modelling techniques needed to fully exploit proteomics data. Although Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods offer a parallelisable alternative to traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo, their high-performance implementations often rely on specialised hardware, increasing both financial and energy costs. We address these challenges by introducing an opportunistic computing framework for SMC samplers, tailored to the demands of large-scale proteomics inference. Our approach leverages idle compute resources at the University of Liverpool via HTCondor, enabling scalable Bayesian inference without dedicated high-performance computing infrastructure. Central to this framework is a novel Coordinator-Manager-Follower architecture that reduces synchronisation overhead and supports robust operation in heterogeneous, unreliable environments. We evaluate the framework on a realistic proteomics model and show that opportunistic SMC delivers accurate inference with weak scaling, increasing samples generated under a fixed time budget as more resources join. To support adoption, we release CondorSMC, an open-source package for deploying SMC samplers in opportunistic computing environments.

Abstract:
Patients with rare types of melanoma such as acral, mucosal, or uveal melanoma, have lower survival rates than patients with cutaneous melanoma; these lower survival rates reflect the lower objective response rates to immunotherapy compared to cutaneous melanoma. Understanding tumor-immune dynamics in rare melanomas is critical for the development of new therapies and for improving response rates to current cancer therapies. Progress has been hindered by the lack of clinical data and the need for better preclinical models of rare melanomas. Canine melanoma provides a valuable comparative oncology model for rare types of human melanomas. We analyzed RNA sequencing data from canine melanoma patients and combined this with literature information to create a novel mechanistic mathematical model of melanoma-immune dynamics. Sensitivity analysis of the mathematical model indicated influential pathways in the dynamics, providing support for potential new therapeutic targets and future combinations of therapies. We share our learnings from this work, to help enable the application of this proof-of-concept workflow to other rare disease settings with sparse available data.

Abstract:
In pharmaceutical R&D, predicting the efficacy of a pharmaceutical in treating a particular disease prior to clinical testing or any real-world use has been challenging. In this paper, we propose a flexible and modular machine learning-based approach for predicting the efficacy of an untested pharmaceutical for treating a disease. We train a machine learning model using sets of pharmaceutical-pathway weight impact scores and patient data, which can include patient characteristics and observed clinical outcomes. The resulting model then analyses weighted impact scores of an untested pharmaceutical across human biological molecule-protein pathways to generate a predicted efficacy value. We demonstrate how the method works on a real-world dataset with patient treatments and outcomes, with two different weight impact score algorithms We include methods for evaluating the generalisation performance on unseen treatments, and to characterise conditions under which the approach can be expected to be most predictive. We discuss specific ways in which our approach can be iterated on, making it an initial framework to support future work on predicting the effect of untested drugs, leveraging RWD clinical data and drug embeddings.

Abstract:
Motile nanosized particles, or "nanobots", promise more effective and less toxic targeted drug delivery because of their unique scale and precision. We consider the case in which the cancer is "diffuse", dispersed such that there are multiple distinct cancer sites. We investigate the problem of a swarm of nanobots locating these sites and treating them by dropping drug payloads at the sites. To improve the success of the treatment, the drug payloads must be allocated between sites according to their "demands"; this requires extra nanobot coordination. We present a mathematical model of the behavior of the nanobot agents and of their colloidal environment. This includes a movement model for agents based upon experimental findings from actual nanoparticles in which bots noisily ascend and descend chemical gradients. We present three algorithms: The first algorithm, called KM, is the most representative of reality, with agents simply following naturally existing chemical signals that surround each cancer site. The second algorithm, KMA, includes an additional chemical payload which amplifies the existing natural signals. The third algorithm, KMAR, includes another additional chemical payload which counteracts the other signals, instead inducing negative chemotaxis in agents such that they are repelled from sites that are already sufficiently treated. We present simulation results for all algorithms across different types of cancer arrangements. For KM, we show that the treatment is generally successful unless the natural chemical signals are weak, in which case the treatment progresses too slowly. For KMA, we demonstrate a significant improvement in treatment speed but a drop in eventual success, except for concentrated cancer patterns. For KMAR, our results show great performance across all types of cancer patterns, demonstrating robustness and adaptability.

Abstract:
Sequence matching algorithms such as BLAST and FASTA have been widely used in searching for evolutionary origin and biological functions of newly discovered nucleic acid and protein sequences. As parts of these search tools, alignment scores and E values are useful indicators of the quality of search results from querying a database of annotated sequences, whereby a high alignment score (and inversely a low E value) reflects significant similarity between the query and the subject (target) sequences. For cross-comparison of results from sufficiently different queries however, the interpretation of alignment score as a similarity measure and E value a dissimilarity measure becomes somewhat nuanced, and prompts herein a judicious distinction of different types of similarity. We show that an adjustment of E value to account for self-matching of query and subject sequences corrects for certain ostensibly anomalous similarity comparisons, resulting in canonical dissimilarity and similarity measures that would be more appropriate for database applications, such as all-on-all sequence alignment or selection of diverse subsets. In actual practice, the canonicalization of E value dissimilarity improves clustering and the diversity of subset selection. While both E value and the canonical E value share positivity and symmetry, two of the four axiomatic properties of a metric space, the canonical E value is also reflexive and meets the condition of triangle inequality, thus itself an appropriate distance function for a metric space of protein sequences.

Abstract:
Dynamical systems theory describes how interacting quantities change over time and space, from molecular oscillators to large-scale biological patterns. Such systems often involve nonlinear feedbacks, delays, and interactions across scales. Classical modeling derives explicit governing equations, often systems of differential equations, by combining mechanistic assumptions, experimental observations, and known physical laws. The growing complexity of biological processes has, however, motivated complementary data-driven methods that aim to infer model structure directly from measurements, often without specifying equations a priori. In this review, we survey approaches for model discovery in biological dynamical systems, focusing on three methodological families: regression-based methods, network-based architectures, and decomposition techniques. We compare their ability to address three core goals: forecasting future states, identifying interactions, and characterizing system states. Representative methods are applied to a common benchmark, the Oregonator model, a minimal nonlinear oscillator that captures shared design principles of chemical and biological systems. By highlighting strengths, limitations, and interpretability, we aim to guide researchers in selecting tools for analyzing complex, nonlinear, and high-dimensional dynamics in the life sciences.

Abstract:
The cycle of scientific discovery is frequently bottlenecked by the slow, manual creation of software to support computational experiments. To address this, we present an AI system that creates expert-level scientific software whose goal is to maximize a quality metric. The system uses a Large Language Model (LLM) and Tree Search (TS) to systematically improve the quality metric and intelligently navigate the large space of possible solutions. The system achieves expert-level results when it explores and integrates complex research ideas from external sources. The effectiveness of tree search is demonstrated across a wide range of benchmarks. In bioinformatics, it discovered 40 novel methods for single-cell data analysis that outperformed the top human-developed methods on a public leaderboard. In epidemiology, it generated 14 models that outperformed the CDC ensemble and all other individual models for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations. Our method also produced state-of-the-art software for geospatial analysis, neural activity prediction in zebrafish, time series forecasting and numerical solution of integrals. By devising and implementing novel solutions to diverse tasks, the system represents a significant step towards accelerating scientific progress.

Abstract:
The precise characterization of plant morphology provides valuable insights into plant environment interactions and genetic evolution. A key technology for extracting this information is 3D segmentation, which delineates individual plant organs from complex point clouds. Despite significant progress in general 3D computer vision domains, the adoption of 3D segmentation for plant phenotyping remains limited by three major challenges: i) the scarcity of large-scale annotated datasets, ii) technical difficulties in adapting advanced deep neural networks to plant point clouds, and iii) the lack of standardized benchmarks and evaluation protocols tailored to plant science. This review systematically addresses these barriers by: i) providing an overview of existing 3D plant datasets in the context of general 3D segmentation domains, ii) systematically summarizing deep learning-based methods for point cloud semantic and instance segmentation, iii) introducing Plant Segmentation Studio (PSS), an open-source framework for reproducible benchmarking, and iv) conducting extensive quantitative experiments to evaluate representative networks and sim-to-real learning strategies. Our findings highlight the efficacy of sparse convolutional backbones and transformer-based instance segmentation, while also emphasizing the complementary role of modeling-based and augmentation-based synthetic data generation for sim-to-real learning in reducing annotation demands. In general, this study bridges the gap between algorithmic advances and practical deployment, providing immediate tools for researchers and a roadmap for developing data-efficient and generalizable deep learning solutions in 3D plant phenotyping.

Abstract:
The majority of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) on the market are produced using Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells cultured at scale in chemically defined cell culture medium. Because of the high costs associated with mammalian cell cultures, obtaining high cell densities to produce high product titers is desired. These bioprocesses require high concentrations of nutrients in the basal media and periodically adding concentrated feed media to sustain cell growth and therapeutic protein productivity. Unfortunately, the desired or optimal nutrient concentrations of the feed media are often solubility limited due to precipitation of chemical complexes that form in the solution. Experimentally screening the various cell culture media configurations which contain 50 to 100 compounds can be expensive and laborious. This article lays the foundation for utilizing computational tools to understand precipitation of nutrients in cell culture media by studying the pairwise interactions between amino acids in thermodynamic models. Activity coefficient data for one amino acid in water and amino acid solubility data of two amino acids in water have been used to determine a single set of UNIFAC group interaction parameters to predict the thermodynamic behavior of the multi-component systems found in mammalian cell culture media. The data collected in this study is, to our knowledge, the largest set of ternary system amino acid solubility data reported to date. These amino acid precipitation predictions have been verified with experimentally measured ternary and quaternary amino acid solutions. Thus, we demonstrate the utility of our model as a digital twin to identify optimal cell culture media compositions by replacing empirical approaches for nutrient precipitation with computational predictions based on thermodynamics of individual media components in complex mixtures.

Abstract:
We present bfact, a Python package for performing accurate low-rank Boolean matrix factorisation (BMF). bfact uses a hybrid combinatorial optimisation approach based on a priori candidate factors generated from clustering algorithms. It selects the best disjoint factors before performing either a second combinatorial or heuristic algorithm to recover the BMF. We show that bfact does particularly well at estimating the true rank of matrices in simulated settings. In real benchmarks, using a collation of single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets from the Human Lung Cell Atlas, we show that bfact achieves strong signal recovery, with a much lower rank.

Abstract:
Accurate epidemic forecasting is critical for effective public health interventions. This study compares Bayesian and Frequentist estimation frameworks within deterministic compartmental epidemic models, focusing on nonlinear least squares optimization versus Bayesian inference using MCMC sampling via Stan. We compare forecasting performance under shared modeling structure and error assumptions for specific implementations of both approaches.   We assess performance on simulated datasets (with R0 values of 2 and 1.5) and historical datasets including the 1918 influenza pandemic, 1896-97 Bombay plague, and COVID-19 pandemic. Evaluation metrics include Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Squared Error, Weighted Interval Score, and 95% prediction interval coverage.   Forecasting performance depends on epidemic phase and dataset characteristics, with no method consistently outperforming across all contexts. Frequentist methods perform well at peak and post-peak phases but are less accurate pre-peak. Bayesian methods, particularly with uniform priors, offer better early-epidemic accuracy and stronger uncertainty quantification, especially valuable when data are sparse or noisy. Frequentist methods often yield more accurate point forecasts with lower error metrics, though their interval estimates may be less robust.   We examine how prior choice influences Bayesian forecasts and how extending forecasting horizons affects convergence. These findings offer practical guidance for choosing estimation strategies tailored to epidemic phase and data quality, supporting more effective public health interventions.

Abstract:
Biomolecular Neural Networks (BNNs), artificial neural networks with biologically synthesizable architectures, achieve universal function approximation capabilities beyond simple biological circuits. However, training BNNs remains challenging due to the lack of target data. To address this, we propose leveraging Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specifications to define training objectives for BNNs. We build on the quantitative semantics of STL, enabling gradient-based optimization of the BNN weights, and introduce a learning algorithm that enables BNNs to perform regression and control tasks in biological systems. Specifically, we investigate two regression problems in which we train BNNs to act as reporters of dysregulated states, and a feedback control problem in which we train the BNN in closed-loop with a chronic disease model, learning to reduce inflammation while avoiding adverse responses to external infections. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that STL-based learning can solve the investigated regression and control tasks efficiently.

Abstract:
The advent of advanced crystallographic techniques has shifted structural biology from static, single-conformer models toward probing protein dynamics. Extracting cooperative motions from temporally and spatially averaged electron density maps requires both high-resolution data and refinement algorithms capable of handling conformational heterogeneity. However, current refinement protocols often fail due to the tangling phenomenon, in which conformational states become improperly intertwined during optimization. Here, we present an automated refinement methodology based on iterative projections within the divide-and-concur framework. This approach enables seamless integration of geometric constraints with experimental density constraints derived from observed scattering amplitudes. By allowing each atom to satisfy density constraints independently, we show that this framework effectively circumvents tangling artifacts and achieves robust refinement performance, even for models initialized with R-factors as high as 12%. Just as iterative projections revolutionized phase retrieval in crystallography, we demonstrate that they can also address the optimization challenges in multi-conformational refinement. This work establishes a computational foundation for advancing crystallographic methodologies to resolve conformational heterogeneity and ultimately capture protein dynamics at atomic resolution.

Abstract:
Background: Many advanced cancer patients experience progression under immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) size profiles offer a promising noninvasive multi-cancer approach to monitor and predict immunotherapy response. Methods: In the SChISM (Size CfDNA Immunotherapy Signature Monitoring) study (NCT05083494), pre-treatment plasmatic cfDNA size profiles from 126 ICI-treated advanced carcinomas were quantified using the BIABooster device. Fragmentomederived variables (concentration, peaks' position, and fragment size ranges) at baseline were analyzed for associations with early progression (EP, progression at first imaging) and progression-free survival (PFS), using logistic and Cox regression models. Bootstrap analysis validated robustness. Additional analyses were performed in homogeneous subpopulations: first-line lung cancer patients (n = 60) and head-andneck patients treated with Nivolumab (n = 25). Results: Higher cfDNA concentration and high quantities of short fragments (111-240 base pairs (bp)) were associated with poor response, unlike long fragments (> 300 bp). The proportion of fragments longer than 1650 bp demonstrated highest discriminatory power (AUC = 0.73, C-index = 0.69). It was significantly associated with non-EP (odds ratio = 0.39 [95% CI: 0.25-0.62]) and longer PFS (hazard ratio: 0.54 [95% CI: 0.42-0.68]). These associations remained significant when adjusted for confounders (age, sex, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, tumor type, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio) and across both subpopulations. Bootstrap analysis confirmed robustness with mean accuracy of 70.1 $\pm$ 4.17% and positive predictive value of 55.6 $\pm$ 7.37%, in test sets. Conclusion: cfDNA size profiles significantly predicted ICI response and anticipate relapse, outperforming the routinely used marker programmed death-ligand 1 immunohistochemistry and reflecting enhanced immune system activation.  Trial registration: (NCT05083494), date of registration: 2021-10-19.

Abstract:
High-throughput 3D quantitative phase imaging (QPI) in flow cytometry enables label-free, volumetric characterization of individual cells by reconstructing their refractive index (RI) distributions from multiple viewing angles during flow through microfluidic channels. However, current imaging methods assume that cells undergo uniform, single-axis rotation, which require their poses to be known at each frame. This assumption restricts applicability to near-spherical cells and prevents accurate imaging of irregularly shaped cells with complex rotations. As a result, only a subset of the cellular population can be analyzed, limiting the ability of flow-based assays to perform robust statistical analysis. We introduce OmniFHT, a pose-free 3D RI reconstruction framework that leverages the Fourier diffraction theorem and implicit neural representations (INRs) for high-throughput flow cytometry tomographic imaging. By jointly optimizing each cell's unknown rotational trajectory and volumetric structure under weak scattering assumptions, OmniFHT supports arbitrary cell geometries and multi-axis rotations. Its continuous representation also allows accurate reconstruction from sparsely sampled projections and restricted angular coverage, producing high-fidelity results with as few as 10 views or only 120 degrees of angular range. OmniFHT enables, for the first time, in situ, high-throughput tomographic imaging of entire flowing cell populations, providing a scalable and unbiased solution for label-free morphometric analysis in flow cytometry platforms.

Abstract:
It is difficult or infeasible to directly measure how much of a drug actually enters the human brain and a brain tumor, how long it remains there, and to estimate drug-specific or patient-specific parameters, as well as how changes in these parameters influence model outputs and pharmacokinetic characteristics. Compartmental modeling offers a powerful mathematical approach to describe drug distribution and elimination in the body using systems of differential equations. This study introduces TumorPred, an R/Shiny-based web application designed for model simulation, sensitivity analysis, and pharmacokinetic parameter calculation in a permeability-limited four-compartment brain model. The model closely mimics human brain functionality for drug delivery and aims to predict the pharmacokinetics of drugs in the brain blood, brain mass, and cranial and spinal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of the human brain. The app provides real-time output updates in response to input modifications and allows users to visualize and download simulated plots and data tables. The computational accuracy of TumorPred is validated against results from the Simcyp Simulator (Certara Inc.). TumorPred is freely accessible and serves as an invaluable computational tool and data-driven resource for advancing drug development and optimizing treatment strategies for more effective brain cancer therapy.

Abstract:
The ubiquitous regression to the mean (RTM) effect complicates statistical inference in biological studies of change. We demonstrate that common RTM correction methods are flawed: the Berry et al. method popularized by Kelly & Price in The American Naturalist is unreliable for hypothesis testing, leading to both false positives and negatives, while the theoretically unbiased Blomqvist method has poor efficiency in limited sample sizes. Our findings show that the most robust approach to handling RTM is not to correct the data but to use the crude slope in conjunction with an assessment of the experiment's repeatability. Ultimately, we argue that any conclusion about a differential treatment effect is statistically unfounded without a clear understanding of the experiment's repeatability.

Abstract:
Biologists and physicists have a rich tradition of modeling living systems with simple models composed of a few interacting components. Despite the remarkable success of this approach, it remains unclear how to use such finely tuned models to study complex biological systems composed of numerous heterogeneous, interacting components. One possible strategy for taming this biological complexity is to embrace the idea that many biological behaviors we observe are ``typical'' and can be modeled using random systems that respect biologically-motivated constraints. Here, we review recent works showing how this approach can be used to make close connection with experiments in biological systems ranging from neuroscience to ecology and evolution and beyond. Collectively, these works suggest that the ``random-with-constraints'' paradigm represents a promising new modeling strategy for capturing experimentally observed dynamical and statistical features in high-dimensional biological data and provides a powerful minimal modeling philosophy for biology.

Abstract:
Topological data analysis (TDA) detects geometric structure in biological data. However, many TDA algorithms are memory intensive and impractical for massive datasets. Here, we introduce a statistical protocol that reduces TDA's memory requirements and gives access to scientists with modest computing resources. We validate this protocol against two empirical datasets, showing that it replicates previous findings with much lower memory requirements. Finally, we demonstrate the power of the protocol by mapping the topology of functional correlations for the human cortex at high spatial resolution, something that was previously infeasible without this novel approach.

Abstract:
Proteins play crucial roles in almost all biological processes. The advancement of deep learning has greatly accelerated the development of protein foundation models, leading to significant successes in protein understanding and design. However, the lack of systematic red-teaming for these models has raised serious concerns about their potential misuse, such as generating proteins with biological safety risks. This paper introduces SafeProtein, the first red-teaming framework designed for protein foundation models to the best of our knowledge. SafeProtein combines multimodal prompt engineering and heuristic beam search to systematically design red-teaming methods and conduct tests on protein foundation models. We also curated SafeProtein-Bench, which includes a manually constructed red-teaming benchmark dataset and a comprehensive evaluation protocol. SafeProtein achieved continuous jailbreaks on state-of-the-art protein foundation models (up to 70% attack success rate for ESM3), revealing potential biological safety risks in current protein foundation models and providing insights for the development of robust security protection technologies for frontier models. The codes will be made publicly available at https://github.com/jigang-fan/SafeProtein.

Abstract:
Accurate identification of interactions between protein residues and ligand functional groups is essential to understand molecular recognition and guide rational drug design. Existing deep learning approaches for protein-ligand interpretability often rely on 3D structural input or use distance-based contact labels, limiting both their applicability and biological relevance. We introduce LINKER, the first sequence-based model to predict residue-functional group interactions in terms of biologically defined interaction types, using only protein sequences and the ligand SMILES as input. LINKER is trained with structure-supervised attention, where interaction labels are derived from 3D protein-ligand complexes via functional group-based motif extraction. By abstracting ligand structures into functional groups, the model focuses on chemically meaningful substructures while predicting interaction types rather than mere spatial proximity. Crucially, LINKER requires only sequence-level input at inference time, enabling large-scale application in settings where structural data is unavailable. Experiments on the LP-PDBBind benchmark demonstrate that structure-informed supervision over functional group abstractions yields interaction predictions closely aligned with ground-truth biochemical annotations.
