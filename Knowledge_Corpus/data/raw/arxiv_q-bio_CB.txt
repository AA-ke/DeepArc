Abstract:
Tracking cells in time-lapse videos is an essential technique for monitoring cell population dynamics at a single-cell level. Current methods for cell tracking are developed on videos with mostly single, constant signals and do not detect pivotal events such as cell death. Here, we present TransientTrack, a deep learning-based framework for cell tracking in multi-channel microscopy video data with transient fluorescent signals that fluctuate over time following processes such as the circadian rhythm of cells. By identifying key cellular events - mitosis (cell division) and apoptosis (cell death) our method allows us to build complete trajectories, including cell lineage information. TransientTrack is lightweight and performs matching on cell detection embeddings directly, without the need for quantification of tracking-specific cell features. Furthermore, our approach integrates Transformer Networks, multi-stage matching using all detection boxes, and the interpolation of missing tracklets with the Kalman Filter. This unified framework achieves strong performance across diverse conditions, effectively tracking cells and capturing cell division and death. We demonstrate the use of TransientTrack in an analysis of the efficacy of a chemotherapeutic drug at a single-cell level. The proposed framework could further advance quantitative studies of cancer cell dynamics, enabling detailed characterization of treatment response and resistance mechanisms. The code is available at https://github.com/bozeklab/TransientTrack.

Abstract:
Red blood cells (RBCs) sustain mechanical stresses associated with microcirculatory flow through ATP-driven plasma membrane flickering. This is an active phenomenon driven by motor proteins that regulate interactions between the spectrin cytoskeleton and the lipid bilayer; it is manifested in RBC shape fluctuations reflecting the cell's mechanical and metabolic state. Yet, direct quantification of the forces and energetic costs underlying this non-equilibrium behavior remains challenging due to the invasiveness of existing techniques. Here, a minimally invasive method that combines bead-free, low-power optical tweezers with high-speed video microscopy was employed to track local membrane forces and displacements in single RBCs during the same time window. This independent dual-channel measurement enabled the construction of a mechano-dynamic phase space for RBCs under different chemical treatments, that allowed for differentiating between metabolic and structural states based on their fluctuation-force signatures. Quantification of mechanical work during flickering demonstrated that membrane softening enhanced fluctuations while elevating energy dissipation. The proposed optical tweezers methodology provides a robust framework for mapping the active mechanics of living cells, enabling precise probing of cellular physiology and detection of biomechanical dysfunction in diseases.

Abstract:
Virtual cell modeling aims to predict cellular responses to perturbations. Existing virtual cell models rely heavily on large-scale single-cell datasets, learning explicit mappings between gene expression and perturbations. Although recent models attempt to incorporate multi-source biological information, their generalization remains constrained by data quality, coverage, and batch effects. More critically, these models often function as black boxes, offering predictions without interpretability or consistency with biological principles, which undermines their credibility in scientific research. To address these challenges, we present VCWorld, a cell-level white-box simulator that integrates structured biological knowledge with the iterative reasoning capabilities of large language models to instantiate a biological world model. VCWorld operates in a data-efficient manner to reproduce perturbation-induced signaling cascades and generates interpretable, stepwise predictions alongside explicit mechanistic hypotheses. In drug perturbation benchmarks, VCWorld achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance, and the inferred mechanistic pathways are consistent with publicly available biological evidence.

Abstract:
Autocatalysis is an important feature of metabolic networks, contributing crucially to the self-maintenance of organisms. Autocatalytic subsystems of chemical reaction networks (CRNs) are characterized in terms of algebraic conditions on submatrices of the stoichiometric matrix. Here, we derive sufficient conditions for subgraphs supporting irreducible autocatalytic systems in the bipartite König representation of the CRN. On this basis, we develop an efficient algorithm to enumerate autocatalytic subnetworks and, as a special case, autocatalytic cores, i.e., minimal autocatalytic subnetworks, in full-size metabolic networks. The same algorithmic approach can also be used to determine autocatalytic cores only. As a showcase application, we provide a complete analysis of autocatalysis in the core metabolism of E. coli and enumerate irreducible autocatalytic subsystems of limited size in full-fledged metabolic networks of E. coli, human erythrocytes, and Methanosarcina barkeri (Archea). The mathematical and algorithmic results are accompanied by software enabling the routine analysis of autocatalysis in large CRNs.

Abstract:
T cells are central to the adaptive immune response, capable of detecting pathogenic antigens while ignoring healthy tissues with remarkable specificity and sensitivity. Quantitatively understanding how T cell receptors (TCRs) discriminate among antigens requires biophysical models and theoretical analysis of signaling networks. Here, we review current theoretical frameworks of antigen recognition in the context of modern experimental and computational advances. Antigen potency spans a continuum and exhibits nonlinear effects within complex mixtures, challenging discrete classification and simple threshold-based models. This complexity motivates the development of models such as adaptive kinetic proofreading, which integrate both activating and inhibitory signals. Advances in high-throughput technologies now generate large-scale, quantitative datasets, enabling the refinement of such models through statistical and machine learning approaches. This convergence of theory, data, and computation promises deeper insights into immune decision-making and opens new avenues for rational immunotherapy design.

Title: Survival and invasion dynamics in cell populations: an analytical framework for threshold behaviour in nonlinear age-structured models

Abstract:
Cell populations invade through a combination of proliferation and motility. Proliferation depends on the internal timing of cell division: how long cells take to complete the cell cycle. This timing varies substantially within (and across) cell types, creating age structure where cells at different times since their last division have different propensities to divide. Classical mathematical models of cell spreading treat division as memoryless and predict exponential cell-cycle-time distributions. Lineage tracing, by contrast, reveals peaked, gamma-like distributions that indicate a maturation delay leading to a fertility window. This gap motivates a modelling framework that incorporates age-dependent cell division rates while retaining analytical tractability.   We address this through a moment-hierarchy framework that tracks time since cell division, with age resetting to zero at division. The framework yields explicit formulae for steady-state age distributions, cell-cycle-time distributions, and invasion speeds. For age-independent rates, we recover classical Fisher--KPP. Three fundamental principles emerge. First, age structure systematically reduces a population's carrying capacity and narrows the viable parameter range for positive steady states. Second, classical linear theory overestimates invasion speeds; the true minimal speed is slower when division is age-dependent. Third, the parameter condition for population survival is identical to the condition for a positive invasion speed.

Abstract:
Cellular Agent-Based Models are commonly employed to describe a variety biological systems. Over the course of the past years, many modeling tools have emerged which solve particular research questions. In this short opinion piece, we argue that existing frameworks lack flexibility compared to the inherent underlying complexity that they should be able to represent. We extract overarching principles of widely used software solutions across multiple domains and compare these with existing Agent-Based Models (ABMs). We come to the conclusion that existing ABMs lack in flexibility which hinders overall progress of the field.

Abstract:
Bantele and colleagues recently reported that repair of a single CRISPR/Cas9-induced DNA double-strand break (DSB) in the c-MYC topologically associated domain leads to a persistent depletion of chromatin interactions and long-term transcriptional attenuation across multiple generations of human cells. They interpret this observation as evidence for a previously unrecognized principle--"chromatin fatigue"--in which DSB repair generates a stable architectural defect that acts as a heritable impairment to genome function. Such an idea, if correct, would carry profound implications for genome biology, epigenetic inheritance, cancer evolution, aging, and the safety of therapeutic genome editing. However, our detailed reassessment of the experimental design, underlying assumptions, and data interpretation reveals that the evidence provided is inadequate to support these sweeping conclusions. Instead, the observed outcomes are more plausibly explained by a combination of Cas9 persistence, off-target DNA damage, repair-factor retention, MYC enhancer plasticity, and the well-documented genomic instability of HeLa cells. The study does not demonstrate mechanistic causality, does not exclude simpler explanations, and does not provide data consistent with true chromatin memory or heritable architectural change. Moreover, its statistical inferences are based on noisy measurements that fall within expected variability of unstable oncogenic loci. Here, we present a comprehensive critical analysis showing that the proposed model of chromatin fatigue is unsupported by the available evidence. We offer a corrected interpretation in which the chromatin landscape experiences a temporary, repair-associated perturbation that resolves without leaving enduring or heritable impairment.

Abstract:
Dabas et al. in Science 2025 report that approximately 117 human kinases directly phosphorylate the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (Pol II), proposing an extensive, direct biochemical bridge between signal transduction and transcriptional control. Such a sweeping claim that one-fourth of the human kinome directly targets the CTD represents a profound revision of canonical transcriptional biology. However, the evidence presented relies primarily on in vitro kinase assays using short CTD peptides, sparse in-cell validation, and mechanistically incomplete models of nuclear trafficking, chromatin targeting, structural compatibility, and catalytic specificity. In this extended critique, we demonstrate that the conclusions of this study are not supported by current biochemical, structural, cell biological, or genomic data. We outline severe shortcomings in assay design, lack of quantitative kinetics, incompatibilities with known Pol II structural constraints, unsupported assumptions about nuclear localization, inappropriate extension to "direct-at-gene" mechanisms, absence of global transcriptional effects, failure to align with the essential role of canonical CDKs, and missing transparency in dataset reporting. We conclude that the central claims of the study are premature and contradicted by decades of established transcriptional research. Substantial new evidence is required before revising the mechanistic model of Pol II CTD regulation.

Abstract:
The slime mould Physarum polycephalum displays adaptive transport dynamics and network formation that have inspired its use as a model of biological computation. We develop a Lagrangian formulation of Physarum's adaptive dynamics on predefined graphs, showing that steady states arise as extrema of a least-action functional balancing metabolic dissipation and transport efficiency. The organism's apparent ability to find optimal paths between nutrient sources and sinks emerges from minimizing global energy dissipation under predefined boundary conditions that specify the problem to be solved. Applied to ring, tree, and lattice geometries, the framework accurately reproduces the optimal conductance and flux configurations observed experimentally. These results show that Physarum's problem-solving on constrained topologies follows a physics-based variational principle, revealing least-action dynamics as the foundation of its adaptive organization.

Abstract:
Nearly all cell models explicitly or implicitly deal with the biophysical constraints that must be respected for life to persist. Despite this, there is almost no systematicity in how these constraints are implemented, and we lack a principled understanding of how cellular dynamics interact with them and how they originate in actual biology. Computational cell biology will only overcome these concerns once it treats the life-death boundary as a central concept, creating a theory of cellular viability. We lay the foundation for such a development by demonstrating how specific geometric structures can separate regions of qualitatively similar survival outcomes in our models, offering new global organizing principles for cell fate. We also argue that idealized models of emergent individuals offer a tractable way to begin understanding life's intrinsically generated limits.

Abstract:
RNA-based vaccination has been broadly applied in the COVID pandemic. A characteristic of the immunization was fast waning immunity. However, the time scale of this process varied considerable for virus subtypes and among individuals. Understanding the origin of this variability is crucial in order to improve future vaccination strategies. Here, we introduce a mathematical model of RNA-based vaccination and the kinetics of the induced immune response. In the model, antigens produced following vaccination rise an immune response leading to germinal center reactions and accordingly B-cell differentiation into memory B-cells and plasma cells. In a negative feedback loop, the antibodies synthesized by newly specified plasma cells shut down the germinal center reaction as well as antigen-induced differentiation of memory B-cell into plasma cells. This limits the build-up of long-lasting immunity and thus is accompanied by fast waning immunity. The detailed data available on infection with and vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 enabled computational simulation of essential processes of the immune response. By simulation, we analyzed to which extent a single or double dose vaccination provides protection against infection. We find that variability of the immune response in individuals, originating e.g. in different immune cell densities, results in a broad log-normal-like distribution of the vaccine-induced protection times that peaks around 100 days. Protection times decrease for virus variants with mutated antibody binding sites or increased replication rates. Independent of these virus specifics, our simulations suggest optimal timing of a second dose about 5 weeks after the first in agreement with clinical trials.

Abstract:
Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has transformed immunotherapy for resistant cancers, yet it faces major limitations such as lack of persistence, toxicity, exhaustion, and antigen-negative relapse. Enhancing CAR T cells with genetic circuitry and synthetic receptors offers solutions to some of these problems, but often the theoretical design space is too large to explore experimentally. Mathematical modeling offers a powerful framework for addressing these translational bottlenecks by linking mechanistic understanding to design optimization and clinical application.   This perspective embeds modeling methodologies within the therapeutic problems they aim to solve, framing the discussion around key translational challenges rather than modeling techniques. We critically evaluate the strengths, limitations, and data gaps of current approaches emphasizing how modeling supports the development of safer and more effective therapies. We highlight emerging approaches such as multiscale modeling, control theory, and data-driven methods that leverage high-dimensional datasets to guide predictive design, and we point toward underexplored areas in immune cell therapy including CAR NK and CAR macrophages as future modeling frontiers. We hope that the themes explored in this perspective will encourage readers to refine predictive models, enabling researchers to optimize CAR T cell therapies at the genetic, cellular, microenvironmental, and patient level to enhance their clinical performance.

Abstract:
A biofilm is a self-contained community of bacteria that uses signaling molecules called autoinducers (AIs) to coordinate responses through the process of quorum sensing. Biofilms exhibit a dual role that drives interest in both combating antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and leveraging their potential in bioprocessing, since their products can have commercial potential. Previous work has demonstrated how the distinct anisotropic channel geometry in some biofilms affects AIs propagation therein. In this paper, a 2D anisotropic biofilm channel model is extended to be a time-varying channel (TVC), in order to represent the diffusion dynamics during the maturation phase when water channels develop. Since maturation is associated with the development of anisotropy, the time-varying model captures the shift from isotropic to anisotropic diffusion. Particle-based simulation results illustrate how the TVC is a hybrid scenario incorporating propagation features of both isotropic and anisotropic diffusion. This hybrid behavior aligns with biofilm maturation. Further study of the TVC includes characterization of the mutual information (MI), which reveals that an increased AI count, reduced transmitter -- receiver distance, greater degree of anisotropy, and shorter inter-symbol interference lengths increase the MI. Finally, a brief dimensional analysis demonstrates the scalability of the anisotropic channel results for larger biofilms and timescales.

Abstract:
Disordered systems subject to a fluctuating environment can self-organize into a complex history-dependent response, retaining a memory of the driving. In sheared amorphous solids, self-organization is established by the emergence of a persistent system of mechanical instabilities that can repeatedly be triggered by the driving, leading to a state of high mechanical reversibility. As a result of self-organization, the response of the system becomes correlated with the dynamics of its environment, which can be viewed as a sensing mechanism of the system's environment. Such phenomena emerge across a wide variety of soft matter systems, suggesting that they are generic and hence may depend very little on the underlying specifics. We review self-organization in driven amorphous solids, concluding with a discussion of what self-organization in driven disordered systems can teach us about how simple organisms sense and adapt to their changing environments.

Abstract:
During development, embryonic tissues experience mechanical stresses ranging from cellular to supracellular length scales. In response, cells generate active forces that drive rearrangements, allowing the tissue to relax accumulated stresses. The nature of these responses depends strongly on the magnitude and duration of the deformation, giving rise to the tissue's characteristic viscoelastic behavior. Although experiments have characterized tissue rheology in various contexts, simpler theoretical approaches that directly connect cellular activity to emergent rheological behavior are still limited. In this study, we employ a vertex-based model of epithelial tissue incorporating active force fluctuations in cell vertices to represent cell motility. We capture distinct rounding dynamics and motility-dependent timescales by benchmarking against experimental observations such as the bulging of presomitic mesoderm (PSM) explants driven by Fibroblast Growth Factor(FGF) gradients. Stress relaxation tests reveal rapid short-timescale relaxation alongside persistent long-timescale residual stresses that decrease from anterior to posterior (AP) region of the PSM. By applying oscillatory shear, we analyzed the resulting elastic and viscous responses, revealing motility dependence of storage and loss modulus. Finally, we introduce spatially patterned cues applied in a temporally pulsed manner, mimicking dynamic biochemical or mechanical signals during development. Our results show that while higher motility promotes tissue remodeling in response to these cues, this response is constrained by spatial scale; cellular-scale perturbations are relaxed irrespective of motility strength, preventing complete morphological adaptation.

Abstract:
Effective metabolic waste clearance and maintaining ionic homeostasis are essential for the health and normal function of the central nervous system. To understand its mechanism and the role of fluid flow, we develop a multidomain electro-osmotic model of optic-nerve microcirculation that couples hydrostatic and osmotic fluid transport with electro-diffusive solute movement across axons, glia, the extracellular space, and arterial/venous/capillary perivascular spaces. Cerebrospinal fluid enters the optic nerve via the arterial parivascular space, passes both the glial and ECS before exiting through the venous parivascular space. Exchanges across astrocytic endfeet are essential and they occur in two distinct and coupled paths: through AQP4 on glial membranes and gaps between glial endfeet, thus establishing a mechanistic substrate for two modes of glymphatic transport, at rest and during stimulus-evoked perturbations. Parameter sweeps show that lowering AQP4-mediated fluid permeability or PVS permeability elevates pressure, suppresses radial exchange and slows clearance, effects most pronounced for solutes reliant on PVS V export. The model reproduces baseline and stimulus-evoked flow and demonstrates that PVS-mediated export is the primary clearance route for both small and moderate solutes. Small molecules clear faster because rapid ECS diffusion broadens their distribution and enhances ECS PVS exchange, whereas moderate species have low ECS diffusivity, depend on transendfoot transfer, and clear more slowly via PVS V convection. Our framework can also be used to explain the sleep-wake effect mechanistically: enlarging ECS volume or permeability increases transinterface flux and accelerates waste removal.

Abstract:
Autophagy and migrasome formation constitute critical cellular mechanisms for maintaining cellular homeostasis, however, their potential compensatory interplay remains poorly understood. In this study, we identify VPS39, a core component of the HOPS complex, as a molecular switch coordinating these processes. Genetic ablation of VPS39 not only impairs autophagic flux but also triggers cell migration through RhoA/Rac1 GTPases upregulation, consequently facilitating migrasome formation. Using super-resolution microscopy, we further demonstrate that migrasomes serve as an alternative disposal route for damaged mitochondria during VPS39-induced autophagy impairment, revealing a novel stress adaptation mechanism. Our work establishes a previously unrecognized autophagy-migrasome axis and provides direct visual evidence of organelle quality control via migrasomal extrusion. These findings position VPS39-regulated pathway switching as a potential therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative diseases characterized by autophagy dysfunction.

Abstract:
Immune cells recognize and discriminate antigens through immunological synapses - dynamic intercellular junctions exhibiting highly organized receptor-ligand patterns. While much work has focused on molecular kinetics and passive mechanisms of pattern formation, the role of active mechanical control in patterning and discrimination remains underexplored. We develop a minimal continuum model coupling receptor binding kinetics, membrane deformation, and cytoskeletal forces, with elastohydrodynamic flow in the synaptic cleft. Numerical simulations and scaling analysis reveal that contractile cortical flows arrest coarsening and stabilize long-lived multifocal clusters, whereas active pulling accelerates cluster dissolution and elevates background receptor binding. Nonequilibrium mechanical forces enable adaptive control over the speed, sensitivity, and dynamic range of affinity discrimination in a pattern-dependent manner. Our results highlight how immune cells exploit cytoskeletal remodeling to robustly regulate antigen recognition through synaptic patterning.

Abstract:
Cell shape changes are largely controlled by the actin cytoskeleton, a dynamic filament network beneath the plasma membrane. Several cell types can form extended free-standing protrusions not supported by an extracellular substrate or matrix, and regulated by proteins that modulate cytoskeletal dynamics in a way sensitive to the curvature of the cell membrane. We develop a theoretical model for the mechanics of a free-standing viscous actin network growing on a corrugated membrane. The model couples the dynamics of the viscous active gel with membrane deformation and the recruitment of curvature-sensitive actin nucleators. We show that an actin layer polymerising uniformly on the membrane always exerts a stabilising effect that reduces membrane deformation. However, curvature-sensitive actin nucleator proteins can render the membrane linearly unstable, depending on the interplay between membrane and actin dynamics, giving rise to spontaneous membrane deformation which could initiate extended free-standing cellular protrusion.

Abstract:
Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are neural networks that embed the laws of dynamical systems modeled by differential equations into their loss function as constraints. In this work, we present a PINN framework applied to oncology. Here, we seek to learn time-varying interactions due to a combination therapy in a tumor microenvironment. In oncology, experimental data are often sparse and composed of a few time points of tumor volume. By embedding inductive biases derived from prior information about a dynamical system, we extend the physics-informed neural networks (PINN) and incorporate observed biological constraints as regularization agents. The modified PINN algorithm is able to steer itself to a reasonable solution and can generalize well with only a few training examples. We demonstrate the merit of our approach by learning the dynamics of treatment applied intermittently in an ordinary differential equation (ODE) model of a combination therapy. The algorithm yields a solution to the ODE and time-varying forms of some of the ODE model parameters. We demonstrate a strong convergence using metrics such as the mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE).

Abstract:
Left-right axis specification is a vital part of embryonic development that establishes the left and the right sides of an embryo. Asymmetric organ morphogenesis follows asymmetric signaling cascades, which in turn follow asymmetric events on the cellular scale. In a recent study, Badih et al.\ reported cell-scale movement asymmetries in spontaneously rotating pairs of endothelial cells confined to a circular fibronectin-coated island. Importantly, the authors demonstrate that cytoskeletal contractility modulates the chirality bias. The relative simplicity of the experimental setup make it a perfect testing ground for the physical forces that could endow this system with rotational movement and biases, but these forces have yet to be stated. We model self-propelling biological cells migrating in response to confinement, polarity, and pairwise repulsive forces. For the first time, we are able to reproduce not only the coherent angular movement of a confined pair of cells biased in a direction but also a contractility-modulated chirality bias. To arrive at these modeling results, two key assumptions are needed: an intrinsic orientation bias (previously observed in other cellular systems), and a difference between the cells in their velocity alignment response, which endows the system with a difference in the timescales of dynamics. Tuning the timescale (or strength) of polarity response relative to the remaining forces (confinement and cell-cell interaction), can amplify or reverse the CW bias. We present a coherent theory, based on dynamical system analysis, that captures chirality emergence in a singlet and doublet cell system.

Abstract:
State transitions are fundamental in biological systems but challenging to observe directly. Here, we present the first single-cell observation of state transitions in a synthetic bacterial genetic circuit. Using a mother machine, we tracked over 1007 cells for 27 hours. First-passage analysis and dynamical reconstruction reveal that transitions occur outside the small-noise regime, challenging the applicability of classical Kramers' theory. The process lacks a single characteristic rate, questioning the paradigm of transitions between discrete cell states. We observe significant multiplicative noise that distorts the effective potential landscape yet increases transition times. These findings necessitate theoretical frameworks for biological state transitions beyond the small-noise assumption.

Abstract:
Large language models (LLMs) are transforming cellular biology by enabling the development of "virtual cells"--computational systems that represent, predict, and reason about cellular states and behaviors. This work provides a comprehensive review of LLMs for virtual cell modeling. We propose a unified taxonomy that organizes existing methods into two paradigms: LLMs as Oracles, for direct cellular modeling, and LLMs as Agents, for orchestrating complex scientific tasks. We identify three core tasks--cellular representation, perturbation prediction, and gene regulation inference--and review their associated models, datasets, evaluation benchmarks, as well as the critical challenges in scalability, generalizability, and interpretability.

Abstract:
Aims. Resistance to targeted therapies remains a major challenge in EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Here, we describe a novel metabolic adaptation in osimertinib-resistant cells characterized by elevated acetate levels and activation of an unconventional pyruvate-acetaldehyde-acetate (PAA) shunt. Methods. Integrated transcriptomic, exometabolomic, and functional analyses reveal suppression of canonical metabolic pathways and upregulation of ALDH2 and ALDH7A1, that mediate the NADP+-dependent oxidation of acetaldehyde to acetate, generating NADPH. Results. This shift generates reducing power essential for biosynthesis and redox balance under conditions of oxidative pentose phosphate inhibition. These metabolic changes promote endurance in resistant cells and rewire the interplay between glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway, and the tricarboxylic acid cycle, offering a de novo bypass for anaplerosis and bioenergetics. Systematic metabolite profiling revealed distinct transcriptomic and metabolic signatures distinguishing resistant from drug sensitive parental cells. Conclusions. Together, these findings depict a unique, resistance-driven adaptive metabolic shift and uncover potential therapeutic vulnerabilities in osimertinib-resistant NSCLC.

Abstract:
Modeling the dynamics of cellular differentiation is fundamental to advancing the understanding and treatment of diseases associated with this process, such as cancer. With the rapid growth of single-cell datasets, this has also become a particularly promising and active domain for machine learning. Current state-of-the-art models, however, rely on computationally expensive optimal transport preprocessing and multi-stage training, while also not discovering explicit gene interactions. To address these challenges we propose Cell-Mechanistic Neural Networks (Cell-MNN), an encoder-decoder architecture whose latent representation is a locally linearized ODE governing the dynamics of cellular evolution from stem to tissue cells. Cell-MNN is fully end-to-end (besides a standard PCA pre-processing) and its ODE representation explicitly learns biologically consistent and interpretable gene interactions. Empirically, we show that Cell-MNN achieves competitive performance on single-cell benchmarks, surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in scaling to larger datasets and joint training across multiple datasets, while also learning interpretable gene interactions that we validate against the TRRUST database of gene interactions.

Abstract:
The biofilms response on active attachment surfaces (submerged plant leaves) and inert attachment surfaces (biomimetic plant glass attachment surfaces) and their effects on PAHs and nitrogen transformation under the application conditions of bactericide, algaecide and PAHs were investigated by lab simulated hydroponics and high-throughput molecular biology methods in Vallisneria natans (VN), Hydrilla verticillata (HV) and biomimetic plants (BP) systems. Results showed that the introduction of bactericide, algaecide and PAHs changed the microorganism composition in biofilm, the presence or absence of submerged plants was the primary factor causing differences in microbial communities. Moreover, the microbial diversity and endemic species of biomimetic plant biofilms were higher than those of submerged plant systems, indicating that submerged plants have selectively induced the reconstruction of biofilm-leaves. The introduction of bactericide, algaecide and PAHs leads to abnormal accumulation of TP and NH3-N in overlying water, as well as NO3-N and TP content in sediment. However, submerged plants can weaken and alleviate the stress effects of these factors on nitrogen and phosphorus conversion. Compared to the inert biomimetic plant glass surface, the presence of active surfaces in submerged plants results in a much higher abundance of PAHs degrading bacteria (Sphingomonas and Novosphingobium) and nitrogen converting bacteria (e.g. denitrifying bacteria of Methylophilus, Methylotenera, Flavobacterium, Hydrogenophaga, Aquabacterium, and nitrogen-fixing bacteria of Rhizobium, Azoarcus, Rhizobacter, Azonexus) in biofilm-leaves of submerged plants after the addition of bactericide, algaecide and PAHs. Coupled degradation of PAHs and nitrogen occurs, which is beneficial for the treatment of combined pollution caused by PAHs and nitrogen.

Abstract:
Background. Preeclampsia (PE) complicates 2-8% of pregnancies and is marked by placental hypoxia and HIF-pathway activation, especially in early-onset PE (eoPE). Integrating patient tissue analyses with experimental models may reveal common molecular markers of trophoblast hypoxia.   Methods. We analyzed scRNA-seq data from 10 eoPE, 7 late-onset PE (loPE), and corresponding control placentas, identifying villous cytotrophoblast (VCT), syncytiotrophoblast (SCT), and extravillous trophoblast (EVT) subpopulations. BeWo b30 cells were treated for 24 h with CoCl2 (300 $μ$M) or an oxyquinoline derivative (OD, 5 $μ$M) to induce hypoxia. RNA and small RNA sequencing quantified mRNA and microRNA changes. PROGENy inferred pathway activities.   Results. ScRNA-seq revealed highest hypoxia pathway activation in eoPE, with EVT showing maximum activity among trophoblast populations. Nine genes were upregulated across all trophoblast types in eoPE: EBI3, CST6, FN1, RFK, COL17A1, LDHA, PKP2, RPS4Y1, and RPS26. In vitro, OD induced more specific hypoxia responses than CoCl2, with 1,284 versus 3,032 differentially expressed genes respectively. Critically, EBI3, FN1, and COL17A1 showed concordant upregulation in both placental tissue and OD-treated cells, while CoCl2 treatment produced opposite expression patterns. MicroRNA analysis identified hsa-miR-27a-5p and hsa-miR-193b-5p as consistently elevated in both experimental conditions and previously reported in PE placental vesicles. We also identified isoforms of hsa-miR-9-5p and hsa-miR-92b-3p as hypoxia-associated in trophoblast.   Conclusions. EBI3, COL17A1, hsa-miR-27a-5p, and hsa-miR-193b-5p emerge as trophoblast hypoxia markers in PE. Oxyquinoline derivatives offer a more physiologically relevant in vitro hypoxia model than CoCl2. This integrated approach advances understanding of PE pathophysiology and suggests candidate therapeutic targets.

Abstract:
Effective recognition of foreign antigens by the adaptive immune system relies on T cells being activated by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in lymph nodes. Here, diffusing T cells may encounter cognate APCs that present matching antigen fragments or non-cognate ones that do not; they are also subject to degradation. We develop a stochastic model in which T cell-APCs interact via a sequence of recognition steps, represented as a multistage Markov chain. T cells are successfully activated only if the terminal state associated with a cognate APC is reached. We compute the probability of successful activation in the presence of interfering non-cognate APCs, T cell degradation, and lymph node exit, and analyze the mean first-passage time to activation. We also incorporate a kinetic proofreading mechanism that enables state resetting, and show how this enhances specificity toward cognate APCs.

Abstract:
Rotational migration is one specific form of collective cell migration when epithelial cells are confined in a spherical geometry, such as in the epithelial acini. This tissue-level rotation motion is crucial for the morphogenesis of multiple epithelial systems. Here, we introduce a new primary human model for the study of rotational migration, pancreatic ductal organoids. Live imaging revealed the persistent rotation of the organoids over time. By tracking the nuclei, the three-dimensional trajectory of the cellular movement was reconstructed and the velocity of the rotation was quantified. The presence of focal adhesion clusters and prominent actin stress fibers were observed at the basal side of the organoids, suggesting the interactions between the cells and the surrounding extracellular matrix. Finally, our inhibition study showed the dependence of pancreatic ductal organoid rotational migration on myosin activity, actin polymerization, and actin branching. We hope that this model will enable future studies with human primary cells, which are more faithful to normal epithelial cells.

Abstract:
Chronic critical illness (CCI) is a disease state in which, following an initial insult, a patient neither recovers nor dies but instead remains in a state of critical illness. CCI is characterized by prolonged organ dysfunction, weight loss, and persistent increased vulnerability to infection. Recent data has shown that patients with CCI generally exhibit persistent immune dysfunction, characterized by prolonged elevation of specific pro-inflammatory cytokines. In this paper, we introduce a host response model that couples hematopoiesis dynamics with immune response to infection. Specifically, we incorporate the reactions between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory signals with specific hematopoietic stem cell compartments with a reduced model of acute inflammation. We found that a maladaptive hematopoietic response to pathogenic insult is able to qualitatively reproduce similar behavior to that seen in CCI patients, namely the presence of a persistent, elevated level of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This suggests that maladaptive hematopoietic responses in vivo may play a role in the development of CCI.

Abstract:
Predicting cellular responses to genetic perturbations represents a fundamental challenge in systems biology, critical for advancing therapeutic discovery and virtual cell modeling. While large language models (LLMs) show promise for biological reasoning, their application to perturbation prediction remains underexplored due to challenges in adapting them to structured experimental data. We present SynthPert, a novel method that enhances LLM performance through supervised fine-tuning on synthetic reasoning traces generated by frontier models. Using the PerturbQA benchmark, we demonstrate that our approach not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but surpasses the capabilities of the frontier model that generated the training data. Our results reveal three key insights: (1) Synthetic reasoning traces effectively distill biological knowledge even when partially inaccurate, (2) This approach enables cross-cell-type generalization with 87% accuracy on unseen RPE1 cells, and (3) Performance gains persist despite using only 2% of quality-filtered training data. This work shows the effectiveness of synthetic reasoning distillation for enhancing domain-specific reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract:
Cytotoxic T lymphocytes eliminate infected or malignant cells, safeguarding surrounding tissues. Although experimental and systems-immunology studies have cataloged many molecular and cellular actors involved in an immune response, the design principles governing how the speed and magnitude of T-cell responses emerge from cellular decision-making remain elusive. Here, we recast the T-cell response as a feedback-controlled program, wherein the rates of activation, proliferation, differentiation and death are regulated through antigenic, pro- and anti-inflammatory cues. By exploring a broad class of feedback-controller designs as potential immune programs, we demonstrate how the speed and magnitude of T-cell responses emerge from optimizing signal-feedback to protect against diverse infection settings. We recover an inherent trade-off: infection clearance at the cost of immunopathology. We show how this trade-off is encoded into the logic of T-cell responses by hierarchical sensitivity to different immune signals. Notably, we find that designs that balance harm from acute infections and autoimmunity produce immune responses consistent with experimentally observed patterns of T-cell effector expansion in mice. Extending our model to immune-based T-cell therapies for cancer tumors, we identify a trade-off between the affinity for tumor antigens ("quality") and the abundance ("quantity") of infused T-cells necessary for effective treatment. Finally, we show how therapeutic efficacy can be improved by targeted genetic perturbations to T-cells. Our findings offer a unified control-logic for cytotoxic T-cell responses and point to specific regulatory programs that can be engineered for more robust T-cell therapies.

Abstract:
In eukaryotic cell chemotaxis, cells extend and retract transient actin-driven protrusions at their membrane that facilitate both the detection of external chemical gradients and directional movement via the formation of focal adhesions with the extracellular matrix. Although extensive experimental work has detailed how cellular protrusions and morphology vary under different environmental conditions, the mechanistic principles linking protrusive activity to these factors remain poorly understood. Here, we model the extension of actin-based protrusions in chemotaxis as an optimisation problem, wherein cells balance the detection of chemical gradients with the energetic cost of protrusion formation. Our model, built on the assumption of energy minimisation, provides a framework that successfully reproduces experimentally observed patterns of protrusive activity across a range of biological systems and environmental conditions, suggesting that energetic efficiency may underpin the morphology and chemotactic behaviour of motile eukaryotic cells. Additionally, we leverage the model to generate novel predictions regarding cellular responses to other, experimentally untested environmental perturbations, providing testable hypotheses for future experimental work that may be used to validate and refine the model presented here.

Abstract:
Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has shown remarkable success in hematological malignancies, yet patient responses remain highly variable and the roles of CD4 and CD8 subsets are not fully understood. We present an extended mathematical framework of CAR-T cell dynamics that explicitly models CD4 helper and CD8 cytotoxic lineages and their interactions with tumor antigen burden. Building on the Kirouac et al. (2023) model of antigen-regulated memory, effector, and exhaustion transitions, our system of differential equations incorporates cytokine-mediated modulation of CD8 proliferation, cytotoxicity, and memory regeneration by CD4 T cells. Sensitivity analyses identify effector proliferation burst size, antigen turnover, and CD8 expansion rates as dominant determinants of treatment outcome. Virtual patient simulations reproduce clinical findings that a 1:1 CD4:CD8 ratio enhances CAR-T expansion and tumor clearance relative to CD8-only products. Finally, we integrate a feed-forward neural network trained on noisy virtual patient data to improve predictive robustness, and apply SHAP analysis to interpret the network predictions and compare them with mechanistic sensitivity analyses. This work highlights the synergistic roles of CD4 and CD8 CAR-T cells and provides a quantitative foundation for optimizing treatments and patient stratification.

Abstract:
Computational models provide crucial insights into complex biological processes such as cancer evolution, but their mechanistic nature often makes them nonlinear and parameter-rich, complicating calibration. We systematically evaluate parameter probability distributions in cell migration models using Bayesian calibration across four complementary strategies: parametric and surrogate models, each with and without explicit model discrepancy. This approach enables joint analysis of parameter uncertainty, predictive performance, and interpretability. Applied to a real data experiment of glioblastoma progression in microfluidic devices, surrogate models achieve higher computational efficiency and predictive accuracy, whereas parametric models yield more reliable parameter estimates due to their mechanistic grounding. Incorporating model discrepancy exposes structural limitations, clarifying where model refinement is necessary. Together, these comparisons offer practical guidance for calibrating and improving computational models of complex biological systems.

Abstract:
To ensure faithful information transmission, cells utilize nonequilibrium drives to reduce errors. Kinetic proofreading is a classic mechanism known to sharpen ligand discrimination by T lymphocytes. It remains an open question whether the adaptive immune system relies solely on kinetic proofreading to boost fidelity. Here, we suggest an alternative: an enhanced form of mechanical proofreading (MPR) in which adaptive force exertion via dynamic cell-cell contact allows faithful selection of high-affinity B lymphocytes. Using a minimal model validated with experiment, we show that adaptive MPR, characterized by mechanical feedback between force generation and contact formation, enables robust discrimination of receptor quality regardless of ligand quantity. Although MPR generically balances the tradeoffs between speed and fidelity, a negative scaling of contact duration with ligand abundance indicates the presence of feedback. Due to its ability to modulate interactions of distinct ligands that share load at membrane contacts, adaptive MPR can be harnessed to mitigate autoimmunity or enhance multivalent vaccines. Overall, this work suggests a generalization of the proofreading mechanism to encompass cellular designs that act across scales to enable competing functionalities.

Abstract:
As epithelial development or wound closure approaches completion, cell proliferation progressively slows via contact inhibition of proliferation (CIP) - a mechanism understood as being strictly local. Here we report the discovery of inhibition of proliferation through an unanticipated mechanism that is non-local. Within the epithelial layer arises a self-organized reticulum comprising two interpenetrating multiscale networks: islands of mechanically compressed non-cycling cells embedded within an ocean of mechanically tensed cycling cells. The evolution of these networks was found to be susceptible to specific mechanical and molecular stimuli. Yet, in all circumstances, the size of compressed islands followed a power-law distribution that is well-captured by network theory, and implies self-organization and proximity to criticality. Thus, the findings demonstrate a completely new biological paradigm - reticular inhibition of proliferation (RIP).

Abstract:
In multicellular systems, adhesion complexes, such as those composed of E-cadherin and associated catenins, mechanically couple neighboring cells by directly linking their actin-based cytoskeletal assemblies. However, the mechanics of how forces are transmitted across these adhesions remains largely unstudied. Here, we introduce a biophysical model that explicitly couples adhesion complex dynamics to intracellular mechanics across cell boundaries. A cadherin dimer plus associated catenins connecting two cells is represented as a spring whose ends experience drag with respect to the moving actin cytoskeleton. The cytoskeleton is modeled as a contractile gel driven by myosin activity in its bulk and forces from adhesion on its boundaries. Our model captures this bidirectional coupling via a coarse-grained continuum framework and reveals a range of observed cell- and tissue-scale behaviors. These include global cell polarization of the multicellular collective, other polarization patterns and oscillatory dynamics, spontaneously formed actin rings within cells, and supracellular stress chains. Many of these features arise from modeling the direct mechanical coupling between cytoskeleton and adhesion. This model can be extended to other adhesion-cytoskeleton feedback systems and used to advance our understanding of multicellular tissue dynamics, particularly during development.

Abstract:
Dinoflagellates are marine phytoplankton that emit flashes of light in response to flow-induced deformation; they are responsible for illuminating breaking-waves, wakes of ships, and other intensely turbulent spots of the upper ocean. Here, we ask how bioluminescence is affected by the fluctuating nature of turbulence -- a question motivated by the dependence of emitted flashes on both the extent and rate of deformation. Introducing a light-emitting dumbbell as a minimal model, we study the Lagrangian dynamics of flashing in a homogeneous isotropic turbulent flow, and contrast it with that in an extensional flow and a Gaussian random flow. We show that turbulent fluctuations strongly enhance bioluminescence, while introducing a Poisson-like stochasticity in the flashing dynamics. Furthermore, the intermittent fluctuations of the velocity-gradient subjects the dinoflagellate to bursts of extreme straining and produces bright flashes -- more intense, though less frequent, than what would result from Gaussian fluctuations. Our results suggest that radiant displays of marine bioluminescence are strongly promoted by turbulence and its dissipation-scale intermittency.

Abstract:
Cancer is a complex sequence of disease conditions progressing gradually with generalized loss of growth control. It continues to be one of the biggest global health problems, and its etiology has given rise to a huge array of treatment outside of conventional chemotherapy. Melanoma is one of the deadliest forms of skin cancer originating from melanocytes. It is characterized by the overproduction of melanin by the increased in cell proliferation. Melanogenesis, the production of melanin is by melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) which stimulates cyclic AMP (cAMP) production to increase melanocyte production. Through the use of methylxanthines, theophylline proliferation rate can be decreased by increasing cell differentiation. One of the basic principles of cell biology is the selectivity of differentiation and proliferation, where cells usually grow or differentiate but not both. This study aimed to collect baseline data of untreated B16-F10 melanoma cells to determine morphology and doubling time of untreated cells. This data was further compared to results from varied concentration treatments of theophylline. It was hypothesized that increased levels in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) could induce differentiation of melanocytes to terminate proliferation. To test this hypothesis, we collected a series of images of B16- F10 derived from mouse melanoma cells and seeded cells into a 12-well plate to calculate cell concentration for a five-day period and doubling time for untreated cells. Theophylline levels were varied to stimulate the production of cAMP and determine its effect on melanocyte proliferation and differentiation. The observed results showed that intracellular stabilization of cAMP, via phosphodiesterase inhibition by methylxanthines like theophylline, increases cell differentiation on melanoma cells and suppresses their growth.

Abstract:
Bright-field microscopy, a cost-effective solution for live-cell culture, is often the only resource available, along with standard CPUs, for many low-budget labs. The inherent challenges of bright-field images -- their noisiness, low contrast, and dynamic morphology -- coupled with a lack of GPU resources and complex software interfaces, hinder the desired research output. This article presents a novel microscopy image analysis framework designed for low-budget labs equipped with a standard CPU desktop. The Python-based program enables cytometric analysis of live, unstained cells in culture through an advanced computer vision and machine learning pipeline. Crucially, the framework operates on label-free data, requiring no manually annotated training data or training phase. It is accessible via a user-friendly, cross-platform GUI that requires no programming skills, while also providing a scripting interface for programmatic control and integration by developers. The end-to-end workflow performs semantic and instance segmentation, feature extraction, analysis, evaluation, and automated report generation. Its modular architecture supports easy maintenance and flexible integration while supporting both single-image and batch processing. Validated on several unstained cell types from the public dataset of livecells, the framework demonstrates superior accuracy and reproducibility compared to contemporary tools like Cellpose and StarDist. Its competitive segmentation speed on a CPU-based platform highlights its significant potential for basic research and clinical applications -- particularly in cell transplantation for personalised medicine and muscle regeneration therapies. The access to the application is available for reproducibility

Abstract:
Human language is one of the most expressive tools for conveying intent, yet most artificial or biological systems lack mechanisms to interpret or respond meaningfully to it. Bridging this gap could enable more natural forms of control over complex, decentralized systems. In AI and artificial life, recent work explores how language can specify high-level goals, but most systems still depend on engineered rewards, task-specific supervision, or rigid command sets, limiting generalization to novel instructions. Similar constraints apply in synthetic biology and bioengineering, where the locus of control is often genomic rather than environmental perturbation.   A key open question is whether artificial or biological collectives can be guided by free-form natural language alone, without task-specific tuning or carefully designed evaluation metrics. We provide one possible answer here by showing, for the first time, that simple agents' collective behavior can be guided by free-form language prompts: one AI model transforms an imperative prompt into an intervention that is applied to simulated cells; a second AI model scores how well the prompt describes the resulting cellular dynamics; and the former AI model is evolved to improve the scores generated by the latter.   Unlike previous work, our method does not require engineered fitness functions or domain-specific prompt design. We show that the evolved system generalizes to unseen prompts without retraining. By treating natural language as a control layer, the system suggests a future in which spoken or written prompts could direct computational, robotic, or biological systems to desired behaviors. This work provides a concrete step toward this vision of AI-biology partnerships, in which language replaces mathematical objective functions, fixed rules, and domain-specific programming.

Abstract:
Pattern formation often occurs in confined systems, yet how boundaries shape patterning dynamics is unclear. We develop techniques to analyze confinement effects in nonlocal advection-diffusion equations, which generically capture the collective dynamics of active self-attracting particles. We identify a sequence of size-controlled transitions that generate characteristic slow modes, leading to exponential increase of patterning timescales. Experimental measurements of multicellular dynamics confirm our predictions.

Abstract:
Turing patterns play a fundamental role in morphogenesis and population dynamics, encoding key information about the underlying biological mechanisms. Yet, traditional inverse problems have largely relied on non-biological data such as boundary measurements, neglecting the rich information embedded in the patterns themselves. Here we introduce a new research direction that directly leverages physical observables from nature--the amplitude of Turing patterns--to achieve complete parameter identification. We present a framework that uses the spatial amplitude profile of a single pattern to simultaneously recover all system parameters, including wavelength, diffusion constants, and the full nonlinear forms of chemotactic and kinetic coefficient functions. Demonstrated on models of chemotactic bacteria, this amplitude-based approach establishes a biologically grounded, mathematically rigorous paradigm for reverse-engineering pattern formation mechanisms across diverse biological systems.

Abstract:
We develop a mother machine-like microfluidic device specifically designed to track the proliferation of T-cells via live-cell microscopy. Although numerous microfluidic setups have been developed to study cell proliferation at the single-cell level, most of them are optimized for use on adherent cells. Here, we present a device to track the proliferation of suspension cells, featuring an array of microchannels that trap cells, easing their monitoring while allowing for controlled growth conditions. Each microchannel, whose geometry has been optimized through computational fluid dynamics simulations, allows a single cell to enter and proliferate while maintaining a continuous flow of nutrients, ensuring long-term monitoring over multiple generations. We show the advantages of this system in characterizing the proliferation of human leukemia T-cells. In particular, we follow the growth and division over multiple generations, finding that cells exhibit a slightly asymmetric volume division where deviations in the size are compensated by a size-like division strategy. Overall, our device design can be easily adapted and used to study different cell types and sizes while maintaining the same high trapping efficiency.

Abstract:
This paper addresses a profoundly challenging inverse problem that has remained largely unexplored due to its mathematical complexity: the unique identification of all unknown coefficients in a coupled nonlinear system of mixed parabolic-elliptic-elliptic type using only boundary measurements. The system models attraction-repulsion chemotaxis--an advanced mathematical biology framework for studying sophisticated cellular processes--yet despite its significant practical importance, the corresponding inverse problem has never been investigated, representing a true frontier in the field. The mixed-type nature of this system introduces significant theoretical difficulties that render conventional methodologies inadequate, demanding fundamental extensions beyond existing techniques developed for simpler, purely parabolic models. Technically, the problem presents formidable obstacles: the coupling between parabolic and elliptic components creates inherent analytical complications, while the nonlinear structure resists standard approaches. From an applied perspective, the biological relevance adds another layer of complexity, as solutions must maintain physical interpretability through non-negativity constraints. Our work provides a complete theoretical framework for this challenging problem, establishing rigorous unique identifiability results that create a one-to-one correspondence between boundary data and the model's parameters. We demonstrate the power of our general theory through a central biological application: the full parameter recovery for an attraction-repulsion chemotaxis model with logistic growth, thus opening new avenues for quantitative analysis in mathematical biology.

Abstract:
Biophotonics-and more recently, biointegrated photonics-offer transformative tools for probing cellular processes with unprecedented precision. Among these, whispering gallery mode (WGM) resonators-optical microcavities formed in spherical structures-have emerged as powerful biosensors and intracellular barcodes. Lipid droplets (LDs), with their high refractive index and intrinsic spherical geometry, are ideal candidates for supporting intracellular lasing. Although lasing in LDs has been previously demonstrated, it has not yet been harnessed to study live cell biology. Here, we report the first use of WGM resonances in LDs of live primary adipocytes, employing a continuous-wave (CW) laser at powers below the biological damage threshold. By measuring these resonances, we achieved nanometer-scale precision in size estimation, enabling real-time observation of rapid LD dynamics and deformations on the minute scale, far beyond the spatio-temporal resolution of conventional microscopy. We systematically characterized this photonic sensing approach, demonstrating its ability to resolve adipocyte heterogeneity, monitor lipolytic responses to forskolin and isoproterenol, and detect early signs of cell viability loss, well before conventional assays. This proof-of-concept establishes intracellular LD WGM resonances as a robust platform for investigating live single-cell metabolism. The technique enables rapid, cost-effective assessment of adipocyte function, reveals cell-to-cell variability obscured by bulk assays, and lays the foundation for high-throughput analysis of metabolism- and obesity-related diseases at both cellular and tissue levels.

Abstract:
Understanding how red blood cell (RBC) suspensions navigate porous materials is critical for for both fundamental physiology, such as maternal-fetal exchange in the placenta, and transformative biomedical applications, including rapid, low-cost disease diagnostics from a single drop of blood in resource-constrained settings. Here we elucidate how RBC movement through fibrous microporous structures is influenced by cell aggregation agents, emphasizing the impact of their clustering, membrane flexibility, and confinement. By varying the volume fraction of the RBC (hematocrit) and aggregation strength, we reveal a surprising phase separation: a dense RBC core surrounded by a cell-free layer, an effect not previously reported in whole blood studies. This separation is shown to be more pronounced with rigidified cells and persists even at high hematocrit levels, unlike in healthy samples. By connecting RBC deformability and aggregability to pore-mediated phase dynamics, our study provides a foundation for new diagnostic tools capable of classifying blood disorders or evaluating blood quality using only a sheet of structured paper, seamlessly integrating fundamental fluid mechanics with translational biomedical innovation in a previously unexplored manner.

Abstract:
Eukaryotic cells generally sense chemical gradients using the binding of chemical ligands to membrane receptors. In order to perform chemotaxis effectively in different environments, cells need to adapt to different concentrations. We present a model of gradient sensing where the affinity of receptor-ligand binding is increased when a protein binds to the receptor's cytosolic side. This interior protein (allosteric factor) alters the sensitivity of the cell, allowing the cell to adapt to different ligand concentrations. We propose a reaction scheme where the cell alters the allosteric factor's availability to adapt the average fraction of bound receptors to 1/2. We calculate bounds on the chemotactic accuracy of the cell, and find that the cell can reach near-optimal chemotaxis over a broad range of concentrations. We find that the accuracy of chemotaxis depends strongly on the diffusion of the allosteric compound relative to other reaction rates. From this, we also find a trade-off between adaptation time and gradient sensing accuracy.

Abstract:
Microbiomes are a vital part of the human body, engaging in tasks like food digestion and immune defense. Their structure and function must be understood in order to promote host health and facilitate swift recovery during disease. Due to the difficulties in experimentally studying these systems in situ, more research is being conducted in the field of mathematical modeling. Visualizing spatiotemporal data is challenging, and current tools that simulate microbial communities' spatial and temporal development often only provide limited functionalities, often requiring expert knowledge to generate useful results. To overcome these limitations, we provide a user-friendly tool to interactively explore spatiotemporal simulation data, called MicroLabVR, which transfers spatial data into virtual reality (VR) while following guidelines to enhance user experience (UX). With MicroLabVR, users can import CSV datasets containing population growth, substance concentration development, and metabolic flux distribution data. The implemented visualization methods allow users to evaluate the dataset in a VR environment interactively. MicroLabVR aims to improve data analysis for the user by allowing the exploration of microbiome data in their spatial context.

Abstract:
The mitigation of stress is a key challenge for all biological systems. Conditions of unresolvable stress have been associated with a diverse array of pathologies, from cancer to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Here, I unify insights from evolutionary and developmental biology with trauma psychology to present a novel framework for tumorigenesis which synthesizes stress-perception, tissue dysfunction, and the hallmarks of neoplastic growth. This view carries therapeutic implications, suggesting a reintegrative approach that seeks to return cancer cells to the homeostatic control of the surrounding tissue.

Abstract:
Single-cell multi-omics data contain huge information of cellular states, and analyzing these data can reveal valuable insights into cellular heterogeneity, diseases, and biological processes. However, as cell differentiation \& development is a continuous and dynamic process, it remains challenging to computationally model and infer cell interaction patterns based on single-cell multi-omics data. This paper presents scI2CL, a new single-cell multi-omics fusion framework based on intra- and inter-omics contrastive learning, to learn comprehensive and discriminative cellular representations from complementary multi-omics data for various downstream tasks. Extensive experiments of four downstream tasks validate the effectiveness of scI2CL and its superiority over existing peers. Concretely, in cell clustering, scI2CL surpasses eight state-of-the-art methods on four widely-used real-world datasets. In cell subtyping, scI2CL effectively distinguishes three latent monocyte cell subpopulations, which are not discovered by existing methods. Simultaneously, scI2CL is the only method that correctly constructs the cell developmental trajectory from hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells to Memory B cells. In addition, scI2CL resolves the misclassification of cell types between two subpopulations of CD4+ T cells, while existing methods fail to precisely distinguish the mixed cells. In summary, scI2CL can accurately characterize cross-omics relationships among cells, thus effectively fuses multi-omics data and learns discriminative cellular representations to support various downstream analysis tasks.

Abstract:
To rapidly coordinate collective behaviors in tissues, cells communicate with one another through traveling fronts of signaling activity called trigger waves. The stimulus threshold for wave propagation is a key biological parameter that determines when the system produces a global response to a local stimulus. However, it is unclear how this stimulus threshold is determined by the properties of the underlying signaling network. To address this gap, we studied a model of trigger waves with a realistic Hill-type auto-activation function. We obtained an analytic expression for the wave ignition threshold in 1D and numerical solutions in 2D and 3D. In the limit of high sensitivity, we found that the trigger wave threshold depends on both the effective dissociation constant, $K_D$, and the effective Hill coefficient, $n$, of the positive feedback circuit, with the dominant contribution scaling as $K_D^{n/(n-1)}$ in all dimensions. This result leads to a simple method for predicting the trigger wave ignition threshold from bulk activation data and is potentially of use for developing synthetic trigger wave circuits with desired sensitivities.

Abstract:
In tissue development, wound healing, and cancer invasion, coordinated cell motion arises from active forces produced by the cells. The relationship between force and motion remains unclear, however, because the forces are a sum active and passive contributions. Here, we show that the active forces can be decoupled from the passive by careful investigation of the distribution of shear stress against strain rate. With this method, we show experimentally that the order of magnitude of passive tissue viscosity is 100 Pa-hr and that increasing (decreasing) the actomyosin cytoskeleton and cell-cell adhesions increase (decrease) the magnitude of tissue viscosity. These results establish tissue viscosity as a meaningful way to describe the mechanical behavior of epithelial tissues, and demonstrate a direct relationship between tissue microstructure and material properties. By providing the first experimental measurement of tissue viscosity, our study separates the active and passive components of stress, in turn clarifying the relationship between force and motion and providing a new means of identifying how active cell forces evolve in space and time.

Abstract:
Collective cell migration is a fundamental biological process that drives events such as embryonic development, wound healing, and cancer metastasis. In this study, we develop a biophysically informed phase-field model to investigate the collective migration of the border cell cluster in the Drosophila melanogaster egg chamber. Our model captures key aspects of the egg chamber architecture, including the oocyte, nurse cells, and surrounding epithelium, and incorporates both mechanical forces and biochemical cues that guide cell migration. We introduce the Tangential Interface Migration (TIM) force which captures contact-mediated propulsion generated along interfaces between the border cell cluster and surrounding nurse cells. Our simulations reveal three key features of TIM-driven migration that distinguish it from previous forms of chemotaxis: (1) the necessity of border cell-nurse cell overlap to initiate movement (i.e., border cells cannot move without a nurse cell substrate), (2) motion is tangential to border cell-nurse cell interfaces, and (3) persistent migration even in regions where the spatial slope of chemoattractant is decreasing. Additionally, we demonstrate that with or without geometry-mediated alterations in chemoattractant distribution such as at intercellular junctions we can vary induced migration pauses, independent of mechanical confinement. We capture an experimentally observed transition to dorsal migration at the oocyte with a sustained medio-lateral chemical cue of small amplitude. The results show how spatial constraints and interfacial forces shape collective cell movement and highlight the utility of phase-field models in capturing the interplay between tissue geometry, contact forces, and chemical signaling.

Abstract:
Populations evolving in fluctuating environments face the fundamental challenge of balancing adaptation to current conditions against preparation for uncertain futures. Here, we study microbial evolution in partially predictable environments using proteome allocation models that capture the trade-off between growth rate and lag time during environmental transitions. We demonstrate that evolution drives populations toward an evolutionary stable allocation strategy that minimizes resource depletion time, thereby balancing faster growth with shorter adaptation delays. In environments with temporal structure, populations evolve to learn the statistical patterns of environmental transitions through proteome pre-allocation, with the evolved allocations reflecting the transition probabilities between conditions. Our framework reveals how microbial populations can extract and exploit environmental predictability without explicit neural computation, using the proteome as a distributed memory system that encodes environmental patterns. This work demonstrates how information-theoretic principles govern cellular resource allocation and provides a mechanistic foundation for understanding learning-like behavior in evolving biological systems.

Abstract:
To maintain homeostasis, living cells process information with networks of interacting molecules. Traditional models for cellular information processing have focused on networks of chemical reactions between molecules. Here, we describe how networks of physical interactions could contribute to the processing of information inside cells. In particular, we focus on the impact of biomolecular condensation, a structural phase transition found in cells. Biomolecular condensation has recently been implicated in diverse cellular processes. Some of these are essentially computational, including classification and control tasks. We place these findings in the broader context of physical computing, an emerging framework for describing how the native dynamics of nonlinear physical systems can be leveraged to perform complex computations. The synthesis of these ideas raises questions about expressivity (the range of problems that cellular phase transitions might be able to solve) and learning (how these systems could adapt and evolve to solve different problems). This emerging area of research presents diverse opportunities across molecular biophysics, soft matter, and physical computing.

Abstract:
The positioning of new cellular walls during cell division plays a key role in shaping plant tissue organization. The influence of cell geometry on the positioning of division planes has been previously captured into various geometrical rules. Accordingly, linking cell shape to division orientation has relied on the comparison between observed division patterns and predictions under specific rules. The need to define a priori the tested rules is a fundamental limitation of this hypothesis-driven approach. As an alternative, we introduce a data-based approach to investigate the relation between cell geometry and division plane positioning, exploiting the ability of deep neural network to learn complex relationships across multidimensional spaces. Adopting an image-based cell representation, we show how division patterns can be learned and predicted from mother cell geometry using a UNet architecture modified to operate on cell masks. Using synthetic data and A. thaliana embryo cells, we evaluate the model performances on a wide range of diverse cell shapes and division patterns. We find that the trained model accounted for embryo division patterns that were previously irreconcilable under existing geometrical rules. Our work shows the potential of deep networks to understand cell division patterns and to generate new hypotheses on the control of cell division positioning.

Title: Competing chemical gradients change chemotactic dynamics and cell distribution

Abstract:
Cells are constantly exposed to diverse stimuli-chemical, mechanical, or electrical-that guide their movement. In physiological conditions, these signals often overlap, as seen during infections, where neutrophils and dendritic cells navigate through multiple chemotactic fields. How cells integrate and prioritize competing signals remains unclear. For instance, in the presence of opposing chemoattractant gradients, how do cells decide which direction to go? When should local signals dominate distant ones? A key factor in these processes is the precision with which cells sense each gradient, which depends non-monotonically on concentrations. Here, we study how gradient sensing accuracy shapes cell navigation in the presence of two distinct chemoattractant sources. We model cells as active random walkers that sense local gradients and combine these estimates to reorient their movement. Our results show that cells sensing multiple gradients can display a range of chemotactic behaviors, including anisotropic spatial patterns and varying degrees of confinement, depending on gradient shape and source location. The model also predicts cases where cells exhibit multistep navigation across sources or a hierarchical response toward one source, driven by disparities in their sensitivity to each chemoattractant. These findings highlight the role of gradient sensing in shaping spatial organization and navigation strategies in multi-field chemotaxis.

Abstract:
A circuital network model for the foraging behaviour of Physarum polycephalum proves that threshold sensing yields the emergence of optimal paths that connect food sources and solve mazes. These findings are in agreement with the experimental evidence of emergent problem solving by P. polycephalum and provide insight into the evolution of primitive intelligence. Our results can also inspire the development of threshold-based algorithms for computing applications.

Abstract:
The process of programmed cell death, namely apoptosis, is a natural mechanism that regulates healthy tissue, multicellular structures, and homeostasis. An improved understanding of apoptosis can significantly enhance our knowledge of biological processes and systems. For instance, pathogens can manipulate the apoptotic process to either evade immune detection or to facilitate their spread. Furthermore, of particular clinical interest is the ability of cancer cells to evade apoptosis, hence allowing them to survive and proliferate uncontrollably. Thus, in this work, we propose a phase-field framework for simulating intrinsic or extrinsic apoptosis induced by an activation field, including deriving the configurational mechanics underlying such phenomena. Along with exploring varying conditions needed to initiate or reduce apoptosis, this can serve as a starting point for computational therapeutic testing. To showcase model capabilities, we present simulations exhibiting different types of cellular dynamics produced when varying the mechanisms underlying apoptosis. The model is subsequently applied to probe different morphological transitions, such as cell shrinkage, membrane blebbing, cavity formation and fragmentation. Lastly, we compare the characteristics observed in our simulations to electron microscopy images, providing additional support for the model.

Abstract:
Accurate modeling of microbial growth curves is essential for understanding and optimizing bioprocesses in biotechnology and environmental engineering. While classical monoauxic models such as Monod, Boltzmann, and Gompertz are widely used, they often lack biological interpretability or fail to capture the complex, multiphasic growth patterns observed in systems with mixed substrates or microbial communities. This paper presents a methodological framework for reparametrizing the Boltzmann and Gompertz equations, assigning direct biological significance to each parameter and enabling their application to both monoauxic and polyauxic (multi-phase) growth scenarios. Polyauxic growth is modeled as a weighted sum of sigmoidal functions, with constraints for model identifiability and biological plausibility. Robust parameter estimation is achieved using a Lorentzian loss function, combined with a global-local optimization strategy (Particle Swarm Optimization and Nelder-Mead), and systematic outlier exclusion using the ROUT method. Model parsimony is enforced via established information criteria. This workflow enables reliable, reproducible, and interpretable extraction of kinetic parameters from complex growth data and is broadly applicable to other fields where sigmoidal patterns are observed.

Abstract:
Early identification of cardiomyocyte dysfunction is a critical challenge for the prognosis of diastolic heart failure (DHF) exhibiting impaired left ventricular relaxation (ILVR). Myocardial relaxation relies strongly on efficient intracellular calcium (${\text{Ca}}^{2+}$) handling. During diastole, a sluggish removal of ${\text{Ca}}^{2+}$ from cardiomyocytes disrupts sarcomere relaxation, leading to ILVR \textit{at the organ level}. Characterizing myocardial relaxation \textit{at the cellular level} requires analyzing both sarcomere length (SL) transients and intracellular calcium kinetics (CK). However, due to the complexity and redundancy in SL and CK data, identifying the most informative features for accurate classification is challenging. To address this, we developed a robust feature selection pipeline involving statistical significance testing (p-values), hierarchical clustering, and feature importance evaluation using random forest (RF) classification to select the most informative features from SL and CK data. SL and CK transients were obtained from prior studies involving a transgenic phospho-ablated mouse model exhibiting ILVR (AAA mice) and wild-type as non-transgenic control mice (NTG). By iteratively refining the feature set, we trained a RF classifier using the selected reduced features. For comparison, we evaluated the performance of the classifier using the full set of original features as well as a dimensionally reduced set derived through principal component analysis (PCA). The confusion matrices demonstrated that the reduced feature set achieved comparable performance to the full feature set and outperformed the PCA-based approach, while offering better interpretability by retaining biologically relevant features. These findings suggest that a small, carefully chosen set of biological features can effectively detect early signs of cardiomyocyte dysfunction.

Abstract:
Background: In vitro endothelial cell culture is widely used to study angiogenesis. Histomicrographic images of cell networks are often analyzed manually, a process that is time-consuming and subjective. Automated tools like ImageJ (NIH) can assist, but are often slow and inaccurate. Additionally, as endothelial networks grow more complex, traditional architectural metrics may not fully reflect network maturity. To address these limitations, we developed tubuleTracker, a software tool that quantifies endothelial network architecture and maturity rapidly and objectively. Methods: Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were cultured in an extracellular matrix, and 54 images were acquired using phase contrast microscopy. Each image was analyzed manually by three independent reviewers, and by both ImageJ and tubuleTracker. Key metrics included tubule count, total length, node count, tubule area, and vessel circularity. In parallel, trained scientists rated each image for angiogenesis maturity on a 1-5 scale (1 = most mature). Results: Analysis time per image differed significantly: manual (8 min), ImageJ (58+/-4 s), and tubuleTracker (6+/-2 s) (p<0.0001). Significant differences were also found in tubule count (manual 168+/-SD, tubuleTracker 92+/-SD, ImageJ 433+/-SD), length, and node count (all p<0.0001). tubuleTracker's metrics varied significantly across angiogenesis maturity scores, including tubule count, length, node count, area, and circularity (all p<0.0001). Conclusions: tubuleTracker was faster and more consistent than both manual and ImageJ-based analysis. Vessel circularity proved especially effective in capturing angiogenesis maturity. tubuleTracker is available as free shareware for the biomedical research community.

Abstract:
We study how simple eukaryotic organisms make decisions in response to competing stimuli in the context of phototaxis by the unicellular alga $Chlamydomonas~reinhardtii$. While negatively phototactic cells swim directly away from a collimated light beam, when presented with two beams of adjustable intersection angle and intensities, we find that cells swim in a direction given by an intensity-weighted average of the two light propagation vectors. This geometrical law is a fixed point of an adaptive model of phototaxis and minimizes the average light intensity falling on the anterior pole of the cell. At large angular separations, subpopulations of cells swim away from one source or the other, or along the direction of the geometrical law, with some cells stochastically switching between the three directions. This behavior is shown to arise from a population-level distribution of photoreceptor locations that breaks front-back symmetry of photoreception.

Abstract:
Biological image analysis has traditionally focused on measuring specific visual properties of interest for cells or other entities. A complementary paradigm gaining increasing traction is image-based profiling - quantifying many distinct visual features to form comprehensive profiles which may reveal hidden patterns in cellular states, drug responses, and disease mechanisms. While current tools like CellProfiler can generate these feature sets, they pose significant barriers to automated and reproducible analyses, hindering machine learning workflows. Here we introduce cp_measure, a Python library that extracts CellProfiler's core measurement capabilities into a modular, API-first tool designed for programmatic feature extraction. We demonstrate that cp_measure features retain high fidelity with CellProfiler features while enabling seamless integration with the scientific Python ecosystem. Through applications to 3D astrocyte imaging and spatial transcriptomics, we showcase how cp_measure enables reproducible, automated image-based profiling pipelines that scale effectively for machine learning applications in computational biology.

Abstract:
Recent measurements of Norway spruce have revealed stress-state-dependent normalized creep behavior, highlighting a gap in our fundamental understanding. This study examines whether the anisotropic response originates from the micro-structural, cellular nature of composite cell walls with varying tracheid types. Cell wall creep parameters are identified via surrogate-based inverse parameter identification, applied to hierarchical micro-mechanical and FEM models of increasing topological complexity up to the growth ring scale. Despite microstructural disorder, simulated creep curves converge toward a universal set of proportionality factors. The results indicate that directional creep behavior cannot be attributed solely to tissue-scale topology, and that realistic predictions require the inclusion of non-linear material responses at stress concentration sites.

Abstract:
This study focuses on the synthesis and characterization of advanced polymeric composite electrospun nanofibers (NFs) containing magnetic oxide nanoparticles (NPs). By leveraging the method of electrospinning, the research aims to investigate polymer composites with enhanced interfacial properties, improved double-layer capacitance, and adequate biocompatibility. Electrospun polyacrylonitrile (PAN) NFs embedded with Fe2O3 and MnZn ferrite NPs were comprehensively characterized using advanced techniques, i.e., Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and alternating gradient field magnetometry (AGFM). The incorporation of metal oxide NPs led to significant changes in the thermal, spectroscopic, and morphological properties of the NFs. XPS analysis confirmed increased oxidation, graphitic carbon content, and the formation of new nitrogen functionalities after heat treatment. Furthermore, interactions between nitrile groups and metal ions were observed, indicating the influence of nanoparticles on surface chemistry. Magnetic characterization demonstrated the potential of these composite NFs to generate magnetic fields for biomedical manipulation. Cytocompatibility studies revealed no significant impact on the viability or morphology of human mesenchymal stromal cells, highlighting their biocompatibility. These findings suggest the promising use of PAN-magnetic NFs in applications including targeted drug administration, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and magnetic hyperthermia for cancer treatment.

Abstract:
The advent of single-cell multi-omics technologies has enabled the simultaneous profiling of diverse omics layers within individual cells. Integrating such multimodal data provides unprecedented insights into cellular identity, regulatory processes, and disease mechanisms. However, it remains challenging, as current methods often rely on selecting highly variable genes or peaks during preprocessing, which may inadvertently discard crucial biological information. Here, we present scMamba, a foundation model designed to integrate single-cell multi-omics data without the need for prior feature selection while preserving genomic positional information. scMamba introduces a patch-based cell tokenization strategy that treats genomics regions as words (tokens) and cells as sentences. Building upon the concept of state space duality, scMamba distills rich biological insights from high-dimensional, sparse single-cell multi-omics data. Additionally, our novel contrastive learning approach, enhanced with cosine similarity regularization, enables superior alignment across omics layers compared to traditional methods. Systematic benchmarking across multiple datasets demonstrates that scMamba significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in preserving biological variation, aligning omics layers, and enhancing key downstream tasks such as clustering, cell type annotation, and trajectory inference. Our findings position scMamba as a powerful tool for large-scale single-cell multi-omics integration, capable of handling large-scale atlases and advancing biological discovery.

Abstract:
Tip growth in filamentous cells, such as root hairs, moss protonemata, and fungal hyphae, depends on coordinated cell wall extension driven by turgor pressure, wall mechanics, and exocytosis. We introduce a dual-configuration model that incorporates both turgid and unturgid states to describe cell wall growth as the combined effect of elastic deformation and irreversible extension. This framework infers exocytosis profiles directly from cell morphology and elastic stretches, formulated as an initial value problem based on the self-similarity condition. Applying the model to Medicago truncatula root hairs, moss Physcomitrium patens protonemata, and hyphoid-like shapes, we find that exocytosis peaks at the tip in tapered cells but shifts to an annular region away from the apex in flatter-tip cells beyond a threshold. The model generalizes previous fluid models and provides a mechanistic link between exocytosis distribution and cell shape, explaining observed variations in tip-growing cells across species.

Abstract:
Mutual information is a theoretically grounded metric for quantifying cellular signaling pathways. However, its measurement demands characterization of both input and output distributions, limiting practical applications. Here, we present alternative method that alleviates this requirement using dual reporter systems. By extending extrinsic-intrinsic noise analysis, we derive a mutual information estimator that eliminates the need to measure input distribution. We demonstrate our method by analyzing the bacterial chemotactic pathway, regarding multiple flagellar motors as natural dual reporters. We show the biological relevance of the measured information flow by comparing it with theoretical bounds on sensory information. This framework opens new possibilities for quantifying information flow in cellular signaling pathways.

Proceedings of the ICML 2025 GenBio Workshop: The 2nd Workshop on Generative AI and Biology, Vancouver, Canada, 2025

Abstract:
Generating high-fidelity and biologically plausible synthetic single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, especially with conditional control, is challenging due to its high dimensionality, sparsity, and complex biological variations. Existing generative models often struggle to capture these unique characteristics and ensure robustness to structural noise in cellular networks. We introduce LapDDPM, a novel conditional Graph Diffusion Probabilistic Model for robust and high-fidelity scRNA-seq generation. LapDDPM uniquely integrates graph-based representations with a score-based diffusion model, enhanced by a novel spectral adversarial perturbation mechanism on graph edge weights. Our contributions are threefold: we leverage Laplacian Positional Encodings (LPEs) to enrich the latent space with crucial cellular relationship information; we develop a conditional score-based diffusion model for effective learning and generation from complex scRNA-seq distributions; and we employ a unique spectral adversarial training scheme on graph edge weights, boosting robustness against structural variations. Extensive experiments on diverse scRNA-seq datasets demonstrate LapDDPM's superior performance, achieving high fidelity and generating biologically-plausible, cell-type-specific samples. LapDDPM sets a new benchmark for conditional scRNA-seq data generation, offering a robust tool for various downstream biological applications.

Comment: 11 pages, 3 figures

Abstract:
We present a coarse-grained stochastic model for axonal extension on periodic arrays of parallel micropatterns that integrates three key biophysical mechanisms: (i) the molecular clutch that couples actin retrograde flow to substrate adhesions, (ii) an active biopolymer-based mechanism generating traction-force fluctuations, and (iii) the mechanical interaction of the growth cone with the micropatterned substrate. Using the Shannon-Jaynes maximum entropy principle with constraints derived from experimental observations, we derive a unique probability distribution for the colored acceleration noise that enters the Langevin equation. The resulting stationary process exhibits power-law temporal correlations with negative exponent, which accounts for the observed superdiffusive dynamics of axons. For biologically relevant parameters the model predicts this exponent to be -1/2, in close quantitative agreement with measurements of cortical neurons cultured on patterned substrates.

Abstract:
Single-cell transcriptomics and proteomics have become a great source for data-driven insights into biology, enabling the use of advanced deep learning methods to understand cellular heterogeneity and gene expression at the single-cell level. With the advent of spatial-omics data, we have the promise of characterizing cells within their tissue context as it provides both spatial coordinates and intra-cellular transcriptional or protein counts. Proteomics offers a complementary view by directly measuring proteins, which are the primary effectors of cellular function and key therapeutic targets. However, existing models either ignore the spatial information or the complex genetic and proteomic programs within cells. Thus they cannot infer how cell internal regulation adapts to microenvironmental cues. Furthermore, these models often utilize fixed gene vocabularies, hindering their generalizability unseen genes. In this paper, we introduce HEIST, a hierarchical graph transformer foundation model for spatial transcriptomics and proteomics. HEIST models tissues as hierarchical graphs. The higher level graph is a spatial cell graph, and each cell in turn, is represented by its lower level gene co-expression network graph. HEIST achieves this by performing both intra-level and cross-level message passing to utilize the hierarchy in its embeddings and can thus generalize to novel datatypes including spatial proteomics without retraining. HEIST is pretrained on 22.3M cells from 124 tissues across 15 organs using spatially-aware contrastive and masked autoencoding objectives. Unsupervised analysis of HEIST embeddings reveals spatially informed subpopulations missed by prior models. Downstream evaluations demonstrate generalizability to proteomics data and state-of-the-art performance in clinical outcome prediction, cell type annotation, and gene imputation across multiple technologies.

Abstract:
Intervertebral discs are avascular and maintain immune privilege. However, during intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD), this barrier is disrupted, leading to extensive immune cell infiltration and localized inflammation. In degenerated discs, macrophages, T lymphocytes, neutrophils, and granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (G-MDSCs) are key players, exhibiting functional heterogeneity. Dysregulated activation of inflammatory pathways, including nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappaB), interleukin-17 (IL-17), and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation, drives local pro-inflammatory responses, leading to cell apoptosis and extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation. Innovative immunotherapies, including exosome-based treatments, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing, and chemokine-loaded hydrogel systems, have shown promise in reshaping the immunological niche of intervertebral discs. These strategies can modulate dysregulated immune responses and create a supportive environment for tissue regeneration. However, current studies have not fully elucidated the mechanisms of inflammatory memory and the immunometabolic axis, and they face challenges in balancing tissue regeneration with immune homeostasis. Future studies should employ interdisciplinary approaches such as single-cell and spatial transcriptomics to map a comprehensive immune atlas of IDD, elucidate intercellular crosstalk and signaling networks, and develop integrated therapies combining targeted immunomodulation with regenerative engineering, thereby facilitating the clinical translation of effective IDD treatments.

Abstract:
Understanding the interactions between cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM) during collective cell invasion is crucial for advancements in tissue engineering, cancer therapies, and regenerative medicine. This study focuses on the roles of contact guidance and ECM remodelling in directing cell behaviour, with a particular emphasis on exploring how differences in cell phenotype impact collective cell invasion. We present a computationally tractable two-dimensional hybrid model of collective cell migration within the ECM, where cells are modelled as individual entities and collagen fibres as a continuous tensorial field. Our model incorporates random motility, contact guidance, cell-cell adhesion, volume filling, and the dynamic remodelling of collagen fibres through cellular secretion and degradation. Through a comprehensive parameter sweep, we provide valuable insights into how differences in the cell phenotype, in terms of the ability of the cell to migrate, secrete, degrade, and respond to contact guidance cues from the ECM, impacts the characteristics of collective cell invasion.

Abstract:
We study single cell E.coli chemotaxis in a spatio-temporally varying attractant environment. Modeling the attractant concentration in the form of a traveling sine wave, we measure in our simulations, the chemotactic drift velocity of the cell for different propagation speed of the attractant wave. We find a highly non-trivial dependence where the chemotactic drift velocity changes sign, and also shows multiple peaks. For slowly moving attractant wave, drift velocity is negative, i.e. the drift motion is directed opposite to wave propagation. As the wave speed increases, drift velocity shows a negative peak, then changes sign, reaches a positive peak and finally becomes zero when the wave moves too fast for the cell to respond. We explain this rich behavior from the difference in attractant gradient perceived by the cell during its run along the propagation direction and opposite to it. In particular, when the cell moves in the same direction as the wave, the relative velocity of the cell with respect to the wave becomes zero when the wave speed matches the run speed. In this limit, the cell is able to ride the wave and experiences no concentration gradient during these runs. On the contrary, for runs in the opposite direction, no such effect is present and the effective gradient increases monotonically with the wave speed. We show, using detailed quantitative measurements, how this difference gives rise to the counter-intuitive behavior of chemotactic drift velocity described above.

Abstract:
Multicellular organisms develop a wide variety of highly-specialized cell types. The consistency and robustness of developmental cell fate trajectories suggests that complex gene regulatory networks effectively act as low-dimensional cell fate landscapes. A complementary set of works draws on the theory of dynamical systems to argue that cell fate transitions can be categorized into universal decision-making classes. However, the theory connecting geometric landscapes and decision-making classes to high-dimensional gene expression space is still in its infancy. Here, we introduce a phenomenological model that allows us to identify gene expression signatures of decision-making classes from single-cell RNA-sequencing time-series data. Our model combines low-dimensional gradient-like dynamical systems and high-dimensional Hopfield networks to capture the interplay between cell fate, gene expression, and signaling pathways. We apply our model to the maturation of alveolar cells in mouse lungs to show that the transient appearance of a mixed alveolar type 1/type 2 state suggests the triple cusp decision-making class. We also analyze lineage-tracing data on hematopoetic differentiation and show that bipotent neutrophil-monocyte progenitors likely undergo a heteroclinic flip bifurcation. Our results suggest it is possible to identify universal decision-making classes for cell fate transitions directly from data.

Abstract:
Many biological processes can be thought of as the result of an underlying dynamics in which the system repeatedly undergoes distinct and abortive trajectories with the dynamical process only ending when some specific process, purpose, structure or function is achieved. A classic example is the way in which microtubules attach to kinetochores as a prerequisite for chromosome segregation and cell division. In this example, the dynamics is characterized by apparently futile time histories in which microtubules repeatedly grow and shrink without chromosomal attachment. We hypothesize that for biological processes for which it is not the initial conditions that matter, but rather the final state, this kind of exploratory dynamics is biology's unique and necessary solution to achieving these functions with high fidelity. This kind of cause and effect relationship can be contrasted to examples from physics and chemistry where the initial conditions determine the outcome. In this paper, we examine the similarities of many biological processes that depend upon random trajectories starting from the initial state and the selection of subsets of these trajectories to achieve some desired functional final state. We begin by reviewing the long history of the principles of dynamics, first in the context of physics, and then in the context of the study of life. These ideas are then stacked against the broad categories of biological phenomenology that exhibit exploratory dynamics. We then build on earlier work by making a quantitative examination of a succession of increasingly sophisticated models for exploratory dynamics, all of which share the common feature of being a series of repeated trials that ultimately end in a "winning" trajectory. We also explore the ways in which microscopic parameters can be tuned to alter exploratory dynamics as well as the energetic burden of performing such processes.

Abstract:
The emerging field of immunometabolism has underscored the central role of metabolic pathways in orchestrating immune cell function. Far from being passive background processes, metabolic activities actively regulate key immune responses. Fundamental pathways such as glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation critically shape the behavior of immune cells, influencing macrophage polarization, T cell activation, and dendritic cell function. In this review, we synthesize recent advances in immunometabolism, with a focus on the metabolic mechanisms that govern the responses of both innate and adaptive immune cells to bacterial, viral, and fungal pathogens. Drawing on experimental, computational, and integrative methodologies, we highlight how metabolic reprogramming contributes to host defense in response to infection. These findings reveal new opportunities for therapeutic intervention, suggesting that modulation of metabolic pathways could enhance immune function and improve pathogen clearance.

Abstract:
Agent-based models (ABMs) are widely used in biology to understand how individual actions scale into emergent population behavior. Modelers employ sensitivity analysis (SA) algorithms to quantify input parameters' impact on model outputs, however, it is hard to perform SA for ABMs due to their computational and complex nature. In this work, we develop the Simulate, Summarize, Reduce, Cluster, and Analyze (SSRCA) methodology, a machine-learning based pipeline designed to facilitate SA for ABMs. In particular, SSRCA can achieve the following tasks for ABMS: 1) identify sensitive model parameters, 2) reveal common output model patterns, and 3) determine which input parameter values generate these patterns. We use an example ABM of tumor spheroid growth to showcase how SSRCA provides similar SA results to the popular Sobol' Method while also identifying four common patterns from the ABM and the parameter regions that generate these outputs. This analysis could streamline data-driven tasks, such as parameter estimation, for ABMs by reducing parameter space. While we highlight these results with an ABM on tumor spheroid formation, the SSRCA methodology is broadly applicable to biological ABMs.

Abstract:
Cell migration in vivo is often guided by chemical signals. Such chemotaxis, such as performed by immune cells migrating to a wound site, is complicated by the complex geometry inside living tissues. In this study, we extend our theoretical model of branched-cell migration on a network by introducing chemokine sources to explore the cellular response. The model predicts a speed-accuracy tradeoff, whereby slow cells are significantly more accurate and able to follow efficiently a weak chemoattractant signal. We then compare the model's predictions with experimental observations of neutrophils migrating to the site of laser-inflicted wound in a zebrafish larva fin, and migrating in-vitro inside a regular lattice of pillars. We find that the model captures the details of the sub-cellular response to the chemokine gradient, as well as the large-scale migration response. This comparison suggests that the neutrophils behave as fast cells, compromising their chemotaxis accuracy, which explains the functionality of these immune cells.

Abstract:
Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) are an important resource for the identification of new therapeutic targets and cardioprotective drugs. After differentiation iPSC-CMs show an immature, fetal-like phenotype. Cultivation of iPSC-CMs in lipid-supplemented maturation medium (MM) strongly enhances their structural, metabolic and functional phenotype. Nevertheless, assessing iPSC-CM maturation state remains challenging as most methods are time consuming and go in line with cell damage or loss of the sample. To address this issue, we developed a non-invasive approach for automated classification of iPSC-CM maturity through interpretable artificial intelligence (AI)-based analysis of beat characteristics derived from video-based motion analysis. In a prospective study, we evaluated 230 video recordings of early-state, immature iPSC-CMs on day 21 after differentiation (d21) and more mature iPSC-CMs cultured in MM (d42, MM). For each recording, 10 features were extracted using Maia motion analysis software and entered into a support vector machine (SVM). The hyperparameters of the SVM were optimized in a grid search on 80 % of the data using 5-fold cross-validation. The optimized model achieved an accuracy of 99.5 $\pm$ 1.1 % on a hold-out test set. Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) identified displacement, relaxation-rise time and beating duration as the most relevant features for assessing maturity level. Our results suggest the use of non-invasive, optical motion analysis combined with AI-based methods as a tool to assess iPSC-CMs maturity and could be applied before performing functional readouts or drug testing. This may potentially reduce the variability and improve the reproducibility of experimental studies.

Abstract:
Multicellular rosettes are observed in different situations such as morphogenesis, wound healing, and cancer progression. While some molecular insights have been gained to explain the presence of these assemblies of five or more cells around a common center, what are the tunable, global features that favors/hinders their formation is still largely unknown. Here, we made use of a Voronoi dynamical model to investigate the ingredients driving the emergence of rosettes characterized by different degree of stability and organization. We found that (i) breaking the local spatial symmetry of the system, i.e., introducing curvature-inducing defects, allows for the formation of rosette-like structures (ii) whose probability of formation depends on the characteristic of the cellular layer. In particular, a trade-off between tissue fluidity and single cell deformability dictates the assembly of transient rosettes, that are strongly stabilized in the presence of cell alignment interactions. To test our model predictions, we performed fluorescence microscopy experiments on rosette-forming neural populations derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, finding significant agreement. Overall, our work may set the stage to gain an unifying understanding of the plethora of biophysical mechanisms involving the occurrence of rosette-like structure both in physiology and their altered formation in pathology.

Abstract:
Cell size control is crucial for maintaining cellular function and homeostasis. In this study, we develop a first-order partial differential equation model to examine the effects of three key size control mechanisms: the sizer, timer, and adder. Each mechanism is incorporated into the model through distinct boundary conditions. Exact solutions for these mechanisms are derived using the method of characteristics, allowing us to explore how the steady-state size distribution depends on control parameters. Additionally, individual-cell-based stochastic simulations are performed to validate our theoretical findings and investigate the size distribution under various conditions. This study provides new insights into the quantitative dynamics of cell size regulation, highlighting the underlying mechanisms and laying the groundwork for future theoretical and experimental work on size homeostasis in biological systems.

Abstract:
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide and the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in adults under 55, involving a complex interplay of biological processes such as dendritic cell (DC) maturation and migration, T cell activation and proliferation, cytokine production, and T cell and natural killer (NK) cell-mediated cancer cell killing. Microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) CRC and deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) CRC constitute 15% of all CRC, and 4% of metastatic CRC, and exhibit remarkable responsiveness to immunotherapy, especially with PD-1 inhibitors such as pembrolizumab. Mathematical models of the underlying immunobiology and the interactions underpinning immune checkpoint blockade offer mechanistic insights into tumour-immune dynamics and provide avenues for treatment optimisation and the identification of novel therapeutic targets. We used our data-driven model of de novo metastatic MSI-H/dMMR CRC (dnmMCRC) and performed sensitivity analysis-guided model reduction using the FAST and EFAST methods. In this work, we constructed two simplified models of dnmMCRC: one that faithfully reproduces all of the original model's trajectories, and a second, minimal model that accurately replicates the original dynamics while being highly extensible for future inclusion of additional components to explore various aspects of the anti-tumour immune response.

Abstract:
The question of "what is life?" has challenged scientists and philosophers for centuries, producing an array of definitions that reflect both the mystery of its emergence and the diversity of disciplinary perspectives brought to bear on the question. Despite significant progress in our understanding of biological systems, psychology, computation, and information theory, no single definition for life has yet achieved universal acceptance. This challenge becomes increasingly urgent as advances in synthetic biology, artificial intelligence, and astrobiology challenge our traditional conceptions of what it means to be alive. We undertook a methodological approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to analyze a set of definitions of life provided by a curated set of cross-disciplinary experts. We used a novel pairwise correlation analysis to map the definitions into distinct feature vectors, followed by agglomerative clustering, intra-cluster semantic analysis, and t-SNE projection to reveal underlying conceptual archetypes. This methodology revealed a continuous landscape of the themes relating to the definition of life, suggesting that what has historically been approached as a binary taxonomic problem should be instead conceived as differentiated perspectives within a unified conceptual latent space. We offer a new methodological bridge between reductionist and holistic approaches to fundamental questions in science and philosophy, demonstrating how computational semantic analysis can reveal conceptual patterns across disciplinary boundaries, and opening similar pathways for addressing other contested definitional territories across the sciences.

Abstract:
Despite significant advances in understanding neuronal development, a fully quantitative framework that integrates intracellular mechanisms with environmental cues during axonal growth remains incomplete. Here, we present a unified biophysical model that captures key mechanochemical processes governing axonal extension on micropatterned substrates. In these environments, axons preferentially align with the pattern direction, form bundles, and advance at constant speed. The model integrates four core components: (i) actin-adhesion traction coupling, (ii) lateral inhibition between neighboring axons, (iii) tubulin transport from soma to the growth cone, and (4) orientation dynamics guided by the substrate anisotropy. Dynamical systems analysis reveals that the saddle-node bifurcation in the actin adhesion subsystem drives a transition to a high-traction motile state, while traction feedback shifts a pitchfork bifurcation in the signaling loop, promoting symmetry breaking and robust alignment. An exact linear solution in the tubulin transport subsystem functions as a built-in speed regulator, ensuring stable elongation rates. Simulations using experimentally inferred parameters accurately reproduce elongation speed, alignment variance, and bundle spacing. The model provides explicit design rules for enhancing axonal alignment through modulation of substrate stiffness and adhesion dynamics. By identifying key control parameters, this work enables rational design of biomaterials for neural repair and engineered tissue systems.

Abstract:
The G-protein coupled receptors EP2 and EP4 both transduce the signal of the lipid messenger Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Changes in the cell response to PGE2 can have important effects on immunity and development of diseases, however, a thorough understanding of the EP2-EP4 receptors' signaling pathways is lacking. Experimental data show that receptor activity (indicated by cAMP expression) has a different kinetics depending on which receptor is triggered by PGE2 and that crosstalk exists between EP2 and EP4. To better understand the underlying mechanisms and be able to predict cell responses to PGE2, we develop novel mathematical models for the cAMP signaling pathways of EP2 and EP4 and their crosstalk. Ligand binding dynamics plays a crucial role for both, the single receptor activity and their crosstalk. The mathematical models can predict the qualitative cAMP levels observed experimentally and provide possible explanations for the differences and commonalities in the signaling behavior of EP2 and EP4. As inhibition of PGE2 signaling is gaining increasing attention in tumor immunology, these mathematical models could contribute to design effective anti-tumor therapies targeting EP2 and EP4.

Abstract:
Over the past decades, nonlocal models have been widely used to describe aggregation phenomena in biology, physics, engineering, and the social sciences. These are often derived as mean-field limits of attraction-repulsion agent-based models, and consist of systems of nonlocal partial differential equations. Using differential adhesion between cells as a biological case study, we introduce a novel local model of aggregation-diffusion phenomena. This system of local aggregation-diffusion equations is fourth-order, resembling thin-film or Cahn-Hilliard type equations. In this framework, cell sorting phenomena are explained through relative surface tensions between distinct cell types. The local model emerges as a limiting case of short-range interactions, providing a significant simplification of earlier nonlocal models, while preserving the same phenomenology. This simplification makes the model easier to implement numerically and more amenable to calibration to quantitative data. Additionally, we discuss recent analytical results based on the gradient-flow structure of the model, along with open problems and future research directions.

Abstract:
Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV), classified as Avian orthoavulavirus 1 (avian paramyxovirus type 1), is a promising oncolytic agent that selectively targets and destroys cancer cells while sparing normal tissues. Its oncoselectivity exploits cancer-specific defects in antiviral defenses, particularly impaired Type I interferon signaling, and dysregulated apoptotic pathways, enabling robust viral replication and cytotoxicity in malignancies such as breast, colorectal, and melanoma. NDV induces intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis through caspase activation and triggers immunogenic cell death via damage-associated molecular patterns, stimulating potent antitumours immune responses. Additionally, NDVs potential as a vaccine vector, expressing tumours-associated antigens, offers prospects for prophylactic and therapeutic cancer applications. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of NDVs morphology, classification, and molecular biology, focusing on its viral entry and replication mechanisms in host cells. It explores NDVs interactions with cancer cells, emphasizing its ability to induce cytotoxicity and immune activation. Understanding these mechanisms is critical for optimizing NDVs oncolytic potential and advancing its clinical translation. Future directions include enhancing NDV through genetic engineering, combining it with therapies like immune checkpoint inhibitors, and developing personalized medicine approaches tailored to tumours genomic profiles. These advancements position NDV as a versatile therapeutic agent in oncolytic virotherapy.

Abstract:
Recent studies have demonstrated the feasibility of modeling single-cell data as natural languages and the potential of leveraging powerful large language models (LLMs) for understanding cell biology. However, a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs' performance on language-driven single-cell analysis tasks still remains unexplored. Motivated by this challenge, we introduce CellVerse, a unified language-centric question-answering benchmark that integrates four types of single-cell multi-omics data and encompasses three hierarchical levels of single-cell analysis tasks: cell type annotation (cell-level), drug response prediction (drug-level), and perturbation analysis (gene-level). Going beyond this, we systematically evaluate the performance across 14 open-source and closed-source LLMs ranging from 160M to 671B on CellVerse. Remarkably, the experimental results reveal: (1) Existing specialist models (C2S-Pythia) fail to make reasonable decisions across all sub-tasks within CellVerse, while generalist models such as Qwen, Llama, GPT, and DeepSeek family models exhibit preliminary understanding capabilities within the realm of cell biology. (2) The performance of current LLMs falls short of expectations and has substantial room for improvement. Notably, in the widely studied drug response prediction task, none of the evaluated LLMs demonstrate significant performance improvement over random guessing. CellVerse offers the first large-scale empirical demonstration that significant challenges still remain in applying LLMs to cell biology. By introducing CellVerse, we lay the foundation for advancing cell biology through natural languages and hope this paradigm could facilitate next-generation single-cell analysis.

Abstract:
Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) -- which include skeletal stem cells -- are a promising tool in regenerative medicine. However, their heterogeneous and unpredictable in vivo behaviour remains a critical barrier preventing the development of standardized therapeutic approaches for skeletal tissue regeneration. Several studies have attempted to identify in vitro features that could correlate with the in vivo differentiation properties, yet the mechanisms ruling BMSC heterogeneity remain poorly understood. Here, using time-lapse imaging, we lineage-trace 32 single-cell-derived BMSC colonies through seven generations. We observe significant inter-colony and intra-colony heterogeneity in lineage topology (determined by the number of senescent or apoptotic cells) and in replicative kinetics (measured from proliferating cells only). Interestingly, topology and kinetics result strongly correlated, suggesting the existence of regulatory factors linking the non-dividing/apoptotic subpopulations with proliferating cells. Furthermore, BMSCs display highly synchronized cell cycles during early generations, indicating stage-specific regulatory mechanisms through which cells influence each other. By employing a non-interacting population growth model, we demonstrate that the observed synchronisation cannot be explained by an uncorrelated branching process; instead, cell-to-cell correlation of division times must exist. Our findings reveal fundamental mechanisms governing BMSC heterogeneity and growth dynamics that may inform strategies to control their regenerative potential.

Abstract:
Diabetes is a civilization chronic disease characterized by a constant elevated concentration of glucose in the blood. Many processes are involved in the glucose regulation, and their interactions are very complex. To better understand those processes we set ourselves a goal to create a Petri net model of the glucose regulation in the whole body. So far we have managed to create a model of glycolysis and synthesis of glucose in the liver, and the general overview models of the glucose regulation in a healthy and diabetic person. In this paper we introduce Petri nets models of insulin secretion in beta cell of the pancreas, and glucagon in the pancreas alpha cells. Those two hormones have mutually opposite effects: insulin preventing hyperglycemia, and glucagon preventing hypoglycemia. Understanding the mechanisms of insulin and glucagon secretion constitutes the basis for understanding diabetes. We also present a model in which both processes occur together, depending on the blood glucose level. The dynamics of each model is analysed. Additionally, we transform the overall insulin and glucagon secretion system to a Boolean network, following standard transformation rules.

Abstract:
Many drugs have been withdrawn from the market worldwide, at a cost of billions of dollars, because of patient fatalities due to them unexpectedly disturbing heart rhythm. Even drugs for ailments as mild as hay fever have been withdrawn due to an unacceptable increase in risk of these heart rhythm disturbances. Consequently, the whole pharmaceutical industry expends a huge effort in checking all new drugs for any unwanted side effects on the heart. The predominant root cause has been identified as drug molecules blocking ionic current flows in the heart. Block of individual types of ionic currents can now be measured experimentally at an early stage of drug development, and this is the standard screening approach for a number of ion currents in many large pharmaceutical companies. However, clinical risk is a complex function of the degree of block of many different types of cardiac ion currents, and this is difficult to understand by looking at results of these screens independently. By using ordinary differential equation models for the electrical activity of heart cells (electrophysiology models) we can integrate information from different types of currents, to predict the effect on whole heart cells and subsequent risk of side effects. The resulting simulations can provide a more accurate summary of the risk of a drug earlier in development and hence more cheaply than the pre-existing approaches.

Abstract:
Cell membrane tension directly influences various cellular functions. In this study, we developed a method to estimate surface tension from time-series data. We obtained the curvature-velocity relationship from time-series of binarized cell shape images, and the effective surface tension term was calculated from linear regression.   During the process, we observed an S-shaped pattern in the curvature-velocity relationship. To understand the dynamics, we constructed a minimal lattice model describing single-cell motion. The model consists of surface tension and protrusion formation, and the characteristic parameters are obtained from experimental observations. We found that similar patterns emerged in the curvature-velocity relationship.

Abstract:
This study aims to identify and parameterize the optimal survival curves for 33 fundamental microorganisms subject to UVC exposure through experimental measurements. We compile published data on UVC doses and corresponding survival fractions for these microorganisms to estimate parameters for four prominent survival models: Single-target (ST), Multi-target (MT), Linear Quadratic (LQ), and Two-Stage Decay (TSD). The best-fitting model for each microorganism is determined by selecting the one with the lowest mean squared error (MSE) compared to the experimental data. Our analysis indicates that the MT model is the most frequently appropriate, accurately fitting 21 of the 33 microorganisms. The TSD model is the best fit for only three, while the LQ model, though occasionally suitable at lower doses, is often excluded due to unreliable performance at higher doses. The assessed models, particularly the MT model, demonstrate strong predictive capabilities for UVC surface sterilization of microorganisms. However, caution is warranted with the LQ model at higher doses due to its potential limitations.

Abstract:
Learning the response of single-cells to various treatments offers great potential to enable targeted therapies. In this context, neural optimal transport (OT) has emerged as a principled methodological framework because it inherently accommodates the challenges of unpaired data induced by cell destruction during data acquisition. However, most existing OT approaches are incapable of conditioning on different treatment contexts (e.g., time, drug treatment, drug dosage, or cell type) and we still lack methods that unanimously show promising generalization performance to unseen treatments. Here, we propose the Conditional Monge Gap which learns OT maps conditionally on arbitrary covariates. We demonstrate its value in predicting single-cell perturbation responses conditional to one or multiple drugs, a drug dosage, or combinations thereof. We find that our conditional models achieve results comparable and sometimes even superior to the condition-specific state-of-the-art on scRNA-seq as well as multiplexed protein imaging data. Notably, by aggregating data across conditions we perform cross-task learning which unlocks remarkable generalization abilities to unseen drugs or drug dosages, widely outperforming other conditional models in capturing heterogeneity (i.e., higher moments) in the perturbed population. Finally, by scaling to hundreds of conditions and testing on unseen drugs, we narrow the gap between structure-based and effect-based drug representations, suggesting a promising path to the successful prediction of perturbation effects for unseen treatments.

Abstract:
Here we characterized an information measure for cell polarity that applies to non-motile cells responding to a chemical gradient. The central idea is that polarization represents information about the direction of the gradient. We applied a theory of optimal gradient sensing and response in the presence of external noise based on the information capacity of a Gaussian channel. First, we formulated an information framework that describes spatial gradient sensing and polarization response. As part of this section, we modeled ligand diffusion and receptor-binding dynamics as a mixed Poisson distribution, confirming the single receptor accuracy limits derived by ten Wolde and colleagues. Second, we performed numerical calculations of stochastic ligand levels at the cell surface to estimate the information provided about the directional component of the gradient vector, which was close to the Gaussian channel bound for low signal-to-noise ratios. Third, we used the information framework to evaluate the noise-robustness of three generic models of cell polarity, demonstrating that a filter-amplifier architecture and time integration can attenuate the detrimental impact of noise on polarity so that the model can approach the theoretical limits. Fourth, we compared the theory to published experimental data on yeast mating projection growth in a pheromone gradient, identifying the ligand association rate and integration time as two key parameters affecting directional accuracy. By varying these parameters, we showed that for certain ranges the theory is roughly in agreement with the data, and that the slow binding rate constant is a key limiting factor. We concluded that temporal averaging can help overcome the slow binding rate to achieve greater accuracy, but with the drawback of a slow mating response.

Abstract:
Motile eukaryotic cells display distinct modes of migration that often occur within the same cell type. It remains unclear, however, whether transitions between the migratory modes require changes in external conditions, or whether the different modes are coexisting states that emerge from the underlying signaling network. Using a simplified mass-conserved reaction-diffusion model of small GTPase signaling with F-actin mediated feedback, we uncover a distinct bistable mechanism (involving gradient-like phase-separation and traveling waves) and a regime where a polarized mode of migration coexists with spatiotemporal oscillations; the latter, in larger domains, including in three-dimensional surface geometry, result in disordered patterns even in the absence of noise or shape deformations. Indeed, experimental observations of D. discoideum show that, upon collision with a rigid boundary, cells may switch from polarized to disordered motion.

Abstract:
It has been observed that the growth of the nucleus and the cytoplasm is coordinated during cell growth, resulting in a nearly constant nuclear-to-cell volume ratio (N/C) throughout the cell cycle. Previous studies have shown that the N/C ratio is determined by the ratio between the number of proteins in the nucleus and the total number of proteins in the cell. These observations suggest the importance of the nucleocytoplasmic transport process in nuclear size by regulating protein concentrations in the nucleus and cytoplasm. This paper combines a biophysical model of Ran-mediated nucleocytoplasmic transport and a simple cell growth model to provide insights into several key aspects of the N/C ratio homeostasis in growing cells. Our model shows that the permeability of the nuclear envelope needs to grow in line with the cell to maintain a nearly constant N/C ratio, that several parameters involved in the nucleocytoplasmic transport mechanism and gene translation significantly affect the N/C ratio, and that Ran may potentially compensate for the lack of NTF2 in the nucleocytoplasmic transport mechanism to maintain a viable N/C ratio. However, this compensation is possible only if RanGDP is allowed to translocate through the nuclear envelope independently of NTF2.

Abstract:
Conventional tissue engineering methodologies frequently depend on pharmacological strategies to induce or expedite tissue repair. However, bioengineered strategies incorporating biophysical stimulation have emerged as promising alternatives. Electroactive materials facilitate the provision of controlled electrical, mechanical, and electromechanical stimuli, which support cell proliferation and tissue remodelling. Despite their ability to supply external electrical and mechanical stimuli to the tissue microenvironment, the electroactive polymers in use today often lack critical biochemical signals essential for native-like cell-cell and cell-scaffold interactions, thereby constraining their regenerative capabilities. To address the demand for biomimetic materials that possess enhanced capabilities in promoting cell and tissue stimulation, we present the development of a novel class of polymers called ionomeric extracellular matrices (iECMs). By utilising the linker-mediated conjugation of sulfonic acid biomolecules (taurine) to the backbone of an extracellular matrix protein (collagen), we illustrate the potential of iECMs as the first electromechanical actuating material platform derived entirely from ECM materials, paving the way for dynamic and soft-robotic platforms for a wide range of tissue engineering applications.

Abstract:
Anemia is a decrease in hemoglobin and red blood cells and due to a decrease in hemoglobin, oxygen carrying capacity reduce. In this disease, the red blood cell the amount and volume decrease. In this research, healthy and live food powder were synthesized by a green route. This organic biomaterial was named NBS. The NBS healthy and live food powder has various vitamins, macro and micro molecules, and ingredients. Twenty Wistar rats were randomly divided into 4 equal groups, including control and treatment groups 1, 2 and 3. Nutritional supplements for healthy living were administered orally via gavage to rats in groups 1, 2, and 3 at 12.5, 25, and 50 mg/ kg, respectively, and within a period of 20 days, one day in between. There was no intervention in the control group in order to reach baseline blood factors. At the end of the study, blood samples were taken from the heart, including blood-red blood cells, hemoglobin, hematocrit and platelets using a fully automated blood cell counting machine. The results showed that the new dietary supplement reduced the level of hematocrit and platelets in the studied rats. The healthy and live food supplement at a concentration of 50 mg / kg increased blood levels compared to the control group. The results of this study showed that the use of healthy and live food supplement increased blood factors compared to the control group.

Abstract:
While hydrodynamic coupling has long been considered essential for synchronisation of eukaryotic flagella, recent experiments on the unicellular biflagellate model organism {\it Chlamydomonas} demonstrate that -- at the single cell level -- intracellular mechanical coupling is necessary for coordination. It is therefore unclear what role, if any, hydrodynamic forces actually play in the synchronisation of multiple flagella within individual cells, arguably the building block of large scale coordination. Here we address this question experimentally by transiently blocking hydrodynamic coupling between the two flagella of single {\it Chlamydomonas}. Our results reveal that in wild type cells intracellularly-mediated forces are necessary and sufficient for flagellar synchronisation, with hydrodynamic coupling causing minimal changes in flagellar dynamics. However, fluid-mediated ciliary coupling is responsible for the extended periods of anti-phase synchronisation observed in a mutant with weaker intracellular coupling. At the single-cell level, therefore, flagellar coordination depends on a subtle balance between intracellular and extracellular forces.

Abstract:
Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens is a nitrogen-fixing symbiont of soybean, worldwide used as biofertilizer. This soil bacterium possesses two flagellar systems enabling it to swim in water-saturated soils. However, the motility in soil pores, which may be crucial for competitiveness for root nodulation, is difficult to predict. To address this gap, we fabricated microfluidic devices with networks of connected microchannels surrounding grains. In them, we directly visualise bacterial behaviour in transparent geometries mimicking minimalist soils-on-a-chip (SOCs). We measured the population velocities and changes of direction for two strains: the wild-type and a mutant with only a subpolar flagellum. A detailed statistical analysis revealed that both strains exhibited reduced speeds and increased changes of direction of 180$^\circ$, in channels of decreasing cross sectional area, down to a few microns in width. Interestingly, while the wild-type strain displayed faster swimming in unconfined spaces, this advantage was negated in the SOCs with the narrowest microchannels. We employed the measured motility parameters to propose a realistic model and simulate B. diazoefficiens confined dynamics being able to reproduce their behaviour, which additionally can be extended enabling further predictions for long time and macro scales. This multidisciplinary work, combining design, microfabrication, microbiology and modelling, offers useful methods to study soil bacteria and may be readily extended to other beneficial/harmful soil species.

Abstract:
In this study, we present a stochastic simulation model designed to explicitly incorporate cell cycle length, overcoming limitations associated with classical compartmental models. Our approach employs a delay mechanism to represent the cell cycle, allowing the use of arbitrary distributions for cell cycle lengths. We demonstrate the feasibility of our model by fitting it to experimental data from melanoma cell lines previously studied by Vittadello et al. Notably, our model successfully replicates experimentally observed synchronization phenomena that multi-stage models could not adequately explain. By using a gamma distribution to model cell cycle lengths, we achieved excellent agreement between our simulations and empirical data, while significantly reducing computational complexity and parameter estimation challenges inherent in multi-stage approaches. Our results highlight the importance of explicitly incorporating cell cycle lengths in modeling cell populations, with potential implications for optimizing cell cycle-dependent tumor therapies.

Abstract:
The development of biologically interpretable and explainable models remains a key challenge in computational pathology, particularly for multistain immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis. We present BioX-CPath, an explainable graph neural network architecture for whole slide image (WSI) classification that leverages both spatial and semantic features across multiple stains. At its core, BioX-CPath introduces a novel Stain-Aware Attention Pooling (SAAP) module that generates biologically meaningful, stain-aware patient embeddings. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on both Rheumatoid Arthritis and Sjogren's Disease multistain datasets. Beyond performance metrics, BioX-CPath provides interpretable insights through stain attention scores, entropy measures, and stain interaction scores, that permit measuring model alignment with known pathological mechanisms. This biological grounding, combined with strong classification performance, makes BioX-CPath particularly suitable for clinical applications where interpretability is key.

Abstract:
Biological transport networks adapt through dynamic interactions between material transport and structural modification during growth and development. In this work, we present a model of transport network growth driven by local material concentration. Using an advection-diffusion framework on a metric graph with a tip growth rule, we investigate how successive construction and destruction influence network development. Our results reveal that while repeated cycles of elongation and retraction can facilitate growth enhancement, a network need to have a structure that mitigates material dissipation. This finding suggests that additional regulatory mechanisms are necessary for networks to efficiently redistribute resources following structural retraction.

Abstract:
High Content Screening (HCS) microscopy datasets have transformed the ability to profile cellular responses to genetic and chemical perturbations, enabling cell-based inference of drug-target interactions (DTI). However, the adoption of representation learning methods for HCS data has been hindered by the lack of accessible datasets and robust benchmarks. To address this gap, we present RxRx3-core, a curated and compressed subset of the RxRx3 dataset, and an associated DTI benchmarking task. At just 18GB, RxRx3-core significantly reduces the size barrier associated with large-scale HCS datasets while preserving critical data necessary for benchmarking representation learning models against a zero-shot DTI prediction task. RxRx3-core includes 222,601 microscopy images spanning 736 CRISPR knockouts and 1,674 compounds at 8 concentrations. RxRx3-core is available on HuggingFace and Polaris, along with pre-trained embeddings and benchmarking code, ensuring accessibility for the research community. By providing a compact dataset and robust benchmarks, we aim to accelerate innovation in representation learning methods for HCS data and support the discovery of novel biological insights.

Abstract:
Morphogenesis of complex body shapes is reproducible despite the noise inherent in the underlying morphogenetic processes. However, how these morphogenetic processes work together to achieve this reproducibility remains unclear. Here, we ask how morphogenetic reproducibility is realised by developing a computational model that evolves complex morphologies. We find that evolved, complex morphologies are reproducible in a sizeable fraction of simulations, despite no direct selection for reproducibility. Strikingly, reproducible morphologies had also evolved stem-cell systems. We show that reproducibility is caused by a morphogenetic division of labour based on these stem-cell systems, where moving, dividing stem cells ``shape'' morphologies and irreversibly differentiate into stationary, non-dividing cells. These results suggest that stem-cell systems observed in natural development play fundamental roles in morphogenesis in addition to their known role of producing specialised cell types. This previously-unrecognised role of stem-cell systems has major implications for our understanding of how morphologies are generated and regenerated.

Abstract:
A mathematical model of atherosclerosis of a blood vessel is advanced with regard for the entry of low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) into blood. For the first time, the influence of cytokines on the inflammation of a blood vessel at the formation of atherosclerotic plaques is taken into account. With the help of the expansion in a Fourier series and the calculation of an invariant measure, the scenario of the appearance of strange attractors depending on a change in the parameter of the dissipation of cholesterol is studied. The conclusion is made about the interconnection of the dynamics of the metabolic process in a blood vascular system and its physical state.

Abstract:
Tumor-associated macrophages are a key component that contributes to the immunosuppressive microenvironment in human cancers. However, therapeutic targeting of macrophages has been a challenge in clinic due to the limited understanding of their heterogeneous subpopulations and distinct functions. Here, we identify a unique and clinically relevant CD19$^+$ subpopulation of macrophages that is enriched in many types of cancer, particularly in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The CD19$^+$ macrophages exhibit increased levels of PD-L1 and CD73, enhanced mitochondrial oxidation, and compromised phagocytosis, indicating their immunosuppressive functions. Targeting CD19$^+$ macrophages with anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cells inhibited HCC tumor growth. We identify PAX5 as a primary driver of up-regulated mitochondrial biogenesis in CD19$^+$ macrophages, which depletes cytoplasmic Ca$^{2+}$, leading to lysosomal deficiency and consequent accumulation of CD73 and PD-L1. Inhibiting CD73 or mitochondrial oxidation enhanced the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade therapy in treating HCC, suggesting great promise for CD19$^+$ macrophage-targeting therapeutics.

Spherical multi-layered structures are prevalent in numerous biological systems and engineered applications, including tumor spheroids, layered tissues, and multi-shell nanoparticles for targeted drug delivery. Despite their widespread occurrence, there remains a gap in modeling particle propagation through these complex structures from a molecular communication (MC) perspective. This paper introduces a generalized analytical framework for modeling diffusion-based molecular communication in multi-layered spherical environments. The framework is capable of supporting an arbitrary number of layers and flexible transmitter-receiver positioning. As an example, the detailed formulation is presented for the three-layer sphere, which is particularly relevant for different biological models such as tumor spheroids. The analytical results are validated using particle-based simulation (PBS) in scenarios that have short inter-layer distances. The findings reveal that the characteristics of each layer significantly impact molecule propagation throughout the entire structure, making their consideration crucial for designing targeted therapies and optimizing drug delivery systems.

Abstract:
Scientific research demands sophisticated reasoning over multimodal data, a challenge especially prevalent in biology. Despite recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for AI-assisted research, existing multimodal reasoning benchmarks only target up to college-level difficulty, while research-level benchmarks emphasize lower-level perception, falling short of the complex multimodal reasoning needed for scientific discovery. To bridge this gap, we introduce MicroVQA, a visual-question answering (VQA) benchmark designed to assess three reasoning capabilities vital in research workflows: expert image understanding, hypothesis generation, and experiment proposal. MicroVQA consists of 1,042 multiple-choice questions (MCQs) curated by biology experts across diverse microscopy modalities, ensuring VQA samples represent real scientific practice. In constructing the benchmark, we find that standard MCQ generation methods induce language shortcuts, motivating a new two-stage pipeline: an optimized LLM prompt structures question-answer pairs into MCQs; then, an agent-based `RefineBot' updates them to remove shortcuts. Benchmarking on state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal a peak performance of 53\%; models with smaller LLMs only slightly underperform top models, suggesting that language-based reasoning is less challenging than multimodal reasoning; and tuning with scientific articles enhances performance. Expert analysis of chain-of-thought responses shows that perception errors are the most frequent, followed by knowledge errors and then overgeneralization errors. These insights highlight the challenges in multimodal scientific reasoning, showing MicroVQA is a valuable resource advancing AI-driven biomedical research.

Abstract:
Understanding and manipulating bioelectric signaling could present a new wave of progress in developmental biology, regenerative medicine, and synthetic biology. Bioelectric signals, defined as voltage gradients across cell membranes caused by ionic movements, play a role in regulating crucial processes including cellular differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and tissue morphogenesis. Recent studies demonstrate the ability to modulate these signals to achieve controlled tissue regeneration and morphological outcomes in organisms such as planaria and frogs. However, significant knowledge gaps remain, particularly in predicting and controlling the spatial and temporal dynamics of membrane potentials (V_mem), understanding their regulatory roles in tissue and organ development, and exploring their therapeutic potential in diseases. In this work we propose an experiment using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework together with lab automation techniques for real-time manipulation of bioelectric signals to guide tissue regeneration and morphogenesis. The proposed framework should interact continuously with biological systems, adapting strategies based on direct biological feedback. Combining DRL with real-time measurement techniques -- such as optogenetics, voltage-sensitive dyes, fluorescent reporters, and advanced microscopy -- could provide a comprehensive platform for precise bioelectric control, leading to improved understanding of bioelectric mechanisms in morphogenesis, quantitative bioelectric models, identification of minimal experimental setups, and advancements in bioelectric modulation techniques relevant to regenerative medicine and cancer therapy. Ultimately, this research aims to utilize bioelectric signaling to develop new biomedical and bioengineering applications.

Abstract:
Accurate gradient sensing is crucial for efficient chemotaxis in noisy environments, but the relationship between cell shape deformations and sensing accuracy is not well understood. Using a theoretical framework based on maximum likelihood estimation, we show that the receptor dispersion, quantified by cell shape convex hull, fundamentally limits gradient sensing accuracy. Cells with a concave shape and isotropic error space achieve optimal performance in gradient detection. This concave shape, resulting from active protrusions or contractions, can significantly improve gradient sensing accuracy at the cost of increased energy expenditure. By balancing sensing accuracy and deformation cost, we predict that a concave, three-branched shape as optimal for cells in shallow gradients. To achieve efficient chemotaxis, our theory suggests that a cell should adopt a repeating "run-and-expansion" cycle. Our theoretical predictions align well with experimental observations, implying that the fast amoeboid cell motion is optimized near the physical limit for chemotaxis. This study highlights the crucial role of active cell shape deformation in facilitating accurate chemotaxis.

Abstract:
Groups of cells, including clusters of cancerous cells, multicellular organisms, and developing organs, may both grow and break apart. What physical factors control these fractures? In these processes, what sets the eventual size of clusters? We first develop a one-dimensional framework for understanding cell clusters that can fragment due to cell motility using an active particle model. We compute analytically how the break rate of cell-cell junctions depends on cell speed, cell persistence, and cell-cell junction properties. Next, we find the cluster size distributions, which differ depending on whether all cells can divide or only the cells on the edge of the cluster divide. Cluster size distributions depend solely on the ratio of the break rate to the growth rate - allowing us to predict how cluster size and variability depend on cell motility and cell-cell mechanics. Our results suggest that organisms can achieve better size control when cell division is restricted to the cluster boundaries or when fracture can be localized to the cluster center. Additionally, we derive a universal survival probability for an intact cluster $S(t)=\mathrm{e}^{-k_d t}$ at steady state if all cells can divide, which is independent of the rupture kinetics and depends solely on the cell division rate $k_d$. Finally, we further corroborate the one-dimensional analytics with two-dimensional simulations, finding quantitative agreement with some elements of the theory across a wide range of cell motility. Our results link the general physics problem of a collective active escape over a barrier to size control, providing a quantitative measure of how motility can regulate organ or organism size.

Abstract:
Escherichia coli has long been a trusty companion, maintaining health in our guts and advancing biological knowledge in the laboratory. In light of recent findings, we discuss multicellular self-organization in E. coli and develop general ideas for multicellularity, including the necessity for multicellular dynamics and interpretation by dynamic graphs, applicable to both unicellular and multicellular organisms. In this context, we next discuss the documented behaviors of E. coli self-organization (rosette formation, multicellular extension, and attached dormancy) and two potential behaviors (internal communication and mating). Finally, by comparing the dynamic graphs for different communities, we develop principles relevant to the theory of multicellularity.

Abstract:
Diverse organisms exploit the geomagnetic field (GMF) for migration. Migrating birds employ an intrinsically quantum mechanical mechanism for detecting the geomagnetic field: absorption of a blue photon generates a radical pair whose two electrons precess at different rates in the magnetic field, thereby sensitizing cells to the direction of the GMF. In this work, using an in vitro injury model, we discovered a quantum-based mechanism of cellular migration. Specifically, we show that migrating cells detect the GMF via an optically activated, electron spin-based mechanism. Cell injury provokes acute emission of blue photons, and these photons sensitize muscle progenitor cells to the magnetic field. We show that the magnetosensitivity of muscle progenitor cells is (a) activated by blue light, but not by green or red light, and (b) disrupted by the application of an oscillatory field at the frequency corresponding to the energy of the electron-spin/magnetic field interaction. A comprehensive analysis of protein expression reveals that the ability of blue photons to promote cell motility is mediated by activation of calmodulin calcium sensors. Collectively, these data suggest that cells possess a light-dependent magnetic compass driven by electron spin dynamics.

Abstract:
Fibroblast cells play a key role in maintaining the extracellular matrix. During wound healing, fibroblasts differentiate into highly contractile myofibroblasts, which secrete extracellular matrix proteins like collagen to facilitate tissue repair. Under normal conditions, myofibroblasts undergo programmed cell death after healing to prevent excessive scar formation. However, in diseases like fibrosis, the myofibroblasts remain active even after the wound is closed, resulting in excessive collagen buildup and a stiff, fibrotic matrix. The reasons for the persistence of myofibroblasts in fibrosis are not well understood. Here we show the existence of a mechanism where direct physical contact between a fibroblast and a myofibroblast is sufficient for fibroblasts to transition into myofibroblasts. We show that fibroblast-myofibroblast transition can occur even in the absence of known biochemical cues such as growth factor activation or mechanical cues from a stiff, fibrotic matrix. Further, we show that contact-based fibroblast-myofibroblast activation can be blocked by Gαq/11/14 inhibitor FR9003591, which inhibits the formation of myofibroblasts. These findings offer new insights into the persistence of fibrosis despite therapeutic interventions and suggest a potential strategy to target fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition in fibrosis.

Abstract:
G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) represent a diverse and vital family of membrane proteins that mediate intracellular signaling in response to extracellular stimuli, playing critical roles in physiology and disease. Traditionally recognized as chemical signal transducers, GPCRs have recently been implicated in mechanotransduction, the process of converting mechanical stimuli into cellular responses. This review explores the emerging role of GPCRs in sensing and responding to mechanical forces, with a particular focus on the cardiovascular system. Cardiovascular homeostasis is heavily influenced by mechanical forces such as shear stress, cyclic stretch, and pressure, which are central to both normal physiology and the pathogenesis of diseases like hypertension and atherosclerosis. GPCRs, including the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) and the \b{eta}2-adrenergic receptor (\b{eta}2-AR), have demonstrated the ability to integrate mechanical and chemical signals, potentially through conformational changes and/or modulation of lipid interactions, leading to biased signaling. Recent studies highlight the dual activation mechanisms of GPCRs, with \b{eta}2-AR now serving as a key example of how mechanical and ligand-dependent pathways contribute to cardiovascular regulation. This review synthesizes current knowledge of GPCR mechanosensitivity, emphasizing its implications for cardiovascular health and disease, and explores advancements in methodologies poised to further unravel the mechanistic intricacies of these receptors.

Abstract:
Despite advances in methods to interrogate tumor biology, the observational and population-based approach of classical cancer research and clinical oncology does not enable anticipation of tumor outcomes to hasten the discovery of cancer mechanisms and personalize disease management. To address these limitations, individualized cancer forecasts have been shown to predict tumor growth and therapeutic response, inform treatment optimization, and guide experimental efforts. These predictions are obtained via computer simulations of mathematical models that are constrained with data from a patient's cancer and experiments. This book chapter addresses the validation of these mathematical models to forecast tumor growth and treatment response. We start with an overview of mathematical modeling frameworks, model selection techniques, and fundamental metrics. We then describe the usual strategies employed to validate cancer forecasts in preclinical and clinical scenarios. Finally, we discuss existing barriers in validating these predictions along with potential strategies to address them.

Abstract:
A novel trait-structured Keller-Segel model that explores the dynamics of a migrating cell population guided by chemotaxis in response to an external ligand concentration is derived and analysed. Unlike traditional Keller-Segel models, this framework introduces an explicit representation of ligand-receptor bindings on the cell membrane, where the percentage of occupied receptors constitutes the trait that influences cellular phenotype. The model posits that the cell's phenotypic state directly modulates its capacity for chemotaxis and proliferation, governed by a trade-off due to a finite energy budget: cells highly proficient in chemotaxis exhibit lower proliferation rates, while more proliferative cells show diminished chemotactic abilities. The model is derived from the principles of a biased random walk, resulting in a system of two non-local partial differential equations, describing the densities of both cells and ligands. Using a Hopf-Cole transformation, we derive an equation that characterises the distribution of cellular traits within travelling wave solutions for the total cell density, allowing us to uncover the monotonicity properties of these waves. Numerical investigations are conducted to examine the model's behaviour across various biological scenarios, providing insights into the complex interplay between chemotaxis, proliferation, and phenotypic diversity in migrating cell populations.

Abstract:
Ferroptosis, a regulated form of cell death driven by oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation, has emerged as a pivotal research focus with implications across various cellular contexts. In this study, we employed a multifaceted approach, integrating label-free Raman spectroscopy and microfluidics to study the mechanisms underpinning ferroptosis. Our investigations included the ferroptosis initiation based on the changes in the lipid Raman band at 1436 cm-1 under different cellular states, the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxidation, DNA damage/repair, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Importantly, our work highlighted the dynamic role of vital cellular components, such as NADPH, ferredoxin clusters, and key genes like GPX-4, VDAC2, and NRF2, as they collectively influenced cellular responses to redox imbalance and oxidative stress. Quantum mechanical (QM) and molecular docking simulations (MD) provided further evidence of interactions between the ferredoxin (containing 4Fe-4S clusters), NADPH and ROS which led to the production of reactive Fe species in the cells. As such, our approach offered a real-time, multidimensional perspective on ferroptosis, surpassing traditional biological methods, and providing valuable insights for therapeutic interventions in diverse biomedical contexts.

Abstract:
Breast cancer cell lines are indispensable tools for unraveling disease mechanisms, enabling drug discovery, and developing personalized treatments, yet their heterogeneity and inconsistent classification pose significant challenges in model selection and data reproducibility. This review aims at providing a comprehensive and user-friendly framework for broadly mapping the features of breast cancer types and commercially available human breast cancer cell lines, defining absolute criteria, i.e. objective features such as origin (e.g., MDA-MB, MCF), histological subtype (ductal, lobular), hormone receptor status (ER/PR/HER2), and genetic mutations (BRCA1, TP53), and relative criteria, which contextualize functional behaviors like metastatic potential, drug sensitivity, and genomic instability. It then examines how the proposed framework could be applied to cell line screening in advanced and emerging disease models. By supporting better informed choices, this work aims to improve experimental design and strengthen the connection between in vitro breast cancer studies and their clinical translation.

Abstract:
Hair cells actively drive oscillations of their mechanosensitive organelles--the hair bundles that enable hearing and balance sensing in vertebrates. Why and how some hair cells expend energy by sustaining this oscillatory motion in order to fulfill their function as signal sensors and others--as amplifiers, remains unknown. We develop a stochastic thermodynamic theory to describe energy flows in a periodically-driven hair bundle. Our analysis of thermodynamic fluxes associated with hair bundles' motion and external sinusoidal stimulus reveals that these organelles operate as thermodynamic work-to-work machines under different operational modes. One operational mode transduces the signal's power into the cell, whereas another allows the external stimulus to harvest the energy supplied by the cell. These two regimes might represent thermodynamic signatures of signal sensing and amplification respectively. In addition to work transduction and energy harvesting, our model also substantiates the capability of hair-cell bundles to operate as heaters and, at the expense of external driving, as active feedback refrigerators. We quantify the performance and robustness of the work-to-work conversion by hair bundles, whose efficiency in some conditions exceeds 80 % of the applied power.

Abstract:
Myosin II molecular motors slide actin filaments relatively to each other and are essential for force generation, motility and mechanosensing in animal cells. For non-muscle cells, evolution has resulted in three different isoforms, which have different properties concerning the motor cycle and also occur in different abundances in the cells, but their respective biological and physical roles are not fully understood. Here we use active gel theory to demonstrate the complementary roles of isoforms A and B for cell migration. We first show that our model can be derived both from coarse-graining kinetic equations and from nonequilibrium thermodynamics as the macroscopic limit of a two-component Tonks gas. We then parametrize the model and show that motile solutions exist, in which the more abundant and more dynamic isoform A is localized to the front and the stronger isoform B to the rear, in agreement with experiments. Exploring parameter space beyond the isoform parameters typical for animal cells, we also find cell oscillations in length and velocity, which might be realized for genetically engineered systems. We also describe an analytical solution for the stiff limit, which then is used to calculate a state diagram, and the effect of actin polymerization at the boundaries, that leads to an imperfect pitchfork bifurcation. Our findings highlight the importance of including isoform-specific molecular details to describe whole cell behavior.

Abstract:
Building a virtual cell capable of accurately simulating cellular behaviors in silico has long been a dream in computational biology. We introduce CellFlux, an image-generative model that simulates cellular morphology changes induced by chemical and genetic perturbations using flow matching. Unlike prior methods, CellFlux models distribution-wise transformations from unperturbed to perturbed cell states, effectively distinguishing actual perturbation effects from experimental artifacts such as batch effects -- a major challenge in biological data. Evaluated on chemical (BBBC021), genetic (RxRx1), and combined perturbation (JUMP) datasets, CellFlux generates biologically meaningful cell images that faithfully capture perturbation-specific morphological changes, achieving a 35% improvement in FID scores and a 12% increase in mode-of-action prediction accuracy over existing methods. Additionally, CellFlux enables continuous interpolation between cellular states, providing a potential tool for studying perturbation dynamics. These capabilities mark a significant step toward realizing virtual cell modeling for biomedical research. Project page: https://yuhui-zh15.github.io/CellFlux/.

Abstract:
Predicting the future evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 remains a critical challenge, particularly due to the pivotal role of spike protein mutations. It is therefore essential to develop evolutionary models capable of continuously integrating new experimental data. In this study, we employ a cladogram algorithm that incorporates established assumptions for mutant representation -- using both four-letter and two-letter formats -- along with an n-mer distance algorithm to construct a cladogenetic tree of SARS-CoV-2 mutations. This tree accurately captures the observed changes across macro-lineages. We introduce a stochastic method for generating new strains on this tree based on spike protein mutations. For a given set A of existing mutation sites, we define a set X comprising x randomly generated mutation sites on the spike protein. The intersection of A and X, denoted as set Y, contains y sites. Our analysis indicates that the position of a generated strain on the tree is primarily determined by x. Through large-scale stochastic sampling, we predict the emergence of new macro-lineages. As x increases, the dominance among macro-lineages shifts: lineage O surpasses N, P surpasses O, and eventually Q surpasses P. We identify threshold values of x that delineate transitions between these macro-lineages. Furthermore, we propose an algorithm for predicting the timeline of macro-lineage emergence. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 evolution adheres to statistical principles: the emergence of new strains can be driven by randomly generated spike protein sites, and large-scale stochastic sampling reveals evolutionary patterns underlying the rise of distinct macro-lineages.

Abstract:
In recent years, deep learning models have been extensively applied to biological data across various modalities. Discriminative deep learning models have excelled at classifying images into categories (e.g., healthy versus diseased, treated versus untreated). However, these models are often perceived as black boxes due to their complexity and lack of interpretability, limiting their application in real-world biological contexts. In biological research, explainability is essential: understanding classifier decisions and identifying subtle differences between conditions are critical for elucidating the effects of treatments, disease progression, and biological processes. To address this challenge, we propose DiffEx, a method for generating visually interpretable attributes to explain classifiers and identify microscopic cellular variations between different conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DiffEx in explaining classifiers trained on natural and biological images. Furthermore, we use DiffEx to uncover phenotypic differences within microscopy datasets. By offering insights into cellular variations through classifier explanations, DiffEx has the potential to advance the understanding of diseases and aid drug discovery by identifying novel biomarkers.

Abstract:
White blood cells (WBC) are important parts of our immune system, and they protect our body against infections by eliminating viruses, bacteria, parasites and fungi. The number of WBC types and the total number of WBCs provide important information about our health status. A traditional method, convolutional neural networks (CNN), a deep learning architecture, can classify the blood cell from a part of an object and perform object recognition. Various CNN models exhibit potential; however, their development often involves ad-hoc processes that neglect unnecessary layers, leading to issues with unbalanced datasets and insufficient data augmentation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel ensemble approach that integrates three CNN architectures, each uniquely configured with different dropout and max-pooling layer settings to enhance feature learning. This ensemble model, named DCENWCNet, effectively balances the bias-variance trade-off. When evaluated on the widely recognized Rabbin-WBC dataset, our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art networks, achieving highest mean accuracy. Additionally, it demonstrates superior performance in precision, recall, F1-score, and Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) across all categories. To delve deeper into the interpretability of classifiers, we employ reliable post-hoc explanation techniques, including Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME). These methods approximate the behavior of a black-box model by elucidating the relationships between feature values and predictions. Interpretable results enable users to comprehend and validate the model's predictions, thereby increasing their confidence in the automated diagnosis.

Abstract:
Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the artery wall. The early stages of atherosclerosis are driven by interactions between lipids and monocyte-derived-macrophages (MDMs). The mechanisms that govern the spatial distribution of lipids and MDMs in the lesion remain poorly understood. In this paper, we develop a spatially-resolved and lipid-structured model for early atherosclerosis. The model development and analysis are guided by images of human coronary lesions by Nakashima et al. 2007. Consistent with their findings, the model predicts that lipid initially accumulates deep in the intima due to a spatially non-uniform LDL retention capacity. The model also qualitatively reproduces the global internal maxima in the Nakashima images only when the MDM mobility is sufficiently sensitive to lipid content, and MDM lifespan sufficiently insensitive. Introducing lipid content-dependence to MDM mobility and mean lifespan produced minimal impact on model behaviour at early times, but strongly impacted lesion composition at steady state. Increases to the sensitivity of MDM lifespan to lipid content yield lesions with fewer MDMs, less total lesion lipid content and reduced mean MDM infiltration depth. Increases to the sensitivity of MDM mobility to lipid content also reduces the MDM infiltration depth, but increases the proportion of lipid-laden MDMs. We find that MDM lipid content increases with spatial depth, regardless of blood LDL and HDL content. These results shed light on the mechanisms that drive spatial variation in the composition of early atherosclerotic lesions, and the role of macrophage lipid content in disease progression.

Abstract:
Single-cell RNA-sequencing captures a temporal slice, or a snapshot, of a cell differentiation process. A major bioinformatical challenge is the inference of differentiation trajectories from a single snapshot, and methods that account for outlier cells that are unrelated to the differentiation process have yet to be established. We present MultistageOT: a Multistage Optimal Transport-based framework for trajectory inference in a snapshot (https://github.com/dahlinlab/MultistageOT). Application of optimal transport has proven successful for many single-cell tasks, but classical bimarginal optimal transport for trajectory inference fails to model temporal progression in a snapshot. Representing a novel generalization of optimal transport, MultistageOT addresses this major limitation by introducing a temporal dimension, allowing for high resolution modeling of intermediate differentiation stages. We challenge MultistageOT with snapshot data of cell differentiation, demonstrating effectiveness in pseudotime ordering, detection of outliers, and significantly improved fate prediction accuracy over state-of-the-art.

Abstract:
Objective: Identifying the activity of motor neurons (MNs) non-invasively is possible by decomposing signals from muscles, e.g., surface electromyography (EMG) or ultrasound. The theoretical background of MN identification is convolutive blind source separation (cBSS), and different algorithms have been developed and validated. Yet, the existence and identifiability of inverse solutions and the corresponding estimation errors are not fully understood. Further, the guidelines for selecting appropriate parameters are often built on empirical observations, limiting the translation to clinical applications and other modalities. Approach: We revisited the cBSS model for MN identification, augmented it with new theoretical insights and derived a framework that can predict the existence of inverse solutions. This framework allows the quantification of estimation errors due to the imperfect inversion of the motor unit action potentials (MUAP), noise sources, and the ill-conditioning of the inverse problem. To bridge the gap between theory and practice, we used computer simulations. Main results: (1) Increasing the similarity of MUAPs or correlation between spike trains increases the bias for detecting high amplitude MUs. (2) The optimal objective function depends on the expected spike amplitude, spike amplitude statistics and the amplitude of background spikes. (3) There is some wiggle room for MN detection given non-stationary MUAPs. (4) There is no connection between MUAP duration and extension factor, in contrast to previous guidelines. (5) Source quality metrics like the silhouette score (SIL) or the pulse-to-noise ratio (PNR) are highly correlated with a source's objective function output. (6) SIL is superior to PNR. Significance: These findings will guide cBSS algorithm developments tailored to MN identification and clinical application translation.

Abstract:
Ever since the ground breaking work of Trepat et al. in 2009, we know that cell colonies growing on a substrate can be under tensile mechanical stress. The origin of tension has so far been attributed to cellular motility forces being oriented outward of the colony. Works in the field mainly revolve around how this orientation of the forces can be explained, ranging from velocity alignment, self-sorting due to self-propulsion, to kenotaxis. In this work, we demonstrate that tension in growing colonies can also be explained without cellular motility forces! Using a combination of well established tissue growth simulation technique and analytical modelling, we show how tension can arise as a consequence of simple mechanics of growing tissues. Combining these models with a minimalistic motility model shows how colonies can expand while under even larger tension. Furthermore, our results and analytical models provide novel analysis procedures to identify the underlying mechanics.

Abstract:
As the next step in extraterrestrial exploration, many engineers and scientists around the country revealed their intense interest to enable multiplanetary human life, including colonizing Mars. This study proposes that architecture on Mars can be realized by a synthetic lichen system, composed of diazotrophic cyanobacteria and filamentous fungi, which produce abundant biominerals and biopolymers to bond Martian regolith into consolidated building blocks. These self-growing building blocks can be assembled into a wide range of structures. Diazotrophic cyanobacteria will 1) fix carbon dioxide and dinitrogen from the atmosphere and convert them into oxygen and organic carbon and nitrogen sources to support filamentous fungi; and 2) give rise to high concentrations of carbonate ions because of photosynthetic activities. Filamentous fungi will 1) bind metal ions onto fungal cell walls and serve as nucleation sites to promote biomineral precipitates; and 2) assist the survival and growth of cyanobacteria by providing them water, minerals, additional carbon dioxide, and protection. This report presents the major progress of the project. It has been tested and confirmed that such co-culture systems can be created, and they grow very well solely on Martian regolith simulants, air, light, and an inorganic liquid medium without any additional carbon or nitrogen sources. The cyanobacterial and fungal growth in such co-culture systems is significantly better than their axenic growth due to mutual interactions. The amounts and morphologies of the precipitated crystals vary remarkably depending on the cultivation condition.

Abstract:
Epithelial cells form diverse structures from squamous spherical organoids to densely packed pseudostratified tissues. Quantification of cellular properties in these contexts requires high-resolution deep imaging and computational techniques to achieve truthful three-dimensional (3D) structural features. Here, we describe a detailed step-by-step protocol for sample preparation, imaging and deep-learning-assisted cell segmentation to achieve accurate quantification of fluorescently labelled individual cells in 3D within live tissues. We share the lessons learned through troubleshooting 3D imaging of Drosophila wing discs, including considerations on the choice of microscopy modality and settings (objective, sample mounting) and available segmentation methods. In addition, we include a computational pipeline alongside custom code to assist replication of the protocol. While we focus on the segmentation of cell outlines from membrane labelling, this protocol applies to a wide variety of samples, and we believe it be valuable for studying other tissues that demand complex analysis in 3D.

Abstract:
Active movement is essential for the survival of microorganisms like bacteria, algae and unicellular parasites. In three dimensions, both swimming and gliding microorganisms often exhibit helical trajectories. One such case are malaria parasites gliding through 3D hydrogels, for which we find that the internal correlation time for the stochastic process generating propulsion is similar to the time taken for one helical turn. Motivated by this experimental finding, here we theoretically analyze the case of finite internal correlation time for microorganisms with helical trajectories as chiral active particles with an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process for torque. We present an analytical solution which is in very good agreement with computer simulations. We then show that for this type of internal noise, chirality and rotation increase the persistence of motion and results in helical trajectories that have a larger long-time mean squared displacement than straight trajectories at the same propulsion speed. Finally we provide experimental evidence for this prediction for the case of the malaria parasites.

Abstract:
Intracellular networks process cellular-level information and control cell fate. They can be computationally modeled using Boolean networks, which are implicit-time causal models of discrete binary events. These networks can be embedded in computational agents to drive cellular behavior. To explore this integration, we construct a set of candidate interventions that induce apoptosis in a cell-survival network of a rare leukemia using exhaustive search simulation, stable motif control, and an individual-based mean field approach (IBMFA). Due to inherent algorithmic limitations, these interventions are most suitable for cell-level determinations, not the more realistic multicellular setting. To address these limitations, we treat the target control solutions as putative targets for therapeutic interventions and develop a pipeline to translate them to continuous-time multicellular, agent-based models. We set the discrete-to-continuous transitions between the Boolean network and multicellular model via thresholding and produce simple computational simulations designed to emulate situations in experimental and translational biology. These include a series of simulations: constant substrate gradients, global substrate pulses, and time-varying boundary conditions. We find that interventions that perform equally well in the implicit-time single-cell setting are separable in the multiscale setting in ability to impact population growth and spatial distribution. Further analysis shows that the population and spatial distribution differences arise from differences in internal dynamics (stable motif controls versus target controls) and network distance between the intervention and output nodes. This proof of concept work demonstrates the importance of accounting for internal dynamics in multicellular simulations as well as impacts on understanding of Boolean network control.

Abstract:
All intelligence is collective intelligence, in the sense that it is made of parts which must align with respect to system-level goals. Understanding the dynamics which facilitate or limit navigation of problem spaces by aligned parts thus impacts many fields ranging across life sciences and engineering. To that end, consider a system on the vertices of a planar graph, with pairwise interactions prescribed by the edges of the graph. Such systems can sometimes exhibit long-range order, distinguishing one phase of macroscopic behaviour from another. In networks of interacting systems we may view spontaneous ordering as a form of self-organisation, modelling neural and basal forms of cognition. Here, we discuss necessary conditions on the topology of the graph for an ordered phase to exist, with an eye towards finding constraints on the ability of a system with local interactions to maintain an ordered target state. By studying the scaling of free energy under the formation of domain walls in three model systems -- the Potts model, autoregressive models, and hierarchical networks -- we show how the combinatorics of interactions on a graph prevent or allow spontaneous ordering. As an application we are able to analyse why multiscale systems like those prevalent in biology are capable of organising into complex patterns, whereas rudimentary language models are challenged by long sequences of outputs.

Abstract:
Formulating quantitative and predictive models for tissue development requires consideration of the complex, stochastic gene expression dynamics, its regulation via cell-to-cell interactions, and cell proliferation. Including all of these processes into a practical mathematical framework requires complex expressions that are difficult to interpret and apply. We construct a simple theory that incorporates intracellular stochastic gene expression dynamics, signaling chemicals that influence these dynamics and mediate cell-cell interactions, and cell proliferation and its accompanying differentiation. Cellular states (genetic and epigenetic) are described by a Waddington vector field that allows for non-gradient dynamics (cycles, entropy production, loss of detailed balance) which is precluded in Waddington potential landscape representations of gene expression dynamics. We define an epigenetic fitness landscape that describes the proliferation of different cell types, and elucidate how this fitness landscape is related to Waddington's vector field. We illustrate the applicability of our framework by analyzing two model systems: an interacting two-gene differentiation process and a spatiotemporal organism model inspired by planaria.

Abstract:
Bacteria can form a great variety of spatially heterogeneous cell density patterns, ranging from simple concentric rings to dynamical spiral waves appearing in growing colonies. These pattern formation phenomena are important as they reflect how cellular processes such as metabolism operate in heterogeneous chemical environments. In the laboratory, they can be studied in simplified set-ups, where spatial gradients of oxygen and nutrients are externally imposed, and cells are immobilized in a gel matrix. An intriguing example, observed in such set-ups over 80 years ago, is the sequential formation of narrow bands of high cell density, taking place even for a clonal population. However, key aspects of the dynamics of band formation remained obscure. Using time-lapse imaging of replicate transparent columns in simplified growth media, we first quantify the precision of the positioning and timing of band formation. We also show that the appearance and position of different bands can be modulated independently. This "modularity" is suggested by the observation that different bands differ in their gene expression, and it is reproduced by a theoretical model based on the existence of internal metabolic states and the induction of a pH gradient. Finally, we can also modify the observed pattern formation by introducing genetic modifications that impair selected metabolic pathways. In our opinion, the possibility of precise measurements and controls, together with the simplicity and richness of the "proliferation pattern formation" phenomenon, can make it a model system to study the response of cellular processes to heterogeneous environments.

Abstract:
Neuroblastoma, is a highly heterogeneous pediatric tumour and is responsible for 15% of pediatric cancer-related deaths. The clinical outcomes can vary from spontaneous regression to high metastatic disease. This extracranial tumour arises from a neural crest-derived cell and can harbor different phenotypes. Its heterogeneity may result from variations in differentiation states influenced by genetic and epigenetic factors and individual patient characteristics. This leads downstream to disruption of homeostasis and a metabolic shift in response to the tumour needs. Nutrition can play a key role in influencing various aspects of a tumour behaviour. This review provides an in-depth exploration of the aetiology of neuroblastoma and the different avenues of disease progression, which can be targeted with individualized nutrition intervention strategies to improve the well-being of children and optimize clinical outcomes.

Abstract:
Large language models excel at interpreting complex natural language instructions, enabling them to perform a wide range of tasks. In the life sciences, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data serves as the "language of cellular biology", capturing intricate gene expression patterns at the single-cell level. However, interacting with this "language" through conventional tools is often inefficient and unintuitive, posing challenges for researchers. To address these limitations, we present InstructCell, a multi-modal AI copilot that leverages natural language as a medium for more direct and flexible single-cell analysis. We construct a comprehensive multi-modal instruction dataset that pairs text-based instructions with scRNA-seq profiles from diverse tissues and species. Building on this, we develop a multi-modal cell language architecture capable of simultaneously interpreting and processing both modalities. InstructCell empowers researchers to accomplish critical tasks-such as cell type annotation, conditional pseudo-cell generation, and drug sensitivity prediction-using straightforward natural language commands. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that InstructCell consistently meets or exceeds the performance of existing single-cell foundation models, while adapting to diverse experimental conditions. More importantly, InstructCell provides an accessible and intuitive tool for exploring complex single-cell data, lowering technical barriers and enabling deeper biological insights.

Abstract:
Recent high-throughput experiments unveil substantial electrophysiological diversity among uncoupled healthy myocytes under identical conditions. To quantify inter-cell variability, the values of a subset of the parameters in a well-regarded mathematical model of the action potential of rabbit ventricular myocytes are estimated from fluorescence voltage measurements of a large number of cells. Statistical inference yields a population of nearly 1200 cell-specific model variants that, on a population-level replicate experimentally measured biomarker ranges and distributions, and in contrast to earlier studies, also match experimental biomarker values on a cell-by-cell basis. This model population may be regarded as a random sample from the phenotype of healthy rabbit ventricular myocytes. Uni-variate and bi-variate joint marginal distributions of the estimated parameters are presented, and the parameter dependencies of several commonly utilised electrophysiological biomarkers are revealed. Parameter values are weakly correlated, while summary metrics such as the action potential duration are not strongly dependent on any single electrophysiological characteristic of the myocyte. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of accurately and efficiently fitting entire action potential waveforms at scale.   Keywords: cellular excitability, rabbit ventricular myocytes, fluorescence voltage measurements, action potential waveform, parameter estimation in differential equations, noisy time series

Abstract:
Plasmonic nanostructures have wide applications in photonics including pathogen detection and diagnosis via Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS). Despite major role plasmonics play in signal enhancement, electrostatics in SERS is yet to be fully understood and harnessed. Here, we perform a systematic study of electrostatic interactions between 785 nm resonant gold nanorods designed to harbor zeta potentials of +29, +16, 0 and -9 mV spanning positive neutral and negative domains. SERS activity is tested on representative Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Gram-positive Staphylococcus epidermidis bacteria with zeta potentials of -30 and -23 mV respectively in water. Raman spectroscopy and Cryo-Electron microscopy reveal that +29, +16, 0 and -9 mV nanorods give SERS enhancement of 7.2X, 3.6X, 4.2X, 1.3X to Staphylococcus epidermidis and 3.9X, 2.8X, 2.9X, 1.1X to Escherichia coli. Theoretical results show that electrostatics play the major role among all interaction forces in determining cell-nanorod proximity and signal enhancement. We identify steric repulsion due to cell protrusions to be the critical opposing force. Finally, a design principle is proposed to estimate the electrostatic strength in SERS. Our work provides new insights into the principle of bacteria-nanorod interactions, enabling reproducible and precise biomolecular readouts, critical for next-generation point-of-care diagnostics and smart healthcare applications.
