Abstract:
Temporal point processes (TPPs) provide a natural mathematical framework for modeling heartbeats due to capturing underlying physiological inductive biases. In this work, we apply density-based neural TPPs to model heartbeat dynamics from 18 subjects. We adapt a goodness-of-fit framework from classical point process literature to Neural TPPs and use it to optimize hyperparameters, identify appropriate training sequence lengths to capture temporal dependencies, and demonstrate zero-shot predictive capability on heartbeat data.

Abstract:
Collective cell flows are a hallmark of tissue dynamics in development, wound healing, and various diseases. Here, we perform experiments on epithelial MDCK cell monolayers, over tens of hours without jamming, on millimeter-scale micropatterned substrates with or without free front (a strip or a closed racetrack). During maturation in time, domains and long-range correlations of the velocity field appear. Enstrophy increases (along with kinetic energy) during 5 hours, then passes through a maximum and decreases. Spatial velocity correlations are scale-free, following a power law, which challenges the notion of a single intrinsic correlation length. It suggests that the monolayer behaves as a critical-like system where information is transmitted across its entire size, a feature consistent with models of active solids capable of long-range stress propagation. The spatial correlation exponent significantly evolves with time, probably reflecting the monolayer maturation. The size, shape, topology and rigidity of patterned substrate influence the organization of flows and mechanical fields. Spontaneous collective motions are stronger on soft than on hard substrate. The presence of a free front accumulates vimentin on a much larger length scale than a fixed boundary ($65\pm 4$~$μ$m vs $3.2 \pm 0.7$~$μ$m), possibly revealing an underlying polarizing cue on the cell velocity field.

Abstract:
Classical models of cancer focus on tumour-intrinsic genetic aberrations and immune dynamics and often overlook how the metabolic environment of healthy tissues shapes tumour development and immune efficacy. Here, we propose that tissue-intrinsic metabolic intensity and waste-handling capacity act as an upstream gatekeeper of anti-tumour immunity, determining whether immune infiltration translates into effective immune function and safeguards the tissue from tumourigenesis. Across human cancers, tumours arising in high-metabolism tissues - like kidney, brain, and eye - tend to show high T cell infiltration but poor prognosis, suggesting pre-existing metabolic environments prior to malignant transformation may undermine immune function. This pattern is mirrored across species: large mammals with lower mass-specific metabolic rates (e.g., elephants, whales) accumulate fewer metabolic byproducts and show lower cancer incidence (Peto's paradox), while long-lived small mammals like bats and naked mole-rats resist tumourigenesis via suppressed glycolysis or altered hypoxia responses leading to lower metabolic rates and/or byproduct accumulation. Through integrative synthesis spanning human single-cell expression data and cross-species comparisons, we outline a framework of 'immunometabolic gatekeeping', where tissues with high metabolic rate and poor waste clearance foster immune-exhausting niches even before transformation. This unifying framework reconciles multiple paradoxes in cancer biology: Peto's paradox, T cell infiltration non-prognosticity, tissue tropisms, and sex-based inequalities, and suggests new principles for identifying high-risk patients and metabolic-immune combination strategies for prevention and treatment. By shifting focus from tumour-intrinsic mutations to host-tissue metabolism, this work offers a novel, integrative lens on cancer vulnerability and immune failure.

Abstract:
Myofascial pain (MP) is a leading cause of chronic low back pain, yet its tissue-level drivers remain poorly defined and lack reliable image biomarkers. Existing studies focus predominantly on muscle while neglecting fascia, fat, and other soft tissues that play integral biomechanical roles. We developed an anatomically grounded explainable artificial intelligence (AI) framework, LAYER (Layer-wise Analysis for Yielding Explainable Relevance Tissue), that analyses six tissue layers in three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound and quantifies their contribution to MP prediction. By utilizing the largest multi-model 3D ultrasound cohort consisting of over 4,000 scans, LAYER reveals that non-muscle tissues contribute substantially to pain prediction. In B-mode imaging, the deep fascial membrane (DFM) showed the highest saliency (0.420), while in combined B-mode and shear-wave images, the collective saliency of non-muscle layers (0.316) nearly matches that of muscle (0.317), challenging the conventional muscle-centric paradigm in MP research and potentially affecting the therapy methods. LAYER establishes a quantitative, interpretable framework for linking layer-specific anatomy to pain physiology, uncovering new tissue targets and providing a generalizable approach for explainable analysis of soft-tissue imaging.

Abstract:
Quantifying the in-plane rheology of epithelial monolayers remains challenging due to the difficulty of imposing controlled shear. We introduce a self-driven, rheometer-like assay in which collective migration generates stationary shear flows, allowing rheological parameters to be inferred directly from image sequences. The assay relies on two sets of ring-shaped fibronectin patches, micropatterned in arrays for high-throughput imaging. Within isolated rings, the epithelial tissue exhibits persistent rotation, from which we infer active migration stresses and substrate friction. Within partially overlapping rings, the tissue exhibits sustained shear, from which we infer the elastic and viscous responses of the cells. The emergence of a Maxwell-like viscoelastic relation -- characterized by a linear relationship between mean cell deformation and neighbor-exchange rate -- is specifically recapitulated within a wet vertex-model framework, which reproduces experimental measurements only when intercellular viscous dissipation is included alongside substrate friction. We apply our method to discriminate the respective roles of two myosin~II isoforms in tissue mechanics. Overall, by harnessing self-generated stresses instead of externally imposed ones, we propose a noninvasive route to rheological inference in migrating epithelial tissues and, more generally, in actively flowing granular materials.

Abstract:
Cervical adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) is a critical premalignant lesion whose accurate histopathological diagnosis is challenging. Early detection is essential to prevent progression to invasive cervical adenocarcinoma. In this study, we developed a deep learning-based virtual pathology assistant capable of distinguishing AIS from normal cervical gland histology using the CAISHI dataset, which contains 2240 expert-labeled H&E images (1010 normal and 1230 AIS). All images underwent Macenko stain normalization and patch-based preprocessing to enhance morphological feature representation. An EfficientNet-B3 convolutional neural network was trained using class-balanced sampling and focal loss to address dataset imbalance and emphasize difficult examples. The final model achieved an overall accuracy of 0.7323, with an F1-score of 0.75 for the Abnormal class and 0.71 for the Normal class. Grad-CAM heatmaps demonstrated biologically interpretable activation patterns, highlighting nuclear atypia and glandular crowding consistent with AIS morphology. The trained model was deployed in a Gradio-based virtual diagnostic assistant. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of lightweight, interpretable AI systems for cervical gland pathology, with potential applications in screening workflows, education, and low-resource settings.

Abstract:
Current acoustic radiation force (ARF) based methods for quantifying tissue elasticity primarily rely on shear wave propagation. However, their spatial resolution is limited by the need for spatial averaging, and their accuracy is affected by shear wave guidance, out of plane reflections, and geometric dispersion, which reduce their applicability in mechanically complex tissues. This study introduces a novel technique called Double Profile Intersection (DoPIo) ultrasound, which enables pointwise estimation of shear elastic modulus within the region of ARF excitation by leveraging the scatterer shearing rate. This rate is inferred by tracking ARF induced displacement using two tracking beams with different lateral widths. The wider beam captures scatterers located outside the ARF excitation region that begin to displace as shearing propagates. The time at which the two resulting displacement profiles intersect is mapped to shear elastic modulus using an empirically derived model based on finite element simulations. In silico, DoPIo estimated shear elastic modulus with a median error of -0.02 kPa and a median absolute deviation of 1.98 kPa in elastic materials up to 35 kPa. Experimental validation in vitro and ex vivo demonstrated that DoPIo reliably distinguished softer regions from stiffer ones, and its modulus estimates remained consistent across varying ARF push amplitudes, provided sufficient displacement estimation signal to noise ratio. DoPIo offers a feasible approach for high resolution, on axis shear elasticity estimation and holds promise as a quantitative biomarker that is independent of ARF amplitude.

Abstract:
Surgical video segmentation is crucial for computer-assisted surgery, enabling precise localization and tracking of instruments and tissues. Interactive Video Object Segmentation (iVOS) models such as Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) provide prompt-based flexibility beyond methods with predefined categories, but face challenges in surgical scenarios due to the domain gap and limited long-term tracking. To address these limitations, we construct SA-SV, the largest surgical iVOS benchmark with instance-level spatio-temporal annotations (masklets) spanning eight procedure types (61k frames, 1.6k masklets), enabling comprehensive development and evaluation for long-term tracking and zero-shot generalization. Building on SA-SV, we propose SAM2S, a foundation model enhancing \textbf{SAM2} for \textbf{S}urgical iVOS through: (1) DiveMem, a trainable diverse memory mechanism for robust long-term tracking; (2) temporal semantic learning for instrument understanding; and (3) ambiguity-resilient learning to mitigate annotation inconsistencies across multi-source datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning on SA-SV enables substantial performance gains, with SAM2 improving by 12.99 average $\mathcal{J}$\&$\mathcal{F}$ over vanilla SAM2. SAM2S further advances performance to 80.42 average $\mathcal{J}$\&$\mathcal{F}$, surpassing vanilla and fine-tuned SAM2 by 17.10 and 4.11 points respectively, while maintaining 68 FPS real-time inference and strong zero-shot generalization.

Abstract:
Quantitative descriptors convert high-dimensional medical images into low-dimensional features capable of differentiating organ shapes that correlate with injury or disease progression for diagnostic purposes. An important example is aortic dissections, which can be imaged using high-resolution CT scans and for which the shape of the true and false lumens of the aorta has long been used to predict disease state and the potential for positive surgical outcomes (namely thoracic endovascular repair or TEVAR). Here we present a method for calculating the topographical pair correlation function (TPCF), a descriptor of the spatial correlation of point estimates for Gaussian curvature, mean curvature, shape index, and bending ratio constrained to the surface of a meshed image. We used the TPCF as a metric to describe aortic shape and extracted quantitative features from the resulting curves. When the TPCF was parameterized by shape index, the area under the curve of the correlation function contributed to a classification accuracy of 0.95 for disease presence and/or impending TEVAR success. Comparison with single-point statistics suggests that the TPCF provides powerful features for classifying the disease state of aortas and more broadly in capturing structural correlations in anatomical data.

Abstract:
Correlating articular cartilage material properties to quantitative magnetic resonance imaging biomarkers is a powerful approach to biofidelic finite element models. However, subject-specific relationships between imaging biomarkers such as T2 and material properties like dynamic modulus are uncertain. To evaluate the sensitivity of finite element models to this uncertainty, we shifted the slope and intercept of a linear T2-dynamic modulus relationship used to define cartilage properties. Modulus shifts led to notable percent changes in the top 1% of calculated stress and strain while modulating slope had a negligible impact, together supporting the use of physiologically relevant moduli ranges in subject-specific models.

Abstract:
Histopathologists establish cancer grade by assessing histological structures, such as glands in prostate cancer. Yet, digital pathology pipelines often rely on grid-based tiling that ignores tissue architecture. This introduces irrelevant information and limits interpretability. We introduce histology-informed tiling (HIT), which uses semantic segmentation to extract glands from whole slide images (WSIs) as biologically meaningful input patches for multiple-instance learning (MIL) and phenotyping. Trained on 137 samples from the ProMPT cohort, HIT achieved a gland-level Dice score of 0.83 +/- 0.17. By extracting 380,000 glands from 760 WSIs across ICGC-C and TCGA-PRAD cohorts, HIT improved MIL models AUCs by 10% for detecting copy number variation (CNVs) in genes related to epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMT) and MYC, and revealed 15 gland clusters, several of which were associated with cancer relapse, oncogenic mutations, and high Gleason. Therefore, HIT improved the accuracy and interpretability of MIL predictions, while streamlining computations by focussing on biologically meaningful structures during feature extraction.

Abstract:
Rapid progress in computational pathology is increasingly driven by vision foundation models pretrained on vast histopathology datasets. While recent efforts have prioritized training on an ever-larger amount of patches, we take an alternative approach focused on data diversity. Our foundation model, Athena, was initialized from a pretrained model and trained on just 115 million tissue patches, several times fewer than recent histopathology foundation models. Rather than relying on patch volume or complex sampling heuristics, we maximize data diversity by randomly selecting only a moderate number of patches per whole-slide image from our diverse internal repository, which spans multiple countries, institutions, and scanner types. Evaluated on a single patch-level benchmark and four slide-level downstream tasks (two molecular and two morphological), Athena approaches the state-of-the-art and even surpasses several models trained on substantially larger datasets. This indicates that diversity across whole-slide images, rather than patch quantity alone, drives learning in histopathology foundation models.

Abstract:
Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is a cardiac electrophysiology (EP) disorder caused by the presence of an accessory pathway (AP) that bypasses the atrioventricular node, faster ventricular activation rate, and provides a substrate for atrio-ventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT). Accurate localization of the AP is critical for planning and guiding catheter ablation procedures. While traditional diagnostic tree (DT) methods and more recent machine learning (ML) approaches have been proposed to predict AP location from surface electrocardiogram (ECG), they are often constrained by limited anatomical localization resolution, poor interpretability, and the use of small clinical datasets. In this study, we present a Deep Learning (DL) model for the localization of single manifest APs across 24 cardiac regions, trained on a large, physiologically realistic database of synthetic ECGs generated using a personalized virtual heart model. We also integrate eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods, Guided Backpropagation, Grad-CAM, and Guided Grad-CAM, into the pipeline. This enables interpretation of DL decision-making and addresses one of the main barriers to clinical adoption: lack of transparency in ML predictions. Our model achieves localization accuracy above 95%, with a sensitivity of 94.32% and specificity of 99.78%. XAI outputs are physiologically validated against known depolarization patterns, and a novel index is introduced to identify the most informative ECG leads for AP localization. Results highlight lead V2 as the most critical, followed by aVF, V1, and aVL. This work demonstrates the potential of combining cardiac digital twins with explainable DL to enable accurate, transparent, and non-invasive AP localization.

Abstract:
Menopause reshapes female physiology, yet its full temporal footprint is obscured by uncertainty in the age of the final menstrual period (FMP). Here we analyse cross-sectional data on 300 million laboratory tests from more than a million women in two population-scale cohorts (Israel-Clalit and US-NHANES). We apply a deconvolution algorithm inspired by astronomical image "de-blurring" to align each test to time-from-FMP rather than chronological age. Nearly every assay - spanning endocrine, bone, hepatic, lipid, osmolality, inflammatory and muscular systems - exhibits a jump at FMP that is absent in males and highly concordant between cohorts. Jumps were largest in the sex hormones, followed by bone, toxins, red blood cells, liver, iron, lipids, kidney, and muscle. Changes are mostly detrimental except iron indices and anemia that improve post-menopause, and depression scores that spike only transiently. Hormone-replacement therapy attenuates many of the step-like changes. Sex hormone dysregulation occurs more than 10 years prior to FMP. These findings reveal the step-like dysregulation across physiology caused by loss of sex hormones and establish deconvolution as a general strategy for disentangling age-related transitions in large, noisy datasets.

Abstract:
To explore the possible mechanical correlations between intraocular pressure (IOP) variations and glaucoma, this study presents a transversely isotropic poroelastic model of the Lamina Cribrosa (LC) based on Reissner Mindlin plate theory, ultimately highlighting the interplay between solid matrix deformation and blood flow behavior under pathological conditions. Starting from poroelasticity theory, the equilibrium equations governing the LC were formulated and analytically solved by applying appropriate mechanical and hydraulic boundary conditions. The results indicate that both strain and stress measures (in the form of shear strain and von Mises stress) peak in the peripheral region of the LC, which is currently suspected to be the initial site of glaucomatous damage. These quantities increase with IOP, suggesting a pressure-dependent mechanical insult to the retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons. In parallel, the model predicts a monotonic reduction in fluid content as IOP rises, which may contribute to ischemic phenomena and disc haemorrhages. The influence of material anisotropy was also examined, revealing that isotropic assumptions tend to underestimate the fluid content while overestimating shear strain. Given the current experimental challenges in measuring blood flow within the LC, the proposed model provides a valuable framework for exploring the coupled mechanical hemodynamic behavior of the tissue and for inverse estimation of its mechanical parameters, such as the stiffness of the opening for the central retinal vessels.

Abstract:
Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging is widely used in a number of clinical applications, including cancer and Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis, monitoring of disease development, and treatment effect evaluation. Statistical modeling of PET imaging is essential to address continually emerging scientific questions in these research fields, including hypotheses related to evaluation of effects of disease modifying treatments on amyloid reduction in AD and associations between amyloid reduction and cognitive function, among many others. In this paper, we provide background information and tools for statisticians interested in developing statistical models for PET imaging to pre-process and prepare data for analysis. We introduce our novel pre-processing and visualization tool TRAECR (Template registration, MRI-PET co-Registration, Anatomical brain Extraction and COMBAT/RAVEL harmonization) to facilitate data preparation for statistical analysis.

Abstract:
Motivation: CMR is the golden standard for cardiac diagnosis, and medical data annotation is time-consuming. Thus, screening techniques from unlabeled data can help streamline the cardiac diagnosis process.   Goal: This work aims to enable cardiac function assessment from unlabeled cardiac MR images using an unsupervised approach with masked image modeling.   Approach: Our model creates a robust latent space by reconstructing sparse 2D+T planes (SAX, 2CH, 3CH, and 4CH views) with 70\% masking, which can be further disentangled into distinct cardiac temporal states.   Results: t-SNE visualization and kNN clustering analysis confirm the association between latent space and cardiac phenotypes, highlighting strong temporal feature extraction.   Impact: This method offers a scalable approach for cardiac screening by creating a latent space as well as distinct time-segment embeddings, enabling diverse preliminary analysis of cardiac function and potentially advancing research in cardiovascular disease applications.

Abstract:
This study uses in silico trials (ISTs) to quantify the potential for benefit due to improved recanalisation outcomes and shorter time to treatment for acute ischaemic stroke (AIS) patients. We use an IST framework to run trials on cohorts of virtual patients with early and late treatment after stroke onset, and with successful (full) and unsuccessful (no) recanalisation outcomes. Using a virtual population of AIS patients, and in silico models of blood flow, perfusion, and tissue death, we predict the functional independence of each patient at 90 days using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS).   Results predict 57% of the virtual population achieve functional independence with full recanalisation and a treatment time of 4 hours or less, compared to 29% with no recanalisation and more than 4 hours to treatment. Successful recanalisation was more beneficial than faster treatment: the best-case common odds ratio (improved mRS) due to recanalisation was 2.7 compared to 1.6 for early treatment.   This study provides a proof-of-concept for a novel use-case of ISTs: quantifying the maximum potential for improvement to patient outcomes. This would be useful during early stages of therapy development, to determine the target populations and therapy goal with the greatest potential for population improvements.

Abstract:
Acidosis in tumors arises from reprogrammed metabolism and compromised vasculature, creating a harsh, acidic microenvironment that drives the evolutionary selection of acid-resistant cell phenotypes. A mathematical model is proposed to integrate phenotypic evolution, microenvironmental acidification, and tumor density dynamics. Three key mechanisms are incorporated in it: frequency-dependent selection favoring acid-resistant cells below a critical pH, stress-induced phenotypic switching, and a positive feedback loop where resistant cells produce excess acid that intensifies selection pressure. The well-posedness of the model is established. Through numerical simulations across biologically relevant parameter regimes, we identify two therapeutically targetable parameters: baseline acid clearance rate (a proxy for vascular perfusion) and a protection factor (representing acid-resistance "machinery" effectiveness) as critical bifurcation parameters for resistance evolution. The model exhibits qualitatively distinct dynamics depending on phenotypic plasticity levels. In low-plasticity tumors, both parameters exhibit sharp bifurcations with strong parameter interactions: clearance and protection effects are context-dependent, with therapeutic interventions effective only within specific parameter ranges. In high-plasticity tumors, both parameters produce continuous, monotonic responses with independent, additive effects. These regime-dependent dynamics suggest that treatment strategies should adapt to tumor plasticity: in the formar, targeting perfusion alone is typically sufficient, though sequential therapy may be required if the perfusion rate approaches or exceeds the bifurcation threshold, whereas in the latter treatment might benefit from combination therapies addressing both parameters simultaneously.

Abstract:
A critical need exists for optimal therapeutic strategies for neuroblastoma, a prevalent and often fatal pediatric solid malignancy. To address the demand for quantitative models that can guide clinical decision-making, a novel mathematical framework was developed. Combination therapies involving immunotherapy, such as Interleukin-2 (IL-2), and chemotherapy, exemplified by Cyclophosphamide, have shown significant clinical potential by enhancing anti-tumor immune responses. In this study, a nonlinear system of coupled ordinary differential equations was formulated to mechanistically describe the interactions among tumor cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). The pharmacodynamic effects of both IL-2 and Cyclophosphamide on these key immune populations were explicitly incorporated, allowing for the simulation of tumor dynamics across distinct patient risk profiles. The resulting computational framework provides a robust platform for the \textit{\textbf{in silico}} \textbf{optimization} of therapeutic regimens, presenting a quantitative pathway toward the improvement of clinical outcomes for patients with neuroblastoma.

Abstract:
During development, embryonic tissues experience mechanical stresses ranging from cellular to supracellular length scales. In response, cells generate active forces that drive rearrangements, allowing the tissue to relax accumulated stresses. The nature of these responses depends strongly on the magnitude and duration of the deformation, giving rise to the tissue's characteristic viscoelastic behavior. Although experiments have characterized tissue rheology in various contexts, simpler theoretical approaches that directly connect cellular activity to emergent rheological behavior are still limited. In this study, we employ a vertex-based model of epithelial tissue incorporating active force fluctuations in cell vertices to represent cell motility. We capture distinct rounding dynamics and motility-dependent timescales by benchmarking against experimental observations such as the bulging of presomitic mesoderm (PSM) explants driven by Fibroblast Growth Factor(FGF) gradients. Stress relaxation tests reveal rapid short-timescale relaxation alongside persistent long-timescale residual stresses that decrease from anterior to posterior (AP) region of the PSM. By applying oscillatory shear, we analyzed the resulting elastic and viscous responses, revealing motility dependence of storage and loss modulus. Finally, we introduce spatially patterned cues applied in a temporally pulsed manner, mimicking dynamic biochemical or mechanical signals during development. Our results show that while higher motility promotes tissue remodeling in response to these cues, this response is constrained by spatial scale; cellular-scale perturbations are relaxed irrespective of motility strength, preventing complete morphological adaptation.

Abstract:
Peristalsis is the driving mechanism behind a broad array of biological and engineered flows. In peristaltic pumping, a wave-like contraction of the tube wall produces local changes in volume which induce flow. Net flow arises due to geometric nonlinearities in the momentum equation, which must be properly captured to compute the flow accurately. While most previous models focus on radius-imposed peristalsis, they often neglect longitudinal length changes - a natural consequence of radial contraction in elastic materials. In this paper, to capture a more accurate picture of peristaltic pumping, we calculate the flow in an elastic vessel undergoing contractions in the transverse and longitudinal directions simultaneously, keeping the geometric nonlinearities arising in the strain. A careful analysis requires us to study our fluid using the Lagrangian coordinates of the elastic tube. We perform analytic calculations of the flow characteristics by studying the fluid inside a fixed boundary with time-dependent metric. This mathematical manipulation works even for large-amplitude contractions, as we confirm by comparing our analytical results to COMSOL simulations. We demonstrate that transverse and longitudinal contractions induce instantaneous flows at the same order in wall strain, but in opposite directions. We investigate the influence of the wall's Poisson ratio on the flow profile. Incompressible walls suppress flow by minimizing local volume changes, whereas auxetic walls enhance flow. For radius-imposed peristaltic waves, wall incompressibility reduces both reflux and particle trapping. In contrast, length-imposed waves typically generate backflow, although trapping can still occur at large amplitudes for some Poisson ratios. These results yield a more complete description of peristalsis in elastic media and offer a framework for studying contraction-induced flows more broadly.

Abstract:
We measured the thickness of MDCK epithelia grown on substrates with a sinusoidal profile. We show that while at long wavelength the profile of the epithelium follows that of the substrate, at short wavelengths cells are thicker in valleys than on ridges. This is reminiscent of the so-called « healing length » in the case of a thin liquid film wetting a rough solid substrate. We explore the ability of continuum mechanics models to account for these observations. Modeling the epithelium as a thin liquid film, with surface tension, does not fully account for the measurements. Neither does modeling the epithelium as a thin incompressible elastic film. On the contrary, the addition of an apical active stress gives satisfactory agreement with measurements, with one fitting parameter, the ratio between the active stress and the elastic modulus.

Abstract:
Background. Knee Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common chronic joint condition, and its prevalence increases with age. This study aims to examine whether flattened vertical ground reaction force (vGRF) waveforms and reduced knee range of motion (RoM) occur together during gait as compensatory strategies to maintain gait speed. Methods. Twelve women with knee OA and twelve healthy women of the same age completed the Western Ontario and McMaster University Index (WOMAC) to assess self-reported pain, stiffness, and function. The groups were divided into two groups: OA vs. control 2 limbs or left and right in the Control group. A mixed-design ANOVA was used to examine differences in vertical ground response forces (VGRFs) peaks, minimum VGRF, anterior-posterior weight acceptance (ADWA) and propulsive force (ADPO), knee RoM, and gait speeds. Results. In the OA group, the mean Peak 1 vGFR was 1.109 (SD = 0.05) for the right leg (p 0.05), while the mean min vGFFR was 0.87 (SD=0.04) for the left leg. The OA leg exhibited a mean ADWA of 0.23 0.04 kg/BW, which was significantly lower than the control group's right leg (0.28 0.09 kg/bw, p0.05). No group differences in gait velocity were detected. Conclusions. We interpret the flattening of the vFGFR waveform and the reduction in knee RoM as components of an adaptive, yet potentially maladaptive, motor strategy

Abstract:
In early years of life, the cranium rapidly changes in size and shape to accommodate brain growth, primarily driven by mechanical stress from brain expansion. Developmental disorders such as premature fusion of sutures in craniosynostosis, disrupts normal growth process, leading to abnormal skull shapes. Thus, understanding the interplay between biomechanical forces, soft tissues, and individual bone plates is crucial for understanding their role in shaping infant skulls. This study develops a mechanically-driven growth model to simulate healthy cranial growth in the first year. The algorithm considers simultaneous and coupled growth of brain, cranial bones, sutures, with volumetric brain expansion as the primary driver, with strain-based feedback governing growth in bone and suture tissues. A bulk bone formation approach accounts for evolving mechanical properties, with elastic moduli of bone and sutures increasing monthly. The model was applied on individual fused sutures and skull dysmorphologies due to craniosynostosis were predicted, and results showed good agreement with clinically observations. Stress at bone-suture interfaces and elevated intracranial pressure under fused sutures highlighted biomechanical impacts due to the disorders. Sensitivity analysis explored how material properties and growth rates affect skull shape. This framework enhances understanding of cranial growth and supports treatment planning for craniosynostosis.

Abstract:
Organoids offer a promising alternative in biomedical research and clinical medicine, with better feature recapitulation than 2D cultures. They also have more consistent responses with clinical results when compared to animal models. However, major challenges exist in the longevity of culture, the reproducibility of organoid properties, and the development of non-disruptive monitoring methods. Recent advances in materials and microfabrication methods, such as 3D printing and compressive buckling, have enabled three-dimensional (3D) interfaces of microfluidics and bioelectronics to manipulate and monitor these biological models in exciting ways. These advanced systems have great potential for applications in drug delivery, personalized medicine, and disease modelling. We conclude with important future considerations to generate longevity using further technological development in organoid and spheroid models.

Abstract:
Hearts subjected to volume overload (VO) are prone to detrimental anatomical and functional changes in response to elevated mechanical stretches, ultimately leading to heart failure. Experimental findings increasingly emphasize that organ-scale changes following VO cannot be explained by myocyte growth alone, as traditionally proposed in the literature. Collagen degradation, in particular, has been associated with left ventricular adaptation in both acute and chronic stages of VO. These hypotheses remain to be substantiated by comprehensive mechanistic evidence, and the contribution of each constituent to myocardial growth and remodeling (G&R) processes is yet to be quantified. In this work, we establish a hybrid G&R framework in which we integrate a mixture-based constitutive model with the kinematic growth formulation. This multi-constituent model enables us to mechanistically assess the relative contributions of collagen and myocyte changes to alterations in tissue properties, ventricular dimensions, and growth phenotype. Our numerical results confirm that collagen dynamics control the passive mechanical response of the myocardium, whereas myocytes predominantly impact the extent and the phenotype of eccentric hypertrophy. Importantly, collagen degradation exacerbates myocyte hypertrophy, demonstrating a synergistic interplay that accelerates left ventricular progression toward diastolic dysfunction. This work constitutes an important step towards an integrated characterization of the early compensatory stages of VO-induced cardiac G&R.

Abstract:
Fully capturing this behavior in traditional homogenized tissue testing requires the excitation of multiple deformation modes, i.e. combined triaxial shear tests and biaxial stretch tests. Inherently, such multimodal experimental protocols necessitate multiple tissue samples and extensive sample manipulations. Intrinsic inter-sample variability and manipulation-induced tissue damage might have an adverse effect on the inversely identified tissue behavior. In this work, we aim to overcome this gap by focusing our attention to the use of heterogeneous deformation profiles in a parameter estimation problem. More specifically, we adapt EUCLID, an unsupervised method for the automated discovery of constitutive models, towards the purpose of parameter identification for highly nonlinear, orthotropic constitutive models using a Bayesian inference approach and three-dimensional continuum elements. We showcase its strength to quantitatively infer, with varying noise levels, the material model parameters of synthetic myocardial tissue slabs from a single heterogeneous biaxial stretch test. This method shows good agreement with the ground-truth simulations and with corresponding credibility intervals. Our work highlights the potential for characterizing highly nonlinear and orthotropic material models from a single biaxial stretch test with uncertainty quantification.

Abstract:
The mechanosensory system of teeth is currently believed to partly rely on Odontoblast cells stimulation by fluid flow through a porosity network extending through dentin. Visualizing the smallest sub-microscopic porosity vessels therefore requires the highest achievable resolution from confocal fluorescence microscopy, the current gold standard. This considerably limits the extent of the field of view to very small sample regions. To overcome this limitation, we tested different deep learning (DL) super-resolution (SR) models to allow faster experimental acquisitions of lower resolution images and restore optimal image quality by post-processing. Three supervised 2D SR models (RCAN, pix2pix, FSRCNN) and one unsupervised (CycleGAN) were applied to a unique set of experimentally paired high- and low-resolution confocal images acquired with different sampling schemes, resulting in a pixel size increase of x2, x4, x8. Model performance was quantified using a broad set of similarity and distribution-based image quality assessment (IQA) metrics, which yielded inconsistent results that mostly contradicted our visual perception. This raises the question of the relevance of such generic metrics to efficiently target the specific structure of dental porosity. To resolve this conflicting information, the generated SR images were segmented taking into account the specific scales and morphology of the porosity network and analysed by comparing connected components. Additionally, the capacity of the SR models to preserve 3D porosity connectivity throughout the confocal image stacks was evaluated using graph analysis. This biology-driven assessment allowed a far better mechanistic interpretation of SR performance, highlighting differences in model sensitivity to weak intensity features and the impact of non-linearity in image generation, which explains the failure of standard IQA metrics.

Abstract:
Purpose: Computational head models are essential tools for studying the risk of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) under different activities and across populations. However, different computational models incorporate varied levels of anatomical details, such as cortical folds. In this study, we aim to determine the effect of modeling cortical folds on mTBI risk assessment. Methods: We compared the gyrencephalic (with cortical folds) and lissencephalic (without cortical folds) FE models of 18 subjects aged 9 - 18 years, under a rotational head acceleration event. A rotational acceleration of 10 krad/s$^2$ and 10 ms duration was simulated about each principal head axis. We analyzed different mTBI injury metrics, including maximum principal strain (MPS95), maximum principal strain rate (MPSR95), and cumulative strain damage measure (CSDM15), for the whole brain as well as for specific regions of interest (ROIs). Results: Modeling cortical folds consistently predicted higher injury metrics across all individuals and rotational direction, with the bias (mean $\pm$ std. dev.) of $-21.17\pm 9.1\%$ in MPS95, $-17.1 \pm 7.6\%$ in MPSR95, and $-14.4 \pm 11.3\%$ in CSDM15. Modeling cortical folds significantly affected the spatial strain distributions, with the DICE similarity coefficient on peak MPS ranging between $0.07-0.43$ and DICE on CSDM15 ranging between $0.42-0.70$; and increasing the peak injury metrics even in the geometrically unaltered regions of interest, such as the corpus callosum, cerebellum, and brain stem, by up to $50\%$. Conclusions: The study finds that the inclusion of cortical folds significantly alters the pattern of deformation in the brain, thereby affecting the mTBI risk predictions head rotations.

Abstract:
The forces generated by action potentials in muscle cells shuttle blood, food and waste products throughout the luminal structures of the body. Although non-invasive electrophysiological techniques exist, most mechanosensors cannot access luminal structures non-invasively. Here we introduce non-toxic ingestible mechanosensors to enable the quantitative study of luminal forces and apply them to study feeding in living Caenorhabditis elegans roundworms. These optical 'microgauges' comprise NaY0.8Yb0.18Er0.02F4@NaYF4 upconverting nanoparticles embedded in polystyrene microspheres. Combining optical microscopy and atomic force microscopy to study microgauges in vitro, we show that force evokes a linear and hysteresis-free change in the ratio of emitted red to green light. With fluorescence imaging and non-invasive electrophysiology, we show that adult C. elegans generate bite forces during feeding on the order of 10 micronewtons and that the temporal pattern of force generation is aligned with muscle activity in the feeding organ. Moreover, the bite force we measure corresponds to Hertzian contact stresses in the pressure range used to lyse the bacterial food of the worm. Microgauges have the potential to enable quantitative studies that investigate how neuromuscular stresses are affected by aging, genetic mutations and drug treatments in this organ and other luminal organs.

Abstract:
Spatial variable genes (SVGs) reveal critical information about tissue architecture, cellular interactions, and disease microenvironments. As spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies proliferate, accurately identifying SVGs across diverse platforms, tissue types, and disease contexts has become both a major opportunity and a significant computational challenge. Here, we present a comprehensive benchmarking study of 20 state-of-the-art SVG detection methods using human slides from STimage-1K4M, a large-scale resource of ST data comprising 662 slides from more than 18 tissue types. We evaluate each method across a range of biologically and technically meaningful criteria, including recovery of pathologist-annotated domain-specific markers, cross-slide reproducibility, scalability to high-resolution data, and robustness to technical variation. Our results reveal marked differences in performance depending on tissue type, spatial resolution, and study design. Beyond benchmarking, we construct the first cross-tissue atlas of SVGs, enabling comparative analysis of spatial gene programs across cancer and normal tissues. We observe similarities between pairs of tissues that reflect developmental and functional relationships, such as high overlap between thymus and lymph node, and uncover spatial gene programs associated with metastasis, immune infiltration, and tissue-of-origin identity in cancer. Together, our work defines a framework for evaluating and interpreting spatial gene expression and establishes a reference resource for the ST community.

Abstract:
We introduce a new model of the human corneal stroma, regarded as a fluid-saturated continuum, able to describe surface flattening and thickness thinning observed in several pathological conditions. In contrast with more common approaches that describe the human cornea as a quasi-incompressible hyperelastic medium, eventually including micro-structured anisotropy and heterogeneity, here we focus on the multi-phase nature of the tissue, where the content of water reaches about 78\% in weight. The study is motivated by the fact that, although purely mechanical continuum models have been demonstrated to be satisfactory and accurate at predicting physiological behaviors, they have not been able to capture the geometrical features of tissue degeneration clearly associated to a reduction of the fluid content in the stroma, such thinning and loss of curvature. Here, we model the cornea as a fully saturated mixture of a solid phase and a fluid phase, in principle without restricting the formulation to specific assumptions on the actual inhomogeneous nature of both phases. The focus of the study is to understand whether a multiphysics model is capable of explaining, in terms of fluid flux imbalance, such as ectasia and keratoconus. As a first attempt in this direction, we make simple isotropic constitutive assumptions for both phases.

Abstract:
Deep learning models which perform well on images from their training distribution can degrade substantially when applied to new distributions. If a CT scanner introduces a new artifact not present in the training labels, the model may misclassify the images. Although modern CT scanners include design features which mitigate these artifacts, unanticipated or difficult-to-mitigate artifacts can still appear in practice. The direct solution of labeling images from this new distribution can be costly. As a more accessible alternative, this study evaluates domain adaptation as an approach for training models that maintain classification performance despite new artifacts, even without corresponding labels. We simulate ring artifacts from detector gain error in sinogram space and evaluate domain adversarial neural networks (DANN) against baseline and augmentation-based approaches on the OrganAMNIST abdominal CT dataset. Our results demonstrate that baseline models trained only on clean images fail to generalize to images with ring artifacts, and traditional augmentation with other distortion types provides no improvement on unseen artifact domains. In contrast, the DANN approach successfully maintains high classification accuracy on ring artifact images using only unlabeled artifact data during training, demonstrating the viability of domain adaptation for artifact robustness. The domain-adapted model achieved classification performance on ring artifact test data comparable to models explicitly trained with labeled artifact images, while also showing unexpected generalization to uniform noise. These findings provide empirical evidence that domain adaptation can effectively address distribution shift in medical imaging without requiring expensive expert labeling of new artifact distributions, suggesting promise for deployment in clinical settings where novel artifacts may emerge.

Abstract:
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is highly heterogeneous, with five-year survival rates dropping from $\sim$90% in localized disease to $\sim$15% with distant metastases. Disease progression is shaped not only by tumor-intrinsic alterations but also by the reorganization of the tumor microenvironment (TME). Metabolic, compositional, and spatial changes contribute to this progression, but considered individually they lack context and often fail as therapeutic targets. Understanding their coordination could reveal processes to alter the disease course. Here, we combined multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI) with machine learning to profile metabolic, functional and spatial states of 522 colorectal lesions with single-cell resolution. We observed recurrent stage-specific remodeling marked by a lymphoid-to-myeloid shift, stromal-cancer cooperation, and malignant metabolic shifts. Spatial organization of epithelial, stromal, and immune compartments provided stronger stratification of disease stage than tumor-intrinsic changes or bulk immune infiltration alone. To systematically model these coordinated changes, we condensed multimodal features into 10 latent factors of TME organization. These factors tracked disease progression, were conserved across cohorts, and revealed frequent multicellular metabolic niches and distinct, non-exclusive TME trajectories. Our framework MuVIcell exposes the elements that together drive CRC progression by grouping co-occurring changes across cell types and feature classes into coordinated multicellular programs. This creates a rational basis to therapeutically target TME reorganization. Importantly, the framework is scalable and flexible, offering a resource for studying multicellular organization in other solid tumors.

We analyzed scRNA-seq data from 10 eoPE, 7 late-onset PE (loPE), and corresponding control placentas, identifying villous cytotrophoblast (VCT), syncytiotrophoblast (SCT), and extravillous trophoblast (EVT) subpopulations. BeWo b30 cells were treated for 24 h with CoCl2 (300 $μ$M) or an oxyquinoline derivative (OD, 5 $μ$M) to induce hypoxia. RNA and small RNA sequencing quantified mRNA and microRNA changes. PROGENy inferred pathway activities.   Results. ScRNA-seq revealed highest hypoxia pathway activation in eoPE, with EVT showing maximum activity among trophoblast populations. Nine genes were upregulated across all trophoblast types in eoPE: EBI3, CST6, FN1, RFK, COL17A1, LDHA, PKP2, RPS4Y1, and RPS26. In vitro, OD induced more specific hypoxia responses than CoCl2, with 1,284 versus 3,032 differentially expressed genes respectively. Critically, EBI3, FN1, and COL17A1 showed concordant upregulation in both placental tissue and OD-treated cells, while CoCl2 treatment produced opposite expression patterns. MicroRNA analysis identified hsa-miR-27a-5p and hsa-miR-193b-5p as consistently elevated in both experimental conditions and previously reported in PE placental vesicles. We also identified isoforms of hsa-miR-9-5p and hsa-miR-92b-3p as hypoxia-associated in trophoblast.   Conclusions. EBI3, COL17A1, hsa-miR-27a-5p, and hsa-miR-193b-5p emerge as trophoblast hypoxia markers in PE. Oxyquinoline derivatives offer a more physiologically relevant in vitro hypoxia model than CoCl2. This integrated approach advances understanding of PE pathophysiology and suggests candidate therapeutic targets.

Abstract:
A sensor-fused wearable assistance prototype for upper-limb function (triceps brachii and extensor pollicis brevis) is presented. The device integrates surface electromyography (sEMG), an inertial measurement unit (IMU), and flex/force sensors on an M5StickC plus an ESP32-S3 compute hub. Signals are band-pass and notch filtered; features (RMS, MAV, zero-crossings, and 4-12 Hz tremor-band power) are computed in 250 ms windows and fed to an INT8 TensorFlow Lite Micro model. Control commands are bounded by a control-barrier-function safety envelope and delivered within game-based tasks with lightweight personalization. In a pilot technical feasibility evaluation with healthy volunteers (n = 12) performing three ADL-oriented tasks, tremor prominence decreased (Delta TI = -0.092, 95% CI [-0.102, -0.079]), range of motion increased (+12.65%, 95% CI [+8.43, +13.89]), repetitions rose (+2.99 min^-1, 95% CI [+2.61, +3.35]), and the EMG median-frequency slope became less negative (Delta = +0.100 Hz/min, 95% CI [+0.083, +0.127]). The sensing-to-assist loop ran at 100 Hz with 8.7 ms median on-device latency, 100% session completion, and 0 device-related adverse events. These results demonstrate technical feasibility of embedded, sensor-fused assistance for upper-limb function; formal patient studies under IRB oversight are planned.

Abstract:
Objective: We sought to develop a classification algorithm to extract diagnoses from free-text radiology reports of brain imaging performed in patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF) undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation. Methods: We developed and fine-tuned Neu-RadBERT, a BERT-based model, to classify unstructured radiology reports. We extracted all the brain imaging reports (computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging) from MIMIC-IV database, performed in patients with ARF. Initial manual labelling was performed on a subset of reports for various brain abnormalities, followed by fine-tuning Neu-RadBERT using three strategies: 1) baseline RadBERT, 2) Neu-RadBERT with Masked Language Modeling (MLM) pretraining, and 3) Neu-RadBERT with MLM pretraining and oversampling to address data skewness. We compared the performance of this model to Llama-2-13B, an autoregressive LLM. Results: The Neu-RadBERT model, particularly with oversampling, demonstrated significant improvements in diagnostic accuracy compared to baseline RadBERT for brain abnormalities, achieving up to 98.0% accuracy for acute brain injuries. Llama-2-13B exhibited relatively lower performance, peaking at 67.5% binary classification accuracy. This result highlights potential limitations of current autoregressive LLMs for this specific classification task, though it remains possible that larger models or further fine-tuning could improve performance. Conclusion: Neu-RadBERT, enhanced through target domain pretraining and oversampling techniques, offered a robust tool for accurate and reliable diagnosis of neurological conditions from radiology reports. This study underscores the potential of transformer-based NLP models in automatically extracting diagnoses from free text reports with potential applications to both research and patient care.

Abstract:
This work introduces Federated Adaptive Gain via Dual Signal Trust (FedAgain), a novel federated learning algorithm designed to enhance anomaly detection in medical imaging under decentralized and heterogeneous conditions. Focusing on the task of kidney stone classification, FedAgain addresses the common challenge of corrupted or low-quality client data in real-world clinical environments by implementing a dual-signal trust mechanism based on reconstruction error and model divergence. This mechanism enables the central server to dynamically down-weight updates from untrustworthy clients without accessing their raw data, thereby preserving both model integrity and data privacy. FedAgain employs deep convolutional autoencoders trained in two diverse kidney stone datasets and is evaluated in 16 types of endoscopy-specific corruption at five severity levels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedAgain effectively suppresses "expert forger" clients, enhances robustness to image corruptions, and offers a privacy-preserving solution for collaborative medical anomaly detection. Compared to traditional FedAvg, FedAgain achieves clear improvements in all 16 types of corruption, with precision gains of up to +14.49\% and F1 score improvements of up to +10.20\%, highlighting its robustness and effectiveness in challenging imaging scenarios.

Comment: Millennium Pathways (30 Sept, 2025)

Abstract:
In the spirit of the historic Millennium Prize Problems that heralded a new era for mathematics, the newly formed International Society for Tractography (IST) has launched the Millennium Pathways for Tractography, a community-driven roadmap designed to shape the future of the field. Conceived during the inaugural Tract-Anat Retreat, this initiative reflects a collective vision for advancing tractography over the coming decade and beyond. The roadmap consists of 40 grand challenges, developed by international experts and organized into seven categories spanning three overarching themes: neuroanatomy, tractography methods, and clinical applications. By defining shared short-, medium-, and long-term goals, these pathways provide a structured framework to confront fundamental limitations, promote rigorous validation, and accelerate the translation of tractography into a robust tool for neuroscience and medicine. Ultimately, the Millennium Pathways aim to guide and inspire future research and collaboration, ensuring the continued scientific and clinical relevance of tractography well into the future.

Title: Load Transfer along Continuous Collagen Fibers Reduces the Importance of Wall Thickness Variations

Abstract:
The mechanical response of biological soft tissues is influenced by wall heterogeneity, including spatial variations in wall thickness. Traditional models for homogeneous soft tissues under uniaxial loading predict higher stretch and stress in thinner regions. In fact, large gradients in stretch and stress are predicted to be induced by spatial variations in wall thickness. In prior studies, the role of collagen fibers in regions of thickness transition has been largely neglected or only considered in terms of their effect on anisotropy. Here, we explore the role of collagen fibers as primary load-bearing components across regions of varying wall thickness, using a three-dimensional representative volume element (RVE) model incorporating explicit collagen fiber architecture and a gradual thickness gradient. We examined two distinct collagen fiber configurations across the thickness transition: one featuring abrupt fiber termination and another with fiber continuity. Finite element analysis (FEA) under uniaxial tension revealed that load transfer by continuous fibers across the specimen markedly reduced the importance of the change in wall thickness, with stretch differentials dropping from ~20% (fiber-termination network) to 0.68% (continuous fibers) and stress differentials dropping from ~65% (fiber-termination network) to 2.3% (continuous fibers). Fiber tortuosity delayed the point at which mechanical response was governed by fiber structure. These findings demonstrate the critical role of fiber continuity in reducing stretch and stress gradients across regions of varying wall thickness and clarify the importance of accurately representing fiber architecture when modeling soft tissues with heterogeneous wall thickness.

Abstract:
Selective interleukin-23 receptor antagonists (IL-23RA) show promise for treating moderate to severe ulcerative colitis (UC) but their efficacy and safety are not fully understood. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing IL-23RA with placebo in moderate to severe UC. Outcomes included clinical and endoscopic remission, response rates, and adverse events. Nine trials including 3808 patients in the induction phase and 1734 in the maintenance phase were analyzed. IL-23RA improved clinical remission (induction risk ratio 2.63, 95 percent confidence interval 2.05-3.36; maintenance 1.99, 95 percent confidence interval 1.63-2.44) and endoscopic remission (induction 2.36, 95 percent confidence interval 1.70-2.20; maintenance 1.96, 95 percent confidence interval 1.63-2.37). IL-23RA reduced serious adverse events in the induction phase (0.40, 95 percent confidence interval 0.27-0.69) with no difference during maintenance (0.75, 95 percent confidence interval 0.31-1.84). No significant differences were observed in overall adverse events or specific events such as headache or nasopharyngitis. Trial sequential analysis confirmed sufficient sample size for clinical endpoints. IL-23RA showed superior effectiveness and similar safety compared with placebo in moderate to severe UC.

Abstract:
In this work, we propose a novel method for calibrating Windkessel (WK) parameters in a dimensionally reduced 1D-0D coupled blood flow model. To this end, we design a data-driven neural network (NN)trained on simulated blood pressures in the left brachial artery. Once trained, the NN emulates the pressure pulse waves across the entire simulated domain, i.e., over time, space and varying WK parameters, with negligible error and computational effort. To calibrate the WK parameters on a measured pulse wave, the NN is extended by dummy neurons and retrained only on these. The main objective of this work is to assess the effectiveness of the method in various scenarios -- particularly, when the exact measurement location is unknown or the data are affected by noise.

Comment: 24 pages, 47 figures, publish to BIBM

Abstract:
Clinical machine learning faces a critical dilemma in high-stakes medical applications: algorithms achieving optimal diagnostic performance typically sacrifice the interpretability essential for physician decision-making, while interpretable methods compromise sensitivity in complex scenarios. This paradox becomes particularly acute in non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT), where missed chromosomal abnormalities carry profound clinical consequences yet regulatory frameworks mandate explainable AI systems. We introduce Medical Priority Fusion (MPF), a constrained multi-objective optimization framework that resolves this fundamental trade-off by systematically integrating Naive Bayes probabilistic reasoning with Decision Tree rule-based logic through mathematically-principled weighted fusion under explicit medical constraints. Rigorous validation on 1,687 real-world NIPT samples characterized by extreme class imbalance (43.4:1 normal-to-abnormal ratio) employed stratified 5-fold cross-validation with comprehensive ablation studies and statistical hypothesis testing using McNemar's paired comparisons. MPF achieved simultaneous optimization of dual objectives: 89.3% sensitivity (95% CI: 83.9-94.7%) with 80% interpretability score, significantly outperforming individual algorithms (McNemar's test, p < 0.001). The optimal fusion configuration achieved Grade A clinical deployment criteria with large effect size (d = 1.24), establishing the first clinically-deployable solution that maintains both diagnostic accuracy and decision transparency essential for prenatal care. This work demonstrates that medical-constrained algorithm fusion can resolve the interpretability-performance trade-off, providing a mathematical framework for developing high-stakes medical decision support systems that meet both clinical efficacy and explainability requirements.

Title: Magnetically Guided Endothelial BioBots: A Next-Generation Strategy for Treating Complex Cerebral Aneurysms

Abstract:
Cerebral aneurysms affect three to five percent of the population, and rupture remains a major cause of stroke-related death and disability. Current therapies, surgical clipping, endovascular coiling, and flow diversion, have improved outcomes but each carries limitations. Clipping is invasive and often unsuitable for deep or posterior lesions. Coiling is prone to recurrence from compaction or incomplete occlusion, particularly in wide-neck or fusiform aneurysms. Flow diverters offer improved durability but rely on rigid metallic scaffolds that may malappose in tortuous vessels, compromise branch arteries, delay endothelialization, and necessitate long-term dual antiplatelet therapy. These shortcomings highlight a gap in current management: devices primarily provide mechanical occlusion but fail to conform to complex geometries or reliably promote rapid, complete endothelialization. As a result, aneurysm necks may remain exposed to persistent flow, delayed healing, and thrombosis.   To address this, we propose magnetically guided endothelial BioBots as a next-generation therapeutic strategy. BioBots are biodegradable hydrogel carriers embedded with magnetic nanoparticles and coated with primed endothelial progenitor cells. Delivered through microcatheters and guided by external electromagnetic fields, they can assemble across aneurysm defects. Once localized, they form a conformal, geometry-adaptive endothelial patch that provides immediate antithrombotic protection and, as the hydrogel degrades, leaves behind a stable, functional endothelial lining. By integrating microrobotic navigation with regenerative vascular biology, BioBots may overcome the central limitations of current devices and enable safer, more durable treatment for complex aneurysms.

Abstract:
As epithelial development or wound closure approaches completion, cell proliferation progressively slows via contact inhibition of proliferation (CIP) - a mechanism understood as being strictly local. Here we report the discovery of inhibition of proliferation through an unanticipated mechanism that is non-local. Within the epithelial layer arises a self-organized reticulum comprising two interpenetrating multiscale networks: islands of mechanically compressed non-cycling cells embedded within an ocean of mechanically tensed cycling cells. The evolution of these networks was found to be susceptible to specific mechanical and molecular stimuli. Yet, in all circumstances, the size of compressed islands followed a power-law distribution that is well-captured by network theory, and implies self-organization and proximity to criticality. Thus, the findings demonstrate a completely new biological paradigm - reticular inhibition of proliferation (RIP).

Abstract:
Large-language models (LLMs) are rapidly being applied to radiology, enabling automated image interpretation and report generation tasks. Their deployment in clinical practice requires both high diagnostic accuracy and low inference latency, which in turn demands powerful hardware. High-performance graphical processing units (GPUs) provide the necessary compute and memory throughput to run large LLMs on imaging data. We review modern GPU architectures (e.g. NVIDIA A100/H100, AMD Instinct MI250X/MI300) and key performance metrics of floating-point throughput, memory bandwidth, VRAM capacity. We show how these hardware capabilities affect radiology tasks: for example, generating reports or detecting findings on CheXpert and MIMIC-CXR images is computationally intensive and benefits from GPU parallelism and tensor-core acceleration. Empirical studies indicate that using appropriate GPU resources can reduce inference time and improve throughput. We discuss practical challenges including privacy, deployment, cost, power and optimization strategies: mixed-precision, quantization, compression, and multi-GPU scaling. Finally, we anticipate that next-generation features (8-bit tensor cores, enhanced interconnect) will further enable on-premise and federated radiology AI. Advancing GPU infrastructure is essential for safe, efficient LLM-based radiology diagnostics.

Abstract:
Background and Aims: Pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) combined with oral antiviral agents is currently the most widely used and highly effective treatment regimen for chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. While effectively suppressing HBV replication, its impact on liver histopathological fibrosis and inflammation remains a critical concern for clinicians and patients. Methods : A total of 625 patients who completed 48 weeks of PEG-IFN combined with oral antiviral therapy were enrolled in this real-world study. Based on their virological response at 48 weeks, patients were categorized into Clearance group and Non-clearance group. Changes in liver biochemistry, fibrosis, and renal function were compared between groups and before/after treatment. Results: No significant differences were observed in baseline blood tests, liver biochemical markers, or histopathological features between the Clearance group and Non-clearance group. Similarly, baseline renal function showed no significant variation. Further analysis revealed that the Clearance group exhibited significant aggravation of liver fibrosis after 48 weeks of treatment, which correlated strongly with alterations in liver enzyme levels. However, one patient who underwent paired liver biopsies before and after treatment demonstrated marked histopathological improvement in fibrosis. This finding underscores the irreplaceable role of liver histopathology in assessing fibrosis and inflammation. Conclusion: PEG-IFN combined with oral antiviral therapy exerts favorable effects on liver fibrosis and inflammation in chronic HBV patients. Non-invasive fibrosis assessment models can monitor fibrotic progression but are susceptible to confounding by hepatic inflammation.

Abstract:
Purpose: To develop a deep learning method for the automatic segmentation of spinal nerve rootlets on various MRI scans. Material and Methods: This retrospective study included MRI scans from two open-access and one private dataset, consisting of 3D isotropic 3T TSE T2-weighted (T2w) and 7T MP2RAGE (T1-weighted [T1w] INV1 and INV2, and UNIT1) MRI scans. A deep learning model, RootletSeg, was developed to segment C2-T1 dorsal and ventral spinal rootlets. Training was performed on 76 scans and testing on 17 scans. The Dice score was used to compare the model performance with an existing open-source method. Spinal levels derived from RootletSeg segmentations were compared with vertebral levels defined by intervertebral discs using Bland-Altman analysis. Results: The RootletSeg model developed on 93 MRI scans from 50 healthy adults (mean age, 28.70 years $\pm$ 6.53 [SD]; 28 [56%] males, 22 [44%] females) achieved a mean $\pm$ SD Dice score of 0.67 $\pm$ 0.09 for T1w-INV2, 0.65 $\pm$ 0.11 for UNIT1, 0.64 $\pm$ 0.08 for T2w, and 0.62 $\pm$ 0.10 for T1w-INV1 contrasts. Spinal-vertebral level correspondence showed a progressively increasing rostrocaudal shift, with Bland-Altman bias ranging from 0.00 to 8.15 mm (median difference between level midpoints). Conclusion: RootletSeg accurately segmented C2-T1 spinal rootlets across MRI contrasts, enabling the determination of spinal levels directly from MRI scans. The method is open-source and can be used for a variety of downstream analyses, including lesion classification, neuromodulation therapy, and functional MRI group analysis.

Abstract:
Lung cancer continues to be the predominant cause of cancer-related mortality globally. This review analyzes various approaches, including advanced image processing methods, focusing on their efficacy in interpreting CT scans, chest radiographs, and biological markers. Notably, we identify critical gaps in the previous surveys, including the need for robust models that can generalize across diverse populations and imaging modalities. This comprehensive synthesis aims to serve as a foundational resource for researchers and clinicians, guiding future efforts toward more accurate and efficient lung cancer detection. Key findings reveal that 3D CNN architectures integrated with CT scans achieve the most superior performances, yet challenges such as high false positives, dataset variability, and computational complexity persist across modalities.

Abstract:
State-of-the-art (SOTA) Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are criticized for their extensive computational power, long training times, and large datasets. To overcome this limitation, we propose a reasonable network (R-Net), a lightweight CNN only to detect and classify colorectal cancer (CRC) using the Enteroscope Biopsy Histopathological Hematoxylin and Eosin Image Dataset (EBHI). Furthermore, six SOTA CNNs, including Multipath-based CNNs (DenseNet121, ResNet50), Depth-based CNNs (InceptionV3), width-based multi-connection CNNs (Xception), depth-wise separable convolutions (MobileNetV2), spatial exploitation-based CNNs (VGG16), Transfer learning, and two ensemble models are also tested on the same dataset. The ensemble models are a multipath-depth-width combination (DenseNet121-InceptionV3-Xception) and a multipath-depth-spatial combination (ResNet18-InceptionV3-VGG16). However, the proposed R-Net lightweight achieved 99.37% accuracy, outperforming MobileNet (95.83%) and ResNet50 (96.94%). Most importantly, to understand the decision-making of R-Net, Explainable AI such as SHAP, LIME, and Grad-CAM are integrated to visualize which parts of the EBHI image contribute to the detection and classification process of R-Net. The main novelty of this research lies in building a reliable, lightweight CNN R-Net that requires fewer computing resources yet maintains strong prediction results. SOTA CNNs, transfer learning, and ensemble models also extend our knowledge on CRC classification and detection. XAI functionality and the impact of pixel intensity on correct and incorrect classification images are also some novelties in CRC detection and classification.

State-of-the-art (SOTA) Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) require substantial computational resources, extended training time, and large datasets. In this study, a lightweight CNN model, S-Net (Simple Net), is developed specifically for cervical cancer detection and classification using Pap smear images to address these limitations. Alongside S-Net, six SOTA CNNs were evaluated using transfer learning, including multi-path (DenseNet201, ResNet152), depth-based (Serasnet152), width-based multi-connection (Xception), depth-wise separable convolutions (MobileNetV2), and spatial exploitation-based (VGG19). All models, including S-Net, achieved comparable accuracy, with S-Net reaching 99.99%. However, S-Net significantly outperforms the SOTA CNNs in terms of computational efficiency and inference time, making it a more practical choice for real-time and resource-constrained applications. A major limitation in CNN-based medical diagnosis remains the lack of transparency in the decision-making process. To address this, Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, such as SHAP, LIME, and Grad-CAM, were employed to visualize and interpret the key image regions influencing model predictions. The novelty of this study lies in the development of a highly accurate yet computationally lightweight model (S-Net) caPable of rapid inference while maintaining interpretability through XAI integration. Furthermore, this work analyzes the behavior of SOTA CNNs, investigates the effects of negative transfer learning on Pap smear images, and examines pixel intensity patterns in correctly and incorrectly classified samples.

Abstract:
Contrastive learning is a widely adopted self-supervised pretraining strategy, yet its dependence on cohort composition remains underexplored. We present Contrasting by Patient Augmented Electrocardiograms (CAPE) foundation model and pretrain on four cohorts (n = 5,203,352), from diverse populations across three continents (North America, South America, Asia). We systematically assess how cohort demographics, health status, and population diversity influence the downstream performance for prediction tasks also including two additional cohorts from another continent (Europe). We find that downstream performance depends on the distributional properties of the pretraining cohort, including demographics and health status. Moreover, while pretraining with a multi-centre, demographically diverse cohort improves in-distribution accuracy, it reduces out-of-distribution (OOD) generalisation of our contrastive approach by encoding cohort-specific artifacts. To address this, we propose the In-Distribution Batch (IDB) strategy, which preserves intra-cohort consistency during pretraining and enhances OOD robustness. This work provides important insights for developing clinically fair and generalisable foundation models.

Abstract:
As a lightweight and non-invasive imaging technique, lung ultrasound (LUS) has gained importance for assessing lung pathologies. The use of Artificial intelligence (AI) in medical decision support systems is promising due to the time- and expertise-intensive interpretation, however, due to the poor quality of existing data used for training AI models, their usability for real-world applications remains unclear. In a prospective study, we analyze data from 63 COVID-19 suspects (33 positive) collected at Maastricht University Medical Centre. Ultrasound recordings at six body locations were acquired following the BLUE protocol and manually labeled for severity of lung involvement. Several AI models were applied and trained for detection and severity of pulmonary infection. The severity of the lung infection, as assigned by human annotators based on the LUS videos, is not significantly different between COVID-19 positive and negative patients (p = 0.89). Nevertheless, the predictions of image-based AI models identify a COVID-19 infection with 65% accuracy when applied zero-shot (i.e., trained on other datasets), and up to 79% with targeted training, whereas the accuracy based on human annotations is at most 65%. Multi-modal models combining images and CBC improve significantly over image-only models. Although our analysis generally supports the value of AI in LUS assessment, the evaluated models fall short of the performance expected from previous work. We find this is due to 1) the heterogeneity of LUS datasets, limiting the generalization ability to new data, 2) the frame-based processing of AI models ignoring video-level information, and 3) lack of work on multi-modal models that can extract the most relevant information from video-, image- and variable-based inputs. To aid future research, we publish the dataset at: https://github.com/NinaWie/COVID-BLUES.

Abstract:
Aortic shape analysis plays a key role in cardiovascular diagnostics, treatment planning, and understanding disease progression. We present a robust, fully automated pipeline for aortic shape analysis from cardiac MRI, combining deep learning and statistical techniques across segmentation, 3D surface reconstruction, and mesh registration. We benchmark leading segmentation models including nnUNet, TotalSegmentator, and MedSAM2 highlighting the effectiveness of domain specific training and transfer learning on a curated dataset. Following segmentation, we reconstruct high quality 3D meshes and introduce a DL based mesh registration method that directly optimises vertex displacements. This approach significantly outperforms classical rigid and nonrigid methods in geometric accuracy and anatomical consistency. Using the registered meshes, we perform statistical shape analysis on a cohort of 599 healthy subjects. Principal Component Analysis reveals dominant modes of aortic shape variation, capturing both global morphology and local structural differences under rigid and similarity transformations. Our findings demonstrate the advantages of integrating traditional geometry processing with learning based models for anatomically precise and scalable aortic analysis. This work lays the groundwork for future studies into pathological shape deviations and supports the development of personalised diagnostics in cardiovascular medicine.

Abstract:
We propose MAE-SAM2, a novel foundation model for retinal vascular leakage segmentation on fluorescein angiography images. Due to the small size and dense distribution of the leakage areas, along with the limited availability of labeled clinical data, this presents a significant challenge for segmentation tasks. Our approach integrates a Self-Supervised learning (SSL) strategy, Masked Autoencoder (MAE), with SAM2. In our implementation, we explore different loss functions and conclude a task-specific combined loss. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that MAE-SAM2 outperforms several state-of-the-art models, achieving the highest Dice score and Intersection-over-Union (IoU). Compared to the original SAM2, our model achieves a $5\%$ performance improvement, highlighting the promise of foundation models with self-supervised pretraining in clinical imaging tasks.

Abstract:
Fabric-based soft robots combine high load-carrying capacity, efficiency, and low weight with the ability to bend, twist, contract, or extend with ease, making them promising candidates for biomedical applications such as soft total artificial hearts. While recent experiments have demonstrated their potential, predictive numerical models are urgently needed to study their complex mechanics, guide design optimization and improve their reliability. We develop a computational model of the Less In More Out device, a fluidically actuated soft total artificial heart constructed from heat-sealed layers of woven fabric. Our model reproduces the nonlinear deformation, strain fields, and pressure-volume relationships measured in quasi-static experiments. Devices with fewer pouches deliver higher stroke volumes but exhibit up to 50% higher peak von Mises stresses. Fatigue analysis using a strain-life approach identifies heat-sealed seams and buckling regions as durability-limiting features. Our framework enables detailed evaluation of stress concentrations, buckling, and fatigue life, providing mechanistic insights that are difficult to obtain experimentally. It also offers a foundation for the optimization of artificial hearts and other fluid actuated fabric-based soft robotic systems.

Abstract:
Objectives: The role of advanced diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in chronic liver disease (CLD) has not been fully studied. Chronic liver disease (CLD) is a progressive deterioration of liver functions, caused by one or more etiology. This study was aimed to investigate whether radiomics features extracted from individual or combined magnetic resonance imaging sequences, such as T1-weighted, T2-weighted images, or quantitative maps from chemical shift encoded, diffusion-weighted imaging, can effectively classify inflammation and fibrosis in CLD. Method: Seventy-seven patients with CLD were enrolled in this study. Each participant underwent both MRI examinations and liver biopsy. The biopsy procedure was applied to quantitatively or semi-qualitatively analyze several histology features, steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis. Radiomic features were extracted, selected, reduced, and used to train the inflammation and fibrosis classification based on random forest models. The performances of classifiers were evaluated by the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, and DeLong tests. Result: The random forest model achieved the area under the curve (AUC) of 0.85 and 0.86 for inflammation and fibrosis classification, respectively. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that the MRI-based radiomics features hold potential in the inflammation and fibrosis classification.

Abstract:
Epiboly, during which a tissue closes around the surface of the egg, pervades animal development. This epithelial gap closure involves cell intercalations at the edge of the gap. Here, inspired by serosa closure in the beetle Tribolium, we study the interplay between these plastic cell rearrangements and the elasticity of the tissue in a minimal continuum model of the closure of a circular gap bounded by a contractile actomyosin cable. We discover two different closure mechanisms at the tissue scale depending on the energy barrier $E_\text{b}$ to and the energy $ΔE$ released by intercalation: If $E_\text{b}\ggΔE$, cells intercalate into the gap to close it. For a fluidised tissue in which $E_\text{b}\llΔE$, however, cells deintercalate from the boundary into the bulk of the tissue, and we reveal an emergent mechanical role of inhomogeneities of the actomyosin cable. Our work thus explains the mechanical role of tissue fluidisation in Tribolium serosa closure and processes of epiboly and wound healing more generally.

Abstract:
Magnetic seed treatment (MST) is an effective technique for improving conditions in processes associated with germination, stability, and, ultimately, crop production. In this work, the technical management parameters related to the water adsorption process on magnetically treated Zea mays L. seeds will be determined. Models were compared to describe the experimentally obtained adsorption isotherms using nonlinear regressions. The modeling parameters, along with the Clausyus-Clapeyron equation, were used to determine the differential enthalpy, differential entropy, and Gibbs free energy present in the process. In addition, the compensation theory for this system was validated. The results indicate an overall reduction in the energy required to establish equilibrium in the water-seed system as the moisture content increases. A relationship is observed that will inject Gibbs free energy into the system at the extremes of the magnetic dose applied to the seeds. This relationship is stable as a first approximation to understand the energetic aspects when connecting the magnetic processing of seeds.

Comment: 13 pages, 5 figures

Abstract:
Across development, the morphology of fluid-filled lumina enclosed by epithelial tissues arises from an interplay of lumen pressure, mechanics of the cell cortex, and cell-cell adhesion. Here, we explore the mechanical basis for the control of this interplay using the shape space of MDCK cysts and the instability of their apical surfaces under tight junction perturbations [Mukenhirn et al., Dev. Cell 59, 2886 (2024)]. We discover that the cysts respond to these perturbations by significantly modulating their lateral and basal tensions, in addition to the known modulations of pressure and apical belt tension. We develop a mean-field three-dimensional vertex model of these cysts that reproduces the experimental shape instability quantitatively. This reveals that the observed increase of lateral contractility is a cellular response that counters the instability. Our work thus shows how regulation of the mechanics of all cell surfaces conspires to control lumen morphology.

Abstract:
Current gastric cancer (GCa) risk systems are prone to errors since they evaluate a visual estimation of intestinal metaplasia percentages in histopathology images of gastric mucosa to assign a risk. This study presents an automated method to detect and quantify intestinal metaplasia using deep convolutional neural networks as well as a comparative analysis with visual estimations of three pathologists. Gastric samples were collected from two different cohorts: 149 asymptomatic volunteers from a region with a high prevalence of GCa in Colombia and 56 patients from a tertiary hospital. Deep learning models were trained to classify intestinal metaplasia, and predictions were used to estimate a percentage of intestinal metaplasia and to assign an adapted OLGIM stage. Atrophy was not assessed because of the limited reproducibility among pathologists. Results were compared with independent blinded metaplastic assessments performed by three graduated pathologists. The best-performing deep learning architecture classified intestinal metaplasia with F1-Score of 0.80 +- 0.01 and AUC of 0.91 +- 0.01. Among pathologists, inter-observer agreement by a Fleiss's Kappa score ranged from 0.20 to 0.48. In comparison, agreement between the pathologists and the best-performing model ranged from 0.12 to 0.35. Deep learning models show potential to reliably detect and quantify the percentage of intestinal metaplasia, achieving high classification performance. In practice, visual estimation is still the only available method, yet it is marked by considerable inter-observer variability. Deep learning models provide consistent estimates that could help reduce this subjectivity in risk stratification.

Abstract:
The mitigation of stress is a key challenge for all biological systems. Conditions of unresolvable stress have been associated with a diverse array of pathologies, from cancer to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Here, I unify insights from evolutionary and developmental biology with trauma psychology to present a novel framework for tumorigenesis which synthesizes stress-perception, tissue dysfunction, and the hallmarks of neoplastic growth. This view carries therapeutic implications, suggesting a reintegrative approach that seeks to return cancer cells to the homeostatic control of the surrounding tissue.

Abstract:
Myocardial infarction causes myocardium thinning, fibrosis, and progressive heart failure. Engineered human myocardium (EHM) is tested clinically as a first-in-class product for sustainable remuscularization in patients with advanced heart failure. Current EHM production procedure from iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes and stromal cells, is time consuming and involves thin constructs. Here, I introduce 4D-DLP-printed foldable scaffolds with potential to create modular cylindrical cardiac bricks. This enables self-assembly into thicker and aligned sarcomeres with synchronous contractility mimicking a native myocardium. When optimized and integrated with cryopreservation protocols, the biomanufacturing and biobanking of these cellular building blocks may overcome current EHM limitations and advance translational regenerative therapies for myocardial infarction. The structure-material properties investigations into these new class of life building blocks paves the way for future medical breakthroughs.

Abstract:
We envision the Full-Body AI Agent as a comprehensive AI system designed to simulate, analyze, and optimize the dynamic processes of the human body across multiple biological levels. By integrating computational models, machine learning tools, and experimental platforms, this system aims to replicate and predict both physiological and pathological processes, ranging from molecules and cells to tissues, organs, and entire body systems. Central to the Full-Body AI Agent is its emphasis on integration and coordination across these biological levels, enabling analysis of how molecular changes influence cellular behaviors, tissue responses, organ function, and systemic outcomes. With a focus on biological functionality, the system is designed to advance the understanding of disease mechanisms, support the development of therapeutic interventions, and enhance personalized medicine. We propose two specialized implementations to demonstrate the utility of this framework: (1) the metastasis AI Agent, a multi-scale metastasis scoring system that characterizes tumor progression across the initiation, dissemination, and colonization phases by integrating molecular, cellular, and systemic signals; and (2) the drug AI Agent, a system-level drug development paradigm in which a drug AI-Agent dynamically guides preclinical evaluations, including organoids and chip-based models, by providing full-body physiological constraints. This approach enables the predictive modeling of long-term efficacy and toxicity beyond what localized models alone can achieve. These two agents illustrate the potential of Full-Body AI Agent to address complex biomedical challenges through multi-level integration and cross-scale reasoning.

Abstract:
Periorbital measurements such as margin reflex distances (MRD1/2), palpebral fissure height, and scleral show are essential in diagnosing and managing conditions like ptosis and eyelid disorders. We developed Glorbit, a lightweight, browser-based application for automated periorbital distance measurement using artificial intelligence, designed for use in low-resource clinical settings. The app integrates a DeepLabV3 segmentation model into a modular pipeline with secure, site-specific Google Cloud storage. Glorbit supports offline mode, local preprocessing, and cloud upload via Firebase-authenticated logins. We evaluated usability, cross-platform compatibility, and deployment readiness through a simulated enrollment study of 15 volunteers. The app completed the full workflow -- metadata entry, image capture, segmentation, and upload -- on all tested sessions without error. Glorbit successfully ran on laptops, tablets, and mobile phones across major browsers. The segmentation model succeeded on all images. Average session time was 101.7 seconds (standard deviation: 17.5). Usability survey scores (1-5 scale) were uniformly high: intuitiveness and efficiency (5.0), workflow clarity (4.8), output confidence (4.9), and clinical utility (4.9). Glorbit provides a functional, scalable solution for standardized periorbital measurement in diverse environments. It supports secure data collection and may enable future development of real-time triage tools and multimodal AI-driven oculoplastics. Tool available at: https://glorbit.app

Abstract:
The increasing global cancer burden necessitates exploration of effective and affordable treatments. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a green tea catechin, and piperine, a black pepper alkaloid, have demonstrated promising anti-cancer properties. Leveraging the regenerative capacity of Dugesia tigrina (planaria) and their neoblast stem cells as a model for cancer growth, this study investigated the combined effects of EGCG and piperine on cell proliferation. Planaria were exposed to varying concentrations of EGCG and piperine over seven days, with growth changes recorded and compared to a negative control group. Initial trials identified optimal concentrations for growth inhibition, subsequently validated in a second trial using combined EGCG and piperine treatment. Statistical analysis revealed significant differences in growth across all experimental groups (p < 0.05), indicating a synergistic effect of EGCG and piperine in limiting planarian growth. These findings suggest the potential of combined EGCG and piperine therapy for cancer and other proliferative diseases like keloids and psoriatic arthritis, warranting further investigation into clinical applications.

Abstract:
The mesoderm invagination of the Drosophila embryo is known as an archetypal morphogenic process. To explore the roles of the active cellular forces and the regulation of these forces, we developed an integrated vertex model that combines the regulation of morphogen expression with cell movements and tissue mechanics. Our results suggest that a successful furrow formation requires an apical tension gradient, decreased basal tension, and increased lateral tension, which corresponds to apical constriction, basal expansion, and apicobasal shortening respectively. Our model also considers the mechanical feedback which leads to an ectopic twist expression with external compression as observed in experiments. Our model predicts that ectopic invagination could happen if an external compressive gradient is applied.

Abstract:
Understanding the dynamic organization and homeostasis of living tissues requires high-resolution, time-resolved imaging coupled with methods capable of extracting interpretable, predictive insights from complex datasets. Here, we present the Vision Transformer Digital Twin Surrogate Network (VT-DTSN), a deep learning framework for predictive modeling of 3D+T imaging data from biological tissue. By leveraging Vision Transformers pretrained with DINO (Self-Distillation with NO Labels) and employing a multi-view fusion strategy, VT-DTSN learns to reconstruct high-fidelity, time-resolved dynamics of a Drosophila midgut while preserving morphological and feature-level integrity across imaging depths. The model is trained with a composite loss prioritizing pixel-level accuracy, perceptual structure, and feature-space alignment, ensuring biologically meaningful outputs suitable for in silico experimentation and hypothesis testing. Evaluation across layers and biological replicates demonstrates VT-DTSN's robustness and consistency, achieving low error rates and high structural similarity while maintaining efficient inference through model optimization. This work establishes VT-DTSN as a feasible, high-fidelity surrogate for cross-timepoint reconstruction and for studying tissue dynamics, enabling computational exploration of cellular behaviors and homeostasis to complement time-resolved imaging studies in biological research.

Abstract:
Diffusion models have recently gained immense interest for their generative capabilities, specifically the high quality and diversity of the synthesized data. However, examples of their applications in 3D medical imaging are still scarce, especially in cardiology. Generating diverse realistic cardiac anatomies is crucial for applications such as in silico trials, electromechanical computer simulations, or data augmentations for machine learning models. In this work, we investigate the application of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) for generating 3D meshes of human cardiac anatomies. To this end, we propose a novel LDM architecture -- MeshLDM. We apply the proposed model on a dataset of 3D meshes of left ventricular cardiac anatomies from patients with acute myocardial infarction and evaluate its performance in terms of both qualitative and quantitative clinical and 3D mesh reconstruction metrics. The proposed MeshLDM successfully captures characteristics of the cardiac shapes at end-diastolic (relaxation) and end-systolic (contraction) cardiac phases, generating meshes with a 2.4% difference in population mean compared to the gold standard.

Abstract:
Tumor-immune interactions are central to cancer progression and treatment outcomes. In this study, we present a stochastic agent-based model that integrates cellular heterogeneity, spatial cell-cell interactions, and drug resistance evolution to simulate tumor growth and immune response in a two-dimensional microenvironment. The model captures dynamic behaviors of four major cell types--tumor cells, cytotoxic T lymphocytes, helper T cells, and regulatory T cells--and incorporates key biological processes such as proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and immune regulation. Using this framework, we simulate tumor progression under different therapeutic interventions, including radiotherapy, targeted therapy, and immune checkpoint blockade. Our simulations reproduce emergent phenomena such as immune privilege and spatial immune exclusion. Quantitative analyses show that all therapies suppress tumor growth to varying degrees and reshape the tumor microenvironment. Notably, combination therapies--especially targeted therapy with immunotherapy--achieve the most effective tumor control and delay the emergence of resistance. Additionally, sensitivity analyses reveal a nonlinear relationship between treatment intensity and therapeutic efficacy, highlighting the existence of optimal dosing thresholds. This work demonstrates the utility of agent-based modeling in capturing complex tumor-immune dynamics and provides a computational platform for optimizing cancer treatment strategies. The model is extensible, biologically interpretable, and well-suited for future integration with experimental or clinical data.

Abstract:
Transcriptomic assays such as the PAM50-based ROR-P score guide recurrence risk stratification in non-metastatic, ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer but are not universally accessible. Histopathology is routinely available and may offer a scalable alternative. We introduce MAKO, a benchmarking framework evaluating 12 pathology foundation models and two non-pathology baselines for predicting ROR-P scores from H&E-stained whole slide images using attention-based multiple instance learning. Models were trained and validated on the Carolina Breast Cancer Study and externally tested on TCGA BRCA. Several foundation models outperformed baselines across classification, regression, and survival tasks. CONCH achieved the highest ROC AUC, while H-optimus-0 and Virchow2 showed top correlation with continuous ROR-P scores. All pathology models stratified CBCS participants by recurrence similarly to transcriptomic ROR-P. Tumor regions were necessary and sufficient for high-risk predictions, and we identified candidate tissue biomarkers of recurrence. These results highlight the promise of interpretable, histology-based risk models in precision oncology.

Abstract:
Information on the number and category of cervical cells is crucial for the diagnosis of cervical cancer. However, existing classification methods capable of automatically measuring this information require the training dataset to be representative, which consumes an expensive or even unaffordable human cost. We herein propose active labeling that enables us to construct a representative training dataset using a much smaller human cost for data-efficient cervical cell classification. This cost-effective method efficiently leverages the classifier's uncertainty on the unlabeled cervical cell images to accurately select images that are most beneficial to label. With a fast estimation of the uncertainty, this new algorithm exhibits its validity and effectiveness in enhancing the representative ability of the constructed training dataset. The extensive empirical results confirm its efficacy again in navigating the usage of human cost, opening the avenue for data-efficient cervical cell classification.

Abstract:
This article introduces CHESRA (Cardiac Hyperelastic Evolutionary Symbolic Regression Algorithm), a novel data-driven framework for automatically designing low-complexity hyperelastic strain energy functions (SEF) for cardiac digital twins. Cardiac digital twins require accurate yet personalized models of heart tissue elasticity, but existing SEF often suffer from high parameter variance, hindering personalization. CHESRA addresses this by using an evolutionary algorithm to derive SEF that balance accuracy and simplicity, while using a normalizing loss function to enable learning from multiple experimental datasets. CHESRA identified two novel SEF, named ψ_CH1 and ψ_CH2, which use only three and four parameters, respectively, and achieve high accuracy in fitting experimental data. Results show that the parameters of ψ_CH1 and ψ_CH2 can be estimated more consistently than those of the state-of-the-art SEF when using tissue data, with similar improvements observed for ψ_CH1 in a three-dimensional digital twin. CHESRA's utility for generating simple, generalizable SEF makes it a promising tool for advancing cardiac digital twins and clinical decision-making.

Abstract:
Pulsed field ablation (PFA) has emerged as a non-thermal alternative to traditional thermal ablation techniques for the treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF). This study presents a patient-specific 3D computational framework to model the effects of PFA on pulmonary vein isolation (PVI). The modeling framework is rigorously validated against published numerical and experimental data, demonstrating strong agreement across a range of scenarios. Using realistic left atrial (LA) anatomy, commercially available circular, flower, and basket catheter configurations are simulated to evaluate lesion formation across different applied voltages. The performance of each catheter type is quantitatively assessed using multiple metrics, including lesion volume, energy delivery efficiency and transmurality. Simulation results show that circular catheters provide the highest energy delivery efficiency and target coverage at lower voltages, while basket catheters produce the largest lesion volumes. This framework offers a useful basis for exploring catheter design and treatment planning in PFA applications.

Abstract:
Vascular access, such as arteriovenous grafts, is crucial for patients undergoing haemodialysis as part of kidney replacement therapy. One of the primary causes of arteriovenous graft failure and loss of patency is disordered blood flow, as the vein is exposed to the arterial environment with high flow rates and shear stress. We hypothesize that secondary flow downstream of the vein-graft anastomosis plays a critical role in generating low shear regions, thereby promoting neointima hyperplasia. The secondary flow highlighted here also promotes high oscillatory shear index regions downstream of the vein-graft anastomosis, further contributing to graft failure. To prolong the overall graft survival and patency, we aim to develop a strategy to optimise graft configurations with reduced levels of disturbed haemodynamics. We developed an image-based approach to build three-dimensional geometries for subsequent computational fluid dynamics (CFD) numerical simulations. This simple, yet accurate, method allowed us to improve the accuracy of geometries, thus facilitating comparisons between different vein-graft anastomotic angles.   Our results reveal that overall graft curvature (looped vs. straight) plays a dominant role in characterising the failure metrics. Looped grafts, particularly at moderate vein-graft anastomotic angles (30°-45°), exhibited the most favourable metrics, including reduced values of low wall shear stress, high wall shear stress, and high oscillatory shear index. These findings provide critical insights to inform medical professionals about graft areas that are subject to high shear stresses due to the oscillating nature of blood flow as well as the graft geometric configuration when performing surgery. The model developed in this work offers a framework enabling personalised vascular access strategies tailored to individual patient needs.

Abstract:
Accelerated Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) requires careful optimization of k-space sampling patterns to balance acquisition speed and image quality. While recent advances in deep learning have shown promise in optimizing Cartesian sampling, the potential of reinforcement learning (RL) for non-Cartesian trajectory optimization remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present a novel RL framework for optimizing radial sampling trajectories in cardiac MRI. Our approach features a dual-branch architecture that jointly processes k-space and image-domain information, incorporating a cross-attention fusion mechanism to facilitate effective information exchange between domains. The framework employs an anatomically-aware reward design and a golden-ratio sampling strategy to ensure uniform k-space coverage while preserving cardiac structural details. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively learns optimal radial sampling strategies across multiple acceleration factors, achieving improved reconstruction quality compared to conventional approaches.

Abstract:
Histopathological analysis has been transformed by serial section-based methods, advancing beyond traditional 2D histology to enable volumetric and microstructural insights in oncology and inflammatory disease diagnostics. This review outlines key developments in specimen preparation and high-throughput imaging that support these innovations. Computational workflows are categorized into multimodal image co-registration, 3D histoarchitecture reconstruction, multiplexed immunohistochemical correlation, and cross-scale data fusion. These approaches exploit serial section-derived spatial concordance to enhance resolution in microenvironmental and molecular profiling. Despite progress, challenges remain in harmonizing heterogeneous datasets, optimizing large-scale registration, and ensuring interpretability. Future directions include spatial transcriptomics, and applications in developmental biology and neuroscience in AI integration, establishing serial section analytics as central to precision histopathology.

Abstract:
Spatial transcriptomics enables simultaneous measurement of gene expression and tissue morphology, offering unprecedented insights into cellular organization and disease mechanisms. However, the field lacks comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating multimodal learning methods that leverage both histology images and gene expression data. Here, we present HESCAPE, a large-scale benchmark for cross-modal contrastive pretraining in spatial transcriptomics, built on a curated pan-organ dataset spanning 6 different gene panels and 54 donors. We systematically evaluated state-of-the-art image and gene expression encoders across multiple pretraining strategies and assessed their effectiveness on two downstream tasks: gene mutation classification and gene expression prediction. Our benchmark demonstrates that gene expression encoders are the primary determinant of strong representational alignment, and that gene models pretrained on spatial transcriptomics data outperform both those trained without spatial data and simple baseline approaches. However, downstream task evaluation reveals a striking contradiction: while contrastive pretraining consistently improves gene mutation classification performance, it degrades direct gene expression prediction compared to baseline encoders trained without cross-modal objectives. We identify batch effects as a key factor that interferes with effective cross-modal alignment. Our findings highlight the critical need for batch-robust multimodal learning approaches in spatial transcriptomics. To accelerate progress in this direction, we release HESCAPE, providing standardized datasets, evaluation protocols, and benchmarking tools for the community

There is an unmet need for artificial intelligence techniques that can speed up the design of growth strategies for cultured tissues. Cultured tissue is increasingly important for a range of applications such as cultivated meat, pharmaceutical assays and regenerative medicine. In this paper, we introduce a method based around evolutionary strategies, machine learning and biophysical simulations that can be used to speed up the process of identifying new tissue growth strategies for these diverse applications. We demonstrate the method by designing tethering strategies to grow tissues containing various cell types with desirable properties such as high cellular alignment and uniform density.

Abstract:
Understanding cancer cell differentiation is essential for advancing its detection, diagnosis, and treatment. Mathematical models significantly contribute to this by providing a theoretical framework to understand the complex interactions between cancer stem cells, differentiated cancer cells, and immune system components. Such models depend on experimental data and computational simulations to predict tumor dynamics, offering insights into how different cell populations evolve over time. However, to ensure their realistic and consistent outcomes, rigorous mathematical analysis is required, including verification of solution uniqueness, stability, viability, positivity, and boundedness. Such validation guarantees that model's results can be used in both oncological research and clinical applications. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of an integrative mathematical model of cancer cell differentiation, with a particular focus on its interactions with immune cells. The model captures the dynamic balance between cancer stem cell self-renewal, differentiation into mature tumor cells, and immune-mediated elimination. By employing analytical and numerical techniques, we assess the model's feasibility, stability, and long-term behavior under various biological conditions. Our findings demonstrate that immune system engagement can significantly influence tumor composition and growth, highlighting potential therapeutic targets. This work not only advances theoretical cancer modeling but also provides a foundation for future experimental validation and the development of combined differentiation-immunotherapy approaches. The results underscore the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in the fight against cancer.

Abstract:
Even simple tactile stimuli can lead to remarkably different perceptions among individuals, both in intensity and pleasantness. To understand the physical factors behind this variation, it is important to investigate how mechanical events are transmitted through the skin. In this study, we visualize the internal skin strains in response to soft brushing stimuli using functional Optical Coherence Tomography (fOCT), which provides depth-resolved time-series data of the displacement of the skin. Driven with custom-made software, the system enabled sub-surface imaging at a refresh rate of 10 kHz. Brushing was applied to the back of the hand, and skin displacement was observed at different depths. The results show that each skin layer responds differently to the stimulus, suggesting that internal skin dynamics play a role in tactile perception. This method offers a way to investigate how mechanical events within the skin relate to sensory function.

Abstract:
Computational pathology (CPath) has shown great potential in mining actionable insights from Whole Slide Images (WSIs). Deep Learning (DL) has been at the center of modern CPath, and while it delivers unprecedented performance, it is also known that DL may be affected by irrelevant details, such as those introduced during scanning by different commercially available scanners. This may lead to scanner bias, where the model outputs for the same tissue acquired by different scanners may vary. In turn, it hinders the trust of clinicians in CPath-based tools and their deployment in real-world clinical practices. Recent pathology Foundation Models (FMs) promise to provide better domain generalization capabilities. In this paper, we benchmark FMs using a multi-scanner dataset and show that FMs still suffer from scanner bias. Following this observation, we propose ScanGen, a contrastive loss function applied during task-specific fine-tuning that mitigates scanner bias, thereby enhancing the models' robustness to scanner variations. Our approach is applied to the Multiple Instance Learning task of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutation prediction from H\&E-stained WSIs in lung cancer. We observe that ScanGen notably enhances the ability to generalize across scanners, while retaining or improving the performance of EGFR mutation prediction.

Abstract:
Morphoelasticity represents a foundational theory for tracing back growth, remodelling, and morphogenesis, yet crucial challenges persist. A unified growth law -- independent of a priori assumptions about constitutive relations or specified structures of the growth tensor -- remains in fact elusive, as does an intimate connection between local anisotropic growth, morphogenesis dynamics, diffusion phenomena and mechanics. When anisotropy of growth is not prescribed arbitrarily, current frameworks mainly attribute shape emergence to growth-induced global configurational switches, somehow neglecting the existence of local drivers of spontaneous patterning or distorsions also in stress-free conditions. To overcome these limitations, in this work we propose a theoretical approach that reformulates anisotropic growth, remodeling, and morphogenesis starting from first principles, grounded in mass balance. In particular, by positing mass conservation as the sole dynamic constraint for the growth problem, we generalize the mass balance equation to derive evolution laws for mass distribution and geometric reconfiguration. This reveals how mass transport and associated microstructural evolution of the tissue fabric synergistically guide biological, geometric, and constitutive changes of living matter, with the isochoric component of growth orchestrating local anisotropy and, at the macroscale, even spontaneous shape development. The proposed fully coupled modelling approach integrates chemo-mechanical and biological interactions inherent to living systems, offering a pathway to investigate complex scenarios in growth and morphogenesis, redefining the latter in a Continuum Mechanics framework. It is felt that this strategy could help to take a step forward a unified perspective for biomechanical and mechanobiological problems, bridging scales from local drivers to emergent tissue forms and shapes.

Abstract:
The emergence of spatial patterns and organized growth is a hallmark of developing tissues. While symmetry-breaking and scaling laws govern these processes, how cells coordinate spatial patterning with size regulation remains unclear. Here, we combine quantitative imaging, a Turing activator-repressor model with self-organized reactive boundaries, and in vitro models of early mouse development to study mesodermal pattern formation in two-dimensional (2D) gastruloids. We show that colony size dictates symmetry: small colonies (radius approximately 100 micrometers) spontaneously break symmetry, while larger ones remain centro-symmetric, consistent with size-dependent positional information and model predictions. The mesodermal domain area scales robustly with colony size following a power law, independent of cell density, indicating that cells sense and respond to gastruloid size. Time-lapse imaging reveals a biphasic growth law: an early power-law expansion followed by exponential arrest, marking a dynamical phase transition. These dynamics, conserved across sizes, reflect features of criticality seen in physical systems, where self-organization, scaling, and boundary feedback converge. Our findings uncover a minimal mechanism for size-dependent pattern formation and growth control. This framework enables quantitative investigation of symmetry-breaking and scaling in self-organizing tissues, offering insights into the physical principles underlying multicellular organization.

Tumor organoid-on-a-chip platforms represent a cutting-edge fusion of patient-derived organoids with microfluidic technologies, offering unprecedented capabilities for personalized cancer research. These systems overcome limitations of conventional models by enabling precise control over the tumor microenvironment, including nutrient gradients, fluid flow, and immune interactions. Tumor organoids recapitulate patient-specific tumor heterogeneity and genetic landscapes, while microfluidic chips provide dynamic perfusion and mechanical stimuli, enhancing physiological relevance. Together, they facilitate advanced applications such as high-throughput drug screening, immunotherapy testing, and metastasis modeling, showing superior predictive power for clinical outcomes. Despite challenges in standardization, scalability, and integration of complex tumor components, ongoing advances in hydrogel engineering, automation, and artificial intelligence are poised to accelerate their clinical translation. This review highlights current technologies, applications, and future directions of tumor organoid-on-a-chip systems, emphasizing their transformative potential in precision oncology.

Abstract:
BACKGROUND: Primary aldosteronism is the most common form of secondary hypertension. The most frequent genetic cause of aldosterone-producing adenomas is somatic mutations in the potassium channel KCNJ5. They affect the ion selectivity of the channel, with sodium influx leading to cell membrane depolarization and activation of calcium signaling, the major trigger for aldosterone biosynthesis. METHODS: To investigate how KCNJ5 mutations lead to the development of aldosterone-producing adenomas, we established an adrenocortical cell model in which sodium entry into the cells can be modulated on demand using chemogenetic tools [H295R-S2 $α$7-5HT3-R ($α$7-5HT3 receptor) cells]. We investigated their functional and molecular characteristics with regard to aldosterone biosynthesis and cell proliferation. RESULTS: A clonal cell line with stable expression of the chimeric $α$7-5HT3-R in H295R-S2 (human adrenocortical carcinoma cell line, Strain 2) cells was obtained. Increased sodium entry through $α$7-5HT3-R upon stimulation with uPSEM-817 (uPharmacologically Selective Effector Molecule-817) led to cell membrane depolarization, opening of voltage-gated Ca 2+ channels, and increased intracellular Ca 2+ concentrations, resulting in the stimulation of CYP11B2 expression and increased aldosterone biosynthesis. Increased intracellular sodium influx did not increase proliferation but rather induced apoptosis. RNA sequencing and steroidome analyses revealed unique profiles associated with Na + entry, with only partial overlap with Ang II (angiotensin II) or potassium-induced changes. CONCLUSIONS: H295R-S2 $α$7-5HT3-R cells are a new model reproducing the major features of cells harboring KCNJ5 mutations. Increased expression of CYP11B2 and stimulation of the mineralocorticoid biosynthesis pathway are associated with a decrease of cell proliferation and an increase of apoptosis, indicating that additional events may be required for the development of aldosterone-producing adenomas.

Abstract:
Model-based clustering is widely used for identifying and distinguishing types of diseases. However, modern biomedical data coming with high dimensions make it challenging to perform the model estimation in traditional cluster analysis. The incorporation of factor analyzer into the mixture model provides a way to characterize the large set of data features, but the current estimation method is computationally impractical for massive data due to the intrinsic slow convergence of the embedded algorithms, and the incapability to vary the size of the factor analyzers, preventing the implementation of a generalized mixture of factor analyzers and further characterization of the data clusters. We propose a hybrid matrix-free computational scheme to efficiently estimate the clusters and model parameters based on a Gaussian mixture along with generalized factor analyzers to summarize the large number of variables using a small set of underlying factors. Our approach outperforms the existing method with faster convergence while maintaining high clustering accuracy. Our algorithms are applied to accurately identify and distinguish types of breast cancer based on large tumor samples, and to provide a generalized characterization for subtypes of lymphoma using massive gene records.

Abstract:
We propose and analyze a hierarchy of three models of blood perfusion through a tissue surrounding a thin arteriole or venule. Our goal is to rigorously link 3D-3D Darcy--Stokes, 3D-1D Darcy--Poiseuille, and 1D Green's function methods commonly used to model this process. Here in Part II, we consider the most detailed level, a 3D-3D Darcy-Stokes system coupled across the permeable vessel surface by mass conservation and pressure/stress balance conditions. We derive a convergence result between the 3D-3D model and both the 3D-1D Darcy--Poiseuille model and 1D Green's function model proposed in Part I [Ohm \& Strikwerda, arXiv preprint July 2025] at a rate proportional to $ε^{1/6}|\logε|$, where $ε$ is the maximum vessel radius. The rate is limited by the inclusion of a degenerate endpoint where the vessel radius vanishes, i.e. becomes indistinguishable from a capillary. Key to our proof are \emph{a priori} estimates for the 1D integrodifferential model obtained in Part I.

We propose and analyze a family of models describing blood perfusion through a tissue surrounding a thin blood vessel. Our goal is to rigorously establish convergence results among 3D-3D Darcy--Stokes, 3D-1D Darcy--Poiseuille, and 1D Green's function methods commonly used to model this process. In Part I, we propose a 3D-1D Darcy--Poiseuille system where the coupling across the permeable vessel surface involves an angle-averaged Neumann boundary condition coupled with a geometrically constrained Robin boundary condition. We show that this model is well-posed and moreover limits to a 1D Green's function model as the maximum vessel radius $ε\to 0$. In the 1D model, the exterior blood pressure is given by an explicit Green's function expression involving the interior blood pressure. The interior pressure satisfies a novel 1D integrodifferential equation in which the integral term incorporates the effects of the exterior pressure and the vessel geometry. Much of this paper is devoted to analyzing this integrodifferential equation. Using the \emph{a priori} bounds obtained here, we show that the solution to the 1D model converges to the 3D-1D solution with a rate proportional to $ε^{1/2}|\logε|$. In Part II [Ohm \& Strikwerda, arXiv preprint July 2025], we rely on the 1D estimates to show that both the 1D and 3D-1D models converge to a coupled 3D-3D Darcy-Stokes system as $ε\to 0$, thereby establishing a convergence chain among all hierarchy levels.

Abstract:
Synthetic molecular communication (SMC) is a key enabler for future healthcare systems in which Internet of Bio-Nano-Things (IoBNT) devices facilitate the continuous monitoring of a patient's biochemical signals. To close the loop between sensing and actuation, both the detection and the generation of in-body molecular communication (MC) signals is key. However, generating signals inside the human body, e.g., via synthetic nanodevices, poses a challenge in SMC, due to technological obstacles as well as legal, safety, and ethical issues. Hence, this paper considers an SMC system in which signals are generated indirectly via the modulation of a natural in-body MC system, namely the gut-brain axis (GBA). Therapeutic GBA modulation is already established as treatment for neurological diseases, e.g., drug refractory epilepsy (DRE), and performed via the administration of nutritional supplements or specific diets. However, the molecular signaling pathways that mediate the effect of such treatments are mostly unknown. Consequently, existing treatments are standardized or designed heuristically and able to help only some patients while failing to help others. In this paper, we propose to leverage personal health data, e.g., gathered by in-body IoBNT devices, to design more versatile and robust GBA modulation-based treatments as compared to the existing ones. To show the feasibility of our approach, we define a catalog of theoretical requirements for therapeutic GBA modulation. Then, we propose a machine learning model to verify these requirements for practical scenarios when only limited data on the GBA modulation exists. By evaluating the proposed model on several datasets, we confirm its excellent accuracy in identifying different modulators of the GBA. Finally, we utilize the proposed model to identify specific modulatory pathways that play an important role for therapeutic GBA modulation.

Abstract:
Plain X-ray is one of the most common image modalities for clinical diagnosis (e.g. bone fracture, pneumonia, cancer screening, etc.). X-ray image segmentation is an essential step for many computer-aided diagnostic systems, yet it remains challenging. Deep-learning-based methods have achieved superior performance in medical image segmentation tasks but often require a large amount of high-quality annotated data for model training. Providing such an annotated dataset is not only time-consuming but also requires a high level of expertise. This is particularly challenging in wrist bone segmentation in X-rays, due to the interposition of multiple small carpal bones in the image. To overcome the data annotation issue, this work utilizes a large number of simulated X-ray images generated from Computed Tomography (CT) volumes with their corresponding 10 bone labels to train a deep learning-based model for wrist bone segmentation in real X-ray images. The proposed method was evaluated using both simulated images and real images. The method achieved Dice scores ranging from 0.80 to 0.92 for the simulated dataset generated from different view angles. Qualitative analysis of the segmentation results of the real X-ray images also demonstrated the superior performance of the trained model. The trained model and X-ray simulation code are freely available for research purposes: the link will be provided upon acceptance.

Abstract:
Breast cancer is a significant global health issue, and the diagnosis of breast cancer through imaging remains challenging. Mammography images are characterized by extremely high resolution, while lesions often occupy only a small portion of the image. Down-sampling in neural networks can easily lead to the loss of microcalcifications or subtle structures. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Context Clustering based triple information fusion framework. First, in comparison to CNNs or transformers, we observe that Context clustering methods are (1) more computationally efficient and (2) better at associating structural or pathological features. This makes them particularly well-suited for mammography in clinical settings. Next, we propose a triple information fusion mechanism that integrates global, feature-based local, and patch-based local information. The proposed approach is rigorously evaluated on two public datasets, Vindr-Mammo and CBIS-DDSM, using five independent data splits to ensure statistical robustness. Our method achieves an AUC of 0.828 \pm 0.020 on Vindr-Mammo and 0.805 \pm 0.020 on CBIS-DDSM, outperforming the second best method by 3.5% and 2.5%, respectively. These improvements are statistically significant (p<0.05), highlighting the advantages of the Context Clustering Network with triple information fusion. Overall, our Context Clustering framework demonstrates strong potential as a scalable and cost-effective solution for large-scale mammography screening, enabling more efficient and accurate breast cancer detection.

Abstract:
Background - Pulmonary insufficiency is a consequence of transannular patch repair in Tetralogy of Fallot (ToF), leading to late morbidity and mortality. Transcatheter native outflow tract pulmonary valve replacement (TPVR) has become common, but assessment of patient candidacy and selection of the optimal device remains challenging. We demonstrate an integrated open-source workflow for simulation of TPVR in image-derived models to inform device selection.   Methods - Machine learning-based segmentation of CT scans was implemented to define the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT). A custom workflow for device positioning and pre-compression was implemented in SlicerHeart. Resulting geometries were exported to FEBio for simulation. Visualization of results and quantification were performed using custom metrics implemented in SlicerHeart and FEBio.   Results - RVOT model creation and device placement could be completed in under 1 minute. Virtual device placement using FE simulations visually mimicked actual device placement and allowed quantification of vessel strain, stress, and contact area. Regions of higher strain and stress were observed at the proximal and distal end locations of the TPVs where the devices impinge the RVOT wall. No other consistent trends were observed across simulations. The observed variability in mechanical metrics across RVOTS, stents, and locations in the RVOT highlights that no single device performs optimally in all anatomies, thereby reinforcing the need for simulation-based patient-specific assessment.   Conclusions - This study demonstrates the feasibility of a novel open-source workflow for the rapid simulation of TPVR which with further refinement may inform assessment of patient candidacy and optimal device selection.

Abstract:
Mechanical contributions are crucial regulators of diverse biological processes, yet their \textit{in vivo} measurement remains challenging due to limitations of current techniques, that can be destructive or require complex dedicated setups. This study introduces a novel method to synthesize biocompatible, self-functionalizing stress sensors based on inverted emulsions, that can be used to probe stresses inside tissues but can also locally perturb the biological environment through specific binder presentation or drug delivery. We engineered an optimal design for these inverted emulsions, focusing on finding the balance between the two contradictory constraints: achieving low surface tension for deformability while maintaining emulsion instability for efficient self-functionalization and drug release. Proof-of-concept experiments in both agarose gels and complex biological systems, including brain organoids and zebrafish embryos, confirm the droplets ability to deform in response to mechanical stress applied within the tissue, to self-functionalize and to release encapsulated molecules locally. These versatile sensors offer a method for non-invasive stress measurements and targeted chemical delivery within living biological tissues, giving the potential to overcome current technical barriers in biophysical studies.

Abstract:
The villi and crypts of the gastrointestinal tract increase the effective surface area of the intestinal mucosa, potentially enhancing nutrient absorption. It is commonly assumed that this is their primary function, and that a higher villi density necessarily leads to improved absorption. However, when villi are packed too closely together, diffusion can be hindered, potentially offsetting this benefit. In this work, we investigate the relationship between the density of these structures and the overall efficiency of absorption. In three different simplified geometries, approximating crypts, leaf-like villi, and finger-like villi we calculate analytically the concentration profile and the absorption flux, assuming that there is only diffusion between these structures while the lumen is well mixed. When plotting the absorption flux per unit of gut length as a function of the structures' density, we observe that there is a density maximizing absorption. We study numerically this optimum. It depends weakly on the absorption properties of the given nutrient, so that a geometry optimal for one nutrient is close to optimum for another nutrient. Physiological data from various animal species align with this predicted optimal range and potentially reflect evolutionary selection for efficient nutrient uptake, supporting the model's validity.

Abstract:
A significant hallmark of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is fiber disarray, which is associated with various cardiac events such as heart failure. Quantifying fiber disarray remains critical for understanding the disease s complex pathophysiology. This study investigates the role of heterogeneous HCM-induced cellular abnormalities in the development of fiber disarray and their subsequent impact on cardiac pumping function. Fiber disarray is predicted using a stress-based law to reorient myofibers and collagen within a multiscale finite element cardiac modeling framework, MyoFE. Specifically, the model is used to quantify the distinct impacts of heterogeneous distributions of hypercontractility, hypocontractility, and fibrosis on fiber disarray development and examines their effect on functional characteristics of the heart. Our results show that heterogenous cell level abnormalities highly disrupt the normal mechanics of myocardium and lead to significant fiber disarray. The pattern of disarray varies depending on the specific perturbation, offering valuable insights into the progression of HCM. Despite the random distribution of perturbed regions within the cardiac muscle, significantly higher fiber disarray is observed near the epicardium compared to the endocardium across all perturbed left ventricle (LV) models. This regional difference in fiber disarray, irrespective of perturbation severity, aligns with previous DT-MRI studies, highlighting the role of regional myocardial mechanics in the development of fiber disarray. Furthermore, cardiac performance declined in the remodeled LVs, particularly in those with fibrosis and hypocontractility. These findings provide important insights into the structural and functional consequences of HCM and offer a framework for future investigations into therapeutic interventions targeting cardiac remodeling.

Abstract:
Recent trials of a neuronal pacemaker have shown that cardiac pumping efficiency increases when respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) is artificially restored in animal models of heart failure. This novel device sheds new light on the functional role of RSA, which has long been debated, by allowing the strength of cardiorespiratory coupling to be artificially varied. Here we show that RSA minimizes the cardiac power dissipated within the cardiovascular network. The cardiorespiratory system is found to exhibit mode-locked synchronized regions within which viscoelastic dissipation is reduced relative to the scenario where cardiorespiratory coupling is absent. We determine the gain in cardiac output as the magnitude of RSA increases. We find that cardiac pumping efficiency improves up and until the cardiac frequency, within each breadth intake, is approximately 1.5 times greater than the cardiac frequency in the expiratory phase, at which point it reaches a plateau. RSA was found to be most effective at low cardiac frequencies, in good agreement with clinical evidence. Simulation of the cardiac power saved under RSA is in good agreement with the 17-20% increase in cardiac output observed in RSA-paced animal models.

Abstract:
Technological breakthroughs in spatial omics and artificial intelligence (AI) have the potential to transform the understanding of cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment. Here we review the role of AI in spatial omics, discussing the current state-of-the-art and further needs to decipher cancer biology from large-scale spatial tissue data. An overarching challenge is the development of interpretable spatial AI models, an activity which demands not only improved data integration, but also new conceptual frameworks. We discuss emerging paradigms, in particular data-driven spatial AI, constraint-based spatial AI, and mechanistic spatial modeling, as well as the importance of integrating AI with hypothesis-driven strategies and model systems to realize the value of cancer spatial information.

Abstract:
This study introduces the first 3D spectral-element method (SEM) simulation of ultrasonic wave propagation in a bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) head. Unlike traditional finite-element methods (FEM), which struggle with high-frequency simulations due to costly linear-system inversions and slower convergence, SEM offers exponential convergence and efficient parallel computation. Using Computed Tomography (CT) scan data, we developed a detailed hexahedral mesh capturing complex anatomical features, such as acoustic fats and jaws. Our simulations of plane and spherical waves confirm SEM's effectiveness for ultrasonic time-domain modeling. This approach opens new avenues for marine biology, contributing to research in echolocation, the impacts of anthropogenic marine noise pollution and the biophysics of hearing and click generation in marine mammals. By overcoming FEM's limitations, SEM provides a powerful scalable tool to test hypotheses about dolphin bioacoustics, with significant implications for conservation and understanding marine mammal auditory systems under increasing environmental challenges.
