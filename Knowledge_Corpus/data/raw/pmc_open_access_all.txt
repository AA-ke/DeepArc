Abstract:
Considerable efforts have been made to characterize active enhancer elements, which can be annotated by accessible chromatin and H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac). However, apart from poised enhancers that are observed in early stages of development and putative silencers, the functional significance of cis -regulatory elements lacking H3K27ac is poorly understood. Here we show that macroH2A histone variants mark a subset of enhancers in normal and cancer cells, which we coined ‘macro-Bound Enhancers’, that modulate enhancer activity. We find macroH2A variants localized at enhancer elements that are devoid of H3K27ac in a cell type-specific manner, indicating a role for macroH2A at inactive enhancers to maintain cell identity. In following, reactivation of macro-bound enhancers is associated with oncogenic programs in breast cancer and their repressive role is correlated with the activity of macroH2A2 as a negative regulator of BRD4 chromatin occupancy. Finally, through single cell epigenomic profiling of normal mammary stem cells derived from mice, we show that macroH2A deficiency facilitates increased activity of transcription factors associated with stem cell activity.

Title: NeuronMotif: Deciphering cis-regulatory codes by layer-wise demixing of deep neural networks

Abstract:
Cis-regulatory sequences regulate the expression of nearby genes. Recently, remarkable advances in our ability to predict the function of cis-regulatory sequences have been achieved by using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, the difficulty in interpreting these CNNs has hindered the translation of these advances to better understanding of the cis-regulatory code. The main difficulty is due to the problem of multifaceted CNN neurons, each of which can recognize multiple types of patterns. Visualizing a multifaceted neuron in one image will result in a mixed pattern that is hard to interpret. To address this difficulty, we propose an algorithm capable of revealing the individual facets of deep neurons, which enables better understanding of the cis-regulatory codes embedded in the state-of-the-art CNNs.

Abstract:
Despite extensive mapping of cis-regulatory elements (cREs) across cellular contexts with chromatin accessibility assays, the sequence syntax and genetic variants that regulate transcription factor (TF) binding and chromatin accessibility at context-specific cREs remain elusive. We introduce ChromBPNet, a deep learning DNA sequence model of base-resolution accessibility profiles that detects, learns and deconvolves assay-specific enzyme biases from regulatory sequence determinants of accessibility, enabling robust discovery of compact TF motif lexicons, cooperative motif syntax and precision footprints across assays and sequencing depths. Extensive benchmarks show that ChromBPNet, despite its lightweight design, is competitive with much larger contemporary models at predicting variant effects on chromatin accessibility, pioneer TF binding and reporter activity across assays, cell contexts and ancestry, while providing interpretation of disrupted regulatory syntax. ChromBPNet also helps prioritize and interpret regulatory variants that influence complex traits and rare diseases, thereby providing a powerful lens to decode regulatory DNA and genetic variation.

Title: G-quadruplexes as pivotal components of cis -regulatory elements in the human genome
Authors: Rongxin Zhang, Yuqi Wang, Cheng Wang, Xiao Sun, Jean-Louis Mergny
Date: 2024-08-26

Abstract:
Cis -regulatory elements (CREs) are crucial for regulating gene expression, and G-quadruplexes (G4s), as prototypal non-canonical DNA structures, may play a role in this regulation. However, the relationship between G4s and CREs, especially with non-promoter-like functional elements, requires further systematic investigation. We aimed to investigate the associations between G4s and human cCREs (candidate CREs) inferred from the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) data. We found that G4s are prominently enriched in most types of cCREs, especially those with promoter-like signatures (PLS). The co-occurrence of CTCF signals with H3K4me3 or H3K27ac signals strengthens the association between cCREs and G4s. Genetic variants in G4s, particularly within their G-runs, exhibit higher regulatory potential and deleterious effects compared to cCREs. The G-runs within G4s near transcriptional start sites (TSSs) are more evolutionarily constrained compared to G-runs in cCREs, while those far from the TSS are relatively less conserved. The presence of G4s is often linked to a more favorable local chromatin environment for the activation and execution of regulatory function of cCREs, potentially attributable to the formation of G4 secondary structures. Finally, we discovered that G4-associated cCREs exhibit widespread activation in a variety of cancers. Our study suggests that G4s are integral components of human cis -regulatory elements, extending beyond their potential role in promoters. The G4 primary sequences are associated with the localization of CREs, while the G4 structures are linked to the activation of these elements. Therefore, we propose defining G4s as pivotal regulatory elements in the human genome. The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12915-024-01971-5.

Title: Crosstalk between paralogs and isoforms influences p63-dependent regulatory element activity
Authors: Gabriele Baniulyte, Abby A McCann, Dana L Woodstock, Morgan A Sammons
Date: 2024-12-11

Abstract:
The p53 family of transcription factors (p53, p63 and p73) regulate diverse organismal processes including tumor suppression, maintenance of genome integrity and the development of skin and limbs. Crosstalk between transcription factors with highly similar DNA binding profiles, like those in the p53 family, can dramatically alter gene regulation. While p53 is primarily associated with transcriptional activation, p63 mediates both activation and repression. The specific mechanisms controlling p63-dependent gene regulatory activity are not well understood. Here, we use massively parallel reporter assays (MPRA) to investigate how local DNA sequence context influences p63-dependent transcriptional activity. Most regulatory elements with a p63 response element motif (p63RE) activate transcription, although binding of the p63 paralog, p53, drives a substantial proportion of that activity. p63RE sequence content and co-enrichment with other known activating and repressing transcription factors, including lineage-specific factors, correlates with differential p63RE-mediated activities. p63 isoforms dramatically alter transcriptional behavior, primarily shifting inactive regulatory elements towards high p63-dependent activity. Our analysis provides novel insight into how local sequence and cellular context influences p63-dependent behaviors and highlights the key, yet still understudied, role of transcription factor paralogs and isoforms in controlling gene regulatory element activity.

Abstract:
Noncoding DNA is central to our understanding of human gene regulation and complex diseases 1 , 2 , and measuring the evolutionary sequence constraint can establish the functional relevance of putative regulatory elements in the human genome 3 – 9 . Identifying the genomic elements that have become constrained specifically in primates has been hampered by the faster evolution of noncoding DNA compared to protein-coding DNA 10 , the relatively short timescales separating primate species 11 , and the previously limited availability of whole-genome sequences 12 . Here we construct a whole-genome alignment of 239 species, representing nearly half of all extant species in the primate order. Using this resource, we identified human regulatory elements that are under selective constraint across primates and other mammals at a 5% false discovery rate. We detected 111,318 DNase I hypersensitivity sites and 267,410 transcription factor binding sites that are constrained specifically in primates but not across other placental mammals and validate their cis -regulatory effects on gene expression. These regulatory elements are enriched for human genetic variants that affect gene expression and complex traits and diseases. Our results highlight the important role of recent evolution in regulatory sequence elements differentiating primates, including humans, from other placental mammals.

Abstract:
Altered transcription is a cardinal feature of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), however, exactly how mutations synergize to remodel the epigenetic landscape and rewire 3-Dimensional (3D) DNA topology is unknown. Here we apply an integrated genomic approach to a murine allelic series that models the two most common mutations in AML, Flt3 -ITD and Npm1c . We then deconvolute the contribution of each mutation to alterations of the epigenetic landscape and genome organization, and infer how mutations synergize in the induction of AML. Our studies demonstrate that Flt3-ITD signals to chromatin to alter the epigenetic environment and synergizes with Npm1c mutation to alter gene expression and drive leukemia induction. These analyses also allow the identification of long-range cis -regulatory circuits, including a novel super-enhancer of Hoxa locus, as well as larger and more detailed gene-regulatory networks, driven by transcription factors including PU.1 and IRF8, whose importance we demonstrate through perturbation of network members.

Title: A comprehensive map of preferentially located motifs reveals distinct proximal cis -regulatory sequences in plants

Date: 2022-10-12

Abstract:
Identification of cis -regulatory sequences controlling gene expression is an arduous challenge that is being actively explored to discover key genetic factors responsible for traits of agronomic interest. Here, we used a genome-wide de novo approach to investigate preferentially located motifs (PLMs) in the proximal cis -regulatory landscape of Arabidopsis thaliana and Zea mays . We report three groups of PLMs in both the 5’- and 3’-gene-proximal regions and emphasize conserved PLMs in both species, particularly in the 3’-gene-proximal region. Comparison with resources from transcription factor and microRNA binding sites shows that 79% of the identified PLMs are unassigned, although some are supported by MNase-defined cistrome occupancy analysis. Enrichment analyses further reveal that unassigned PLMs provide functional predictions that differ from those derived from transcription factor and microRNA binding sites. Our study provides a comprehensive map of PLMs and demonstrates their potential utility for future characterization of orphan genes in plants.

Title: Accurate prediction of cis -regulatory modules reveals a prevalent regulatory genome of humans
Authors: Pengyu Ni, Zhengchang Su
Date: 2021-06

Abstract:
 cis -regulatory modules(CRMs) formed by clusters of transcription factor (TF) binding sites (TFBSs) are as important as coding sequences in specifying phenotypes of humans. It is essential to categorize all CRMs and constituent TFBSs in the genome. In contrast to most existing methods that predict CRMs in specific cell types using epigenetic marks, we predict a largely cell type agonistic but more comprehensive map of CRMs and constituent TFBSs in the gnome by integrating all available TF ChIP-seq datasets. Our method is able to partition 77.47% of genome regions covered by available 6092 datasets into a CRM candidate (CRMC) set (56.84%) and a non-CRMC set (43.16%). Intriguingly, the predicted CRMCs are under strong evolutionary constraints, while the non-CRMCs are largely selectively neutral, strongly suggesting that the CRMCs are likely cis -regulatory, while the non-CRMCs are not. Our predicted CRMs are under stronger evolutionary constraints than three state-of-the-art predictions (GeneHancer, EnhancerAtlas and ENCODE phase 3) and substantially outperform them for recalling VISTA enhancers and non-coding ClinVar variants. We estimated that the human genome might encode about 1.47M CRMs and 68M TFBSs, comprising about 55% and 22% of the genome, respectively; for both of which, we predicted 80%. Therefore, the cis -regulatory genome appears to be more prevalent than originally thought.

Abstract:
The complex transcriptional regulatory network leads to the poor prognosis of glioma. The role of orphan CpG islands (oCGIs) in the transcriptional regulatory network has been overlooked. We conducted a comprehensive exploration of the cis -regulatory roles of oCGIs and enhancers by integrating multi-omics data. Direct regulation of target genes by oCGIs or enhancers is of great importance in the cis -regulatory network. Furthermore, based on single-cell multi-omics data, we found that the highly activated cis -regulatory network in cluster 2 (C2) sustains the high proliferative potential of glioma cells. The upregulation of oCGIs and enhancers related genes in C2 results in glioma patients exhibiting resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. These findings were further validated through glioma cell line related experiments. Our study offers insight into the pathogenesis of glioma and provides a strategy to treat this challenging disease.

Abstract:
Enhancers are genomic DNA elements controlling spatiotemporal gene expression. Their flexible organization and functional redundancies make deciphering their sequence-function relationships challenging. This article provides an overview of the current understanding of enhancer organization and evolution, with an emphasis on factors that influence these relationships. Technological advancements, particularly in machine learning and synthetic biology, are discussed in light of how they provide new ways to understand this complexity. Exciting opportunities lie ahead as we continue to unravel the intricacies of enhancer function. The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s13059-023-02955-4.

Title: Epigenetic characterization of housekeeping core promoters and their importance in tumor suppression
Authors: Martin Loza, Alexis Vandenbon, Kenta Nakai
Date: 2024-02-09

Abstract:
In this research, we elucidate the presence of around 11,000 housekeeping cis- regulatory elements (HK-CREs) and describe their main characteristics. Besides the trivial promoters of housekeeping genes, most HK-CREs reside in promoter regions and are involved in a broader role beyond housekeeping gene regulation. HK-CREs are conserved regions rich in unmethylated CpG sites. Their distribution highly correlates with that of protein-coding genes, and they interact with many genes over long distances. We observed reduced activity of a subset of HK-CREs in diverse cancer subtypes due to aberrant methylation, particularly those located in chromosome 19 and associated with zinc finger genes. Further analysis of samples from 17 cancer subtypes showed a significantly increased survival probability of patients with higher expression of these genes, suggesting them as housekeeping tumor suppressor genes. Overall, our work unravels the presence of housekeeping CREs indispensable for the maintenance and stability of cells.

Abstract:
The inability to scalably and precisely measure the activity of developmental cis -regulatory elements (CREs) in multicellular systems is a bottleneck in genomics. Here we develop a dual RNA cassette that decouples the detection and quantification tasks inherent to multiplex single-cell reporter assays. The resulting measurement of reporter expression is accurate over multiple orders of magnitude, with a precision approaching the limit set by Poisson counting noise. Together with RNA barcode stabilization via circularization, these scalable single-cell quantitative expression reporters provide high-contrast readouts, analogous to classic in situ assays but entirely from sequencing. Screening >200 regions of accessible chromatin in a multicellular in vitro model of early mammalian development, we identify 13 (8 previously uncharacterized) autonomous and cell-type-specific developmental CREs. We further demonstrate that chimeric CRE pairs generate cognate two-cell-type activity profiles and assess gain- and loss-of-function multicellular expression phenotypes from CRE variants with perturbed transcription factor binding sites. Single-cell quantitative expression reporters can be applied in developmental and multicellular systems to quantitatively characterize native, perturbed and synthetic CREs at scale, with high sensitivity and at single-cell resolution.

Authors: Timothy H.-C. Hsiau, Claudiu Diaconu, Connie A. Myers, Jongwoo Lee, Constance L. Cepko, Joseph C. Corbo
Date: 2007

Abstract:
The photoreceptor cells of the retina are subject to a greater number of genetic diseases than any other cell type in the human body. The majority of more than 120 cloned human blindness genes are highly expressed in photoreceptors. In order to establish an integrative framework in which to understand these diseases, we have undertaken an experimental and computational analysis of the network controlled by the mammalian photoreceptor transcription factors, Crx , Nrl , and Nr2e3 . Using microarray and in situ hybridization datasets we have produced a model of this network which contains over 600 genes, including numerous retinal disease loci as well as previously uncharacterized photoreceptor transcription factors. To elucidate the connectivity of this network, we devised a computational algorithm to identify the photoreceptor-specific cis -regulatory elements (CREs) mediating the interactions between these transcription factors and their target genes. In vivo validation of our computational predictions resulted in the discovery of 19 novel photoreceptor-specific CREs near retinal disease genes. Examination of these CREs permitted the definition of a simple cis -regulatory grammar rule associated with high-level expression. To test the generality of this rule, we used an expanded form of it as a selection filter to evolve photoreceptor CREs from random DNA sequences in silico . When fused to fluorescent reporters, these evolved CREs drove strong, photoreceptor-specific expression in vivo . This study represents the first systematic identification and in vivo validation of CREs in a mammalian neuronal cell type and lays the groundwork for a systems biology of photoreceptor transcriptional regulation.

Abstract:
Enhancer reprogramming plays a significant role in the heterogeneity of cancer. However, we have limited knowledge about the impact of chromatin remodeling in B-Cell Precursor Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (BCP-ALL) patients, and how it affects tumorigenesis and drug response. Our research focuses on investigating the role of enhancers in sustaining oncogenic transformation in children with BCP-ALL. We used ATAC-seq to study the accessibility of chromatin in pediatric BCP-ALL at three different stages—onset, remission, and relapse. Using a combination of computational and experimental methods, we were able to analyze the accessibility landscape and focus on the most significant cis-regulatory sites. These sites were then functionally validated through the use of Promoter capture Hi-C in a primary cell line model called LAL-B, followed by RNA-seq and genomic deletion of target sites using CRISPR-Cas9 editing. We found that enhancer activity changes during cancer progression and is mediated by the production of enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). CRISPR-Cas9-mediated validation of previously unknown eRNA productive enhancers demonstrated their capability to control the oncogenic activities of the MYB and DCTD genes. Our findings directly support the notion that productive enhancer engagement is a crucial determinant of the BCP-ALL and highlight the potential of enhancers as therapeutic targets in pediatric BCP-ALL.

Title: Information content differentiates enhancers from silencers in mouse photoreceptors
Authors: Ryan Z Friedman, David M Granas, Connie A Myers, Joseph C Corbo, Barak A Cohen, Michael A White
Date: 2021-09-06

Abstract:
Enhancers and silencers often depend on the same transcription factors (TFs) and are conflated in genomic assays of TF binding or chromatin state. To identify sequence features that distinguish enhancers and silencers, we assayed massively parallel reporter libraries of genomic sequences targeted by the photoreceptor TF cone-rod homeobox (CRX) in mouse retinas. Both enhancers and silencers contain more TF motifs than inactive sequences, but relative to silencers, enhancers contain motifs from a more diverse collection of TFs. We developed a measure of information content that describes the number and diversity of motifs in a sequence and found that, while both enhancers and silencers depend on CRX motifs, enhancers have higher information content. The ability of information content to distinguish enhancers and silencers targeted by the same TF illustrates how motif context determines the activity of cis -regulatory sequences.

Abstract:
Repetitive DNA sequences playing critical roles in driving evolution, inducing variation, and regulating gene expression. In this review, we summarized the definition, arrangement, and structural characteristics of repeats. Besides, we introduced diverse biological functions of repeats and reviewed existing methods for automatic repeat detection, classification, and masking. Finally, we analyzed the type, structure, and regulation of repeats in the human genome and their role in the induction of complex diseases. We believe that this review will facilitate a comprehensive understanding of repeats and provide guidance for repeat annotation and in-depth exploration of its association with human diseases.

Title: Coupling high-throughput mapping with proteomics analysis delineates cis -regulatory elements at high resolution
Authors: Ting Wu, Danli Jiang, Meijuan Zou, Wei Sun, Di Wu, Jing Cui, Ian Huntress, Xinxia Peng, Gang Li
Date: 2022-01-11

Abstract:
Growing evidence suggests that functional cis -regulatory elements ( cis -REs) not only exist in epigenetically marked but also in unmarked sites of the human genome. While it is already difficult to identify cis -REs in the epigenetically marked sites, interrogating cis -REs residing within the unmarked sites is even more challenging. Here, we report adapting Reel-seq, an in vitro high-throughput (HTP) technique, to fine-map cis -REs at high resolution over a large region of the human genome in a systematic and continuous manner. Using Reel-seq, as a proof-of-principle, we identified 408 candidate cis -REs by mapping a 58 kb core region on the aging-related CDKN2A/B locus that harbors p16 INK 4 a . By coupling Reel-seq with FREP-MS, a proteomics analysis technique, we characterized two cis -REs, one in an epigenetically marked site and the other in an epigenetically unmarked site. These elements are shown to regulate the p16 INK 4 a expression over an ∼100 kb distance by recruiting the poly(A) binding protein PABPC1 and the transcription factor FOXC2. Downregulation of either PABPC1 or FOXC2 in human endothelial cells (ECs) can induce the p16 INK 4 a -dependent cellular senescence. Thus, we confirmed the utility of Reel-seq and FREP-MS analyses for the systematic identification of cis -REs at high resolution over a large region of the human genome.

Abstract:
The ch12q13 locus is among the most significant childhood obesity loci identified in genome-wide association studies. This locus resides in a non-coding region within FAIM2 ; thus, the underlying causal variant(s) presumably influence disease susceptibility via cis -regulation. We implicated rs7132908 as a putative causal variant by leveraging our in-house 3D genomic data and public domain datasets. Using a luciferase reporter assay, we observed allele-specific cis -regulatory activity of the immediate region harboring rs7132908. We generated isogenic human embryonic stem cell lines homozygous for either rs7132908 allele to assess changes in gene expression and chromatin accessibility throughout a differentiation to hypothalamic neurons, a key cell type known to regulate feeding behavior. The rs7132908 obesity risk allele influenced expression of FAIM2 and other genes and decreased the proportion of neurons produced by differentiation. We have functionally validated rs7132908 as a causal obesity variant that temporally regulates nearby effector genes and influences neurodevelopment and survival.

Title: The role of transposon activity in shaping cis -regulatory element evolution after whole-genome duplication

Abstract:
Whole-genome duplications (WGDs) and transposable element (TE) activity can act synergistically in genome evolution. WGDs can increase TE activity directly through cellular stress or indirectly by relaxing selection against TE insertions in functionally redundant, duplicated regions. Because TEs can function as, or evolve into, TE-derived cis -regulatory elements (TE-CREs), bursts of TE activity following WGD are therefore likely to impact evolution of gene regulation. Yet, the role of TEs in genome regulatory evolution after WGDs is not well understood. Here we used Atlantic salmon as a model system to explore how TE activity after the salmonid WGD ∼100 MYA shaped CRE evolution. We identified 55,080 putative TE-CREs using chromatin accessibility data from the liver and brain. Retroelements were both the dominant source of TE-CREs and had higher regulatory activity in MPRA experiments compared with DNA elements. A minority of TE subfamilies (16%) accounted for 46% of TE-CREs, but these “CRE superspreaders” were mostly active prior to the WGD. Analysis of individual TE insertions, however, revealed enrichment of TE-CREs originating from WGD-associated TE activity, particularly for the DTT (Tc1-Mariner) DNA elements. Furthermore, coexpression analyses supported the presence of TE-driven gene regulatory network evolution, including DTT elements active at the time of WGD. In conclusion, our study supports a scenario in which TE activity has been important in genome regulatory evolution, either through relaxed selective constraints or through strong selection to recalibrate optimal gene expression phenotypes, during a transient period following genome doubling.

Title: Comprehensive In Silico Analysis of RNA Silencing-Related Genes and Their Regulatory Elements in Wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.)

Abstract:
Dicer-like (DCL), Argonaute (AGO), and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDR) are known as the three major gene families that act as the critical components of RNA interference or silencing mechanisms through the noncoding small RNA molecules (miRNA and siRNA) to regulate the expressions of protein-coding genes in eukaryotic organisms. However, most of their characteristics including structures, chromosomal location, subcellular locations, regulatory elements, and gene networking were not rigorously studied. Our analysis identified 7 TaDCL , 39 TaAGO , and 16 TaRDR genes as RNA interference (RNAi) genes from the wheat genome. Phylogenetic analysis of predicted RNAi proteins with the RNAi proteins of Arabidopsis and rice showed that the predicted proteins of TaDCL, TaAGO, and TaRDR groups are clustered into four, eight, and four subgroups, respectively. Domain, 3D protein structure, motif, and exon-intron structure analyses showed that these proteins conserve identical characteristics within groups and maintain differences between groups. The nonsynonymous/synonymous mutation ratio (Ka/Ks) < 1 suggested that these protein sequences conserve some purifying functions. RNAi genes networking with TFs revealed that ERF, MIKC-MADS, C2H2, BBR-BPC, MYB, and Dof are the key transcriptional regulators of the predicted RNAi-related genes. The cis -regulatory element (CREs) analysis detected some important CREs of RNAi genes that are significantly associated with light, stress, and hormone responses. Expression analysis based on an online database exhibited that almost all of the predicted RNAi genes are expressed in different tissues and organs. A case-control study from the gene expression level showed that some RNAi genes significantly responded to the drought and heat stresses. Overall results would therefore provide an excellent basis for in-depth molecular investigation of these genes and their regulatory elements for wheat crop improvement against different stressors.

Title: Regulatory Elements for Gene Therapy of Epilepsy
Authors: Ekaterina Chesnokova, Natalia Bal, Ghofran Alhalabi, Pavel Balaban
Date: 2025-02-06

Abstract:
The problem of drug resistance in epilepsy means that in many cases, a surgical treatment may be advised. But this is only possible if there is an epileptic focus, and resective brain surgery may have adverse side effects. One of the promising alternatives is gene therapy, which allows the targeted expression of therapeutic genes in different brain regions, and even in specific cell types. In this review, we provide detailed explanations of some key terms related to genetic engineering, and describe various regulatory elements that have already been used in the development of different approaches to treating epilepsy using viral vectors. We compare a few universal promoters for their strength and duration of transgene expression, and in our description of cell-specific promoters, we focus on elements driving expression in glutamatergic neurons, GABAergic neurons and astrocytes. We also explore enhancers and some other cis-regulatory elements currently used in viral vectors for gene therapy, and consider future perspectives of state-of-the-art technologies for designing new, stronger and more specific regulatory elements. Gene therapy has multiple advantages and should become more common in the future, but there is still a lot to study and invent in this field.

Abstract:
Deuterostomes are one major group of bilaterians composed by hemichordates and echinoderms (collectively called Ambulacraria) and chordates. Comparative studies between these groups can provide valuable insights into the nature of the last common ancestor of deuterostomes and that of bilaterians. Indirect development of hemichordates, with larval phases similar to echinoderms and an adult body plan with an anteroposterior polarity like chordates and other bilaterians, makes them a suitable model for studying the molecular basis of development among deuterostomes. However, a comprehensive, quantitative catalogue of gene expression and chromatin dynamics in hemichordates is still lacking. In this study, we analysed the transcriptomes and chromatin accessibility of multiple developmental stages of the indirect-developing hemichordate Ptychodera flava . We observed that P. flava development is underpinned by a biphasic transcriptional program probably controlled by distinct genetic networks. Comparisons with other bilaterian species revealed similar transcriptional and regulatory dynamics during hemichordate gastrulation, cephalochordate neurulation and elongation stages of annelids. By means of regulatory networks analysis and functional validations by transgenesis experiments in echinoderms, we propose that gastrulation is the stage of highest molecular resemblance in deuterostomes and that much of the molecular basis of deuterostome development was probably present in the bilaterian last common ancestor.

Title: Delineating yeast cleavage and polyadenylation signals using deep learning
Authors: Emily Kunce Stroup, Zhe Ji
Date: 2024-07

Abstract:
3′-end cleavage and polyadenylation is an essential process for eukaryotic mRNA maturation. In yeast species, the polyadenylation signals that recruit the processing machinery are degenerate and remain poorly characterized compared with the well-defined regulatory elements in mammals. Here we address this issue by developing deep learning models to deconvolute degenerate cis -regulatory elements and quantify their positional importance in mediating yeast poly(A) site formation, cleavage heterogeneity, and strength. In S. cerevisiae , cleavage heterogeneity is promoted by the depletion of U-rich elements around poly(A) sites as well as multiple occurrences of upstream UA-rich elements. Sites with high cleavage heterogeneity show overall lower strength. The site strength and tandem site distances modulate alternative polyadenylation (APA) under the diauxic stress. Finally, we develop a deep learning model to reveal the distinct motif configuration of S. pombe poly(A) sites, which show more precise cleavage than S. cerevisiae . Altogether, our deep learning models provide unprecedented insights into poly(A) site formation of yeast species, and our results highlight divergent poly(A) signals across distantly related species.

Abstract:
Precise control of developmental processes is encoded in the genome in the form of gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Such multi-factorial systems are difficult to decode in vertebrates owing to their complex gene hierarchies and dynamic molecular interactions. Here we present a genome-wide in vivo reconstruction of the GRN underlying development of the multipotent neural crest (NC) embryonic cell population. By coupling NC-specific epigenomic and transcriptional profiling at population and single-cell levels with genome/epigenome engineering in vivo , we identify multiple regulatory layers governing NC ontogeny, including NC-specific enhancers and super-enhancers, novel trans -factors, and cis -signatures allowing reverse engineering of the NC-GRN at unprecedented resolution. Furthermore, identification and dissection of divergent upstream combinatorial regulatory codes has afforded new insights into opposing gene circuits that define canonical and neural NC fates early during NC ontogeny. Our integrated approach, allowing dissection of cell-type-specific regulatory circuits in vivo , has broad implications for GRN discovery and investigation.

Abstract:
Transposable elements (TEs) have colonized the genomes of most metazoans, and many TE-embedded sequences function as cis -regulatory elements (CREs) for genes involved in a wide range of biological processes from early embryogenesis to innate immune responses. Because of their repetitive nature, TEs have the potential to form CRE platforms enabling the coordinated and genome-wide regulation of protein-coding genes by only a handful of trans -acting transcription factors (TFs). Here, we directly test this hypothesis through mathematical modeling and demonstrate that differences in expression at protein-coding genes alone are sufficient to estimate the magnitude and significance of TE-contributed cis -regulatory activities, even in contexts where TE-derived transcription fails to do so. We leverage hundreds of overexpression experiments and estimate that, overall, gene expression is influenced by TE-embedded CREs situated within approximately 500 kb of promoters. Focusing on the cis -regulatory potential of TEs within the gene regulatory network of human embryonic stem cells, we find that pluripotency-specific and evolutionarily young TE subfamilies can be reactivated by TFs involved in post-implantation embryogenesis. Finally, we show that TE subfamilies can be split into truly regulatorily active versus inactive fractions based on additional information such as matched epigenomic data, observing that TF binding may better predict TE cis -regulatory activity than differences in histone marks. Our results suggest that TE-embedded CREs contribute to gene regulation during and beyond gastrulation. On a methodological level, we provide a statistical tool that infers TE-dependent cis -regulation from RNA-seq data alone, thus facilitating the study of TEs in the next-generation sequencing era.

Date: 2024-08-31

Abstract:
Transposable elements (TEs) comprise ~50% of our genome, but knowledge of how TEs affect genome evolution remains incomplete. Leveraging ENCODE4 data, we provide the most comprehensive study to date of TE contributions to the regulatory genome. We find 236,181 (~25%) human candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) are TE-derived, with over 90% lineage-specific since the human-mouse split, accounting for 8–36% of lineage-specific cCREs. Except for SINEs, cCRE-associated transcription factor (TF) motifs in TEs are derived from ancestral TE sequence more than expected by chance. We show that TEs may adopt similar regulatory activities of elements near their integration site. Since human-mouse divergence, TEs have contributed 3–56% of TF binding site turnover events across 30 examined TFs. Finally, TE-derived cCREs are similar to non-TE cCREs in terms of MPRA activity and GWAS variant enrichment. Overall, our results substantiate the notion that TEs have played an important role in shaping the human regulatory genome.

Abstract:
Zebrafish, a popular organism for studying embryonic development and for modeling human diseases, has so far lacked a systematic functional annotation program akin to those in other animal models. To address this, we formed the international DANIO-CODE consortium and created a central repository to store and process zebrafish developmental functional genomic data. Our data coordination center ( https://danio-code.zfin.org ) combines a total of 1,802 sets of unpublished and re-analyzed published genomic data, which we used to improve existing annotations and show its utility in experimental design. We identified over 140,000 cis -regulatory elements throughout development, including classes with distinct features dependent on their activity in time and space. We delineated the distinct distance topology and chromatin features between regulatory elements active during zygotic genome activation and those active during organogenesis. Finally, we matched regulatory elements and epigenomic landscapes between zebrafish and mouse and predicted functional relationships between them beyond sequence similarity, thus extending the utility of zebrafish developmental genomics to mammals.

Title: Identification of cis-regulatory motifs in first introns and the prediction of intron-mediated enhancement of gene expression in Arabidopsis thaliana
Authors: Georg Back, Dirk Walther
Date: 2021-05-26

Abstract:
Intron mediated enhancement (IME) is the potential of introns to enhance the expression of its respective gene. This essential function of introns has been observed in a wide range of species, including fungi, plants, and animals. However, the mechanisms underlying the enhancement are as of yet poorly understood. The goal of this study was to identify potential IME-related sequence motifs and genomic features in first introns of genes in Arabidopsis thaliana . Based on the rationale that functional sequence motifs are evolutionarily conserved, we exploited the deep sequencing information available for Arabidopsis thaliana , covering more than one thousand Arabidopsis accessions, and identified 81 candidate hexamer motifs with increased conservation across all accessions that also exhibit positional occurrence preferences. Of those, 71 were found associated with increased correlation of gene expression of genes harboring them, suggesting a cis-regulatory role. Filtering further for effect on gene expression correlation yielded a set of 16 hexamer motifs, corresponding to five consensus motifs. While all five motifs represent new motif definitions, two are similar to the two previously reported IME-motifs, whereas three are altogether novel. Both consensus and hexamer motifs were found associated with higher expression of alleles harboring them as compared to alleles containing mutated motif variants as found in naturally occurring Arabidopsis accessions. To identify additional IME-related genomic features, Random Forest models were trained for the classification of gene expression level based on an array of sequence-related features. The results indicate that introns contain information with regard to gene expression level and suggest sequence-compositional features as most informative, while position-related features, thought to be of central importance before, were found with lower than expected relevance. Exploiting deep sequencing and broad gene expression information and on a genome-wide scale, this study confirmed the regulatory role on first-introns, characterized their intra-species conservation, and identified a set of novel sequence motifs located in first introns of genes in the genome of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana that may play a role in inducing high and correlated gene expression of the genes harboring them.

Abstract:
Correlation of motif occurrences with gene expression intensity is an effective strategy for elucidating transcriptional cis -regulatory logic. Here we demonstrate that this approach can also identify cis -regulatory elements for alternative pre-mRNA splicing. Using data from a human exon microarray, we identified 56 cassette exons that exhibited higher transcript-normalized expression in muscle than in other normal adult tissues. Intron sequences flanking these exons were then analyzed to identify candidate regulatory motifs for muscle-specific alternative splicing. Correlation of motif parameters with gene-normalized exon expression levels was examined using linear regression and linear splines on RNA words and degenerate weight matrices, respectively. Our unbiased analysis uncovered multiple candidate regulatory motifs for muscle-specific splicing, many of which are phylogenetically conserved among vertebrate genomes. The most prominent downstream motifs were binding sites for Fox1- and CELF-related splicing factors, and a branchpoint-like element acuaac ; pyrimidine-rich elements resembling PTB-binding sites were most significant in upstream introns. Intriguingly, our systematic study indicates a paucity of novel muscle-specific elements that are dominant in short proximal intronic regions. We propose that Fox and CELF proteins play major roles in enforcing the muscle-specific alternative splicing program, facilitating expression of unique isoforms of cytoskeletal proteins critical to muscle cell function.

Date: 2025-11-24

Abstract:
Deciphering how DNA sequence specifies cell-type-specific regulatory activity is a central challenge in gene regulation. We present Bag-of-Motifs (BOM), a computational framework that represents distal cis-regulatory elements as unordered counts of transcription factor (TF) motifs. This minimalist representation, combined with gradient-boosted trees, enables the accurate prediction of cell-type-specific enhancers across mouse, human, zebrafish, and Arabidopsis datasets. Despite its simplicity, BOM outperforms more complex deep-learning models while using fewer parameters. We validate BOM’s predictions experimentally by constructing synthetic enhancers from the most predictive motifs, demonstrating that these motif sets drive cell-type-specific expression. By providing direct interpretability and broad applicability, BOM reveals a highly predictive sequence code at distal regulatory regions and offers a scalable framework for dissecting cis-regulatory grammar across diverse species and conditions.

Abstract:
Color vision in Drosophila melanogaster is based on the expression of five different color-sensing Rhodopsin proteins in distinct subtypes of photoreceptor neurons. Promoter regions of less than 300 base pairs are sufficient to reproduce the unique, photoreceptor subtype-specific rhodopsin expression patterns. The underlying cis -regulatory logic remains poorly understood, but it has been proposed that the rhodopsin promoters have a bipartite structure: the distal promoter region directs the highly restricted expression in a specific photoreceptor subtype, while the proximal core promoter region provides general activation in all photoreceptors. Here, we investigate whether the rhodopsin promoters exhibit a strict specialization of their distal (subtype specificity) and proximal (general activation) promoter regions, or if both promoter regions contribute to generating the photoreceptor subtype-specific expression pattern. To distinguish between these two models, we analyze the expression patterns of a set of hybrid promoters that combine the distal promoter region of one rhodopsin with the proximal core promoter region of another rhodopsin . We find that the function of the proximal core promoter regions extends beyond providing general activation: these regions play a previously underappreciated role in generating the non-overlapping expression patterns of the different rhodopsins . Therefore, cis -regulatory motifs in both the distal and the proximal core promoter regions recruit transcription factors that generate the unique rhodopsin patterns in a combinatorial manner. We compare this combinatorial regulatory logic to the regulatory logic of olfactory receptor genes and discuss potential implications for the evolution of rhodopsins .

Title: DIRECT-NET: An efficient method to discover cis-regulatory elements and construct regulatory networks from single-cell multiomics data
Authors: Lihua Zhang, Jing Zhang, Qing Nie
Date: 2022-06

Abstract:
The emergence of single-cell multiomics data provides unprecedented opportunities to scrutinize the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms controlling cell identity. However, how to use those datasets to dissect the cis-regulatory element (CRE)–to–gene relationships at a single-cell level remains a major challenge. Here, we present DIRECT-NET, a machine-learning method based on gradient boosting, to identify genome-wide CREs and their relationship to target genes, either from parallel single-cell gene expression and chromatin accessibility data or from single-cell chromatin accessibility data alone. By extensively evaluating and characterizing DIRECT-NET’s predicted CREs using independent functional genomics data, we find that DIRECT-NET substantially improves the accuracy of inferring CRE-to-gene relationships in comparison to existing methods. DIRECT-NET is also capable of revealing cell subpopulation–specific and dynamic regulatory linkages. Overall, DIRECT-NET provides an efficient tool for predicting transcriptional regulation codes from single-cell multiomics data.

Abstract:
Transcription factor programs mediating the immune response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are not fully understood. Capturing active transcription initiation from cis -regulatory elements such as enhancers and promoters by capped small RNA sequencing (csRNA-seq), in contrast to capturing steady-state transcripts by conventional RNA-seq, allows unbiased identification of the underlying transcription factor activity and regulatory pathways. Here, we profile transcription initiation in critically ill COVID-19 patients, identifying transcription factor motifs that correlate with clinical lung injury and disease severity. Unbiased clustering reveals distinct subsets of cis -regulatory elements that delineate the cell type, pathway-specific, and combinatorial transcription factor activity. We find evidence of critical roles of regulatory networks, showing that STAT/BCL6 and E2F/MYB regulatory programs from myeloid cell populations are activated in patients with poor disease outcomes and associated with COVID-19 susceptibility genetic variants. More broadly, we demonstrate how capturing acute, disease-mediated changes in transcription initiation can provide insight into the underlying molecular mechanisms and stratify patient disease severity.

Abstract:
The ch12q13 obesity locus is among the most significant childhood obesity loci identified in genome-wide association studies. This locus resides in a non-coding region within FAIM2 ; thus, the underlying causal variant(s) presumably influence disease susceptibility via an influence on cis -regulation within the genomic region. We implicated rs7132908 as a putative causal variant at this locus leveraging a combination of our inhouse 3D genomic data, public domain datasets, and several computational approaches. Using a luciferase reporter assay in human primary astrocytes, we observed allele-specific cis -regulatory activity of the immediate region harboring rs7132908. Motivated by this finding, we went on to generate isogenic human embryonic stem cell lines homozygous for either rs7132908 allele with CRISPR-Cas9 homology-directed repair to assess changes in gene expression due to genotype and chromatin accessibility throughout a differentiation to hypothalamic neurons, a key cell type known to regulate feeding behavior. We observed that the rs7132908 obesity risk allele influenced the expression of FAIM2 along with other genes, decreased the proportion of neurons produced during differentiation, up-regulated cell death gene sets, and conversely down-regulated neuron differentiation gene sets. We have therefore functionally validated rs7132908 as a causal obesity variant which temporally regulates nearby effector genes at the ch12q13 locus and influences neurodevelopment and survival.

Title: Robust regulatory interplay of enhancers, facilitators, and promoters in a native chromatin context
Authors: Zhou Zhou, Albert Li, Junke Zhang, Haiyuan Yu, Abdullah Ozer, John T. Lis
Date: 2025-07-09

Abstract:
Enhancers are gene-distal cis -regulatory elements that drive cell type-specific gene expression. While significant progress has been made in identifying enhancers and characterizing their epigenomic features, much less effort has been devoted to elucidating mechanistic interactions among clusters of functionally linked regulatory elements within their endogenous chromatin contexts. Here, we developed a novel recombinase-mediated genome rewriting platform and applied our divergent transcription architectural model to understand how a long-range human enhancer confers a remarkable 10,000-fold activation to its target gene, NMU, at its native locus. Our systematic dissection reveals transcription factor synergy at this enhancer and highlights the interplay between a divergently transcribed core enhancer unit and emerging new types of cis -regulatory elements—notably, intrinsically inactive facilitators that augment and buffer core enhancer activity, and an adjacent retroviral long terminal repeat promoter that represses enhancer activity. We discuss the broader implications of our focused study on enhancer mechanisms and regulation genome-wide.

Title: An integrated multi-omics approach to identify regulatory mechanisms in cancer metastatic processes
Authors: Saba Ghaffari, Casey Hanson, Remington E. Schmidt, Kelly J. Bouchonville, Steven M. Offer, Saurabh Sinha
Date: 2021-01-07

Abstract:
Metastatic progress is the primary cause of death in most cancers, yet the regulatory dynamics driving the cellular changes necessary for metastasis remain poorly understood. Multi-omics approaches hold great promise for addressing this challenge; however, current analysis tools have limited capabilities to systematically integrate transcriptomic, epigenomic, and cistromic information to accurately define the regulatory networks critical for metastasis. To address this limitation, we use a purposefully generated cellular model of colon cancer invasiveness to generate multi-omics data, including expression, accessibility, and selected histone modification profiles, for increasing levels of invasiveness. We then adopt a rigorous probabilistic framework for joint inference from the resulting heterogeneous data, along with transcription factor binding profiles. Our approach uses probabilistic graphical models to leverage the functional information provided by specific epigenomic changes, models the influence of multiple transcription factors simultaneously, and automatically learns the activating or repressive roles of cis -regulatory events. Global analysis of these relationships reveals key transcription factors driving invasiveness, as well as their likely target genes. Disrupting the expression of one of the highly ranked transcription factors JunD, an AP-1 complex protein, confirms functional relevance to colon cancer cell migration and invasion. Transcriptomic profiling confirms key regulatory targets of JunD, and a gene signature derived from the model demonstrates strong prognostic potential in TCGA colorectal cancer data. Our work sheds new light into the complex molecular processes driving colon cancer metastasis and presents a statistically sound integrative approach to analyze multi-omics profiles of a dynamic biological process.

Abstract:
Cell type-specific transcriptional differences between brain tissues from donors with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and unaffected controls have been well documented, but few studies have rigorously interrogated the regulatory mechanisms responsible for these alterations. We performed single nucleus multiomics (snRNA-seq plus snATAC-seq) on 105,332 nuclei isolated from cortical tissues from 7 AD and 8 unaffected donors to identify candidate cis -regulatory elements (CREs) involved in AD-associated transcriptional changes. We detected 319,861 significant correlations, or links, between gene expression and cell type-specific transposase accessible regions enriched for active CREs. Among these, 40,831 were unique to AD tissues. Validation experiments confirmed the activity of many regions, including several candidate regulators of APP expression. We identified ZEB1 and MAFB as candidate transcription factors playing important roles in AD-specific gene regulation in neurons and microglia, respectively. Microglia links were globally enriched for heritability of AD risk and previously identified active regulatory regions.

Title: Pairs of Adjacent Conserved Noncoding Elements Separated by Conserved Genomic Distances Act as Cis -Regulatory Units
Authors: Lifei Li, Nicolai K H Barth, Eva Hirth, Leila Taher
Date: 2018-09

Abstract:
Comparative genomic studies have identified thousands of conserved noncoding elements (CNEs) in the mammalian genome, many of which have been reported to exert cis -regulatory activity. We analyzed ∼5,500 pairs of adjacent CNEs in the human genome and found that despite divergence at the nucleotide sequence level, the inter-CNE distances of the pairs are under strong evolutionary constraint, with inter-CNE sequences featuring significantly lower transposon densities than expected. Further, we show that different degrees of conservation of the inter-CNE distance are associated with distinct cis -regulatory functions at the CNEs. Specifically, the CNEs in pairs with conserved and mildly contracted inter-CNE sequences are the most likely to represent active or poised enhancers. In contrast, CNEs in pairs with extremely contracted or expanded inter-CNE sequences are associated with no cis -regulatory activity. Furthermore, we observed that functional CNEs in a pair have very similar epigenetic profiles, hinting at a functional relationship between them. Taken together, our results support the existence of epistatic interactions between adjacent CNEs that are distance-sensitive and disrupted by transposon insertions and deletions, and contribute to our understanding of the selective forces acting on cis -regulatory elements, which are crucial for elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying adaptive evolution and human genetic diseases.

Title: Genome-wide prediction of cis-regulatory regions using supervised deep learning methods
Authors: Yifeng Li, Wenqiang Shi, Wyeth W. Wasserman
Date: 2018-05-31

Abstract:
In the human genome, 98% of DNA sequences are non-protein-coding regions that were previously disregarded as junk DNA. In fact, non-coding regions host a variety of cis -regulatory regions which precisely control the expression of genes. Thus, Identifying active cis -regulatory regions in the human genome is critical for understanding gene regulation and assessing the impact of genetic variation on phenotype. The developments of high-throughput sequencing and machine learning technologies make it possible to predict cis -regulatory regions genome wide. Based on rich data resources such as the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) and the Functional Annotation of the Mammalian Genome (FANTOM) projects, we introduce DECRES based on supervised deep learning approaches for the identification of enhancer and promoter regions in the human genome. Due to their ability to discover patterns in large and complex data, the introduction of deep learning methods enables a significant advance in our knowledge of the genomic locations of cis -regulatory regions. Using models for well-characterized cell lines, we identify key experimental features that contribute to the predictive performance. Applying DECRES, we delineate locations of 300,000 candidate enhancers genome wide (6.8% of the genome, of which 40,000 are supported by bidirectional transcription data), and 26,000 candidate promoters (0.6% of the genome). The predicted annotations of cis -regulatory regions will provide broad utility for genome interpretation from functional genomics to clinical applications. The DECRES model demonstrates potentials of deep learning technologies when combined with high-throughput sequencing data, and inspires the development of other advanced neural network models for further improvement of genome annotations.

Title: Deep learning of human polyadenylation sites at nucleotide resolution reveals molecular determinants of site usage and relevance in disease
Authors: Emily Kunce Stroup, Zhe Ji
Date: 2023-11-15

Abstract:
The genomic distribution of cleavage and polyadenylation (polyA) sites should be co-evolutionally optimized with the local gene structure. Otherwise, spurious polyadenylation can cause premature transcription termination and generate aberrant proteins. To obtain mechanistic insights into polyA site optimization across the human genome, we develop deep/machine learning models to identify genome-wide putative polyA sites at unprecedented nucleotide-level resolution and calculate their strength and usage in the genomic context. Our models quantitatively measure position-specific motif importance and their crosstalk in polyA site formation and cleavage heterogeneity. The intronic site expression is governed by the surrounding splicing landscape. The usage of alternative polyA sites in terminal exons is modulated by their relative locations and distance to downstream genes. Finally, we apply our models to reveal thousands of disease- and trait-associated genetic variants altering polyadenylation activity. Altogether, our models represent a valuable resource to dissect molecular mechanisms mediating genome-wide polyA site expression and characterize their functional roles in human diseases.

Abstract:
The mammalian cerebrum performs high-level sensory perception, motor control and cognitive functions through highly specialized cortical and subcortical structures 1 . Recent surveys of mouse and human brains with single-cell transcriptomics 2 – 6 and high-throughput imaging technologies 7 , 8 have uncovered hundreds of neural cell types distributed in different brain regions, but the transcriptional regulatory programs that are responsible for the unique identity and function of each cell type remain unknown. Here we probe the accessible chromatin in more than 800,000 individual nuclei from 45 regions that span the adult mouse isocortex, olfactory bulb, hippocampus and cerebral nuclei, and use the resulting data to map the state of 491,818 candidate cis -regulatory DNA elements in 160 distinct cell types. We find high specificity of spatial distribution for not only excitatory neurons, but also most classes of inhibitory neurons and a subset of glial cell types. We characterize the gene regulatory sequences associated with the regional specificity within these cell types. We further link a considerable fraction of the cis -regulatory elements to putative target genes expressed in diverse cerebral cell types and predict transcriptional regulators that are involved in a broad spectrum of molecular and cellular pathways in different neuronal and glial cell populations. Our results provide a foundation for comprehensive analysis of gene regulatory programs of the mammalian brain and assist in the interpretation of noncoding risk variants associated with various neurological diseases and traits in humans.

Title: Transposable elements may enhance antiviral resistance in HIV-1 elite controllers
Authors: Manvendra Singh, Sabrina M. Leddy, Luis Pedro Iñiguez, Matthew L. Bendall, Douglas F. Nixon, Cédric Feschotte
Date: 2023-12-12

Abstract:
Less than 0.5% of people living with HIV-1 are elite controllers (ECs) - individuals who have a replication-competent viral reservoir in their CD4 + T cells but maintain undetectable plasma viremia without the help of antiretroviral therapy. While the EC CD4 + T cell transcriptome has been investigated for gene expression signatures associated with disease progression (or, in this case, a lack thereof), the expression and regulatory activity of transposable elements (TEs) in ECs has not been explored. Yet previous studies have established that TEs can directly impact the immune response to pathogens, including HIV-1. Thus, we hypothesize that the regulatory activities of TEs could contribute to the natural resistance of ECs against HIV-1. We perform a TE-centric analysis of previously published multi-omics data derived from EC individuals and other populations. We find that the CD4 + T cell transcriptome and retrotranscriptome of ECs are distinct from healthy controls, treated patients, and viremic progressors. However, there is a substantial level of transcriptomic heterogeneity among ECs. We categorize individuals with distinct chromatin accessibility and expression profiles into four clusters within the EC group, each possessing unique repertoires of TEs and antiviral factors. Notably, several TE families with known immuno-regulatory activity are differentially expressed among ECs. Their transcript levels in ECs positively correlate with their chromatin accessibility and negatively correlate with the expression of their KRAB zinc-finger (KZNF) repressors. This coordinated variation is seen at the level of individual TE loci likely acting or, in some cases, known to act as cis -regulatory elements for nearby genes involved in the immune response and HIV-1 restriction. Based on these results, we propose that the EC phenotype is driven in part by the reduced availability of specific KZNF proteins to repress TE-derived cis -regulatory elements for antiviral genes, thereby heightening their basal level of resistance to HIV-1 infection. Our study reveals considerable heterogeneity in the CD4 + T cell transcriptome of ECs, including variable expression of TEs and their KZNF controllers, that must be taken into consideration to decipher the mechanisms enabling HIV-1 control.

Title: Assessing Computational Methods of Cis-Regulatory Module Prediction
Authors: Jing Su, Sarah A. Teichmann, Thomas A. Down
Date: 2010-12

Abstract:
Computational methods attempting to identify instances of cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) in the genome face a challenging problem of searching for potentially interacting transcription factor binding sites while knowledge of the specific interactions involved remains limited. Without a comprehensive comparison of their performance, the reliability and accuracy of these tools remains unclear. Faced with a large number of different tools that address this problem, we summarized and categorized them based on search strategy and input data requirements. Twelve representative methods were chosen and applied to predict CRMs from the Drosophila CRM database REDfly, and across the human ENCODE regions. Our results show that the optimal choice of method varies depending on species and composition of the sequences in question. When discriminating CRMs from non-coding regions, those methods considering evolutionary conservation have a stronger predictive power than methods designed to be run on a single genome. Different CRM representations and search strategies rely on different CRM properties, and different methods can complement one another. For example, some favour homotypical clusters of binding sites, while others perform best on short CRMs. Furthermore, most methods appear to be sensitive to the composition and structure of the genome to which they are applied. We analyze the principal features that distinguish the methods that performed well, identify weaknesses leading to poor performance, and provide a guide for users. We also propose key considerations for the development and evaluation of future CRM-prediction methods.

Title: Structure and transcriptional regulation of the major intrinsic protein gene family in grapevine
Authors: Darren Chern Jan Wong, Li Zhang, Isabelle Merlin, Simone D. Castellarin, Gregory A. Gambetta
Date: 2018-04-11

Abstract:
The major intrinsic protein (MIP) family is a family of proteins, including aquaporins, which facilitate water and small molecule transport across plasma membranes. In plants, MIPs function in a huge variety of processes including water transport, growth, stress response, and fruit development. In this study, we characterize the structure and transcriptional regulation of the MIP family in grapevine, describing the putative genome duplication events leading to the family structure and characterizing the family’s tissue and developmental specific expression patterns across numerous preexisting microarray and RNAseq datasets. Gene co-expression network (GCN) analyses were carried out across these datasets and the promoters of each family member were analyzed for cis-regulatory element structure in order to provide insight into their transcriptional regulation. A total of 29 Vitis vinifera MIP family members (excluding putative pseudogenes) were identified of which all but two were mapped onto Vitis vinifera chromosomes. In this study, segmental duplication events were identified for five plasma membrane intrinsic protein (PIP) and four tonoplast intrinsic protein (TIP) genes, contributing to the expansion of PIPs and TIPs in grapevine. Grapevine MIP family members have distinct tissue and developmental expression patterns and hierarchical clustering revealed two primary groups regardless of the datasets analyzed. Composite microarray and RNA-seq gene co-expression networks (GCNs) highlighted the relationships between MIP genes and functional categories involved in cell wall modification and transport, as well as with other MIPs revealing a strong co-regulation within the family itself. Some duplicated MIP family members have undergone sub-functionalization and exhibit distinct expression patterns and GCNs. Cis-regulatory element (CRE) analyses of the MIP promoters and their associated GCN members revealed enrichment for numerous CREs including AP2/ERFs and NACs. Combining phylogenetic analyses, gene expression profiling, gene co-expression network analyses, and cis-regulatory element enrichment, this study provides a comprehensive overview of the structure and transcriptional regulation of the grapevine MIP family. The study highlights the duplication and sub-functionalization of the family, its strong coordinated expression with genes involved in growth and transport, and the putative classes of TFs responsible for its regulation.

Abstract:
Most genetic variants associated with psychiatric disorders are located in noncoding regions of the genome. To investigate their functional implications, we integrate epigenetic data from the PsychENCODE Consortium and other published sources to construct a comprehensive atlas of candidate brain cis-regulatory elements. Using deep learning, we model these elements’ sequence syntax and predict how binding sites for lineage-specific transcription factors contribute to cell type–specific gene regulation in various types of glia and neurons. The elements’ evolutionary history suggests that new regulatory information in the brain emerges primarily via smaller sequence mutations within conserved mammalian elements rather than entirely new human- or primate-specific sequences. However, primate-specific candidate elements, particularly those active during fetal brain development and in excitatory neurons and astrocytes, are implicated in the heritability of brain-related human traits. Additionally, we introduce PsychSCREEN, a web-based platform offering interactive visualization of PsychENCODE-generated genetic and epigenetic data from diverse brain cell types in individuals with psychiatric disorders and healthy controls.

Title: Predominance of cis -regulatory changes in parallel expression divergence of sticklebacks
Authors: Jukka-Pekka Verta, Felicity C Jones
Date: 2019-05-15

Abstract:
Regulation of gene expression is thought to play a major role in adaptation, but the relative importance of cis - and trans - regulatory mechanisms in the early stages of adaptive divergence is unclear. Using RNAseq of threespine stickleback fish gill tissue from four independent marine-freshwater ecotype pairs and their F1 hybrids, we show that cis -acting (allele-specific) regulation consistently predominates gene expression divergence. Genes showing parallel marine-freshwater expression divergence are found near to adaptive genomic regions, show signatures of natural selection around their transcription start sites and are enriched for cis- regulatory control. For genes with parallel increased expression among freshwater fish, the quantitative degree of cis- and trans- regulation is also highly correlated across populations, suggesting a shared genetic basis. Compared to other forms of regulation, cis- regulation tends to show greater additivity and stability across different genetic and environmental contexts, making it a fertile substrate for the early stages of adaptive evolution.

Abstract:
Descriptive data are rapidly expanding in biomedical research. Instead, functional validation methods with sufficient complexity remain underdeveloped. Transcriptional reporters allow experimental characterization and manipulation of developmental and disease cell states, but their design lacks flexibility. Here, we report logical design of synthetic cis- regulatory DNA (LSD), a computational framework leveraging phenotypic biomarkers and trans-regulatory networks as input to design reporters marking the activity of selected cellular states and pathways. LSD uses bulk or single-cell biomarkers and a reference genome or custom cis- regulatory DNA datasets with user-defined boundary regions. By benchmarking validated reporters, we integrate LSD with a computational ranking of phenotypic specificity of putative cis- regulatory DNA. Experimentally, LSD-designed reporters targeting a wide range of cell states are functional without minimal promoters. Applied to broadly expressed genes from human and mouse tissues, LSD generates functional housekeeper-like sLCRs compatible with size constraints of AAV vectors for gene therapy applications. A mesenchymal glioblastoma reporter designed by LSD outperforms previously validated ones and canonical cell surface markers. In genome-scale CRISPRa screens, LSD facilitates the discovery of known and novel bona fide cell-state drivers. Thus, LSD captures core principles of cis- regulation and is broadly applicable to studying complex cell states and mechanisms of transcriptional regulation.

Title: Learning the histone codes with large genomic windows and three-dimensional chromatin interactions using transformer
Authors: Dohoon Lee, Jeewon Yang, Sun Kim
Date: 2022-11-05

Abstract:
The quantitative characterization of the transcriptional control by histone modifications has been challenged by many computational studies, but most of them only focus on narrow and linear genomic regions around promoters, leaving a room for improvement. We present Chromoformer, a transformer-based, three-dimensional chromatin conformation-aware deep learning architecture that achieves the state-of-the-art performance in the quantitative deciphering of the histone codes in gene regulation. The core essence of Chromoformer architecture lies in the three variants of attention operation, each specialized to model individual hierarchy of transcriptional regulation involving from core promoters to distal elements in contact with promoters through three-dimensional chromatin interactions. In-depth interpretation of Chromoformer reveals that it adaptively utilizes the long-range dependencies between histone modifications associated with transcription initiation and elongation. We also show that the quantitative kinetics of transcription factories and Polycomb group bodies can be captured by Chromoformer. Together, our study highlights the great advantage of attention-based deep modeling of complex interactions in epigenomes.

Abstract:
Despite extensive characterization of mammalian Pol II transcription, the DNA sequence determinants of transcription initiation at a third of human promoters and most enhancers remain poorly understood. We trained and interpreted a neural network called ProCapNet that accurately models base-resolution initiation profiles from PRO-cap experiments using local DNA sequence. ProCapNet learns sequence motifs with distinct effects on initiation rates and TSS positioning and uncovers context-specific cryptic initiator elements intertwined within other TF motifs. ProCapNet annotates predictive motifs in nearly all actively transcribed regulatory elements across multiple cell-lines, revealing a shared cis -regulatory logic across promoters and enhancers and a highly epistatic sequence syntax of cooperative and competitive motif interactions. ProCapNet models of steady-state RAMPAGE profiles distill initiation signals on par with models trained directly on PRO-cap profiles. ProCapNet learns a largely cell-type-agnostic cis -regulatory code of initiation complementing sequence drivers of cell-type-specific chromatin state critical for accurate prediction of cell-type-specific transcription initiation.

Title: Mosaic cis-regulatory evolution drives transcriptional partitioning of HERVH endogenous retrovirus in the human embryo
Authors: Thomas A Carter, Manvendra Singh, Gabrijela Dumbović, Jason D Chobirko, John L Rinn, Cédric Feschotte, Mia T Levine
Date: 2022-02-18

Abstract:
The human endogenous retrovirus type-H (HERVH) family is expressed in the preimplantation embryo. A subset of these elements are specifically transcribed in pluripotent stem cells where they appear to exert regulatory activities promoting self-renewal and pluripotency. How HERVH elements achieve such transcriptional specificity remains poorly understood. To uncover the sequence features underlying HERVH transcriptional activity, we performed a phyloregulatory analysis of the long terminal repeats (LTR7) of the HERVH family, which harbor its promoter, using a wealth of regulatory genomics data. We found that the family includes at least eight previously unrecognized subfamilies that have been active at different timepoints in primate evolution and display distinct expression patterns during human embryonic development. Notably, nearly all HERVH elements transcribed in ESCs belong to one of the youngest subfamilies we dubbed LTR7up. LTR7 sequence evolution was driven by a mixture of mutational processes, including point mutations, duplications, and multiple recombination events between subfamilies, that led to transcription factor binding motif modules characteristic of each subfamily. Using a reporter assay, we show that one such motif, a predicted SOX2/3 binding site unique to LTR7up, is essential for robust promoter activity in induced pluripotent stem cells. Together these findings illuminate the mechanisms by which HERVH diversified its expression pattern during evolution to colonize distinct cellular niches within the human embryo.

Abstract:
Kidney disease is highly heritable; however, the causal genetic variants, the cell types in which these variants function, and the molecular mechanisms underlying kidney disease remain largely unknown. To identify genetic loci affecting kidney function, we performed a GWAS using multiple kidney function biomarkers and identified 462 loci. To begin to investigate how these loci affect kidney function, we generated single-cell chromatin accessibility (scATAC-seq) maps of the human kidney and identified candidate cis -regulatory elements (cCREs) for kidney podocytes, tubule epithelial cells, and kidney endothelial, stromal, and immune cells. Kidney tubule epithelial cCREs explained 58% of kidney function SNP-heritability and kidney podocyte cCREs explained an additional 6.5% of SNP-heritability. In contrast, little kidney function heritability was explained by kidney endothelial, stromal, or immune cell-specific cCREs. Through functionally informed fine-mapping, we identified putative causal kidney function variants and their corresponding cCREs. Using kidney scATAC-seq data, we created a deep learning model (which we named ChromKid) to predict kidney cell type-specific chromatin accessibility from sequence. ChromKid and allele specific kidney scATAC-seq revealed that many fine-mapped kidney function variants locally change chromatin accessibility in tubule epithelial cells. Enhancer assays confirmed that fine-mapped kidney function variants alter tubule epithelial regulatory element function. To map the genes which these regulatory elements control, we used CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) to target these regulatory elements in tubule epithelial cells and assessed changes in gene expression. CRISPRi of enhancers harboring kidney function variants regulated NDRG1 and RBPMS expression. Thus, inherited differences in tubule epithelial NDRG1 and RBPMS expression may predispose to kidney disease in humans. We conclude that genetic variants affecting tubule epithelial regulatory element function account for most SNP-heritability of human kidney function. This work provides an experimental approach to identify the variants, regulatory elements, and genes involved in polygenic disease.

Abstract:
A key attribute of some long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) is their ability to regulate expression of neighbouring genes in cis . However, such ‘ cis- lncRNAs’ are presently defined using ad hoc criteria that, we show, are prone to false-positive predictions. The resulting lack of cis- lncRNA catalogues hinders our understanding of their extent, characteristics and mechanisms. Here, we introduce TransCistor, a framework for defining and identifying cis- lncRNAs based on enrichment of targets amongst proximal genes. TransCistor’s simple and conservative statistical models are compatible with functionally defined target gene maps generated by existing and future technologies. Using transcriptome-wide perturbation experiments for 268 human and 134 mouse lncRNAs, we provide the first large-scale survey of cis- lncRNAs. Known cis- lncRNAs are correctly identified, including XIST, LINC00240 and UMLILO, and predictions are consistent across analysis methods, perturbation types and independent experiments. We detect cis- activity in a minority of lncRNAs, primarily involving activators over repressors. Cis -lncRNAs are detected by both RNA interference and antisense oligonucleotide perturbations. Mechanistically, cis- lncRNA transcripts are observed to physically associate with their target genes and are weakly enriched with enhancer elements. In summary, TransCistor establishes a quantitative foundation for cis- lncRNAs, opening a path to elucidating their molecular mechanisms and biological significance.

Title: Interpreting Cis -Regulatory Interactions from Large-Scale Deep Neural Networks for Genomics
Authors: Shushan Toneyan, Peter K Koo
Date: 2024-03-20

Abstract:
The rise of large-scale, sequence-based deep neural networks (DNNs) for predicting gene expression has introduced challenges in their evaluation and interpretation. Current evaluations align DNN predictions with experimental perturbation assays, which provides insights into the generalization capabilities within the studied loci but offers a limited perspective of what drives their predictions. Moreover, existing model explainability tools focus mainly on motif analysis, which becomes complex when interpreting longer sequences. Here we introduce CREME, an in silico perturbation toolkit that interrogates large-scale DNNs to uncover rules of gene regulation that it learns. Using CREME, we investigate Enformer, a prominent DNN in gene expression prediction, revealing cis -regulatory elements (CREs) that directly enhance or silence target genes. We explore the intricate complexity of higher-order CRE interactions, the relationship between CRE distance from transcription start sites on gene expression, as well as the biochemical features of enhancers and silencers learned by Enformer. Moreover, we demonstrate the flexibility of CREME to efficiently uncover a higher-resolution view of functional sequence elements within CREs. This work demonstrates how CREME can be employed to translate the powerful predictions of large-scale DNNs to study open questions in gene regulation.

Abstract:
Cross-species genome comparisons have revealed a substantial number of ultraconserved non-coding elements (UCNEs). Several of these elements have proved to be essential tissue- and cell type-specific cis -regulators of developmental gene expression. Here, we characterize a set of UCNEs as candidate CREs (cCREs) during retinal development and evaluate the contribution of their genomic variation to rare eye diseases, for which pathogenic non-coding variants are emerging. Integration of bulk and single-cell retinal multi-omics data reveals 594 genes under potential cis -regulatory control of UCNEs, of which 45 are implicated in rare eye disease. Mining of candidate cis -regulatory UCNEs in WGS data derived from the rare eye disease cohort of Genomics England reveals 178 ultrarare variants within 84 UCNEs associated with 29 disease genes. Overall, we provide a comprehensive annotation of ultraconserved non-coding regions acting as cCREs during retinal development which can be targets of non-coding variation underlying rare eye diseases.

Title: Context dependent activity of p63-bound gene regulatory elements
Authors: Abby A. McCann, Gabriele Baniulyte, Dana L. Woodstock, Morgan A. Sammons
Date: 2024-05-12

Abstract:
The p53 family of transcription factors regulate numerous organismal processes including the development of skin and limbs, ciliogenesis, and preservation of genetic integrity and tumor suppression. p53 family members control these processes and gene expression networks through engagement with DNA sequences within gene regulatory elements. Whereas p53 binding to its cognate recognition sequence is strongly associated with transcriptional activation, p63 can mediate both activation and repression. How the DNA sequence of p63-bound gene regulatory elements is linked to these varied activities is not yet understood. Here, we use massively parallel reporter assays (MPRA) in a range of cellular and genetic contexts to investigate the influence of DNA sequence on p63-mediated transcription. Most regulatory elements with a p63 response element motif (p63RE) activate transcription, with those sites bound by p63 more frequently or adhering closer to canonical p53 family response element sequences driving higher transcriptional output. The most active regulatory elements are those also capable of binding p53. Elements uniquely bound by p63 have varied activity, with p63RE-mediated repression associated with lower overall GC content in flanking sequences. Comparison of activity across cell lines suggests differential activity of elements may be regulated by a combination of p63 abundance or context-specific cofactors. Finally, changes in p63 isoform expression dramatically alters regulatory element activity, primarily shifting inactive elements towards a strong p63-dependent activity. Our analysis of p63-bound gene regulatory elements provides new insight into how sequence, cellular context, and other transcription factors influence p63-dependent transcription. These studies provide a framework for understanding how p63 genomic binding locally regulates transcription. Additionally, these results can be extended to investigate the influence of sequence content, genomic context, chromatin structure on the interplay between p63 isoforms and p53 family paralogs.

Title: Long Non-coding RNAs as Local Regulators of Pancreatic Islet Transcription Factor Genes
Authors: Berta Font-Cunill, Luis Arnes, Jorge Ferrer, Lori Sussel, Anthony Beucher
Date: 2018-11-06

Abstract:
The transcriptional programs of differentiated cells are tightly regulated by interactions between cell type-specific transcription factors and cis -regulatory elements. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as additional regulators of gene transcription. Current evidence indicates that lncRNAs are a very heterogeneous group of molecules. For example, selected lncRNAs have been shown to regulate gene expression in cis or trans , although in most cases the precise underlying molecular mechanisms is unknown. Recent studies have uncovered a large number of lncRNAs that are selectively expressed in pancreatic islet cells, some of which were shown to regulate β cell transcriptional programs. A subset of such islet lncRNAs appears to control the expression of β cell-specific transcription factor (TF) genes by local cis -regulation. In this review, we discuss current knowledge of molecular mechanisms underlying cis -regulatory lncRNAs and discuss challenges involved in using genetic perturbations to define their function. We then discuss known examples of pancreatic islet lncRNAs that appear to exert cis -regulation of TF genes. We propose that cis -regulatory lncRNAs could represent a molecular target for modulation of diabetes-relevant genes.

Title: TooManyPeaks identifies drug-resistant-specific regulatory elements from single-cell leukemic epigenomes
Authors: Gregory W. Schwartz, Yeqiao Zhou, Jelena Petrovic, Warren S. Pear, Robert B. Faryabi
Date: 2021-08-24

Abstract:
Emerging single-cell epigenomic assays are used to investigate the heterogeneity of chromatin activity and its function. However, identifying cells with distinct regulatory elements and clearly visualizing their relationships remains challenging. To this end, we introduce TooManyPeaks to address the need for the simultaneous study of chromatin state heterogeneity in both rare and abundant subpopulations. Our analyses of existing data from three widely used single-cell assays for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (scATAC-seq) show the superior performance of TooManyPeaks in delineating and visualizing pure clusters of rare and abundant subpopulations. Furthermore, the application of TooManyPeaks to new scATAC-seq data from drug-naive and drug-resistant leukemic T cells clearly visualizes relationships among these cells and stratifies a rare “resistant-like” drug-naive sub-clone with distinct cis -regulatory elements.

Title: Analysis of a new begomovirus unveils a composite element conserved in the CP gene promoters of several Geminiviridae genera: Clues to comprehend the complex regulation of late genes

Abstract:
A novel bipartite begomovirus, Blechum interveinal chlorosis virus (BleICV), was characterized at the genome level. Comparative analyses revealed that BleICV coat protein ( CP ) gene promoter is highly divergent from the equivalent region of other begomoviruses (BGVs), with the single exception of Tomato chino La Paz virus (ToChLPV) with which it shares a 23-bp phylogenetic footprint exhibiting dyad symmetry. Systematic examination of the homologous CP promoter segment of 132 New World BGVs revealed the existence of a quasi-palindromic DNA segment displaying a strongly conserved ACTT-(N7)-AAGT core. The spacer sequence between the palindromic motifs is constant in length, but its sequence is highly variable among viral species, presenting a relaxed consensus (TT)GGKCCCY, which is similar to the Conserved Late Element or CLE (GTGGTCCC), a putative TrAP-responsive element. The homologous CP promoter region of Old World BGVs exhibited a distinct organization, with the putative TATA-box overlapping the left half of the ACTT-N7 composite element. Similar CP promoter sequences, dubbed “TATA-associated composite element” or TACE, were found in viruses belonging to different Geminiviridae genera, hence hinting unsuspected evolutionary relationships among those lineages. To get cues about the TACE function, the regulatory function of the CLE was explored in distinct experimental systems. Transgenic tobacco plants harboring a GUS reporter gene driven by a promoter composed by CLE multimers expressed high beta-glucuronidase activity in absence of viral factors, and that expression was increased by begomovirus infection. On the other hand, the TrAP-responsiveness of a truncated CP promoter of Tomato golden mosaic virus (TGMV) was abolished by site-directed mutation of the only CLE present in it, whereas the artificial addition of one CLE to the -125 truncated promoter strongly enhanced the transactivation level in tobacco protoplasts. These results indicate that the CLE is a TrAP-responsive element, hence providing valuable clues to interpret the recurrent association of the CLE with the TACE. On the basis of the aforesaid direct evidences and the insights afforded by the extensive comparative analysis of BleICV CP promoter, we propose that the TACE might be involved in the TrAP-mediated derepression of CP gene in vascular tissues.

Abstract:
Long-range cis- regulatory elements such as enhancers coordinate cell-specific transcriptional programmes by engaging in DNA looping interactions with target promoters. Deciphering the interplay between the promoter connectivity and activity of cis- regulatory elements during lineage commitment is crucial for understanding developmental transcriptional control. Here, we use Promoter Capture Hi-C to generate a high-resolution atlas of chromosomal interactions involving ~22,000 gene promoters in human pluripotent and lineage-committed cells, identifying putative target genes for known and predicted enhancer elements. We reveal extensive dynamics of cis -regulatory contacts upon lineage commitment, including the acquisition and loss of promoter interactions. This spatial rewiring occurs preferentially with predicted changes in the activity of cis- regulatory elements and is associated with changes in target gene expression. Our results provide a global and integrated view of promoter interactome dynamics during lineage commitment of human pluripotent cells. DOI:  http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21926.001

Title: The Evolution of Ultraconserved Elements in Vertebrates
Authors: Mitchell Cummins, Cadel Watson, Richard J Edwards, John S Mattick
Date: 2024-07

Abstract:
Ultraconserved elements were discovered two decades ago, arbitrarily defined as sequences that are identical over a length ≥ 200 bp in the human, mouse, and rat genomes. The definition was subsequently extended to sequences ≥ 100 bp identical in at least three of five mammalian genomes (including dog and cow), and shown to have undergone rapid expansion from ancestors in fish and strong negative selection in birds and mammals. Since then, many more genomes have become available, allowing better definition and more thorough examination of ultraconserved element distribution and evolutionary history. We developed a fast and flexible analytical pipeline for identifying ultraconserved elements in multiple genomes, dedUCE , which allows manipulation of minimum length, sequence identity, and number of species with a detectable ultraconserved element according to specified parameters. We suggest an updated definition of ultraconserved elements as sequences ≥ 100 bp and ≥97% sequence identity in ≥50% of placental mammal orders (12,813 ultraconserved elements). By mapping ultraconserved elements to ∼200 species, we find that placental ultraconserved elements appeared early in vertebrate evolution, well before land colonization, suggesting that the evolutionary pressures driving ultraconserved element selection were present in aquatic environments in the Cambrian–Devonian periods. Most (>90%) ultraconserved elements likely appeared after the divergence of gnathostomes from jawless predecessors, were largely established in sequence identity by early Sarcopterygii evolution—before the divergence of lobe-finned fishes from tetrapods—and became near fixed in the amniotes. Ultraconserved elements are mainly located in the introns of protein-coding and noncoding genes involved in neurological and skeletomuscular development, enriched in regulatory elements, and dynamically expressed throughout embryonic development.

Title: The Advances in Deep Learning Modeling of Polyadenylation Codes
Authors: Emily Kunce Stroup, Tianjiao Sun, Qianru Li, John Carinato, Zhe Ji
Date: 2025-06-04

Abstract:
3′‐end cleavage and polyadenylation is an essential step of eukaryotic mRNA and lncRNA expression. The formation of a polyadenylation (polyA) site is determined by combinatory effects of multiple tandem motifs (~6 motifs in humans), each of which is bound by a protein subcomplex. However, motif occurrences and compositions are quite variable across individual polyA sites, leading to the technical challenge of quantifying polyadenylation activities and defining cleavage sites. Although conventional motif enrichment analyses and machine learning models identified contributing polyadenylation motifs, these cannot unbiasedly quantify motif crosstalk. Recently, several groups developed deep learning models to resolve sequence complexity, capture complex positional interactions among cis ‐regulatory motifs, examine polyA site formation, predict cleavage probability, and calculate site strength. These deep learning models have brought novel insights into polyadenylation biology, such as site configuration differences across species, cleavage heterogeneity, genomic parameters regulating site expression, and human genetic variants altering polyadenylation activities. In this review, we summarize the advances of deep learning models developed to address facets of polyadenylation regulation and discuss applications of the models.

Abstract:
Correct daily phasing of transcription confers an adaptive advantage to almost all organisms, including higher plants. In this study, we describe a hypothesis-driven network discovery pipeline that identifies biologically relevant patterns in genome-scale data. To demonstrate its utility, we analyzed a comprehensive matrix of time courses interrogating the nuclear transcriptome of Arabidopsis thaliana plants grown under different thermocycles, photocycles, and circadian conditions. We show that 89% of Arabidopsis transcripts cycle in at least one condition and that most genes have peak expression at a particular time of day, which shifts depending on the environment. Thermocycles alone can drive at least half of all transcripts critical for synchronizing internal processes such as cell cycle and protein synthesis. We identified at least three distinct transcription modules controlling phase-specific expression, including a new midnight specific module, PBX/TBX/SBX. We validated the network discovery pipeline, as well as the midnight specific module, by demonstrating that the PBX element was sufficient to drive diurnal and circadian condition-dependent expression. Moreover, we show that the three transcription modules are conserved across Arabidopsis , poplar, and rice. These results confirm the complex interplay between thermocycles, photocycles, and the circadian clock on the daily transcription program, and provide a comprehensive view of the conserved genomic targets for a transcriptional network key to successful adaptation.

Abstract:
Vertebrate early embryogenesis is initially directed by a set of maternal RNAs and proteins, yet the mechanisms controlling this program remain largely unknown. Recent transcriptome-wide studies on RNA structure have revealed its pervasive and crucial roles in RNA processing and functions, but whether and how RNA structure regulates the fate of the maternal transcriptome have yet to be determined. Here we establish the global map of four nucleotide-based mRNA structures by icSHAPE during zebrafish early embryogenesis. Strikingly, we observe that RNA structurally variable regions are enriched in the 3′ UTR and contain cis -regulatory elements important for maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT). We find that the RNA-binding protein Elavl1a stabilizes maternal mRNAs by binding to the cis -elements. Conversely, RNA structure formation suppresses Elavl1a’s binding leading to the decay of its maternal targets. Our study finds that RNA structurally variable regions are enriched in mRNA 3′ UTRs and contain cis -regulatory elements during zebrafish early embryogenesis. We reveal that Elavl1a regulates maternal RNA stability in an RNA structure-dependent fashion. Overall, our findings reveal a broad and fundamental role of RNA structure-based regulation in vertebrate early embryogenesis.

Abstract:
Growing evidence indicates that transcriptional regulatory elements can exert both promoter and enhancer activity; however, the relationship and determinants of this dual functionality remain poorly understood. We developed a massively parallel dual reporter assay that enables simultaneous assessment of the intrinsic promoter and enhancer potential exerted by the same sequence. Parallel quantification for thousands of elements reveals that canonical human promoters and enhancers can act as both promoters and enhancers under the same contexts, and that promoter activity may be necessary but not sufficient for enhancer function. We find that regulatory potential is intrinsic to element sequences, irrespective of downstream features typically associated with distinct element classes. Perturbations to element transcription factor binding motifs lead to disruptions in both activities, implicating a shared syntax for the two regulatory functions. Combinations of elements with different minimal promoters reveal reciprocal activity modulation between associated elements and a strong positive correlation between promoter and enhancer functions imply a bidirectional feedback loop used to maintain environments of high transcriptional activity. Finally, our results indicate that the magnitude and balance between promoter and enhancer functions are shaped by both intrinsic sequence properties and contextual regulatory influences, suggesting a degree of plasticity in regulatory action. Our approach provides a new lens for understanding fundamental principles of regulatory element biology.

Title: Lineage-determining transcription factor-driven promoters regulate cell type-specific macrophage gene expression
Authors: Gergely Nagy, Dóra Bojcsuk, Petros Tzerpos, Tímea Cseh, László Nagy
Date: 2024-05-08

Abstract:
Mammalian promoters consist of multifarious elements, which make them unique and support the selection of the proper transcript variants required under diverse conditions in distinct cell types. However, their direct DNA-transcription factor (TF) interactions are mostly unidentified. Murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) are a widely used model for studying gene expression regulation. Thus, this model serves as a rich source of various next-generation sequencing data sets, including a large number of TF cistromes. By processing and integrating the available cistromic, epigenomic and transcriptomic data from BMDMs, we characterized the macrophage-specific direct DNA-TF interactions, with a particular emphasis on those specific for promoters. Whilst active promoters are enriched for certain types of typically methylatable elements, more than half of them contain non-methylatable and prototypically promoter-distal elements. In addition, circa 14% of promoters—including that of Csf1r —are composed exclusively of ‘distal’ elements that provide cell type-specific gene regulation by specialized TFs. Similar to CG-rich promoters, these also contain methylatable CG sites that are demethylated in a significant portion and show high polymerase activity. We conclude that this unusual class of promoters regulates cell type-specific gene expression in macrophages, and such a mechanism might exist in other cell types too.

Abstract:
Genetic mapping studies on crops suggest that agronomic traits can be controlled by gene-distal intergenic loci. Despite the biological importance and the potential agronomic utility of these loci, they remain virtually uncharacterized in all crop species to date. Here, we provide genetic, epigenomic, and functional molecular evidence supporting the widespread existence of gene-distal (hereafter, distal) loci which act as long-range transcriptional cis-regulatory elements (CREs) in the maize genome. Such loci are enriched for euchromatic features that suggest their regulatory functions. Chromatin loops link together putative CREs with genes and recapitulate genetic interactions. Additionally, putative CREs display elevated transcriptional enhancer activities, as measured by STARR-seq. These results provide functional support for the widespread existence of CREs which act over large genomic distances to control gene expression.

Abstract:
Most double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viruses use the host transcriptional machinery to express viral genes for replication and immune evasion. This is mediated by viral cis-regulatory elements (CREs) regulated by host and viral transcription factors (TFs). Although some viral CREs and their regulatory mechanisms have been determined, most remain unidentified. Here, we used massively parallel reporter assays to identify ~2,000 CREs across 27 dsDNA viruses from the Adenovirus, Herpesvirus, Polyomavirus and Papillomavirus families. Viral genomes have a higher CRE density than the human genome, with most viral CREs having promoter-like features and overlapping protein coding sequences. Using saturation mutagenesis and machine learning models, we report viral CRE regulators, including SP, ETS, bZIPs, and TFs acting downstream of signal-activated pathways. Altogether, we present a comprehensive functional CRE map of human-infecting dsDNA viruses that serves as a blueprint for further studies in viral regulation, reactivation, evolution, and viral vector design.

Abstract:
The interactions between transcription factors (TFs) and cis -regulatory DNA sequences control gene expression, constituting the essential functional linkages of gene regulatory networks. The aim of this study is to identify and integrate all putative TFs from six grass species: Brachypodium distachyon , maize, rice, sorghum, barley, and wheat with significant information into an integrative database (GramineaeTFDB) for comparative genomics and functional genomics. For each TF, sequence features, promoter regions, domain alignments, GO assignment, FL-cDNA information, if available, and cross-references to various public databases and genetic resources are provided. Additionally, GramineaeTFDB possesses a tool which aids the users to search for putative cis -elements located in the promoter regions of TFs and predict the functions of the TFs using cis -element-based functional prediction approach. We also supplied hyperlinks to expression profiles of those TF genes of maize, rice, and barley, for which data are available. Furthermore, information about the availability of FOX and Ds mutant lines for rice and maize TFs, respectively, are also accessible through hyperlinks. Our study provides an important user-friendly public resource for functional analyses and comparative genomics of grass TFs, and understanding of the architecture of transcriptional regulatory networks and evolution of the TFs in agriculturally important cereal crops.

Abstract:
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of melanoma risk have identified 68 independent signals at 54 loci. For most loci, specific functional variants and their respective target genes remain to be established. Capture-HiC is an assay that links fine-mapped risk variants to candidate target genes by comprehensively mapping cell-type specific chromatin interactions. We performed a melanoma GWAS region-focused capture-HiC assay in human primary melanocytes to identify physical interactions between fine-mapped risk variants and potential causal melanoma susceptibility genes. Overall, chromatin interaction data alone nominated potential causal genes for 61 of the 68 melanoma risk signals, identifying many candidates beyond those reported by previous studies. We further integrated these data with cell-type specific epigenomic (chromatin state, accessibility), gene expression (eQTL/TWAS), DNA methylation (meQTL/MWAS), and massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) data to prioritize potentially cis -regulatory variants and their respective candidate gene targets. From the set of fine-mapped variants across these loci, we identified 140 prioritized candidate causal variants linked to 195 candidate genes at 42 risk signals. In addition, we developed an integrative scoring system to facilitate candidate gene prioritization, integrating melanocyte and melanoma datasets. Notably, at several GWAS risk signals we observed long-range chromatin connections (500 kb to >1 Mb) with distant candidate target genes. We validated several such cis -regulatory interactions using CRISPR inhibition, providing evidence for known cancer driver genes MDM4 and CBL , as well as the SRY-box transcription factor SOX4 , as likely melanoma risk genes.

Title: Genomic identification and expression profiling of WRKY genes in alfalfa ( Medicago sativa ) elucidate their responsiveness to seed vigor
Authors: Shoujiang Sun, Wen Ma, Peisheng Mao
Date: 2023-11-16

Abstract:
Seed aging is a critical factor contributing to vigor loss, leading to delayed forage seed germination and seedling growth. Numerous studies have revealed the regulatory role of WRKY transcription factors in seed development, germination, and seed vigor. However, a comprehensive genome-wide analysis of WRKY genes in Zhongmu No.1 alfalfa has not yet been conducted. In this study, a total of 91 MsWRKY genes were identified from the genome of alfalfa. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that these MsWRKY genes could be categorized into seven distinct subgroups. Furthermore, 88 MsWRKY genes were unevenly mapped on eight chromosomes in alfalfa. Gene duplication analysis revealed segmental duplication as the principal driving force for the expansion of this gene family during the course of evolution. Expression analysis of the 91 MsWRKY genes across various tissues and during seed germination exhibited differential expression patterns. Subsequent RT-qPCR analysis highlighted significant induction of nine selected MsWRKY genes in response to seed aging treatment, suggesting their potential roles in regulating seed vigor. This study investigated WRKY genes in alfalfa and identified nine candidate WRKY transcription factors involved in the regulation of seed vigor. While this finding provides valuable insights into understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying vigor loss and developing new strategies to enhance alfalfa seed germinability, further research is required to comprehensively elucidate the precise pathways through which the MsWRKY genes modulate seed vigor.

Title: Revealing cell cycle control by combining model-based detection of periodic expression with novel cis -regulatory descriptors
Authors: Claes R Andersson, Torgeir R Hvidsten, Anders Isaksson, Mats G Gustafsson, Jan Komorowski
Date: 2007

Abstract:
We address the issue of explaining the presence or absence of phase-specific transcription in budding yeast cultures under different conditions. To this end we use a model-based detector of gene expression periodicity to divide genes into classes depending on their behavior in experiments using different synchronization methods. While computational inference of gene regulatory circuits typically relies on expression similarity (clustering) in order to find classes of potentially co-regulated genes, this method instead takes advantage of known time profile signatures related to the studied process. We explain the regulatory mechanisms of the inferred periodic classes with cis -regulatory descriptors that combine upstream sequence motifs with experimentally determined binding of transcription factors. By systematic statistical analysis we show that periodic classes are best explained by combinations of descriptors rather than single descriptors, and that different combinations correspond to periodic expression in different classes. We also find evidence for additive regulation in that the combinations of cis -regulatory descriptors associated with genes periodically expressed in fewer conditions are frequently subsets of combinations associated with genes periodically expression in more conditions. Finally, we demonstrate that our approach retrieves combinations that are more specific towards known cell-cycle related regulators than the frequently used clustering approach. The results illustrate how a model-based approach to expression analysis may be particularly well suited to detect biologically relevant mechanisms. Our new approach makes it possible to provide more refined hypotheses about regulatory mechanisms of the cell cycle and it can easily be adjusted to reveal regulation of other, non-periodic, cellular processes.

Abstract:
Mice lacking the bHLH transcription factor (TF) Neurog3 do not form pancreatic islet cells, including insulin-secreting beta cells, the absence of which leads to diabetes. In humans, homozygous mutations of NEUROG3 manifest with neonatal or childhood diabetes. Despite this critical role in islet cell development, the precise function of and downstream genetic programs regulated directly by NEUROG3 remain elusive. Therefore, we mapped genome-wide NEUROG3 occupancy in human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)–derived endocrine progenitors and determined NEUROG3 dependency of associated genes to uncover direct targets. We generated a novel hiPSC line (NEUROG3-HA-P2A-Venus) where NEUROG3 is HA-tagged and fused to a self-cleaving fluorescent VENUS reporter. We used the CUT&RUN technique to map NEUROG3 occupancy and epigenetic marks in pancreatic endocrine progenitors (PEP) that were differentiated from this hiPSC line. We integrated NEUROG3 occupancy data with chromatin status and gene expression in PEPs as well as their NEUROG3-dependence. In addition, we investigated whether NEUROG3 binds type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)–associated variants at the PEP stage. CUT&RUN revealed a total of 863 NEUROG3 binding sites assigned to 1263 unique genes. NEUROG3 occupancy was found at promoters as well as at distant cis-regulatory elements that frequently overlapped within PEP active enhancers. De novo motif analyses defined a NEUROG3 consensus binding motif and suggested potential co-regulation of NEUROG3 target genes by FOXA or RFX transcription factors. We found that 22% of the genes downregulated in NEUROG3 −/− PEPs, and 10% of genes enriched in NEUROG3-Venus positive endocrine cells were bound by NEUROG3 and thus likely to be directly regulated. NEUROG3 binds to 138 transcription factor genes, some with important roles in islet cell development or function, such as NEUROD1, PAX4, NKX2-2, SOX4, MLXIPL, LMX1B, RFX3 , and NEUROG3 itself, and many others with unknown islet function. Unexpectedly, we uncovered that NEUROG3 targets genes critical for insulin secretion in beta cells (e.g., GCK, ABCC8/KCNJ11, CACNA1A, CHGA, SCG2, SLC30A8, and PCSK1). Thus, analysis of NEUROG3 occupancy suggests that the transient expression of NEUROG3 not only promotes islet destiny in uncommitted pancreatic progenitors, but could also initiate endocrine programs essential for beta cell function. Lastly, we identified eight T2DM risk SNPs within NEUROG3-bound regions. Mapping NEUROG3 genome occupancy in PEPs uncovered unexpectedly broad, direct control of the endocrine genes, raising novel hypotheses on how this master regulator controls islet and beta cell differentiation.

Title: Emerging applications of read profiles towards the functional annotation of the genome
Authors: Sachin Pundhir, Panayiota Poirazi, Jan Gorodkin
Date: 2015-05-19

Abstract:
Functional annotation of the genome is important to understand the phenotypic complexity of various species. The road toward functional annotation involves several challenges ranging from experiments on individual molecules to large-scale analysis of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) data. HTS data is typically a result of the protocol designed to address specific research questions. The sequencing results in reads, which when mapped to a reference genome often leads to the formation of distinct patterns (read profiles). Interpretation of these read profiles is essential for their analysis in relation to the research question addressed. Several strategies have been employed at varying levels of abstraction ranging from a somewhat ad hoc to a more systematic analysis of read profiles. These include methods which can compare read profiles, e.g., from direct (non-sequence based) alignments to classification of patterns into functional groups. In this review, we highlight the emerging applications of read profiles for the annotation of non-coding RNA and cis -regulatory elements (CREs) such as enhancers and promoters. We also discuss the biological rationale behind their formation.

Title: Divergence of Peroxisome Membrane Gene Sequence and Expression Between Yeast Species
Authors: Claire A. Dubin, Jeremy I. Roop, Rachel B. Brem
Date: 2020-04-21

Abstract:
Large population-genomic sequencing studies can enable highly-powered analyses of sequence signatures of natural selection. Genome repositories now available for Saccharomyces yeast make it a premier model for studies of the molecular mechanisms of adaptation. We mined the genomes of hundreds of isolates of the sister species S. cerevisiae and S. paradoxus to identify sequence hallmarks of adaptive divergence between the two. From the top hits we focused on a set of genes encoding membrane proteins of the peroxisome, an organelle devoted to lipid breakdown and other specialized metabolic pathways. In-depth population- and comparative-genomic sequence analyses of these genes revealed striking divergence between S. cerevisiae and S. paradoxus . And from transcriptional profiles we detected non-neutral, directional cis -regulatory variation at the peroxisome membrane genes, with overall high expression in S. cerevisiae relative to S. paradoxus . Taken together, these data support a model in which yeast species have differentially tuned the expression of peroxisome components to boost their fitness in distinct niches.

Abstract:
It is a long-held belief in evolutionary biology that the rate of molecular evolution for a given DNA sequence is inversely related to the level of functional constraint. This belief holds true for the protein-coding homeotic (Hox) genes originally discovered in Drosophila melanogaster . Expression of the Hox genes in Drosophila embryos is essential for body patterning and is controlled by an extensive array of cis -regulatory modules (CRMs). How the regulatory modules functionally evolve in different species is not clear. A comparison of the CRMs for the Abdominal-B gene from different Drosophila species reveals relatively low levels of overall sequence conservation. However, embryonic enhancer CRMs from other Drosophila species direct transgenic reporter gene expression in the same spatial and temporal patterns during development as their D. melanogaster orthologs. Bioinformatic analysis reveals the presence of short conserved sequences within defined CRMs, representing gap and pair-rule transcription factor binding sites. One predicted binding site for the gap transcription factor KRUPPEL in the IAB5 CRM was found to be altered in Superabdominal ( Sab ) mutations. In Sab mutant flies, the third abdominal segment is transformed into a copy of the fifth abdominal segment. A model for KRUPPEL-mediated repression at this binding site is presented. These findings challenge our current understanding of the relationship between sequence evolution at the molecular level and functional activity of a CRM. While the overall sequence conservation at Drosophila CRMs is not distinctive from neighboring genomic regions, functionally critical transcription factor binding sites within embryonic enhancer CRMs are highly conserved. These results have implications for understanding mechanisms of gene expression during embryonic development, enhancer function, and the molecular evolution of eukaryotic regulatory modules.

Title: Transposable Elements Continuously Remodel the Regulatory Landscape, Transcriptome, and Function of Decidual Stromal Cells
Authors: Katelyn Mika, Vincent J Lynch
Date: 2022-12

Abstract:
Gene expression evolution underlies the origin, divergence, and conservation of biological characters including cell-types, tissues, and organ systems. Previously we showed that large-scale gene expression changes in decidual stromal cells (DSCs) contributed to the origins of pregnancy in eutherians and the divergence of pregnancy traits in primates and that transposable elements likely contributed to these gene expression changes. Here we show that two large waves of TEs remodeled the transcriptome and regulatory landscape of DSCs, including a major wave in primates. Genes nearby TE-derived regulatory elements are among the most progesterone responsive in the genome and play essential roles in orchestrating progesterone responsiveness and the core function of decidual cells by donating progesterone receptor binding sites to the genome. We tested the regulatory abilities of 89 TE consensus sequences and found that nearly all of them acted as repressors in mammalian cells, but treatment with a histone deacetylase inhibitor unmasked latent enhancer functions. These data indicate that TEs have played an important role in the development, evolution, and function of primate DSCs and suggest a two-step model in which latent enhancer functions of TEs are unmasked after they lose primary repressor functions.

Abstract:
Sex differences in gene expression are widespread in the liver, where many autosomal factors act in tandem with growth hormone signaling to regulate individual variability of sex differences in liver metabolism and disease. Here, we compare hepatic transcriptomic and epigenetic profiles of mouse strains C57BL/6J and CAST/EiJ, representing two subspecies separated by 0.5–1 million years of evolution, to elucidate the actions of genetic factors regulating liver sex differences. We identify 144 protein coding genes and 78 lncRNAs showing strain-conserved sex bias; many have gene ontologies relevant to liver function, are more highly liver-specific and show greater sex bias, and are more proximally regulated than genes whose sex bias is strain-dependent. The strain-conserved genes include key growth hormone-dependent transcriptional regulators of liver sex bias; however, three other transcription factors, Trim24 , Tox , and Zfp809 , lose their sex-biased expression in CAST/EiJ mouse liver. To elucidate the observed strain specificities in expression, we characterized the strain-dependence of sex-biased chromatin opening and enhancer marks at cis regulatory elements (CREs) within expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) regulating liver sex-biased genes. Strikingly, 208 of 286 eQTLs with strain-specific, sex-differential effects on expression were associated with a complete gain, loss, or reversal of the sex differences in expression between strains. Moreover, 166 of the 286 eQTLs were linked to the strain-dependent gain or loss of localized sex-biased CREs. Remarkably, a subset of these CREs apparently lacked strain-specific genetic variants yet showed coordinated, strain-dependent sex-biased epigenetic regulation. Thus, we directly link hundreds of strain-specific genetic variants to the high variability in CRE activity and expression of sex-biased genes and uncover underlying genetically-determined epigenetic states controlling liver sex bias in genetically diverse mouse populations.

Title: A cis-regulatory logic simulator
Authors: Robert D Zeigler, Jason Gertz, Barak A Cohen
Date: 2007

Abstract:
A major goal of computational studies of gene regulation is to accurately predict the expression of genes based on the cis-regulatory content of their promoters. The development of computational methods to decode the interactions among cis-regulatory elements has been slow, in part, because it is difficult to know, without extensive experimental validation, whether a particular method identifies the correct cis-regulatory interactions that underlie a given set of expression data. There is an urgent need for test expression data in which the interactions among cis-regulatory sites that produce the data are known. The ability to rapidly generate such data sets would facilitate the development and comparison of computational methods that predict gene expression patterns from promoter sequence. We developed a gene expression simulator which generates expression data using user-defined interactions between cis-regulatory sites. The simulator can incorporate additive, cooperative, competitive, and synergistic interactions between regulatory elements. Constraints on the spacing, distance, and orientation of regulatory elements and their interactions may also be defined and Gaussian noise can be added to the expression values. The simulator allows for a data transformation that simulates the sigmoid shape of expression levels from real promoters. We found good agreement between sets of simulated promoters and predicted regulatory modules from real expression data. We present several data sets that may be useful for testing new methodologies for predicting gene expression from promoter sequence. We developed a flexible gene expression simulator that rapidly generates large numbers of simulated promoters and their corresponding transcriptional output based on specified interactions between cis-regulatory sites. When appropriate rule sets are used, the data generated by our simulator faithfully reproduces experimentally derived data sets. We anticipate that using simulated gene expression data sets will facilitate the direct comparison of computational strategies to predict gene expression from promoter sequence. The source code is available online and as additional material. The test sets are available as additional material.

Title: The Loci of Evolution: How Predictable is Genetic Evolution?
Authors: David L Stern, Virginie Orgogozo
Date: 2008-09

Abstract:
Is genetic evolution predictable? Evolutionary developmental biologists have argued that, at least for morphological traits, the answer is a resounding yes. Most mutations causing morphological variation are expected to reside in the cis -regulatory, rather than the coding, regions of developmental genes. This “ cis -regulatory hypothesis” has recently come under attack. In this review, we first describe and critique the arguments that have been proposed in support of the cis -regulatory hypothesis. We then test the empirical support for the cis -regulatory hypothesis with a comprehensive survey of mutations responsible for phenotypic evolution in multicellular organisms. Cis -regulatory mutations currently represent approximately 22% of 331 identified genetic changes although the number of cis -regulatory changes published annually is rapidly increasing. Above the species level, cis -regulatory mutations altering morphology are more common than coding changes. Also, above the species level cis -regulatory mutations predominate for genes not involved in terminal differentiation. These patterns imply that the simple question “Do coding or cis -regulatory mutations cause more phenotypic evolution?” hides more interesting phenomena. Evolution in different kinds of populations and over different durations may result in selection of different kinds of mutations. Predicting the genetic basis of evolution requires a comprehensive synthesis of molecular developmental biology and population genetics.

Abstract:
The natural history of multiple myeloma is characterized by its localization to the bone marrow and its interaction with bone marrow stromal cells. The bone marrow stromal cells provide growth and survival signals, thereby promoting the development of drug resistance. Here, we show that the interaction between bone marrow stromal cells and myeloma cells (using human cell lines) induces chromatin remodeling of cis-regulatory elements and is associated with changes in the expression of genes involved in the cell migration and cytokine signaling. The expression of genes involved in these stromal interactions are observed in extramedullary disease in patients with myeloma and provides the rationale for survival of myeloma cells outside of the bone marrow microenvironment. Expression of these stromal interaction genes is also observed in a subset of patients with newly diagnosed myeloma and are akin to the transcriptional program of extramedullary disease. The presence of such adverse stromal interactions in newly diagnosed myeloma is associated with accelerated disease dissemination, predicts the early development of therapeutic resistance, and is of independent prognostic significance. These stromal cell induced transcriptomic and epigenomic changes both predict long-term outcomes and identify therapeutic targets in the tumor microenvironment for the development of novel therapeutic approaches.

Abstract:
There remains much that we do not understand about the earliest stages of human development. On a gross level, there is evidence for apoptosis, but the nature of the affected cell types is unknown. Perhaps most importantly, the inner cell mass (ICM), from which the foetus is derived and hence of interest in reproductive health and regenerative medicine, has proven hard to define. Here, we provide a multi-method analysis of the early human embryo to resolve these issues. Single-cell analysis (on multiple independent datasets), supported by embryo visualisation, uncovers a common previously uncharacterised class of cells lacking commitment markers that segregates after embryonic gene activation (EGA) and shortly after undergo apoptosis. The discovery of this cell type allows us to clearly define their viable ontogenetic sisters, these being the cells of the ICM. While ICM is characterised by the activity of an Old non-transposing endogenous retrovirus (HERVH) that acts to suppress Young transposable elements, the new cell type, by contrast, expresses transpositionally competent Young elements and DNA-damage response genes. As the Young elements are RetroElements and the cells are excluded from the developmental process, we dub these REject cells. With these and ICM being characterised by differential mobile element activities, the human embryo may be a “selection arena” in which one group of cells selectively die, while other less damaged cells persist.

Title: Mouse genomic and cellular annotations
Authors: Helen Long, Richard Reeves, Michelle M. Simon
Date: 2022-02-05

Abstract:
Mice have emerged as one of the most popular and valuable model organisms in the research of human biology. This is due to their genetic and physiological similarity to humans, short generation times, availability of genetically homologous inbred strains, and relatively easy laboratory maintenance. Therefore, following the release of the initial human reference genome, the generation of the mouse reference genome was prioritised and represented an important scientific resource for the mouse genetics community. In 2002, the Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium published an initial draft of the mouse reference genome which contained ~ 96% of the euchromatic genome of female C57BL/6 J mice. Almost two decades on from the publication of the initial draft, sequencing efforts have continued to increase the completeness and accuracy of the C57BL/6 J reference genome alongside advances in genome annotation. Additionally new sequencing technologies have provided a wealth of data that has added to the repertoire of annotations associated with traditional genomic annotations. Including but not limited to advances in regulatory elements, the 3D genome and individual cellular states. In this review we focus on the reference genome C57BL/6 J and summarise the different aspects of genomic and cellular annotations, as well as their relevance to mouse genetic research. We denote a genomic annotation as a functional unit of the genome. Cellular annotations are annotations of cell type or state, defined by the transcriptomic expression profile of a cell. Due to the wide-ranging number and diversity of annotations describing the mouse genome, we focus on gene, repeat and regulatory element annotation as well as two relatively new technologies; 3D genome architecture and single-cell sequencing outlining their utility in genetic research and their current challenges.

Abstract:
The human and mouse genomes contain instructions that specify RNAs and proteins and govern the timing, magnitude, and cellular context of their production. To better delineate these elements, phase III of the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Project has expanded analysis of the cell and tissue repertoires of RNA transcription, chromatin structure and modification, DNA methylation, chromatin looping, and occupancy by transcription factors and RNA-binding proteins. Here we summarize these efforts, which have produced 5,992 new experimental datasets, including systematic determinations across mouse fetal development. All data are available through the ENCODE data portal ( https://www.encodeproject.org ), including phase II ENCODE 1 and Roadmap Epigenomics 2 data. We have developed a registry of 926,535 human and 339,815 mouse candidate cis -regulatory elements, covering 7.9 and 3.4% of their respective genomes, by integrating selected datatypes associated with gene regulation, and constructed a web-based server (SCREEN; http://screen.encodeproject.org ) to provide flexible, user-defined access to this resource. Collectively, the ENCODE data and registry provide an expansive resource for the scientific community to build a better understanding of the organization and function of the human and mouse genomes.

Title: Requirement of two simultaneous environmental signals for activation of Arabidopsis ELIP2 promoter in response to high light, cold, and UV-B stresses

Date: 2024-08-12

Abstract:
Arabidopsis EARLY LIGH-INDUCIBLE PROTEIN 2 (ELIP2) is a chlorophyll- and carotenoid-binding protein and is involved in photoprotection under stress conditions. Because its expression is induced through high light, cold, or UV-B stressors, its mechanism of induction has been studied. It is known that a functional unit found in the promoter, which is composed of Element B and Element A, is required and sufficient for full activation by these stressors. In this study, the role of each element in the unit was analyzed by introducing weak mutations in each element as synthetic promoters in addition to intensive repeat constructs of each single element. The results suggest that a stressor like cold stress generates two parallel signals in plant cells, and they merge at the promoter region for the activation of ELIP2 expression, which constitutes an “AND” gate and has a potential to realize strong response with high specificity by an environmental trigger.

Title: The Role of Chromatin Accessibility in cis -Regulatory Evolution
Authors: Pei-Chen Peng, Pierre Khoueiry, Charles Girardot, James P Reddington, David A Garfield, Eileen E M Furlong, Saurabh Sinha
Date: 2019-07

Abstract:
Transcription factor (TF) binding is determined by sequence as well as chromatin accessibility. Although the role of accessibility in shaping TF-binding landscapes is well recorded, its role in evolutionary divergence of TF binding, which in turn can alter cis -regulatory activities, is not well understood. In this work, we studied the evolution of genome-wide binding landscapes of five major TFs in the core network of mesoderm specification, between Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila virilis , and examined its relationship to accessibility and sequence-level changes. We generated chromatin accessibility data from three important stages of embryogenesis in both Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila virilis and recorded conservation and divergence patterns. We then used multivariable models to correlate accessibility and sequence changes to TF-binding divergence. We found that accessibility changes can in some cases, for example, for the master regulator Twist and for earlier developmental stages, more accurately predict binding change than is possible using TF-binding motif changes between orthologous enhancers. Accessibility changes also explain a significant portion of the codivergence of TF pairs. We noted that accessibility and motif changes offer complementary views of the evolution of TF binding and developed a combined model that captures the evolutionary data much more accurately than either view alone. Finally, we trained machine learning models to predict enhancer activity from TF binding and used these functional models to argue that motif and accessibility-based predictors of TF-binding change can substitute for experimentally measured binding change, for the purpose of predicting evolutionary changes in enhancer activity.

Abstract:
Cell type differences in the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) transcriptome may arise from variations in transcription or post-transcription regulation. Here we report unexpected differences in transcription and epigenetic control in late-stage HCMV infection of human differentiated NTera2 neural lineage cells (D-NT2) compared to fibroblasts, using integrated functional genomic approaches (PRO-Seq, RNA-Seq, DNA fragmentation factor-ChIP Seq, rapid viral protein degradation, and promoter mutation and function assays). In D-NT2, but not fibroblasts, RNA polymerase II initiation and elongation at several viral promoters requires viral DNA synthesis and are independent of host P-TEFb, viral immediate-early protein 2 (IE2), or viral late transcription factor (LTF). This includes transcription from the enhancer for the major immediate early (MIE) promoter where GC-box sequence mutations increase enhancer transcription, while mutations in CREB and NF- kB response elements reduce it. The GC-box mutations also alter infected D-NT2 cell morphology and gene expression program without affecting viral MIE gene expression levels, whereas mutations in CREB and NF- k B response elements do not induce these changes. In D-NT2, LTF-driven promoters constitute a smaller proportion of the viral late promoter population and are generally less active. Additionally, viral genomes have more nucleosomes, potentially restricting LTF access. A TATA-binding protein (TBP)-IE2-nucleosome complex, with more nucleosome than in fibroblasts, occupies the MIE promoter transcription start site, potentially contributing to its epigenetic silencing.

Title: Mapping Regulatory Determinants in Plants
Authors: Mary Galli, Fan Feng, Andrea Gallavotti
Date: 2020-10-28

Abstract:
The domestication and improvement of many plant species have frequently involved modulation of transcriptional outputs and continue to offer much promise for targeted trait engineering. The cis-regulatory elements (CREs) controlling these trait-associated transcriptional variants however reside within non-coding regions that are currently poorly annotated in most plant species. This is particularly true in large crop genomes where regulatory regions constitute only a small fraction of the total genomic space. Furthermore, relatively little is known about how CREs function to modulate transcription in plants. Therefore understanding where regulatory regions are located within a genome, what genes they control, and how they are structured are important factors that could be used to guide both traditional and synthetic plant breeding efforts. Here, we describe classic examples of regulatory instances as well as recent advances in plant regulatory genomics. We highlight valuable molecular tools that are enabling large-scale identification of CREs and offering unprecedented insight into how genes are regulated in diverse plant species. We focus on chromatin environment, transcription factor (TF) binding, the role of transposable elements, and the association between regulatory regions and target genes.

Title: Phylum-Level Conservation of Regulatory Information in Nematodes despite Extensive Non-coding Sequence Divergence
Authors: Kacy L. Gordon, Robert K. Arthur, Ilya Ruvinsky
Date: 2015-05-28

Abstract:
Gene regulatory information guides development and shapes the course of evolution. To test conservation of gene regulation within the phylum Nematoda, we compared the functions of putative cis-regulatory sequences of four sets of orthologs ( unc-47 , unc-25 , mec-3 and elt-2 ) from distantly-related nematode species. These species, Caenorhabditis elegans , its congeneric C . briggsae , and three parasitic species Meloidogyne hapla , Brugia malayi , and Trichinella spiralis , represent four of the five major clades in the phylum Nematoda. Despite the great phylogenetic distances sampled and the extensive sequence divergence of nematode genomes, all but one of the regulatory elements we tested are able to drive at least a subset of the expected gene expression patterns. We show that functionally conserved cis-regulatory elements have no more extended sequence similarity to their C . elegans orthologs than would be expected by chance, but they do harbor motifs that are important for proper expression of the C . elegans genes. These motifs are too short to be distinguished from the background level of sequence similarity, and while identical in sequence they are not conserved in orientation or position. Functional tests reveal that some of these motifs contribute to proper expression. Our results suggest that conserved regulatory circuitry can persist despite considerable turnover within cis elements.

Abstract:
To address large gaps in our understanding of the molecular regulation of articular and growth plate cartilage development in humans, we used our directed differentiation approach to generate these distinct cartilage tissues from human embryonic stem cells. The resulting transcriptomic profiles of hESC-derived articular and growth plate chondrocytes were similar to fetal epiphyseal and growth plate chondrocytes, with respect to genes both known and previously unknown to cartilage biology. With the goal to characterize the regulatory landscapes accompanying these respective transcriptomes, we mapped chromatin accessibility in hESC-derived chondrocyte lineages, and mouse embryonic chondrocytes, using ATAC-sequencing. Integration of the expression dataset with the differentially accessible genomic regions revealed lineage-specific gene regulatory networks. We validated functional interactions of two transcription factors (TFs) (RUNX2 in growth plate chondrocytes and RELA in articular chondrocytes) with their predicted genomic targets. The maps we provide thus represent a framework for probing regulatory interactions governing chondrocyte differentiation. This work constitutes a substantial step towards comprehensive and comparative molecular characterizations of distinct chondrogenic lineages and sheds new light on human cartilage development and biology.

Abstract:
RNA interference (RNAi) plays key roles in post-transcriptional and chromatin modification levels as well as regulates various eukaryotic gene expressions which are involved in stress responses, development and maintenance of genome integrity during developmental stages. The whole mechanism of RNAi pathway is directly involved with the gene-silencing process by the interaction of Dicer-Like ( DCL ), Argonaute ( AGO ) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase ( RDR ) gene families and their regulatory elements. However, these RNAi gene families and their sub-cellular locations, functional pathways and regulatory components were not extensively investigated in the case of economically and nutritionally important fruit plant sweet orange ( Citrus sinensis L.). Therefore, in silico characterization, gene diversity and regulatory factor analysis of RNA silencing genes in C . sinensis were conducted by using the integrated bioinformatics approaches. Genome-wide comparison analysis based on phylogenetic tree approach detected 4 CsDCL , 8 CsAGO and 4 CsRDR as RNAi candidate genes in C . sinensis corresponding to the RNAi genes of model plant Arabidopsis thaliana . The domain and motif composition and gene structure analyses for all three gene families exhibited almost homogeneity within the same group members. The Gene Ontology enrichment analysis clearly indicated that the predicted genes have direct involvement into the gene-silencing and other important pathways. The key regulatory transcription factors (TFs) MYB, Dof, ERF, NAC, MIKC_MADS, WRKY and bZIP were identified by their interaction network analysis with the predicted genes. The cis -acting regulatory elements associated with the predicted genes were detected as responsive to light, stress and hormone functions. Furthermore, the expressed sequence tag (EST) analysis showed that these RNAi candidate genes were highly expressed in fruit and leaves indicating their organ specific functions. Our genome-wide comparison and integrated bioinformatics analyses provided some necessary information about sweet orange RNA silencing components that would pave a ground for further investigation of functional mechanism of the predicted genes and their regulatory factors.

Title: Identification of tissue-specific cis-regulatory modules based on interactions between transcription factors
Authors: Xueping Yu, Jimmy Lin, Donald J Zack, Jiang Qian
Date: 2007

Abstract:
Evolutionary conservation has been used successfully to help identify cis-acting DNA regions that are important in regulating tissue-specific gene expression. Motivated by increasing evidence that some DNA regulatory regions are not evolutionary conserved, we have developed an approach for cis-regulatory region identification that does not rely upon evolutionary sequence conservation. The conservation-independent approach is based on an empirical potential energy between interacting transcription factors (TFs). In this analysis, the potential energy is defined as a function of the number of TF interactions in a genomic region and the strength of the interactions. By identifying sets of interacting TFs, the analysis locates regions enriched with the binding sites of these interacting TFs. We applied this approach to 30 human tissues and identified 6232 putative cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) regulating 2130 tissue-specific genes. Interestingly, some genes appear to be regulated by different CRMs in different tissues. Known regulatory regions are highly enriched in our predicted CRMs. In addition, DNase I hypersensitive sites, which tend to be associated with active regulatory regions, significantly overlap with the predicted CRMs, but not with more conserved regions. We also find that conserved and non-conserved CRMs regulate distinct gene groups. Conserved CRMs control more essential genes and genes involved in fundamental cellular activities such as transcription. In contrast, non-conserved CRMs, in general, regulate more non-essential genes, such as genes related to neural activity. These results demonstrate that identifying relevant sets of binding motifs can help in the mapping of DNA regulatory regions, and suggest that non-conserved CRMs play an important role in gene regulation.

Abstract:
Transcriptional regulation, which involves a complex interplay between regulatory sequences and proteins, directs all biological processes. Computational models of transcription lack generalizability to accurately extrapolate to unseen cell types and conditions. Here we introduce GET (general expression transformer), an interpretable foundation model designed to uncover regulatory grammars across 213 human fetal and adult cell types 1 , 2 . Relying exclusively on chromatin accessibility data and sequence information, GET achieves experimental-level accuracy in predicting gene expression even in previously unseen cell types 3 . GET also shows remarkable adaptability across new sequencing platforms and assays, enabling regulatory inference across a broad range of cell types and conditions, and uncovers universal and cell-type-specific transcription factor interaction networks. We evaluated its performance in prediction of regulatory activity, inference of regulatory elements and regulators, and identification of physical interactions between transcription factors and found that it outperforms current models 4 in predicting lentivirus-based massively parallel reporter assay readout 5 , 6 . In fetal erythroblasts 7 , we identified distal (greater than 1 Mbp) regulatory regions that were missed by previous models, and, in B cells, we identified a lymphocyte-specific transcription factor–transcription factor interaction that explains the functional significance of a leukaemia risk predisposing germline mutation 8 – 10 . In sum, we provide a generalizable and accurate model for transcription together with catalogues of gene regulation and transcription factor interactions, all with cell type specificity.

Abstract:
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease caused by a variety of mutations in transcription factors, epigenetic regulators and signaling molecules. To determine how different mutant regulators establish AML subtype-specific transcriptional networks we performed a comprehensive global analysis of cis-regulatory element activity and interaction, transcription factor occupancy and gene expression patterns in purified leukemic blast cells. Here, we focussed on specific sub-groups of patients carrying mutations in genes encoding transcription factors ( RUNX1, CEBPA) and signaling molecules ( FTL3-ITD, RAS, NPM1). Integrated analyses of these data demonstrates that each mutant regulator establishes a specific transcriptional and signaling network unrelated to that seen in normal cells, sustaining the expression of unique sets of genes required for AML growth and maintenance.

Title: scEpiLock: A Weakly Supervised Learning Framework for cis -Regulatory Element Localization and Variant Impact Quantification for Single-Cell Epigenetic Data
Authors: Yanwen Gong, Shushrruth Sai Srinivasan, Ruiyi Zhang, Kai Kessenbrock, Jing Zhang
Date: 2022-06-23

Abstract:
Recent advances in single-cell transposase-accessible chromatin using a sequencing assay (scATAC-seq) allow cellular heterogeneity dissection and regulatory landscape reconstruction with an unprecedented resolution. However, compared to bulk-sequencing, its ultra-high missingness remarkably reduces usable reads in each cell type, resulting in broader, fuzzier peak boundary definitions and limiting our ability to pinpoint functional regions and interpret variant impacts precisely. We propose a weakly supervised learning method, scEpiLock, to directly identify core functional regions from coarse peak labels and quantify variant impacts in a cell-type-specific manner. First, scEpiLock uses a multi-label classifier to predict chromatin accessibility via a deep convolutional neural network. Then, its weakly supervised object detection module further refines the peak boundary definition using gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM). Finally, scEpiLock provides cell-type-specific variant impacts within a given peak region. We applied scEpiLock to various scATAC-seq datasets and found that it achieves an area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of ~0.9 and an area under precision recall (AUPR) above 0.7. Besides, scEpiLock’s object detection condenses coarse peaks to only ⅓ of their original size while still reporting higher conservation scores. In addition, we applied scEpiLock on brain scATAC-seq data and reported several genome-wide association studies (GWAS) variants disrupting regulatory elements around known risk genes for Alzheimer’s disease, demonstrating its potential to provide cell-type-specific biological insights in disease studies.

Authors: Anil Panigrahi, Bert W. O’Malley
Date: 2021-04-15

Abstract:
Differential gene expression mechanisms ensure cellular differentiation and plasticity to shape ontogenetic and phylogenetic diversity of cell types. A key regulator of differential gene expression programs are the enhancers, the gene-distal cis -regulatory sequences that govern spatiotemporal and quantitative expression dynamics of target genes. Enhancers are widely believed to physically contact the target promoters to effect transcriptional activation. However, our understanding of the full complement of regulatory proteins and the definitive mechanics of enhancer action is incomplete. Here, we review recent findings to present some emerging concepts on enhancer action and also outline a set of outstanding questions. The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s13059-021-02322-1.

Abstract:
Chromatin insulators or boundary elements protect genes from regulatory activities from neighboring genes or chromatin domains. In the Drosophila Abdominal-B ( Abd-B ) locus, the deletion of such elements, such as Frontabdominal-7 ( Fab-7 ) or Fab-8 led to dominant gain of function phenotypes, presumably due to the loss of chromatin barriers. Homologous chromosomes are paired in Drosophila , creating a number of pairing dependent phenomena including transvection, and whether transvection may affect the function of Polycomb response elements (PREs) and thus contribute to the phenotypes are not known. Here, we studied the chromatin barrier activity of Fab-8 and how it is affected by the zygosity of the transgene, and found that Fab-8 is able to block the silencing effect of the Ubx PRE on the DsRed reporter gene in a CTCF binding sites dependent manner. However, the blocking also depends on the zygosity of the transgene in that the barrier activity is present when the transgene is homozygous, but absent when the transgene is heterozygous. To analyze this effect, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation and quantitative PCR (ChIP-qPCR) experiments on homozygous transgenic embryos, and found that H3K27me3 and H3K9me3 marks are restricted by Fab-8 , but they spread beyond Fab-8 into the DsRed gene when the two CTCF binding sites within Fab-8 were mutated. Consistent with this, the mutation reduced H3K4me3 and RNA Pol II binding to the DsRed gene, and consequently, DsRed expression. Importantly, in heterozygous embryos, Fab-8 is unable to prevent the spread of H3K27me3 and H3K9me3 marks from crossing Fab-8 into DsRed, suggesting an insulator bypass. These results suggest that in the Abd-B locus, deletion of the insulator in one copy of the chromosome could lead to the loss of insulator activity on the homologous chromosome, and in other loci where chromosomal deletion created hemizygous regions of the genome, the chromatin barrier could be compromised. This study highlights a role of homologous chromosome pairing in the regulation of gene expression in the Drosophila genome.

Title: An insulator element 3′ to the CFTR gene binds CTCF and reveals an active chromatin hub in primary cells
Authors: Neil P. Blackledge, Christopher J. Ott, Austin E. Gillen, Ann Harris
Date: 2009-03

Abstract:
Regulation of expression of the CFTR gene is poorly understood. Elements within the basal promoter of the gene do not fully explain CFTR expression patterns, suggesting that cis -regulatory elements are located elsewhere, either within the locus or in adjacent chromatin. We previously mapped DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHS) in 400 kb spanning the CFTR locus including a cluster of sites close to the 3′-end of the gene. Here we focus on a DHS at +6.8 kb from the CFTR translation end-point to evaluate its potential role in regulating expression of the gene. This DHS, which encompasses a consensus CTCF-binding site, was evident in primary human epididymis cells that express abundant CFTR mRNA. We show by DNase I footprinting and electophoretic mobility shift assays that the cis -regulatory element within this DHS binds CTCF in vitro . We further demonstrate that the element functions as an enhancer blocker in a well-established in vivo assay, and by using chromatin immunoprecipitation that it recruits CTCF in vivo . Moreover, we reveal that in primary epididymis cells, the +6.8 kb DHS interacts closely with the CFTR promoter, suggesting that the CFTR locus exists in a looped conformation, characteristic of an active chromatin hub.

Abstract:
A growing body of research on the transcriptome and cancer genome has demonstrated that many gynecological tumor-specific gene mutations are located in cis-regulatory elements. Through chromosomal looping, cis-regulatory elements interact which each other to control gene expression by bringing distant regulatory elements, such as enhancers and insulators, into close proximity with promoters. It is well known that chromatin connections may be disrupted in cancer cells, promoting transcriptional dysregulation and the expression of abnormal tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes. In this review, we examine the roles of alterations in 3D chromatin interactions. This includes changes in CTCF protein function, cancer-risk single nucleotide polymorphisms, viral integration, and hormonal response as part of the mechanisms that lead to the acquisition of enhancers or super-enhancers. The translocation of existing enhancers, as well as enhancer loss or acquisition of insulator elements that interact with gene promoters, is also revised. Remarkably, similar processes that modify 3D chromatin contacts in gene promoters may also influence the expression of non-coding RNAs, such as long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs), which have emerged as key regulators of gene expression in a variety of cancers, including gynecological malignancies.

Abstract:
Mammalian genomes contain millions of regulatory elements that control the complex patterns of gene expression. Previously, The ENCODE consortium mapped biochemical signals across many cell types and tissues and integrated these data to develop a Registry of 0.9 million human and 300 thousand mouse candidate cis-Regulatory Elements (cCREs) annotated with potential functions 1 . We have expanded the Registry to include 2.35 million human and 927 thousand mouse cCREs, leveraging new ENCODE datasets and enhanced computational methods. This expanded Registry covers hundreds of unique cell and tissue types, providing a comprehensive understanding of gene regulation. Functional characterization data from assays like STARR-seq, MPRA, CRISPR perturbation, and transgenic mouse assays now cover over 90% of human cCREs, revealing complex regulatory functions. We identified thousands of novel silencer cCREs and demonstrated their dual enhancer/silencer roles in different cellular contexts. Integrating the Registry with other ENCODE annotations facilitates genetic variation interpretation and trait-associated gene identification, exemplified by discovering KLF1 as a novel causal gene for red blood cell traits. This expanded Registry is a valuable resource for studying the regulatory genome and its impact on health and disease.

Title: HIPP1 stabilizes the interaction between CP190 and Su(Hw) in the Drosophila insulator complex
Authors: Larisa Melnikova, Varvara Molodina, Maksim Erokhin, Pavel Georgiev, Anton Golovnin
Date: 2019-12-13

Abstract:
Suppressor of Hairy-wing [Su(Hw)] is one of the best characterized architectural proteins in Drosophila and recruits the CP190 and Mod(mdg4)-67.2 proteins to chromatin, where they form a well-known insulator complex. Recently, HP1 and insulator partner protein 1 (HIPP1), a homolog of the human co-repressor Chromodomain Y-Like (CDYL), was identified as a new partner for Su(Hw). Here, we performed a detailed analysis of the domains involved in the HIPP1 interactions with Su(Hw)-dependent complexes. HIPP1 was found to directly interact with the Su(Hw) C-terminal region (aa 720–892) and with CP190, but not with Mod(mdg4)-67.2. We have generated Hipp1 null mutants (Hipp Δ1 ) and found that the loss of Hipp1 does not affect the enhancer-blocking or repression activities of the Su(Hw)-dependent complex. However, the simultaneous inactivation of both HIPP1 and Mod(mdg4)-67.2 proteins resulted in reduced CP190 binding with Su(Hw) sites and significantly altered gypsy insulator activity. Taken together, these results suggested that the HIPP1 protein stabilized the interaction between CP190 and the Su(Hw)-dependent complex.

Abstract:
Cancer is a disease of the genome caused by oncogene activation and tumor suppressor gene inhibition. Deep sequencing studies including large consortia such as TCGA and ICGC identified numerous tumor‐specific mutations not only in protein‐coding sequences but also in non‐coding sequences. Although 98% of the genome is not translated into proteins, most studies have neglected the information hidden in this “dark matter” of the genome. Malignancy‐driving mutations can occur in all genetic elements outside the coding region, namely in enhancer, silencer, insulator, and promoter as well as in 5′‐ UTR and 3′‐ UTR . Intron or splice site mutations can alter the splicing pattern. Moreover, cancer genomes contain mutations within non‐coding RNA , such as micro RNA , lnc RNA , and linc RNA . A synonymous mutation changes the coding region in the DNA and RNA but not the protein sequence. Importantly, oncogenes such as TERT or miR‐21 as well as tumor suppressor genes such as TP 53 / p53 , APC , BRCA 1, or RB 1 can be affected by these alterations. In summary, coding‐independent mutations can affect gene regulation from transcription, splicing, mRNA stability to translation, and hence, this largely neglected area needs functional studies to elucidate the mechanisms underlying tumorigenesis. This review will focus on the important role and novel mechanisms of these non‐coding or allegedly silent mutations in tumorigenesis.

Title: Igf2 adult-specific skeletal muscle enhancer activity revealed in mice with intergenic CTCF boundary deletion
Authors: Joanne L. Thorvaldsen, Aimee M. Juan, Yemin Lan, Christopher Krapp, Marisa S. Bartolomei
Date: 2025-08-29

Abstract:
Precise, monoallelic expression of imprinted genes is governed by cis regulatory elements called imprinting control regions (ICRs) and enhancer-promoter (E-P) interactions shaped by local chromatin architecture. The Igf2/H19 locus employs allele-specific CTCF binding at the ICR to instruct enhancer accessibility to maternal H19 and paternal Igf2 promoters. Here, we investigate the CTCF-bound centrally conserved domain (CCD), intergenic to H19 and Igf2 , and an adjacent widely expressed lncRNA. Using transgenic mice, deletion alleles reinforced CCD as a neonatal muscle-specific repressor of maternal Igf2 . However, deletion of the abutting lncRNA did not affect Igf2 levels. Unexpectedly, in adult skeletal muscle where Igf2 is normally repressed, absence of CCD resulted in remarkable, high-level activation of Igf2 from both parental alleles. Through multimodal chromatin analyses, we identified a conserved putative adult skeletal muscle enhancer (PaSME) insulated between chromatin domains at ICR and CCD. We propose that removal of CCD allows PaSME to drive robust abnormal Igf2 activation on both alleles in adult skeletal muscle. Thus, we uncover CCD as a developmental biallelic muscle-specific repressor, adding a new layer of architectural regulation to the extensively studied Igf2/H19 locus.

Title: Transcriptional enhancers and their communication with gene promoters
Authors: Helen Ray-Jones, Mikhail Spivakov
Date: 2021-08-19

Abstract:
Transcriptional enhancers play a key role in the initiation and maintenance of gene expression programmes, particularly in metazoa. How these elements control their target genes in the right place and time is one of the most pertinent questions in functional genomics, with wide implications for most areas of biology. Here, we synthesise classic and recent evidence on the regulatory logic of enhancers, including the principles of enhancer organisation, factors that facilitate and delimit enhancer–promoter communication, and the joint effects of multiple enhancers. We show how modern approaches building on classic insights have begun to unravel the complexity of enhancer–promoter relationships, paving the way towards a quantitative understanding of gene control.

Title: Transcriptional read through interrupts boundary function in Drosophila
Authors: Olga Kyrchanova, Vladimir Sokolov, Maxim Tikhonov, Paul Schedl, Pavel Georgiev
Date: 2023-02-16

Abstract:
In higher eukaryotes enhancer-promoter interactions are known to be restricted by the chromatin insulators/boundaries that delimit topologically associated domains (TADs); however, there are instances in which enhancer-promoter interactions span one or more boundary elements/TADs. At present, the mechanisms that enable cross-TAD regulatory interaction are not known. In the studies reported here we have taken advantage of the well characterized Drosophila Bithorax complex (BX-C) to study one potential mechanism for controlling boundary function and TAD organization. The regulatory domains of BX-C are flanked by boundaries which function to block crosstalk with their neighboring domains and also to support long distance interactions between the regulatory domains and their target gene. As many lncRNAs have been found in BX-C, we asked whether transcriptional readthrough can impact boundary function. For this purpose, we took advantage of two BX-C boundary replacement platforms, Fab-7 attP50 and F2 attP , in which the Fab-7 and Fub boundaries, respectively, are deleted and replaced with an attP site. We introduced boundary elements, promoters and polyadenylation signals arranged in different combinations and then assayed for boundary function. Our results show that transcriptional readthrough can interfere with boundary activity. Since lncRNAs represent a significant fraction of Pol II transcripts in multicellular eukaryotes, it is possible that many of them may function in the regulation of TAD organization.

Abstract:
Retroviruses integrate their genetic material into the host genome, enabling persistent infection. Human T cell leukaemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) share similarities in genome structure and target cells, yet their infection dynamics differ drastically. While HIV-1 leads to high viral replication and immune system collapse, HTLV-1 establishes latency, promoting the survival of infected cells and, in some cases, leading to leukaemia. The mechanisms underlying this latency preference remain unclear. Here we analyse blood samples from people with HTLV-1 and identify an open chromatin region within the HTLV-1 provirus that functions as a transcriptional silencer and regulates transcriptional burst. The host transcription factor RUNX1 binds to this open chromatin region, repressing viral expression. Mutation of this silencer enhances HTLV-1 replication and immunogenicity, while its insertion into HIV-1 suppresses viral production. These findings reveal a strategy by which HTLV-1 ensures long-term persistence, offering potential insights into retroviral evolution and therapeutic targets.

Title: Mechanisms of Interaction between Enhancers and Promoters in Three Drosophila Model Systems
Authors: Olga Kyrchanova, Vladimir Sokolov, Pavel Georgiev
Date: 2023-02-02

Abstract:
In higher eukaryotes, the regulation of developmental gene expression is determined by enhancers, which are often located at a large distance from the promoters they regulate. Therefore, the architecture of chromosomes and the mechanisms that determine the functional interaction between enhancers and promoters are of decisive importance in the development of organisms. Mammals and the model animal Drosophila have homologous key architectural proteins and similar mechanisms in the organization of chromosome architecture. This review describes the current progress in understanding the mechanisms of the formation and regulation of long-range interactions between enhancers and promoters at three well-studied key regulatory loci in Drosophila.

Authors: Costantino Parisi, Shikha Vashisht, Cecilia Lanny Winata
Date: 2021-04-10

Abstract:
Precise control of gene expression is crucial to ensure proper development and biological functioning of an organism. Enhancers are non-coding DNA elements which play an essential role in regulating gene expression. They contain specific sequence motifs serving as binding sites for transcription factors which interact with the basal transcription machinery at their target genes. Heart development is regulated by intricate gene regulatory network ensuring precise spatiotemporal gene expression program. Mutations affecting enhancers have been shown to result in devastating forms of congenital heart defect. Therefore, identifying enhancers implicated in heart biology and understanding their mechanism is key to improve diagnosis and therapeutic options. Despite their crucial role, enhancers are poorly studied, mainly due to a lack of reliable way to identify them and determine their function. Nevertheless, recent technological advances have allowed rapid progress in enhancer discovery. Model organisms such as the zebrafish have contributed significant insights into the genetics of heart development through enabling functional analyses of genes and their regulatory elements in vivo. Here, we summarize the current state of knowledge on heart enhancers gained through studies in model organisms, discuss various approaches to discover and study their function, and finally suggest methods that could further advance research in this field.

Abstract:
Genome organization into transcriptionally active domains denotes one of the first levels of gene expression regulation. Although the chromatin domain concept is generally accepted, only little is known on how domain organization impacts the regulation of differential gene expression. Insulators might hold answers to address this issue as they delimit and organize chromatin domains. We have previously identified a CTCF-dependent insulator with enhancer-blocking activity embedded in the 5′ non-coding region of the chicken α-globin domain. Here, we demonstrate that this element, called the αEHS-1.4 insulator, protects a transgene against chromosomal position effects in stably transfected cell lines and transgenic mice. We found that this insulator can create a regulated chromatin environment that coincides with the onset of adult α-globin gene expression. Furthermore, such activity is in part dependent on the in vivo regulated occupancy of CTCF at the αEHS-1.4 element. Insulator function is also regulated by CTCF poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation. Our results suggest that the αEHS-1.4 insulator contributes in organizing the chromatin structure of the α-globin gene domain and prevents activation of adult α-globin gene expression at the erythroblast stage via CTCF.

Abstract:
Discoveries in the field of genomics have revealed that non-coding genomic regions are not merely "junk DNA", but rather comprise critical elements involved in gene expression. These gene regulatory elements (GREs) include enhancers, insulators, silencers, and gene promoters. Notably, new evidence shows how mutations within these regions substantially influence gene expression programs, especially in the context of cancer. Advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies have accelerated the identification of somatic and germline single nucleotide mutations in non-coding genomic regions. This review provides an overview of somatic and germline non-coding single nucleotide alterations affecting transcription factor binding sites in GREs, specifically involved in cancer biology. It also summarizes the technologies available for exploring GREs and the challenges associated with studying and characterizing non-coding single nucleotide mutations. Understanding the role of GRE alterations in cancer is essential for improving diagnostic and prognostic capabilities in the precision medicine era, leading to enhanced patient-centered clinical outcomes.

Title: Promoter cross-talk via a shared enhancer explains paternally biased expression of Nctc1 at the Igf2/H19/Nctc1 imprinted locus
Authors: Bokkee Eun, Megan L. Sampley, Austin L. Good, Claudia M. Gebert, Karl Pfeifer
Date: 2013-01

Abstract:
Developmentally regulated transcription often depends on physical interactions between distal enhancers and their cognate promoters. Recent genomic analyses suggest that promoter–promoter interactions might play a similarly critical role in organizing the genome and establishing cell-type-specific gene expression. The Igf2/H19 locus has been a valuable model for clarifying the role of long-range interactions between cis -regulatory elements. Imprinted expression of the linked, reciprocally imprinted genes is explained by parent-of-origin-specific chromosomal loop structures between the paternal Igf2 or maternal H19 promoters and their shared tissue-specific enhancer elements. Here, we further analyze these loop structures for their composition and their impact on expression of the linked long non-coding RNA, Nctc1 . We show that Nctc1 is co-regulated with Igf2 and H19 and physically interacts with the shared muscle enhancer. In fact, all three co-regulated genes have the potential to interact not only with the shared enhancer but also with each other via their enhancer interactions. Furthermore, developmental and genetic analyses indicate functional significance for these promoter–promoter interactions. Altogether, we present a novel mechanism to explain developmental specific imprinting of Nctc1 and provide new information about enhancer mechanisms and about the role of chromatin domains in establishing gene expression patterns.

Title: Systematic identification of silencers in human cells
Authors: Baoxu Pang, Michael P. Snyder
Date: 2020-02-24

Abstract:
The majority of the human genome does not encode proteins. Many of these noncoding regions contain important regulatory sequences that control gene expression. To date, most studies have focused on activators such as enhancers, but regions that repress gene expression—silencers—have not been systematically studied. We have developed a system that identifies silencer regions in a genome-wide fashion on the basis of silencer-mediated transcriptional repression of caspase 9. We found that silencers are widely distributed and may function in a tissue-specific fashion. These silencers harbor unique epigenetic signatures and are associated with specific transcription factors. Silencers also act at multiple genes, and at the level of chromosomal domains and long-range interactions. Deletion of silencer regions linked to the drug transporter genes ABCC2 and ABCG2 caused chemo-resistance. Overall, our study demonstrates that tissue-specific silencing is widespread throughout the human genome and likely contributes substantially to the regulation of gene expression and human biology.

Authors: Wataru Yoshida, Junko Tomikawa, Makoto Inaki, Hiroshi Kimura, Masafumi Onodera, Kenichiro Hata, Kazuhiko Nakabayashi
Date: 2015-06-25

Abstract:
Insulators are cis -elements that control the direction of enhancer and silencer activities (enhancer-blocking) and protect genes from silencing by heterochromatinization (barrier activity). Understanding insulators is critical to elucidate gene regulatory mechanisms at chromosomal domain levels. Here, we focused on a genomic region upstream of the mouse Ccnb1ip1 (cyclin B1 interacting protein 1) gene that was methylated in E9.5 embryos of the C57BL/6 strain, but unmethylated in those of the 129X1/SvJ and JF1/Ms strains. We hypothesized the existence of an insulator-type element that prevents the spread of DNA methylation within the 1.8 kbp segment, and actually identified a 242-bp and a 185-bp fragments that were located adjacent to each other and showed insulator and enhancer activities, respectively, in reporter assays. We designated these genomic regions as the Ccnb1ip1 insulator and the Ccnb1ip1 enhancer. The Ccnb1ip1 insulator showed enhancer-blocking activity in the luciferase assays and barrier activity in the colony formation assays. Further examination of the Ccnb1ip1 locus in other mammalian species revealed that the insulator and enhancer are highly conserved among a wide variety of species, and are located immediately upstream of the transcriptional start site of Ccnb1ip1 . These newly identified cis-elements may be involved in transcriptional regulation of Ccnb1ip1 , which is important in meiotic crossing-over and G2/M transition of the mitotic cell cycle.

Title: The Role of Insulation in Patterning Gene Expression
Authors: Isa Özdemir, Maria Cristina Gambetta
Date: 2019-09-28

Abstract:
Development is orchestrated by regulatory elements that turn genes ON or OFF in precise spatial and temporal patterns. Many safety mechanisms prevent inappropriate action of a regulatory element on the wrong gene promoter. In flies and mammals, dedicated DNA elements (insulators) recruit protein factors (insulator binding proteins, or IBPs) to shield promoters from regulatory elements. In mammals, a single IBP called CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) is known, whereas genetic and biochemical analyses in Drosophila have identified a larger repertoire of IBPs. How insulators function at the molecular level is not fully understood, but it is currently thought that they fold chromosomes into conformations that affect regulatory element-promoter communication. Here, we review the discovery of insulators and describe their properties. We discuss recent genetic studies in flies and mice to address the question: Is gene insulation important for animal development? Comparing and contrasting observations in these two species reveal that they have different requirements for insulation, but that insulation is a conserved and critical gene regulation strategy.

Title: The CTCF insulator protein forms an unusual DNA structure
Authors: Melissa J MacPherson, Paul D Sadowski
Date: 2010

Abstract:
The CTCF insulator protein is a highly conserved zinc finger protein that has been implicated in many aspects of gene regulation and nuclear organization. The protein has been hypothesized to organize the human genome by forming DNA loops. In this paper, we report biochemical evidence to support the role for CTCF in forming DNA loops. We have measured DNA bending by CTCF at the chicken HS4 β-globin FII insulator element in vitro and have observed a unique DNA structure with aberrant electrophoretic mobility which we believe to be a DNA loop. CTCF is able to form this unusual DNA structure at two other binding sites: the c-myc P2 promoter and the chicken F1 lysozyme gene silencer. We also demonstrate that the length though not the sequence of the DNA downstream of the binding site is important for the ability of CTCF to form this unusual DNA structure. We hypothesize that a single CTCF protein molecule is able to act as a "looper" possibly through the use of several of its zinc fingers. CTCF is able to form an unusual DNA structure through the zinc finger domain of the protein. This unusual DNA structure is formed in a directional manner by the CTCF protein. The findings described in this paper suggest mechanisms by which CTCF is able to form DNA loops, organize the mammalian genome and function as an insulator protein.

Abstract:
The functions of non-coding regulatory elements (NCREs), which constitute a major fraction of the human genome, have not been systematically studied. Here we report a method involving libraries of paired single-guide RNAs targeting both ends of an NCRE as a screening system for the Cas9-mediated deletion of thousands of NCREs genome-wide to study their functions in distinct biological contexts. By using K562 and 293T cell lines and human embryonic stem cells, we show that NCREs can have redundant functions, and that many ultra-conserved elements have silencer activity and play essential roles in cell growth and in cellular responses to drugs (notably, the ultra-conserved element PAX6_Tarzan may be critical for heart development, as removing it from human embryonic stem cells led to defects in cardiomyocyte differentiation). The high-throughput screen, which is compatible with single-cell sequencing, may allow for the identification of druggable NCREs.

Title:  CTCF shapes chromatin structure and gene expression in health and disease
Authors: Bondita Dehingia, Małgorzata Milewska, Marcin Janowski, Aleksandra Pękowska
Date: 2022-08-22

Abstract:
CCCTC‐binding factor (CTCF) is an eleven zinc finger (ZF), multivalent transcriptional regulator, that recognizes numerous motifs thanks to the deployment of distinct combinations of its ZFs. The great majority of the ~50,000 genomic locations bound by the CTCF protein in a given cell type is intergenic, and a fraction of these sites overlaps with transcriptional enhancers. Furthermore, a proportion of the regions bound by CTCF intersect genes and promoters. This suggests multiple ways in which CTCF may impact gene expression. At promoters, CTCF can directly affect transcription. At more distal sites, CTCF may orchestrate interactions between regulatory elements and help separate eu‐ and heterochromatic areas in the genome, exerting a chromatin barrier function. In this review, we outline how CTCF contributes to the regulation of the three‐dimensional structure of chromatin and the formation of chromatin domains. We discuss how CTCF binding and architectural functions are regulated. We examine the literature implicating CTCF in controlling gene expression in development and disease both by acting as an insulator and a factor facilitating regulatory elements to efficiently interact with each other in the nuclear space.

Abstract:
Insulators are multiprotein–DNA complexes that regulate the nuclear architecture. The Drosophila CP190 protein is a cofactor for the DNA-binding insulator proteins Su(Hw), CTCF, and BEAF-32. The fact that CP190 has been found at genomic sites devoid of either of the known insulator factors has until now been unexplained. We have identified two DNA-binding zinc-finger proteins, Pita, and a new factor named ZIPIC, that interact with CP190 in vivo and in vitro at specific interaction domains. Genomic binding sites for these proteins are clustered with CP190 as well as with CTCF and BEAF-32. Model binding sites for Pita or ZIPIC demonstrate a partial enhancer-blocking activity and protect gene expression from PRE-mediated silencing. The function of the CTCF-bound MCP insulator sequence requires binding of Pita. These results identify two new insulator proteins and emphasize the unifying function of CP190, which can be recruited by many DNA-binding insulator proteins.

Title: Orientation-dependent interaction between Drosophila insulators is a property of this class of regulatory elements
Authors: Olga Kyrchanova, Darya Chetverina, Oksana Maksimenko, Andrey Kullyev, Pavel Georgiev
Date: 2008-12

Abstract:
Insulators are defined as a class of regulatory elements that delimit independent transcriptional domains within eukaryotic genomes. According to previous data, an interaction (pairing) between some Drosophila insulators can support distant activation of a promoter by an enhancer. Here, we have demonstrated that pairs of well-studied insulators such as scs–scs, scs’–scs’, 1A2–1A2 and Wari–Wari support distant activation of the white promoter by the yeast GAL4 activator in an orientation-dependent manner. The same is true for the efficiency of the enhancer that stimulates white expression in the eyes. In all insulator pairs tested, stimulation of the white gene was stronger when insulators were inserted between the eye enhancer or GAL4 and the white promoter in opposite orientations relative to each other. As shown previously, Zw5, Su(Hw) and dCTCF proteins are required for the functioning of different insulators that do not interact with each other. Here, strong functional interactions have been revealed between DNA fragments containing binding sites for either Zw5 or Su(Hw) or dCTCF protein but not between heterologous binding sites [Zw5–Su(Hw), dCTCF–Su(Hw), or dCTCF–Zw5]. These results suggest that insulator proteins can support selective interactions between distant regulatory elements.

Title: Mechanisms of Enhancer-Promoter Interactions in Higher Eukaryotes
Authors: Olga Kyrchanova, Pavel Georgiev
Date: 2021-01-12

Abstract:
In higher eukaryotes, enhancers determine the activation of developmental gene transcription in specific cell types and stages of embryogenesis. Enhancers transform the signals produced by various transcription factors within a given cell, activating the transcription of the targeted genes. Often, developmental genes can be associated with dozens of enhancers, some of which are located at large distances from the promoters that they regulate. Currently, the mechanisms underlying specific distance interactions between enhancers and promoters remain poorly understood. This review briefly describes the properties of enhancers and discusses the mechanisms of distance interactions and potential proteins involved in this process.

Title: A role for insulator elements in the regulation of gene expression response to hypoxia

Abstract:
Hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) up-regulates the transcription of a few hundred genes required for the adaptation to hypoxia. This restricted set of targets is in sharp contrast with the widespread distribution of the HIF binding motif throughout the genome. Here, we investigated the transcriptional response of GYS1 and RUVBL2 genes to hypoxia to understand the mechanisms that restrict HIF activity toward specific genes. GYS1 and RUVBL2 genes are encoded by opposite DNA strands and separated by a short intergenic region (~1 kb) that contains a functional hypoxia response element equidistant to both genes. However, hypoxia induced the expression of GYS1 gene only. Analysis of the transcriptional response of chimeric constructs derived from the intergenic region revealed an inhibitory sequence whose deletion allowed RUVBL2 induction by HIF. Enhancer blocking assays, performed in cell culture and transgenic zebrafish, confirmed the existence of an insulator element within this inhibitory region that could explain the differential regulation of GYS1 and RUVBL2 by hypoxia. Hence, in this model, the selective response to HIF is achieved with the aid of insulator elements. This is the first report suggesting a role for insulators in the regulation of differential gene expression in response to environmental signals.

Title: Effective Blocking of the White Enhancer Requires Cooperation between Two Main Mechanisms Suggested for the Insulator Function
Authors: Olga Kyrchanova, Oksana Maksimenko, Viacheslav Stakhov, Tatyana Ivlieva, Alexander Parshikov, Vasily M. Studitsky, Pavel Georgiev

Abstract:
Chromatin insulators block the action of transcriptional enhancers when interposed between an enhancer and a promoter. In this study, we examined the role of chromatin loops formed by two unrelated insulators, gypsy and Fab-7, in their enhancer-blocking activity. To test for this activity, we selected the white reporter gene that is activated by the eye-specific enhancer. The results showed that one copy of the gypsy or Fab-7 insulator failed to block the eye enhancer in most of genomic sites, whereas a chromatin loop formed by two gypsy insulators flanking either the eye enhancer or the reporter completely blocked white stimulation by the enhancer. However, strong enhancer blocking was achieved due not only to chromatin loop formation but also to the direct interaction of the gypsy insulator with the eye enhancer, which was confirmed by the 3C assay. In particular, it was observed that Mod(mdg4)-67.2, a component of the gypsy insulator, interacted with the Zeste protein, which is critical for the eye enhancer– white promoter communication. These results suggest that efficient enhancer blocking depends on the combination of two factors: chromatin loop formation by paired insulators, which generates physical constraints for enhancer–promoter communication, and the direct interaction of proteins recruited to an insulator and to the enhancer–promoter pair.

Abstract:
The action of cis -regulatory elements with either activation or repression functions underpins the precise regulation of gene expression during normal development and cell differentiation. Gene activation by the combined activities of promoters and distal enhancers has been extensively studied in normal and pathological contexts. In sharp contrast, gene repression by cis -acting silencers, defined as genetic elements that negatively regulate gene transcription in a position-independent fashion, is less well understood. Here, we repurpose the STARR-seq approach as a novel high-throughput reporter strategy to quantitatively assess silencer activity in mammals. We assessed silencer activity from DNase hypersensitive I sites in a mouse T cell line. Identified silencers were associated with either repressive or active chromatin marks and enriched for binding motifs of known transcriptional repressors. CRISPR-mediated genomic deletions validated the repressive function of distinct silencers involved in the repression of non-T cell genes and genes regulated during T cell differentiation. Finally, we unravel an association of silencer activity with short tandem repeats, highlighting the role of repetitive elements in silencer activity. Our results provide a general strategy for genome-wide identification and characterization of silencer elements.

Title: Igf2/H19 Imprinting Control Region (ICR): An Insulator or a Position-Dependent Silencer?
Authors: Subhasis Banerjee, Alan Smallwood, Scott Lamond, Stuart Campbell, Geeta Nargund
Date: 2001

Abstract:
The imprinting control region (ICR) located far upstream of the H19 gene, in conjunction with enhancers, modulates the transcription of Igf2 and H19 genes in an allele-specific manner. On paternal inheritance, the methylated ICR silences the H19 gene and indirectly facilitates transcription from the distant Igf2 promoter, whereas on the maternal chromosome the unmethylated ICR, together with enhancers, activates transcription of the H19 gene and thereby contributes to the repression of Igf2. This repression of maternal Igf2 has recently been postulated to be due to a chromatin boundary or insulator function of the unmethylated ICR. Central to the insulator model is the site-specific binding of a ubiquitous nuclear factor CTCF which exhibits remarkable flexibility in functioning as transcriptional activator or silencer. We suggest that the ICR positioned close to the enhancers in an episomal context might function as a transcriptional silencer by virtue of interaction of CTCF with its modifiers such as SIN3A and histone deacetylases. Furthermore, a localised folded chromatin structure resulting from juxtaposition of two disparate regulatory sequences (enhancer ICR) could be the mechanistic basis of ICR-mediated position-dependent (ICR-promoter) transcriptional repression in transgenic Drosophila.

Title: CREPT is required for the metastasis of triple-negative breast cancer through a co-operational-chromatin loop-based gene regulation

Abstract:
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is recognized for its aggressiveness, yet the mechanism underlying metastasis remains unclear. Here, we report that CREPT/RPRD1B, which exhibits somatic gene copy-number amplifications and elevated expression, correlates with poor patient survival and drives TNBC metastasis. We demonstrate that CREPT alters three-dimensional genome structures in topologically-associating domain (TAD) status and chromatin loops via occupying promoters and enhancers. Specifically, CREPT mediates 1082 co-operational chromatin loops configured by enhancer-promoter and promoter-termination loops, which are validated by HiChIP analyses and visualized by Tn5-FISH experiments. These loops orchestrate RNAPII loading and recycling to enhance the metastatic gene expression. Disruption of these co-operational loops using CRISPR-dCas9 suppresses TNBC metastasis in vivo. Furthermore, depletion of CREPT using an AAV-based shRNA blocks TNBC metastasis in both preventative and therapeutic mouse models. We propose that targeting CREPT to disrupt the co-operational chromatin loop structures represents a promising therapeutic strategy for metastatic TNBC.

Title: Insulators Target Active Genes to Transcription Factories and Polycomb-Repressed Genes to Polycomb Bodies
Authors: Hua-Bing Li, Katsuhito Ohno, Hongxing Gui, Vincenzo Pirrotta
Date: 2013-04

Abstract:
Polycomb bodies are foci of Polycomb proteins in which different Polycomb target genes are thought to co-localize in the nucleus, looping out from their chromosomal context. We have shown previously that insulators, not Polycomb response elements (PREs), mediate associations among Polycomb Group (PcG) targets to form Polycomb bodies. Here we use live imaging and 3C interactions to show that transgenes containing PREs and endogenous PcG-regulated genes are targeted by insulator proteins to different nuclear structures depending on their state of activity. When two genes are repressed, they co-localize in Polycomb bodies. When both are active, they are targeted to transcription factories in a fashion dependent on Trithorax and enhancer specificity as well as the insulator protein CTCF. In the absence of CTCF, assembly of Polycomb bodies is essentially reduced to those representing genomic clusters of Polycomb target genes. The critical role of Trithorax suggests that stable association with a specialized transcription factory underlies the cellular memory of the active state.

Abstract:
Both genetic and epigenetic alterations contribute to Facio-Scapulo-Humeral Dystrophy (FSHD), which is linked to the shortening of the array of D4Z4 repeats at the 4q35 locus. The consequence of this rearrangement remains enigmatic, but deletion of this 3.3-kb macrosatellite element might affect the expression of the FSHD-associated gene(s) through position effect mechanisms. We investigated this hypothesis by creating a large collection of constructs carrying 1 to >11 D4Z4 repeats integrated into the human genome, either at random sites or proximal to a telomere, mimicking thereby the organization of the 4q35 locus. We show that D4Z4 acts as an insulator that interferes with enhancer–promoter communication and protects transgenes from position effect. This last property depends on both CTCF and A-type Lamins. We further demonstrate that both anti-silencing activity of D4Z4 and CTCF binding are lost upon multimerization of the repeat in cells from FSHD patients compared to control myoblasts from healthy individuals, suggesting that FSHD corresponds to a gain-of-function of CTCF at the residual D4Z4 repeats. We propose that contraction of the D4Z4 array contributes to FSHD physio-pathology by acting as a CTCF-dependent insulator in patients.

Date: 2022-10-05

Abstract:
Chromatin insulators are responsible for orchestrating long-range interactions between enhancers and promoters throughout the genome and align with the boundaries of Topologically Associating Domains (TADs). Here, we demonstrate an association between gypsy insulator proteins and the phosphorylated histone variant H2Av (γH2Av), normally a marker of DNA double strand breaks. Gypsy insulator components colocalize with γH2Av throughout the genome, in polytene chromosomes and in diploid cells in which Chromatin IP data shows it is enriched at TAD boundaries. Mutation of insulator components su(Hw) and Cp190 results in a significant reduction in γH2Av levels in chromatin and phosphatase inhibition strengthens the association between insulator components and γH2Av and rescues γH2Av localization in insulator mutants. We also show that γH2Av, but not H2Av, is a component of insulator bodies, which are protein condensates that form during osmotic stress. Phosphatase activity is required for insulator body dissolution after stress recovery. Together, our results implicate the H2A variant with a novel mechanism of insulator function and boundary formation.

Abstract:
It is only partially understood how constitutive allelic methylation at imprinting control regions (ICRs) interacts with other regulation levels to drive timely parental allele-specific expression along large imprinted domains. The Peg13-Kcnk9 domain is an imprinted domain with important brain functions. To gain insights into its regulation during neural commitment, we performed an integrative analysis of its allele-specific epigenetic, transcriptomic, and cis -spatial organization using a mouse stem cell-based corticogenesis model that recapitulates the control of imprinted gene expression during neurodevelopment. We found that, despite an allelic higher-order chromatin structure associated with the paternally CTCF-bound Peg13 ICR, enhancer- Kcnk9 promoter contacts occurred on both alleles, although they were productive only on the maternal allele. This observation challenges the canonical model in which CTCF binding isolates the enhancer and its target gene on either side and suggests a more nuanced role for allelic CTCF binding at some ICRs.

Title: Incorporating double copies of a chromatin insulator into lentiviral vectors results in less viral integrants
Authors: Troels T Nielsen, Johan Jakobsson, Nina Rosenqvist, Cecilia Lundberg
Date: 2009

Abstract:
Lentiviral vectors hold great promise as gene transfer vectors in gene therapeutic settings. However, problems related to the risk of insertional mutagenesis, transgene silencing and positional effects have stalled the use of such vectors in the clinic. Chromatin insulators are boundary elements that can prevent enhancer-promoter interactions, if placed between these elements, and protect transgene cassettes from silencing and positional effects. It has been suggested that insulators can improve the safety and performance of lentiviral vectors. Therefore insulators have been incorporated into lentiviral vectors in order to enhance their safety profile and improve transgene expression. Commonly such insulator vectors are produced at lower titers than control vectors thus limiting their potential use. In this study we cloned in tandem copies of the chicken β-globin insulator (cHS4) on both sides of the transgene cassette in order to enhance the insulating effect. Our insulator vectors were produced at significantly lower titers compared to control vectors, and we show that this reduction in titer is due to a block during the transduction process that appears after reverse transcription but before integration of the viral DNA. This non-integrated viral DNA could be detected by PCR and, importantly, prevented efficient transduction of target cells. These results have importance for the future use of insulator sequences in lentiviral vectors and might limit the use of insulators in vectors for in vivo use. Therefore, a careful analysis of the optimal design must be performed before insulators are included into clinical lentiviral vectors.

Title: Cis-regulatory sequences in plants: Their importance, discovery, and future challenges
Authors: Robert J Schmitz, Erich Grotewold, Maike Stam
Date: 2022-02

Abstract:
The identification and characterization of cis - regulatory DNA sequences and how they function to coordinate responses to developmental and environmental cues is of paramount importance to plant biology. Key to these regulatory processes are cis-regulatory modules (CRMs), which include enhancers and silencers. Despite the extraordinary advances in high-quality sequence assemblies and genome annotations, the identification and understanding of CRMs, and how they regulate gene expression, lag significantly behind. This is especially true for their distinguishing characteristics and activity states. Here, we review the current knowledge on CRMs and breakthrough technologies enabling identification, characterization, and validation of CRMs; we compare the genomic distributions of CRMs with respect to their target genes between different plant species, and discuss the role of transposable elements harboring CRMs in the evolution of gene expression. This is an exciting time to study cis-regulomes in plants; however, significant existing challenges need to be overcome to fully understand and appreciate the role of CRMs in plant biology and in crop improvement.

Abstract:
cis -Regulatory communication is crucial in mammalian development and is thought to be restricted by the spatial partitioning of the genome in topologically associating domains (TADs). Here, we discovered that the Xist locus is regulated by sequences in the neighboring TAD. In particular, the promoter of the noncoding RNA Linx ( LinxP ) acts as a long-range silencer and influences the choice of X chromosome to be inactivated. This is independent of Linx transcription and independent of any effect on Tsix, the antisense regulator of Xist that shares the same TAD as Linx. Unlike Tsix, LinxP is well conserved across mammals, suggesting an ancestral mechanism for random monoallelic Xist regulation. When introduced in the same TAD as Xist , LinxP switches from a silencer to an enhancer. Our study uncovers an unsuspected regulatory axis for X chromosome inactivation and a class of cis -regulatory effects that may exploit TAD partitioning to modulate developmental decisions.

Title: Idefix insulator activity can be modulated by nearby regulatory elements
Authors: E. Brasset, F. Bantignies, F. Court, S. Cheresiz, C. Conte, C. Vaury
Date: 2007-04

Abstract:
Insulators play important roles in controlling gene activity and maintaining regulatory independence between neighbouring genes. In this article, we show that the enhancer-blocking activity of the insulator present within the LTR retrotransposon Idefix can be abolished if two copies of the region containing the insulator—specifically, the long terminal repeat (LTR)—are fused to the retrotransposon's 5′ untranslated region (5′ UTR). The presence of this combination of two [LTR-5′ UTR] modules is a prerequisite for the loss of enhancer-blocking activity. We further show that the 5′ UTR causes flanking genomic sequences to be displaced to the nuclear periphery, which is not observed when two insulators are present by themselves. This study thus provides a functional link between insulators and independent genomic modules, which may cooperate to allow the specific regulation of defined genomic loci via nuclear repositioning. It further illustrates the complexity of genomic regulation within a chromatic environment with multiple functional elements.

Title: An insulator blocks access to enhancers by an illegitimate promoter, preventing repression by transcriptional interference
Authors: Miki Fujioka, Anastasiya Nezdyur, James B. Jaynes
Date: 2021-04-26

Abstract:
Several distinct activities and functions have been described for chromatin insulators, which separate genes along chromosomes into functional units. Here, we describe a novel mechanism of functional separation whereby an insulator prevents gene repression. When the homie insulator is deleted from the end of a Drosophila even skipped ( eve ) locus, a flanking P-element promoter is activated in a partial eve pattern, causing expression driven by enhancers in the 3’ region to be repressed. The mechanism involves transcriptional read-through from the flanking promoter. This conclusion is based on the following. Read-through driven by a heterologous enhancer is sufficient to repress, even when homie is in place. Furthermore, when the flanking promoter is turned around, repression is minimal. Transcriptional read-through that does not produce anti-sense RNA can still repress expression, ruling out RNAi as the mechanism in this case. Thus, transcriptional interference, caused by enhancer capture and read-through when the insulator is removed, represses eve promoter-driven expression. We also show that enhancer-promoter specificity and processivity of transcription can have decisive effects on the consequences of insulator removal. First, a core heat shock 70 promoter that is not activated well by eve enhancers did not cause read-through sufficient to repress the eve promoter. Second, these transcripts are less processive than those initiated at the P-promoter, measured by how far they extend through the eve locus, and so are less disruptive. These results highlight the importance of considering transcriptional read-through when assessing the effects of insulators on gene expression.

Abstract:
A special class of poorly characterized architectural proteins is required for chromatin topology and enhancer–promoter interactions. Here, we identify Opbp as a new Drosophila architectural protein, interacting with CP190 both in vivo and in vitro . Opbp binds to a very restrictive set of genomic regions, through a rare sequence specific motif. These sites are co-bound by CP190 in vivo , and generally located at bidirectional promoters of ribosomal protein genes. We show that Opbp is essential for viability, and loss of opbp function, or destruction of its motif, leads to reduced ribosomal protein gene expression, indicating a functional role in promoter activation. As characteristic of architectural/insulator proteins, the Opbp motif is sufficient for distance-dependent reporter gene activation and enhancer-blocking activity, suggesting an Opbp-mediated enhancer–promoter interaction. Rather than having a constitutive role, Opbp represents a new type of architectural protein with a very restricted, yet essential, function in regulation of housekeeping gene expression.

Title: Context Differences Reveal Insulator and Activator Functions of a Su(Hw) Binding Region
Authors: Alexey A. Soshnev, Xingguo Li, Misty D. Wehling, Pamela K. Geyer
Date: 2008-08

Abstract:
Insulators are DNA elements that divide chromosomes into independent transcriptional domains. The Drosophila genome contains hundreds of binding sites for the Suppressor of Hairy-wing [Su(Hw)] insulator protein, corresponding to locations of the retroviral gypsy insulator and non- gypsy binding regions (BRs). The first non- gypsy BR identified, 1A-2, resides in cytological region 1A . Using a quantitative transgene system, we show that 1A-2 is a composite insulator containing enhancer blocking and facilitator elements. We discovered that 1A-2 separates the yellow ( y ) gene from a previously unannotated, non-coding RNA gene, named yar for y - a chaete ( ac ) intergenic R NA. The role of 1A-2 was elucidated using homologous recombination to excise these sequences from the natural location, representing the first deletion of any Su(Hw) BR in the genome. Loss of 1A-2 reduced yar RNA accumulation, without affecting mRNA levels from the neighboring y and ac genes. These data indicate that within the 1A region, 1A-2 acts an activator of yar transcription. Taken together, these studies reveal that the properties of 1A-2 are context-dependent, as this element has both insulator and enhancer activities. These findings imply that the function of non- gypsy Su(Hw) BRs depends on the genomic environment, predicting that Su(Hw) BRs represent a diverse collection of genomic regulatory elements.

Abstract:
Enhancers play a critical role in regulating precise gene expression patterns essential for development and cellular identity; however, how gene-enhancer specificity is encoded within the genome is not clearly defined. To investigate how this specificity arises within topologically associated domains (TAD), we performed allele-specific genome editing of sequences surrounding the Lefty1 and Lefty2 paralogs in mouse embryonic stem cells. The Lefty genes arose from a tandem duplication event and these genes interact with each other in chromosome conformation capture assays which place these genes within the same TAD. Despite their physical proximity, we demonstrate that these genes are primarily regulated by separate enhancer elements. Through CRISPR-Cas9 mediated deletions to remove the intervening chromatin between the Lefty genes, we reveal a distance-dependent dosage effect of the Lefty2 enhancer on Lefty1 expression. These findings indicate a role for chromatin distance in insulating gene expression domains in the Lefty locus in the absence of architectural insulation.

Authors: André M. Ribeiro-dos-Santos, Megan S. Hogan, Raven D. Luther, Ran Brosh, Matthew T. Maurano
Date: 2022-03

Abstract:
The specificity of interactions between genomic regulatory elements and potential target genes is influenced by the binding of insulator proteins such as CTCF, which can act as potent enhancer blockers when interposed between an enhancer and a promoter in a reporter assay. But not all CTCF sites genome-wide function as insulator elements, depending on cellular and genomic context. To dissect the influence of genomic context on enhancer blocker activity, we integrated reporter constructs with promoter-only, promoter and enhancer, and enhancer blocker configurations at hundreds of thousands of genomic sites using the Sleeping Beauty transposase. Deconvolution of reporter activity by genomic position reveals distinct expression patterns subject to genomic context, including a compartment of enhancer blocker reporter integrations with robust expression. The high density of integration sites permits quantitative delineation of characteristic genomic context sensitivity profiles and their decomposition into sensitivity to both local and distant DNase I hypersensitive sites. Furthermore, using a single-cell expression approach to test the effect of integrated reporters for differential expression of nearby endogenous genes reveals that CTCF insulator elements do not completely abrogate reporter effects on endogenous gene expression. Collectively, our results lend new insight into genomic regulatory compartmentalization and its influence on the determinants of promoter–enhancer specificity.

We find distinct combinatorial binding of insulator proteins to different classes of sites and uncover a novel type of insulator element that binds CP190 but not any other known insulator proteins. Functional characterization of different classes of binding sites indicates that only a small fraction act as robust insulators in standard enhancer-blocking assays. We show that insulators restrict the spreading of the H3K27me3 mark but only at a small number of Polycomb target regions and only to prevent repressive histone methylation within adjacent genes that are already transcriptionally inactive. RNAi knockdown of insulator proteins in cultured cells does not lead to major alterations in genome expression. Taken together, these observations argue against the concept of a genome partitioned by specialized boundary elements and suggest that insulators are reserved for specific regulation of selected genes.

Title: Analysis of chromatin boundary activity in Drosophila cells
Authors: Mo Li, Vladimir E Belozerov, Haini N Cai
Date: 2008

Abstract:
Chromatin boundaries, also known as insulators, regulate gene activity by organizing active and repressive chromatin domains and modulate enhancer-promoter interactions. However, the mechanisms of boundary action are poorly understood, in part due to our limited knowledge about insulator proteins, and a shortage of standard assays by which diverse boundaries could be compared. We report here the development of an enhancer-blocking assay for studying insulator activity in Drosophila cultured cells. We show that the activities of diverse Drosophila insulators including suHw, SF1, SF1b, Fab7 and Fab8 are supported in these cells. We further show that double stranded RNA (dsRNA)-mediated knockdown of SuHw and dCTCF factors disrupts the enhancer-blocking function of suHw and Fab8, respectively, thereby establishing the effectiveness of using RNA interference in our cell-based assay for probing insulator function. The novel boundary assay provides a quantitative and efficient method for analyzing insulator mechanism and can be further exploited in genome-wide RNAi screens for insulator components. It provides a useful tool that complements the transgenic and genetic approaches for studying this important class of regulatory elements.

Title: Mod(mdg4) variants repress telomeric retrotransposon HeT-A by blocking subtelomeric enhancers

Abstract:
Telomeres in Drosophila are composed of sequential non-LTR retrotransposons HeT-A , TART and TAHRE . Although they are repressed by the PIWI-piRNA pathway or heterochromatin in the germline, the regulation of these retrotransposons in somatic cells is poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrated that specific splice variants of Mod(mdg4) repress HeT-A by blocking subtelomeric enhancers in ovarian somatic cells. Among the variants, we found that the Mod(mdg4)-N variant represses HeT-A expression the most efficiently. Subtelomeric sequences bound by Mod(mdg4)-N block enhancer activity within subtelomeric TAS-R repeats. This enhancer-blocking activity is increased by the tandem association of Mod(mdg4)-N to repetitive subtelomeric sequences. In addition, the association of Mod(mdg4)-N couples with the recruitment of RNA polymerase II to the subtelomeres, which reinforces its enhancer-blocking function. Our findings provide novel insights into how telomeric retrotransposons are regulated by the specific variants of insulator proteins associated with subtelomeric sequences.

Title: The 3′ Region of the Chicken Hypersensitive Site-4 Insulator Has Properties Similar to Its Core and Is Required for Full Insulator Activity
Authors: Paritha I. Arumugam, Fabrizia Urbinati, Chinavenmeni S. Velu, Tomoyasu Higashimoto, H. Leighton Grimes, Punam Malik

Abstract:
Chromatin insulators separate active transcriptional domains and block the spread of heterochromatin in the genome. Studies on the chicken hypersensitive site-4 (cHS4) element, a prototypic insulator, have identified CTCF and USF-1/2 motifs in the proximal 250 bp of cHS4, termed the “core”, which provide enhancer blocking activity and reduce position effects. However, the core alone does not insulate viral vectors effectively. The full-length cHS4 has excellent insulating properties, but its large size severely compromises vector titers. We performed a structure-function analysis of cHS4 flanking lentivirus-vectors and analyzed transgene expression in the clonal progeny of hematopoietic stem cells and epigenetic changes in cHS4 and the transgene promoter. We found that the core only reduced the clonal variegation in expression. Unique insulator activity resided in the distal 400 bp cHS4 sequences, which when combined with the core, restored full insulator activity and open chromatin marks over the transgene promoter and the insulator. These data consolidate the known insulating activity of the canonical 5′ core with a novel 3′ 400 bp element with properties similar to the core. Together, they have excellent insulating properties and viral titers. Our data have important implications in understanding the molecular basis of insulator function and design of gene therapy vectors.

Title: Selective interactions between diverse STEs organize the ANT-C Hox cluster
Authors: Mo Li, Zhibo Ma, Sharmila Roy, Sapna K. Patel, Derrick C. Lane, Carly R. Duffy, Haini N. Cai
Date: 2018-10-11

Abstract:
The three-dimensional organization of the eukaryotic genome is important for its structure and function. Recent studies indicate that hierarchies of chromatin loops underlie important aspects of both genomic organization and gene regulation. Looping between insulator or boundary elements interferes with enhancer-promoter communications and limits the spread active or repressive organized chromatin. We have used the SF1 insulator in the Drosophila Antennapedia homeotic gene complex (ANT-C) as a model to study the mechanism and regulation of chromatin looping events. We reported previously that SF1 tethers a transient chromatin loop in the early embryo that insulates the Hox gene Sex comb reduce from the neighbor non-Hox gene fushi tarazu for their independent regulation. To further probe the functional range and connectivity of SF1, we used high-resolution chromosomal conformation capture (3C) to search for SF1 looping partners across ANT-C. We report here the identification of three distal SF1 Tether Elements (STEs) located in the labial , Deformed and Antennapedia Hox gene regions, extending the range of SF1 looping network to the entire complex. These novel STEs are bound by four different combinations of insulator proteins and exhibit distinct behaviors in enhancer block, enhancer-bypass and boundary functions. Significantly, the six STEs we identified so far map to all but one of the major boundaries between repressive and active histone domains, underlining the functional relevance of these long-range chromatin loops in organizing the Hox complex. Importantly, SF1 selectively captured with only 5 STEs out of ~20 sites that display similar insulator binding profiles, indicating that presence of insulator proteins alone is not sufficient to determine looping events. These findings suggest that selective interaction among diverse STE insulators organize the Drosophila Hox genes in the 3D nuclear space.

Title: The homie insulator has sub-elements with different insulating and long-range pairing properties
Authors: Miki Fujioka, Wenfan Ke, Paul Schedl, James B Jaynes
Date: 2025-01-26

Abstract:
Chromatin insulators are major determinants of chromosome architecture. Specific architectures induced by insulators profoundly influence nuclear processes, including how enhancers and promoters interact over long distances and between homologous chromosomes. Insulators can pair with copies of themselves in trans to facilitate homolog pairing. They can also pair with other insulators, sometimes with great specificity, inducing long-range chromosomal loops. Contrary to their canonical function of enhancer blocking, these loops can bring distant enhancers and promoters together to activate gene expression, while at the same time blocking other interactions in cis . The details of these effects depend on the choice of pairing partner, and on the orientation specificity of pairing, implicating the 3-dimensional architecture as a major functional determinant. Here we dissect the homie insulator from the Drosophila even skipped ( eve ) locus, to understand its substructure. We test pairing function based on homie -carrying transgenes interacting with endogenous eve . The assay is sensitive to both pairing strength and orientation. Using this assay, we found that a Su(Hw) binding site in homie is required for efficient long-range interaction, although some activity remains without it. This binding site also contributes to the canonical insulator activities of enhancer blocking and barrier function. Based on this and other results from our functional dissection, each of the canonical insulator activities, chromosomal loop formation, enhancer blocking, and barrier activity, are partially separable. Our results show the complexity inherent in insulator functions, which can be provided by an array of different proteins with both shared and distinct properties.

Title: Yeast heterochromatin stably silences only weak regulatory elements by altering burst duration
Authors: Kenneth Wu, Namrita Dhillon, Antone Bajor, Sara Abrahamsson, Rohinton T. Kamakaka
Date: 2024-04-23

Abstract:
Transcriptional silencing in Saccharomyces cerevisiae involves the generation of a chromatin state that stably represses transcription. Using multiple reporter assays, a diverse set of upstream activating sequence enhancers and core promoters were investigated for their susceptibility to silencing. We show that heterochromatin stably silences only weak and stress-induced regulatory elements but is unable to stably repress housekeeping gene regulatory elements, and the partial repression of these elements did not result in bistable expression states. Permutation analysis of enhancers and promoters indicates that both elements are targets of repression. Chromatin remodelers help specific regulatory elements to resist repression, most probably by altering nucleosome mobility and changing transcription burst duration. The strong enhancers/promoters can be repressed if silencer-bound Sir1 is increased. Together, our data suggest that the heterochromatic locus has been optimized to stably silence the weak mating-type gene regulatory elements but not strong housekeeping gene regulatory sequences.

Title: How subtle changes in 3D structure can create large changes in transcription
Authors: Jordan Yupeng Xiao, Antonina Hafner, Alistair N Boettiger
Date: 2021-07-09

Abstract:
Animal genomes are organized into topologically associated domains (TADs). TADs are thought to contribute to gene regulation by facilitating enhancer-promoter (E-P) contacts within a TAD and preventing these contacts across TAD borders. However, the absolute difference in contact frequency across TAD boundaries is usually less than 2-fold, even though disruptions of TAD borders can change gene expression by 10-fold. Existing models fail to explain this hypersensitive response. Here, we propose a futile cycle model of enhancer-mediated regulation that can exhibit hypersensitivity through bistability and hysteresis. Consistent with recent experiments, this regulation does not exhibit strong correlation between E-P contact and promoter activity, even though regulation occurs through contact. Through mathematical analysis and stochastic simulation, we show that this system can create an illusion of E-P biochemical specificity and explain the importance of weak TAD boundaries. It also offers a mechanism to reconcile apparently contradictory results from recent global TAD disruption with local TAD boundary deletion experiments. Together, these analyses advance our understanding of cis-regulatory contacts in controlling gene expression and suggest new experimental directions.

Abstract:
In cellular genomes, CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) insulators impact transcription over small distances in a one-dimensional manner and over much longer distances in a three-dimensional manner by maintaining chromatin loops. We have previously shown that the latent HSV-1 genome contains CTCF insulators that function to regulate lytic transcription of adjacent genes in a one-dimensional manner. Here, we test the hypothesis that HSV-1 CTCF insulators nucleate chromatin loops to regulate the expression of distance-separated gene regions through three-dimensional organization of viral genomes. We used 4C-seq methods to identify multiple long-range cis interactions in HSV-1 genomes that generate viral chromatin domains, including those nucleated by the viral CTCF insulator CTRL2. Deletion of the CTRL2 insulator disrupted these viral chromatin domains. Loop-nucleating interactions were quantitated with a novel approach (UMI-4C-seq) that utilizes unique molecular identifiers to label and count chromatin interactions associated with specific viewpoint primers. Cis -interaction peaks across four different viewpoints were quantified. Viral genomes lacking CTRL2 displayed more cis -interaction peaks and wider ranges of interaction lengths compared to wt virus, suggesting altered chromatin organization. Furthermore, differential looping analysis showed that viral genomes lacking CTRL2 displayed a more transcriptionally permissive chromatin environment. Thus, the CTRL2 insulator functions as a critical regulator of long-range chromatin interactions, and its deletion reshapes the viral chromatin landscape, leading to a more accessible and dynamic regulatory environment that may influence HSV-1 transcriptional programs and latency-associated chromatin states. HSV-1 is a significant lifelong human pathogen that infects 70% of adults worldwide. The latent HSV-1 genome is chromatinized and maintained in distinct chromatin structures that silence the virus, while reactivation is facilitated by transient reversal of host factors that maintain those chromatin domains. Understanding how this happens is critical for the development of novel therapeutics. It is becoming clear that CTCF insulators play a key role in the reversal that leads to reactivation. CTCF insulators are essential regulators of chromatin structure and gene expression in mammalian cells and play vital regulatory roles in transcriptional control of DNA viruses by organizing chromatin architecture during both latent and lytic stages of virus lifecycles. Here, we present the first report that latent HSV-1 genomes are organized into 3D structures to support latency yet allow the viral genome to reactivate, opening the door for future therapeutic targets.

Abstract:
Insulators are cis -regulatory elements that separate transcriptional units, whereas silencers are elements that repress transcription regardless of their position. In plants, these elements remain largely uncharacterized. Here, we use the massively parallel reporter assay Plant STARR-seq with short fragments of 8 large insulators to identify more than 100 fragments that block enhancer activity. The short fragments can be combined to generate more powerful insulators that abolish the capacity of the strong viral 35S enhancer to activate the 35S minimal promoter. Unexpectedly, when tested upstream of weak enhancers, these fragments act as silencers and repress transcription. Thus, these elements are capable of insulating or repressing transcription, depending on the regulatory context. We validate our findings in stable transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana , maize ( Zea mays ), and rice ( Oryza sativa ) plants. The short elements identified here should be useful building blocks for plant biotechnology.

Title: Enhancers in Plant Development, Adaptation and Evolution
Authors: Bliss M Beernink, John P Vogel, Li Lei
Date: 2025-04

Abstract:
Understanding plant responses to developmental and environmental cues is crucial for studying morphological divergence and local adaptation. Gene expression changes, governed by cis -regulatory modules (CRMs) including enhancers, are a major source of plant phenotypic variation. However, while genome-wide approaches have revealed thousands of putative enhancers in mammals, far fewer have been identified and functionally characterized in plants. This review provides an overview of how enhancers function to control gene regulation, methods to predict DNA sequences that may have enhancer activity, methods utilized to functionally validate enhancers and the current knowledge of enhancers in plants, including how they impact plant development, response to environment and evolutionary adaptation.

Title: Repressor element-1 silencing transcription factor/neuronal restrictive silencer factor (REST/NRSF) can regulate HSV-1 immediate-early transcription via histone modification
Authors: Rajeswara C Pinnoji, Gautam R Bedadala, Beena George, Thomas C Holland, James M Hill, Shao-chung V Hsia

Abstract:
During primary infection of its human host, Herpes Simplex Virus Type-1 (HSV-1) establishes latency in neurons where the viral genome is maintained in a circular form associated with nucleosomes in a chromatin configration. During latency, most viral genes are silenced, although the molecular mechanisms responsible for this are unclear. We hypothesized that neuronal factors repress HSV-1 gene expression during latency. A search of the HSV-1 DNA sequence for potential regulatory elements identified a Repressor Element-1/Neuronal Restrictive Silencer Element (RE-1/NRSE) located between HSV-1 genes ICP22 and ICP4. We predicted that the Repressor Element Silencing Transcription Factor/Neuronal Restrictive Silencer Factor (REST/NRSF) regulates expression of ICP22 and ICP4. Transient cotransfection indicated that REST/NRSF inhibited the activity of both promoters. In contrast, cotransfection of a mutant form of REST/NRSF encoding only the DNA-binding domain of the protein resulted in less inhibition. Stably transformed cell lines containing episomal reporter plasmids with a chromatin structure showed that REST/NRSF specifically inhibited the ICP4 promoter, but not the ICP22 promoter. REST/NRSF inhibition of the ICP4 promoter was reversed by histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor Trichostatin A (TSA). Additionally, chromatin immuno-precipitation (ChIP) assays indicated that the corepressor CoREST was recruited to the proximity of ICP4 promoter and that acetylation of histone H4 was reduced in the presence of REST/NRSF. Since the ICP4 protein is a key transactivator of HSV-1 lytic cycle genes, these results suggest that REST/NRSF may have an important role in the establishment and/or maintenance of HSV-1 gene silencing during latency by targeting ICP4 expression.

Date: 2020

Abstract:
The mechanisms underlying long-range interactions between chromatin regions and
the principles of chromosomal architecture formation are currently under
extensive scrutiny. A special class of regulatory elements known as insulators
is believed to be involved in the regulation of specific long-range
interactions between enhancers and promoters. This review focuses on the
insulators of Drosophila and mammals, and it also briefly
characterizes the proteins responsible for their functional activity. It was
initially believed that the main properties of insulators are blocking of
enhancers and the formation of independent transcription domains. We present
experimental data proving that the chromatin loops formed by insulators play
only an auxiliary role in enhancer blocking. The review also discusses the
mechanisms involved in the formation of topologically associating domains and
their role in the formation of the chromosomal architecture and regulation of
gene transcription.

Authors: Kenneth Wu, Namrita Dhillon, Antone Bajor, Sara Abrahamson, Rohinton T. Kamakaka
Date: 2023-10-05

Abstract:
The interplay between nucleosomes and transcription factors leads to programs of gene expression. Transcriptional silencing involves the generation of a chromatin state that represses transcription and is faithfully propagated through DNA replication and cell division. Using multiple reporter assays, including directly visualizing transcription in single cells, we investigated a diverse set of UAS enhancers and core promoters for their susceptibility to heterochromatic gene silencing. These results show that heterochromatin only stably silences weak and stress induced regulatory elements but is unable to stably repress housekeeping gene regulatory elements and the partial repression did not result in bistable expression states. Permutation analysis of different UAS enhancers and core promoters indicate that both elements function together to determine the susceptibility of regulatory sequences to repression. Specific histone modifiers and chromatin remodellers function in an enhancer specific manner to aid these elements to resist repression suggesting that Sir proteins likely function in part by reducing nucleosome mobility. We also show that the strong housekeeping regulatory elements can be repressed if silencer bound Sir1 is increased, suggesting that Sir1 is a limiting component in silencing. Together, our data suggest that the heterochromatic locus has been optimized to stably silence the weak mating type gene regulatory elements but not strong housekeeping gene regulatory sequences which could help explain why these genes are often found at the boundaries of silenced domains.

Title: Non-Coding Variants in Cancer: Mechanistic Insights and Clinical Potential for Personalized Medicine

Date: 2021-08-02

Abstract:
The cancer genome is characterized by extensive variability, in the form of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) or structural variations such as Copy Number Alterations (CNAs) across wider genomic areas. At the molecular level, most SNPs and/or CNAs reside in non-coding sequences, ultimately affecting the regulation of oncogenes and/or tumor-suppressors in a cancer-specific manner. Notably, inherited non-coding variants can predispose for cancer decades prior to disease onset. Furthermore, accumulation of additional non-coding driver mutations during progression of the disease, gives rise to genomic instability, acting as the driving force of neoplastic development and malignant evolution. Therefore, detection and characterization of such mutations can improve risk assessment for healthy carriers and expand the diagnostic and therapeutic toolbox for the patient. This review focuses on functional variants that reside in transcribed or not transcribed non-coding regions of the cancer genome and presents a collection of appropriate state-of-the-art methodologies to study them.

Title:  Evx2 - Hoxd13 Intergenic Region Restricts Enhancer Association to Hoxd13 Promoter
Authors: Takumi Yamagishi, Michiru Ozawa, Chiho Ohtsuka, Ritsuko Ohyama-Goto, Takashi Kondo
Date: 2007

Abstract:
Expression of Hox genes is tightly regulated in spatial and temporal domains. Evx2 is located next to Hoxd13 within 8 kb on the opposite DNA strand. Early in development, the pattern of Hoxd13 expression resembles that of Evx2 in limb and genital buds. After 10 dpc, however, Evx2 begins to be expressed in CNS as well. We analyzed the region responsible for these differences using ES cell techniques, and found that the intergenic region between Evx2 and Hoxd13 behaves as a boundary element that functions differentially in space and time, specifically in the development of limbs, genital bud, and brain. This boundary element comprises a large sequence spanning several kilobases that can be divided into at least two units: a constitutive boundary element, which blocks transcription regulatory influences from the chromosomal environment, and a regulatory element, which controls the function of the constitutive boundary element in time and space.

Date: 2006

Abstract:
Germ-line transformation of insects is now a widely used method for analyzing gene function and for the development of genetically modified strains suitable for pest control programs. The most widely used transposable element for the germ-line transformation of insects is piggyBac . The site of integration of the transgene can influence gene expression due to the effects of nearby transcription enhancers or silent heterochromatic regions. Position effects can be minimized by flanking a transgene with insulator elements. The scs/scs' and gypsy insulators from Drosophila melanogaster as well as the chicken β- globin HS4 insulator function in both Drosophila and mammalian cells. To minimize position effects we have created a set of piggyBac transformation vectors that contain either the scs/scs', gypsy or chicken β- globin HS4 insulators. The vectors contain either fluorescent protein or eye color marker genes and have been successfully used for germ-line transformation of Drosophila melanogaster . A set of the scs/scs' vectors contains the coral reef fluorescent protein marker genes AmCyan, ZsGreen and DsRed that have not been optimized for translation in human cells. These marker genes are controlled by a combined GMR-3xP3 enhancer/promoter that gives particularly strong expression in the eyes. This is also the first report of the use of the ZsGreen and AmCyan reef fluorescent proteins as transformation markers in insects. The insulated piggyBac vectors should protect transgenes against position effects and thus facilitate fine control of gene expression in a wide spectrum of insect species. These vectors may also be used for transgenesis in other invertebrate species.

Abstract:
Haspin, a highly conserved kinase in eukaryotes, has been shown to be responsible for phosphorylation of histone H3 at threonine 3 (H3T3ph) during mitosis, in mammals and yeast. Here we report that haspin is the kinase that phosphorylates H3T3 in Drosophila melanogaster and it is involved in sister chromatid cohesion during mitosis. Our data reveal that haspin also phosphorylates H3T3 in interphase. H3T3ph localizes in broad silenced domains at heterochromatin and lamin-enriched euchromatic regions. Loss of haspin compromises insulator activity in enhancer-blocking assays and triggers a decrease in nuclear size that is accompanied by changes in nuclear envelope morphology. We show that haspin is a suppressor of position-effect variegation involved in heterochromatin organization. Our results also demonstrate that haspin is necessary for pairing-sensitive silencing and it is required for robust Polycomb-dependent homeotic gene silencing. Haspin associates with the cohesin complex in interphase, mediates Pds5 binding to chromatin and cooperates with Pds5-cohesin to modify Polycomb-dependent homeotic transformations. Therefore, this study uncovers an unanticipated role for haspin kinase in genome organization of interphase cells and demonstrates that haspin is required for homeotic gene regulation.

Abstract:
The SCL (TAL1) transcription factor is a critical regulator of haematopoiesis and its expression is tightly controlled by multiple cis -acting regulatory elements. To elaborate further the DNA elements which control its regulation, we used genomic tiling microarrays covering 256 kb of the human SCL locus to perform a concerted analysis of chromatin structure and binding of regulatory proteins in human haematopoietic cell lines. This approach allowed us to characterise further or redefine known human SCL regulatory elements and led to the identification of six novel elements with putative regulatory function both up and downstream of the SCL gene. They bind a number of haematopoietic transcription factors (GATA1, E2A LMO2, SCL, LDB1), CTCF or components of the transcriptional machinery and are associated with relevant histone modifications, accessible chromatin and low nucleosomal density. Functional characterisation shows that these novel elements are able to enhance or repress SCL promoter activity, have endogenous promoter function or enhancer-blocking insulator function. Our analysis opens up several areas for further investigation and adds new layers of complexity to our understanding of the regulation of SCL expression.

Abstract:
The SUMO pathway mainly functions to repress innate immunity in myeloid cells. Inactivating sumoylation triggers a strong, noncanonical, type I interferon (IFN1) response, amplified and coupled with inflammation upon stimulation. These findings transposed to pre-clinical models with the demonstration that sumoylation inhibitors activate antitumor immunity in an IFN1-dependent manner. Yet, how sumoylation represses immune signaling remains largely unknown. Here, we identified MORC3, a negative regulator of IFNB1 , as the top SUMO2/3 substrate in myeloid cells. We show that, in monocytes, SUMO functions to repress basal IFNB1 in cis through a single long tandem repeat regulated by MORC3 [MORC3-regulated element (MRE)] that concentrates multiple motifs for the myeloid-enriched PU.1 factor. Inhibiting sumoylation induces a 3D genome reorganization nucleated from the MRE, which acquires both insulator and PU.1-activated enhancer activities, together with loss of H3.3 and H3K9me3 repressive marks and recruitment of PU.1. Paradoxically, MORC3, that interacts with PU.1, is massively recruited, yet unable to repress the MRE. Finally, we show that both sumoylation and MORC3 ATPase cycle are critical for MORC3 repressive activity. Our study thus uncovers an unconventional mechanism in which sumoylation, in concert with MORC3, orchestrates a metastable H3.3/H3K9me3 heterochromatin state on a multi-PU.1 binding platform to prevent an uncontrolled myeloid-specific immune response.

Title: Essential roles of CTCF binding sites at TAD boundaries in modulating chromatin interactions and transcriptional regulation at the Ifng locus

Abstract:
Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) is a key cytokine essential for host defense and tumor surveillance, and its expression in T cells is tightly regulated by long-range enhancer–promoter interactions within the Ifng locus. These interactions are organized within topologically associating domains (TADs) and subdomains (intra-TADs), whose boundaries are defined by the architectural protein CTCF. However, the specific contribution of these boundaries to Ifng regulation and chromatin architecture remains incompletely understood. Here, we investigated how chromatin looping within the TAD affects Ifng expression by using chromosome conformation capture (3C) and RNA sequencing in CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing in mice. Deletion of a single CTCF binding site (CBS) at the TAD boundary markedly impaired Th1-mediated immune responses against Cryptococcus neoformans infection and B16 melanoma. This deletion disrupted enhancer–promoter contacts and diminished enhancer-driven activation of Ifng . In contrast, deletion of a CBS within an intra-TAD boundary had no detectable impact on Ifng transcription. Collectively, these findings highlight the essential role of boundary-associated CBS elements in shaping chromatin architecture that enables enhancer–promoter communication and proper transcriptional regulation of the Ifng locus.

Abstract:
Mechanisms of tissue-specific gene expression regulation via 3D genome organization are poorly understood. Here we uncover the regulatory chromatin network of developing T cells and identify SATB1, a tissue-specific genome organizer, enriched at the anchors of promoter-enhancer loops. We have generated a T-cell specific Satb1 conditional knockout mouse which allows us to infer the molecular mechanisms responsible for the deregulation of its immune system. H3K27ac HiChIP and Hi-C experiments indicate that SATB1-dependent promoter-enhancer loops regulate expression of master regulator genes (such as Bcl6 ), the T cell receptor locus and adhesion molecule genes, collectively being critical for cell lineage specification and immune system homeostasis. SATB1-dependent regulatory chromatin loops represent a more refined layer of genome organization built upon a high-order scaffold provided by CTCF and other factors. Overall, our findings unravel the function of a tissue-specific factor that controls transcription programs, via spatial chromatin arrangements complementary to the chromatin structure imposed by ubiquitously expressed genome organizers.

Title: Kinetics and Epigenetics of Retroviral Silencing in Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells Defined by Deletion of the D4Z4 Element
Authors: Sylvie Rival-Gervier, Mandy YM Lo, Shahryar Khattak, Peter Pasceri, Matthew C Lorincz, James Ellis
Date: 2013-08

Abstract:
Retroviral vectors are silenced in embryonic stem (ES) cells by epigenetic mechanisms whose kinetics are poorly understood. We show here that a 3′D4Z4 insulator directs retroviral expression with persistent but variable expression for up to 5 months. Combining an internal 3′D4Z4 with HS4 insulators in the long terminal repeats (LTRs) shows that these elements cooperate, and defines the first retroviral vector that fully escapes long-term silencing. Using FLP recombinase to induce deletion of 3′D4Z4 from the provirus in ES cell clones, we established retroviral silencing at many but not all integration sites. This finding shows that 3′D4Z4 does not target retrovirus integration into favorable epigenomic domains but rather protects the transgene from silencing. Chromatin analyses demonstrate that 3′D4Z4 blocks the spread of heterochromatin marks including DNA methylation and repressive histone modifications such as H3K9 methylation. In addition, our deletion system reveals three distinct kinetic classes of silencing (rapid, gradual or not silenced), in which multiple epigenetic pathways participate in silencing at different integration sites. We conclude that vectors with both 3′D4Z4 and HS4 insulator elements fully block silencing, and may have unprecedented utility for gene transfer applications that require long-term gene expression in pluripotent stem (PS) cells.

Title: Factors and Mechanisms That Influence Chromatin-Mediated Enhancer–Promoter Interactions and Transcriptional Regulation
Authors: Shinsuke Ito, Nando Dulal Das, Takashi Umehara, Haruhiko Koseki
Date: 2022-11-02

Abstract:
The physical interactions between enhancers and promoters create chromatin conformations involved in gene regulation. In cancer cells, the chromatin conformations can be altered with uncontrolled deposition of histone marks resulting in varied gene expression. Although it is not entirely comprehensive how chromatin-mediated enhancer–promoter (E–P) interactions with various histone marks can affect gene expression, this proximity has been observed in multiple systems at multiple loci and is thought to be essential to control gene expression. In this review, we focus on emerging views of chromatin conformations associated with the E–P interactions and factors that establish or maintain such interactions, which may regulate gene expression. Eukaryotic gene expression is regulated through chromatin conformation, in which enhancers and promoters physically interact (E–P interactions). How such chromatin-mediated E–P interactions affect gene expression is not yet fully understood, but the roles of histone acetylation and methylation, pioneer transcription factors, and architectural proteins such as CCCTC binding factor (CTCF) and cohesin have recently attracted attention. Moreover, accumulated data suggest that E–P interactions are mechanistically involved in biophysical events, including liquid–liquid phase separation, and in biological events, including cancers. In this review, we discuss various mechanisms that regulate eukaryotic gene expression, focusing on emerging views regarding chromatin conformations that are involved in E–P interactions and factors that establish and maintain them.

Title: The MADF-BESS Protein CP60 Is Recruited to Insulators via CP190 and Has Redundant Functions in Drosophila
Authors: Larisa Melnikova, Varvara Molodina, Valentin Babosha, Margarita Kostyuchenko, Pavel Georgiev, Anton Golovnin
Date: 2023-10-09

Abstract:
Drosophila CP190 and CP60 are transcription factors that are associated with centrosomes during mitosis. CP190 is an essential transcription factor and preferentially binds to housekeeping gene promoters and insulators through interactions with architectural proteins, including Su(Hw) and dCTCF. CP60 belongs to a family of transcription factors that contain the N-terminal MADF domain and the C-terminal BESS domain, which is characterized by the ability to homodimerize. In this study, we show that the conserved CP60 region adjacent to MADF is responsible for interacting with CP190. In contrast to the well-characterized MADF-BESS transcriptional activator Adf-1, CP60 is recruited to most chromatin sites through its interaction with CP190, and the MADF domain is likely involved in protein–protein interactions but not in DNA binding. The deletion of the Map60 gene showed that CP60 is not an essential protein, despite the strong and ubiquitous expression of CP60 at all stages of Drosophila development. Although CP60 is a stable component of the Su(Hw) insulator complex, the inactivation of CP60 does not affect the enhancer-blocking activity of the Su(Hw)-dependent gypsy insulator. Overall, our results indicate that CP60 has an important but redundant function in transcriptional regulation as a partner of the CP190 protein.

Title: Telomere Position Effect‐Over Long Distances Acts as a Genome‐Wide Epigenetic Regulator Through a Common Alu Element
Authors: Raphaël Chevalier, Victor Murcia Pienkowski, Nicolas Jullien, Leslie Caron, Pascal Verdier Pinard, Frédérique Magdinier, Jérôme D. Robin
Date: 2025-03-10

Abstract:
Among epigenetic modifiers, telomeres represent attractive modulators of the genome in part through position effects. Telomere Position Effect‐Over Long Distances (TPE‐OLD) modulates gene expression by changes in telomere‐dependent long‐distance loops. To gain insights into the molecular mechanisms of TPE‐OLD, we performed a genome‐wide transcriptome and methylome analysis in proliferative fibroblasts and myoblasts or differentiated myotubes with controlled telomere lengths. By integrating omics data, we identified a common TPE‐OLD dependent cis ‐acting motif that behaves as an insulator or enhancer. Next, we uncovered trans partners that regulate these activities and observed the consistent depletion of one candidate factor, RBPJ, at TPE‐OLD associated loci upon telomere shortening. Importantly, we confirmed our findings by unbiased comparisons to recent Human transcriptomic studies, including those from the Genotype‐Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. We concluded that TPE‐OLD acts at the genome‐wide level and can be relayed by RBPJ bridging Alu‐like elements to telomeres. In response to physiological (i.e., aging) or pathological cues, TPE‐OLD might coordinate the genome‐wide impact of telomeres through recently evolved Alu elements acting as enhancers in association with RBPJ.

Title: Development of a New Model System to Study Long-Distance Interactions Supported by Architectural Proteins
Authors: Larisa Melnikova, Varvara Molodina, Pavel Georgiev, Anton Golovnin
Date: 2024-04-23

Abstract:
Chromatin architecture is critical for the temporal and tissue-specific activation of genes that determine eukaryotic development. The functional interaction between enhancers and promoters is controlled by insulators and tethering elements that support specific long-distance interactions. However, the mechanisms of the formation and maintenance of long-range interactions between genome regulatory elements remain poorly understood, primarily due to the lack of convenient model systems. Drosophila became the first model organism in which architectural proteins that determine the activity of insulators were described. In Drosophila , one of the best-studied DNA-binding architectural proteins, Su(Hw), forms a complex with Mod(mdg4)-67.2 and CP190 proteins. Using a combination of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing and attP -dependent integration technologies, we created a model system in which the promoters and enhancers of two reporter genes are separated by 28 kb. In this case, enhancers effectively stimulate reporter gene promoters in cis and trans only in the presence of artificial Su(Hw) binding sites (SBS), in both constructs. The expression of the mutant Su(Hw) protein, which cannot interact with CP190, and the mutation inactivating Mod(mdg4)-67.2, lead to the complete loss or significant weakening of enhancer–promoter interactions, respectively. The results indicate that the new model system effectively identifies the role of individual subunits of architectural protein complexes in forming and maintaining specific long-distance interactions in the D. melanogaster model.

Title: Measuring the buffering capacity of gene silencing in Saccharomyces cerevisiae

Date: 2021-12-02

Abstract:
Gene silencing, once established, is stably maintained for several generations. Despite the high fidelity of the inheritance of the silent state, individual components of silenced chromatin are in constant flux. Models suggest that silent loci can tolerate fluctuations in Sir proteins and histone acetylation levels, but the level of tolerance is unknown. To understand the quantitative relationships between H4K16 acetylation, Sir proteins, and silencing, we developed assays to quantitatively alter a H4K16 acetylation mimic allele and Sir protein levels and measure the effects of these changes on silencing. Our data suggest that a two- to threefold change in levels of histone marks and specific Sir proteins affects the stability of the silent state of a large chromatin domain.

Title: Identification, Design, and Application of Noncoding Cis-Regulatory Elements
Authors: Lingna Xu, Yuwen Liu
Date: 2024-08-05

Abstract:
Cis-regulatory elements (CREs) play a pivotal role in orchestrating interactions with trans-regulatory factors such as transcription factors, RNA-binding proteins, and noncoding RNAs. These interactions are fundamental to the molecular architecture underpinning complex and diverse biological functions in living organisms, facilitating a myriad of sophisticated and dynamic processes. The rapid advancement in the identification and characterization of these regulatory elements has been marked by initiatives such as the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project, which represents a significant milestone in the field. Concurrently, the development of CRE detection technologies, exemplified by massively parallel reporter assays, has progressed at an impressive pace, providing powerful tools for CRE discovery. The exponential growth of multimodal functional genomic data has necessitated the application of advanced analytical methods. Deep learning algorithms, particularly large language models, have emerged as invaluable tools for deconstructing the intricate nucleotide sequences governing CRE function. These advancements facilitate precise predictions of CRE activity and enable the de novo design of CREs. A deeper understanding of CRE operational dynamics is crucial for harnessing their versatile regulatory properties. Such insights are instrumental in refining gene therapy techniques, enhancing the efficacy of selective breeding programs, pushing the boundaries of genetic innovation, and opening new possibilities in microbial synthetic biology.

Authors: Eimear E Holohan, Camilla Kwong, Boris Adryan, Marek Bartkuhn, Martin Herold, Rainer Renkawitz, Steven Russell, Robert White
Date: 2007-07

Abstract:
Insulator or enhancer-blocking elements are proposed to play an important role in the regulation of transcription by preventing inappropriate enhancer/promoter interaction. The zinc-finger protein CTCF is well studied in vertebrates as an enhancer blocking factor, but Drosophila CTCF has only been characterised recently. To date only one endogenous binding location for CTCF has been identified in the Drosophila genome, the Fab-8 insulator in the Abdominal-B locus in the Bithorax complex (BX-C). We carried out chromatin immunopurification coupled with genomic microarray analysis to identify CTCF binding sites within representative regions of the Drosophila genome, including the 3-Mb Adh region, the BX-C, and the Antennapedia complex. Location of in vivo CTCF binding within these regions enabled us to construct a robust CTCF binding-site consensus sequence. CTCF binding sites identified in the BX-C map precisely to the known insulator elements Mcp, Fab-6, and Fab-8. Other CTCF binding sites correlate with boundaries of regulatory domains allowing us to locate three additional presumptive insulator elements; “Fab-2,” “Fab-3,” and “Fab-4.” With the exception of Fab-7, our data indicate that CTCF is directly associated with all known or predicted insulators in the BX-C, suggesting that the functioning of these insulators involves a common CTCF-dependent mechanism. Comparison of the locations of the CTCF sites with characterised Polycomb target sites and histone modification provides support for the domain model of BX-C regulation.

Title: The Interplay Between Chromatin Architecture and Lineage-Specific Transcription Factors and the Regulation of Rag Gene Expression
Authors: Kazuko Miyazaki, Masaki Miyazaki
Date: 2021-03-16

Abstract:
Cell type-specific gene expression is driven through the interplay between lineage-specific transcription factors (TFs) and the chromatin architecture, such as topologically associating domains (TADs), and enhancer-promoter interactions. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms of the cell fate decisions and cell type-specific functions, it is important to understand the interplay between chromatin architectures and TFs. Among enhancers, super-enhancers (SEs) play key roles in establishing cell identity. Adaptive immunity depends on the RAG-mediated assembly of antigen recognition receptors. Hence, regulation of the Rag1 and Rag2 ( Rag1/2 ) genes is a hallmark of adaptive lymphoid lineage commitment. Here, we review the current knowledge of 3D genome organization, SE formation, and Rag1/2 gene regulation during B cell and T cell differentiation.

Date: 2021-01-07

Abstract:
Alveolar macrophages function in innate and adaptive immunity, wound healing, and homeostasis in the lungs dependent on tissue-specific gene expression under epigenetic regulation. The functional diversity of tissue resident macrophages, despite their common myeloid lineage, highlights the need to study tissue-specific regulatory elements that control gene expression. Increasing evidence supports the hypothesis that subtle genetic changes alter sheep macrophage response to important production pathogens and zoonoses, for example, viruses like small ruminant lentiviruses and bacteria like Coxiella burnetii . Annotation of transcriptional regulatory elements will aid researchers in identifying genetic mutations of immunological consequence. Here we report the first genome-wide survey of regulatory elements in any sheep immune cell, utilizing alveolar macrophages. We assayed histone modifications and CTCF enrichment by chromatin immunoprecipitation with deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) in two sheep to determine cis- regulatory DNA elements and chromatin domain boundaries that control immunity-related gene expression. Histone modifications included H3K4me3 (denoting active promoters), H3K27ac (active enhancers), H3K4me1 (primed and distal enhancers), and H3K27me3 (broad silencers). In total, we identified 248,674 reproducible regulatory elements, which allowed assignment of putative biological function in macrophages to 12% of the sheep genome. Data exceeded the FAANG and ENCODE standards of 20 million and 45 million useable fragments for narrow and broad marks, respectively. Active elements showed consensus with RNA-seq data and were predictive of gene expression in alveolar macrophages from the publicly available Sheep Gene Expression Atlas. Silencer elements were not enriched for expressed genes, but rather for repressed developmental genes. CTCF enrichment enabled identification of 11,000 chromatin domains with mean size of 258 kb. To our knowledge, this is the first report to use immunoprecipitated CTCF to determine putative topological domains in sheep immune cells. Furthermore, these data will empower phenotype-associated mutation discovery since most causal variants are within regulatory elements.

Title: Uncovering direct and indirect molecular determinants of chromatin loops using a computational integrative approach
Authors: Raphaël Mourad, Lang Li, Olivier Cuvier
Date: 2017-05

Abstract:
Chromosomal organization in 3D plays a central role in regulating cell-type specific transcriptional and DNA replication timing programs. Yet it remains unclear to what extent the resulting long-range contacts depend on specific molecular drivers. Here we propose a model that comprehensively assesses the influence on contacts of DNA-binding proteins, cis-regulatory elements and DNA consensus motifs. Using real data, we validate a large number of predictions for long-range contacts involving known architectural proteins and DNA motifs. Our model outperforms existing approaches including enrichment test, random forests and correlation, and it uncovers numerous novel long-range contacts in Drosophila and human. The model uncovers the orientation-dependent specificity for long-range contacts between CTCF motifs in Drosophila , highlighting its conserved property in 3D organization of metazoan genomes. Our model further unravels long-range contacts depending on co-factors recruited to DNA indirectly, as illustrated by the influence of cohesin in stabilizing long-range contacts between CTCF sites. It also reveals asymmetric contacts such as enhancer-promoter contacts that highlight opposite influences of the transcription factors EBF1, EGR1 or MEF2C depending on RNA Polymerase II pausing.

Title: Loss of the insulator protein CTCF during nematode evolution
Authors: Peter Heger, Birger Marin, Einhard Schierenberg
Date: 2009

Abstract:
The zinc finger (ZF) protein CTCF (CCCTC-binding factor) is highly conserved in Drosophila and vertebrates where it has been shown to mediate chromatin insulation at a genomewide level. A mode of genetic regulation that involves insulators and insulator binding proteins to establish independent transcriptional units is currently not known in nematodes including Caenorhabditis elegans . We therefore searched in nematodes for orthologs of proteins that are involved in chromatin insulation. While orthologs for other insulator proteins were absent in all 35 analysed nematode species, we find orthologs of CTCF in a subset of nematodes. As an example for these we cloned the Trichinella spiralis CTCF-like gene and revealed a genomic structure very similar to the Drosophila counterpart. To investigate the pattern of CTCF occurrence in nematodes, we performed phylogenetic analysis with the ZF protein sets of completely sequenced nematodes. We show that three ZF proteins from three basal nematodes cluster together with known CTCF proteins whereas no zinc finger protein of C. elegans and other derived nematodes does so. Our findings show that CTCF and possibly chromatin insulation are present in basal nematodes. We suggest that the insulator protein CTCF has been secondarily lost in derived nematodes like C. elegans . We propose a switch in the regulation of gene expression during nematode evolution, from the common vertebrate and insect type involving distantly acting regulatory elements and chromatin insulation to a so far poorly characterised mode present in more derived nematodes. Here, all or some of these components are missing. Instead operons, polycistronic transcriptional units common in derived nematodes, seemingly adopted their function.

Title: Enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) in Cancer: The Jacks of All Trades
Authors: Sara Napoli, Nicolas Munz, Francesca Guidetti, Francesco Bertoni
Date: 2022-04-14

Abstract:
This review focuses on eRNAs and the several mechanisms by which they can regulate gene expression. In particular we describe here the most recent examples of eRNAs dysregulated in cancer or involved in the immune escape of tumor cells. Enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) are non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) transcribed in enhancer regions. They play an important role in transcriptional regulation, mainly during cellular differentiation. eRNAs are tightly tissue- and cell-type specific and are induced by specific stimuli, activating promoters of target genes in turn. eRNAs usually have a very short half-life but in some cases, once activated, they can be stably expressed and acquire additional functions. Due to their critical role, eRNAs are often dysregulated in cancer and growing number of interactions with chromatin modifiers, transcription factors, and splicing machinery have been described. Enhancer activation and eRNA transcription have particular relevance also in inflammatory response, placing the eRNAs at the interplay between cancer and immune cells. Here, we summarize all the possible molecular mechanisms recently reported in association with eRNAs activity.

Abstract:
Understanding and predicting the relationships between genotype and phenotype is often challenging, largely due to the complex nature of eukaryotic gene regulation. A step towards this goal is to map how phenotypic diversity evolves through genomic changes that modify gene regulatory interactions. Using the Prairie Rattlesnake ( Crotalus viridis ) and related species, we integrate mRNA-seq, proteomic, ATAC-seq and whole-genome resequencing data to understand how specific evolutionary modifications to gene regulatory network components produce differences in venom gene expression. Through comparisons within and between species, we find a remarkably high degree of gene expression and regulatory network variation across even a shallow level of evolutionary divergence. We use these data to test hypotheses about the roles of specific trans-factors and cis-regulatory elements, how these roles may vary across venom genes and gene families, and how variation in regulatory systems drive diversity in venom phenotypes. Our results illustrate that differences in chromatin and genotype at regulatory elements play major roles in modulating expression. However, we also find that enhancer deletions, differences in transcription factor expression, and variation in activity of the insulator protein CTCF also likely impact venom phenotypes. Our findings provide insight into the diversity and gene-specificity of gene regulatory features and highlight the value of comparative studies to link gene regulatory network variation to phenotypic variation.

Date: 2023-05-11

Abstract:
Cis-regulatory elements (CRE) are critical for coordinating gene expression programs that dictate cell-specific differentiation and homeostasis. Recently developed self-transcribing active regulatory region sequencing (STARR-Seq) has allowed for genome-wide annotation of functional CREs. Despite this, STARR-Seq assays are only employed in cell lines, in part, due to difficulties in delivering reporter constructs. Herein, we implemented and validated a STARR-Seq–based screen in human CD4+ T cells using a non-integrating lentiviral transduction system. Lenti-STARR-Seq is the first example of a genome-wide assay of CRE function in human primary cells, identifying thousands of functional enhancers and negative regulatory elements (NREs) in human CD4+ T cells. We find an unexpected difference in nucleosome organization between enhancers and NRE: enhancers are located between nucleosomes, whereas NRE are occupied by nucleosomes in their endogenous locations. We also describe chromatin modification, eRNA production, and transcription factor binding at both enhancers and NREs. Our findings support the idea of silencer repurposing as enhancers in alternate cell types. Collectively, these data suggest that Lenti-STARR-Seq is a successful approach for CRE screening in primary human cell types, and provides an atlas of functional CREs in human CD4+ T cells.

Abstract:
Chromatin insulators shield promoters and chromatin domains from neighboring enhancers or chromatin regions with opposing activities. Insulator-binding proteins and their cofactors mediate the boundary function. In general, covalent modification of proteins by the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) is an important mechanism to control the interaction of proteins within complexes. Here we addressed the impact of dSUMO in respect of insulator function, chromatin binding of insulator factors and formation of insulator speckles in Drosophila . SUMOylation augments the enhancer blocking function of four different insulator sequences and increases the genome-wide binding of the insulator cofactor CP190. These results indicate that enhanced chromatin binding of SUMOylated CP190 causes fusion of insulator speckles, which may allow for more efficient insulation. The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13072-017-0140-6) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.

Date: 2024-03-04

Abstract:
Much of our current understanding of rare human diseases is driven by coding genetic variants. However, non-coding genetic variants play a pivotal role in numerous rare human diseases, resulting in diverse functional impacts ranging from altered gene regulation, splicing, and/or transcript stability. With the increasing use of genome sequencing in clinical practice, it is paramount to have a clear framework for understanding how non-coding genetic variants cause disease. To this end, we have synthesized the literature on hundreds of non-coding genetic variants that cause rare Mendelian conditions via the disruption of gene regulatory patterns and propose a functional classification system. Specifically, we have adapted the functional classification framework used for coding variants (i.e., loss-of-function, gain-of-function, and dominant-negative) to account for features unique to non-coding gene regulatory variants. We identify that non-coding gene regulatory variants can be split into three distinct categories by functional impact: (1) non-modular loss-of-expression (LOE) variants; (2) modular loss-of-expression (mLOE) variants; and (3) gain-of-ectopic-expression (GOE) variants. Whereas LOE variants have a direct corollary with coding loss-of-function variants, mLOE and GOE variants represent disease mechanisms that are largely unique to non-coding variants. These functional classifications aim to provide a unified terminology for categorizing the functional impact of non-coding variants that disrupt gene regulatory patterns in Mendelian conditions.

Title: VEZF1 Elements Mediate Protection from DNA Methylation
Authors: Jacqueline Dickson, Humaira Gowher, Ruslan Strogantsev, Miklos Gaszner, Alan Hair, Gary Felsenfeld, Adam G. West
Date: 2010-01

Abstract:
There is growing consensus that genome organization and long-range gene regulation involves partitioning of the genome into domains of distinct epigenetic chromatin states. Chromatin insulator or barrier elements are key components of these processes as they can establish boundaries between chromatin states. The ability of elements such as the paradigm β-globin HS4 insulator to block the range of enhancers or the spread of repressive histone modifications is well established. Here we have addressed the hypothesis that a barrier element in vertebrates should be capable of defending a gene from silencing by DNA methylation. Using an established stable reporter gene system, we find that HS4 acts specifically to protect a gene promoter from de novo DNA methylation. Notably, protection from methylation can occur in the absence of histone acetylation or transcription. There is a division of labor at HS4; the sequences that mediate protection from methylation are separable from those that mediate CTCF-dependent enhancer blocking and USF-dependent histone modification recruitment. The zinc finger protein VEZF1 was purified as the factor that specifically interacts with the methylation protection elements. VEZF1 is a candidate CpG island protection factor as the G-rich sequences bound by VEZF1 are frequently found at CpG island promoters. Indeed, we show that VEZF1 elements are sufficient to mediate demethylation and protection of the APRT CpG island promoter from DNA methylation. We propose that many barrier elements in vertebrates will prevent DNA methylation in addition to blocking the propagation of repressive histone modifications, as either process is sufficient to direct the establishment of an epigenetically stable silent chromatin state.

Title: Diverse transcription influences can be insulated by the Drosophila SF1 chromatin boundary
Authors: Parimal Majumder, Sharmila Roy, Vladimir E. Belozerov, Dimple Bosu, Meena Puppali, Haini N. Cai
Date: 2009-07

Abstract:
Chromatin boundaries regulate gene expression by modulating enhancer–promoter interactions and insulating transcriptional influences from organized chromatin. However, mechanistic distinctions between these two aspects of boundary function are not well understood. Here we show that SF1, a chromatin boundary located in the Drosophila Antennapedia complex (ANT-C), can insulate the transgenic miniwhite reporter from both enhancing and silencing effects of surrounding genome, a phenomenon known as chromosomal position effect or CPE. We found that the CPE-blocking activity associates with different SF1 sub-regions from a previously characterized insulator that blocks enhancers in transgenic embryos, and is independent of GAF-binding sites essential for the embryonic insulator activity. We further provide evidence that the CPE-blocking activity cannot be attributed to an enhancer-blocking activity in the developing eye. Our results suggest that SF1 contains multiple non-overlapping activities that block diverse transcriptional influences from embryonic or adult enhancers, and from positive and negative chromatin structure. Such diverse insulating capabilities are consistent with the proposed roles of SF1 to functionally separate fushi tarazu ( ftz ), a non-Hox gene, from the enhancers and the organized chromatin of the neighboring Hox genes.

Title: The Upstream Enhancer Is Necessary and Sufficient for the Expression of the Pre-T Cell Receptor α Gene in Immature T Lymphocytes
Authors: Boris Reizis, Philip Leder
Date: 2001-10-01

Abstract:
The expression of the pre-T cell receptor α ( pTa ) gene occurs exclusively in immature T lymphocytes and is regulated by poorly defined mechanisms. We have analyzed the role of the upstream enhancer in pTa expression using conventional and bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) reporter transgenes. The deletion of the enhancer completely abolished the expression of pTa BAC reporter in transgenic mice. Conversely, the combination of pTa enhancer and promoter targeted transgenes specifically to immature thymocytes, recapitulating the expression pattern of pTa . The core enhancer is conserved between mice and humans and contains a critical binding site for the transcription factor c-Myb. We also show that pTa promoter contains a conserved tandem E box site activated by E protein, HEB. These data establish the enhancer as a critical element regulating pTa gene expression and identify additional targets for c-Myb and E proteins in T cell development.

Title: Designing artificial synthetic promoters for accurate, smart, and versatile gene expression in plants
Authors: Erum Yasmeen, Jin Wang, Muhammad Riaz, Lida Zhang, Kaijing Zuo
Date: 2023-07-10

Abstract:
With the development of high-throughput biology techniques and artificial intelligence, it has become increasingly feasible to design and construct artificial biological parts, modules, circuits, and even whole systems. To overcome the limitations of native promoters in controlling gene expression, artificial promoter design aims to synthesize short, inducible, and conditionally controlled promoters to coordinate the expression of multiple genes in diverse plant metabolic and signaling pathways. Synthetic promoters are versatile and can drive gene expression accurately with smart responses; they show potential for enhancing desirable traits in crops, thereby improving crop yield, nutritional quality, and food security. This review first illustrates the importance of synthetic promoters, then introduces promoter architecture and thoroughly summarizes advances in synthetic promoter construction. Restrictions to the development of synthetic promoters and future applications of such promoters in synthetic plant biology and crop improvement are also discussed.

Authors: Oksana Maksimenko, Pavel Georgiev
Date: 2014-02-18

Abstract:
Due to advances in genome-wide technologies, consistent distant interactions within chromosomes of higher eukaryotes have been revealed. In particular, it has been shown that enhancers can specifically and directly interact with promoters by looping out intervening sequences, which can be up to several hundred kilobases long. This review is focused on transcription factors that are supposed to be involved in long-range interactions. Available data are in agreement with the model that several known transcription factors and insulator proteins belong to an abundant but poorly studied class of proteins that are responsible for chromosomal architecture.

Title: Core pluripotency factors promote glycolysis of human embryonic stem cells by activating GLUT1 enhancer
Authors: Lili Yu, Kai-yuan Ji, Jian Zhang, Yanxia Xu, Yue Ying, Taoyi Mai, Shuxiang Xu, Qian-bing Zhang, Kai-tai Yao, Yang Xu
Date: 2019-05-31

Abstract:
Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) depend on glycolysis for energy and substrates for biosynthesis. To understand the mechanisms governing the metabolism of hESCs, we investigated the transcriptional regulation of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1, SLC2A1), a key glycolytic gene to maintain pluripotency. By combining the genome-wide data of binding sites of the core pluripotency factors (SOX2, OCT4, NANOG, denoted SON), chromosomal interaction and histone modification in hESCs, we identified a potential enhancer of the GLUT1 gene in hESCs, denoted GLUT1 enhancer (GE) element. GE interacts with the promoter of GLUT1, and the deletion of GE significantly reduces the expression of GLUT1, glucose uptake and glycolysis of hESCs, confirming that GE is an enhancer of GLUT1 in hESCs. In addition, the mutation of SON binding motifs within GE reduced the expression of GLUT1 as well as the interaction between GE and GLUT1 promoter, indicating that the binding of SON to GE is important for its activity. Therefore, SON promotes glucose uptake and glycolysis in hESCs by inducing GLUT1 expression through directly activating the enhancer of GLUT1.

Title: Modular Insulators: Genome Wide Search for Composite CTCF/Thyroid Hormone Receptor Binding Sites
Authors: Oliver Weth, Christine Weth, Marek Bartkuhn, Joerg Leers, Florian Uhle, Rainer Renkawitz
Date: 2010

Abstract:
The conserved 11 zinc-finger protein CTCF is involved in several transcriptional mechanisms, including insulation and enhancer blocking. We had previously identified two composite elements consisting of a CTCF and a TR binding site at the chicken lysozyme and the human c-myc genes. Using these it has been demonstrated that thyroid hormone mediates the relief of enhancer blocking even though CTCF remains bound to its binding site. Here we wished to determine whether CTCF and TR combined sites are representative of a general feature of the genome, and whether such sites are functional in regulating enhancer blocking. Genome wide analysis revealed that about 18% of the CTCF regions harbored at least one of the four different palindromic or repeated sequence arrangements typical for the binding of TR homodimers or TR/RXR heterodimers. Functional analysis of 10 different composite elements of thyroid hormone responsive genes was performed using episomal constructs. The episomal system allowed recapitulating CTCF mediated enhancer blocking function to be dependent on poly (ADP)-ribose modification and to mediate histone deacetylation. Furthermore, thyroid hormone sensitive enhancer blocking could be shown for one of these new composite elements. Remarkably, not only did the regulation of enhancer blocking require functional TR binding, but also the basal enhancer blocking activity of CTCF was dependent on the binding of the unliganded TR. Thus, a number of composite CTCF/TR binding sites may represent a subset of other modular CTCF composite sites, such as groups of multiple CTCF sites or of CTCF/Oct4, CTCF/Kaiso or CTCF/Yy1 combinations.

Abstract:
Late blight resistance of potato was improved by the co‐expression of the potato resistance gene R3a and the pathogen‐inducible avirulence gene Avr3a of Phytopthora infestans . The synthetic pathogen‐inducible promoter 2xS‐4xD‐NpCABE core , which is composed of the cis ‐acting elements S and D and the core promoter of the NpCABE gene, was developed for potato. By analysis of 20 core promoters from Solanacea species synthetic promoters of the 2xS‐2xD‐type were generated which differ in their background activity, strength and promoter inducibility. These data showed that the core promoter plays an important role for the architecture of a synthetic promoter and influences the specificity and strength beside the cis ‐acting element. The 2xS‐2xD‐NpCABE core promoter was further improved by increasing the number of the cis ‐acting elements resulting in the 2xS‐4xD‐NpCABE core promoter. Modified Avr3a alleles, which triggered less cell death than the Avr3a  KI allele, were expressed with the optimized synthetic promoter in transgenic potatoes with an R3a gene. The transgenic lines showed less late blight symptoms and up to 60% reduction of sporangia in detached leaf assays. The absence of a negative plant phenotype in the greenhouse demonstrated that the balanced co‐expression of a modified Avr3a gene under the control of an optimized synthetic promoter is a promising strategy to increase late blight resistance of potatoes. This concept might be as well applied to other crops since the co‐expression of the R3a and Avr3a   KI  gene induced cell death in leaves of corn, wheat and soybean in a transient assay.

Title: RNA-Independent Regulatory Functions of lncRNA in Complex Disease
Authors: Michaela Kafida, Maria Karela, Antonis Giakountis
Date: 2024-07-31

Abstract:
Recent studies highlight the complexity of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) genetic loci in the pathogenesis of complex diseases, including carcinogenesis and cancer progression. These studies converge on the existence of RNA-independent functional layers that participate in the underlying regulatory mechanism of the corresponding lncRNAs. Such layers include downstream regulation through embedded DNA elements, nascent transcription of the lncRNA locus, or even their combined function. Consequently, it is insufficient to limit our investigation to the potential function of a lncRNA transcript if we want to fully uncover the regulatory role of its locus. During the metagenomics era, high-throughput sequencing efforts both in mice and humans indicate that non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) constitute a significant fraction of the transcribed genome. During the past decades, the regulatory role of these non-coding transcripts along with their interactions with other molecules have been extensively characterized. However, the study of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), an ncRNA regulatory class with transcript lengths that exceed 200 nucleotides, revealed that certain non-coding transcripts are transcriptional “by-products”, while their loci exert their downstream regulatory functions through RNA-independent mechanisms. Such mechanisms include, but are not limited to, chromatin interactions and complex promoter-enhancer competition schemes that involve the underlying ncRNA locus with or without its nascent transcription, mediating significant or even exclusive roles in the regulation of downstream target genes in mammals. Interestingly, such RNA-independent mechanisms often drive pathological manifestations, including oncogenesis. In this review, we summarize selective examples of lncRNAs that regulate target genes independently of their produced transcripts.

Abstract:
Understanding the contributions of transcription factor DNA binding sites to transcriptional enhancers is a significant challenge. We developed Quantitative enhancer-FACS-Seq for highly parallel quantification of enhancer activities from a genomically integrated reporter in Drosophila melanogaster embryos. We investigate the contributions of the DNA binding motifs of four poorly characterized TFs to the activities of twelve embryonic mesodermal enhancers. We measure quantitative changes in enhancer activity and discover a range of epistatic interactions among the motifs, both synergistic and alleviating. We find that understanding the regulatory consequences of TF binding motifs requires that they be investigated in combination across enhancer contexts.

Abstract:
The insights into how genome topology couples with epigenetic states to govern the function and identity of the corneal epithelium are poorly understood. Here, we generate a high-resolution Hi-C interaction map of human limbal stem/progenitor cells (LSCs) and show that chromatin multi-hierarchical organisation is coupled to gene expression. By integrating Hi-C, epigenome and transcriptome data, we characterize the comprehensive 3D epigenomic landscapes of LSCs. We find that super-silencers mediate gene repression associated with corneal development, differentiation and disease via chromatin looping and/or proximity. Super-enhancer (SE) interaction analysis identified a set of SE interactive hubs that contribute to LSC-specific gene activation. These active and inactive element-anchored loop networks occur within the cohesin-occupied CTCF-CTCF loops. We further reveal a coordinated regulatory network of core transcription factors based on SE-promoter interactions. Our results provide detailed insights into the genome organization principle for epigenetic regulation of gene expression in stratified epithelia.

Title: Two modes of transvection at the eyes absent gene of Drosophila demonstrate plasticity in transcriptional regulatory interactions in cis and in trans
Authors: Katherine Tian, Rachel E. Henderson, Reyna Parker, Alexia Brown, Justine E. Johnson, Jack R. Bateman
Date: 2019-05-10

Abstract:
For many genes, proper gene expression requires coordinated and dynamic interactions between multiple regulatory elements, each of which can either promote or silence transcription. In Drosophila , the complexity of the regulatory landscape is further complicated by the tight physical pairing of homologous chromosomes, which can permit regulatory elements to interact in trans , a phenomenon known as transvection. To better understand how gene expression can be programmed through cis- and trans- regulatory interactions, we analyzed transvection effects for a collection of alleles of the eyes absent ( eya ) gene. We find that trans -activation of a promoter by the eya eye-specific enhancers is broadly supported in many allelic backgrounds, and that the availability of an enhancer to act in trans can be predicted based on the molecular lesion of an eya allele. Furthermore, by manipulating promoter availability in cis and in trans , we demonstrate that the eye-specific enhancers of eya show plasticity in their promoter preference between two different transcriptional start sites, which depends on promoter competition between the two potential targets. Finally, we show that certain alleles of eya demonstrate pairing-sensitive silencing resulting from trans -interactions between Polycomb Response Elements (PREs), and genetic and genomic data support a general role for PcG proteins in mediating transcriptional silencing at eya . Overall, our data highlight how eya gene regulation relies upon a complex but plastic interplay between multiple enhancers, promoters, and PREs.

Title: Integrating convolution and self-attention improves language model of human genome for interpreting non-coding regions at base-resolution
Authors: Meng Yang, Lichao Huang, Haiping Huang, Hui Tang, Nan Zhang, Huanming Yang, Jihong Wu, Feng Mu
Date: 2022-08-12

Abstract:
Interpretation of non-coding genome remains an unsolved challenge in human genetics due to impracticality of exhaustively annotating biochemically active elements in all conditions. Deep learning based computational approaches emerge recently to help interpret non-coding regions. Here, we present LOGO ( L anguage o f G en o me), a self-attention based contextualized pre-trained language model containing only two self-attention layers with 1 million parameters as a substantially light architecture that applies self-supervision techniques to learn bidirectional representations of the unlabelled human reference genome. LOGO is then fine-tuned for sequence labelling task, and further extended to variant prioritization task via a special input encoding scheme of alternative alleles followed by adding a convolutional module. Experiments show that LOGO achieves 15% absolute improvement for promoter identification and up to 4.5% absolute improvement for enhancer-promoter interaction prediction. LOGO exhibits state-of-the-art multi-task predictive power on thousands of chromatin features with only 3% parameterization benchmarking against the fully supervised model, DeepSEA and 1% parameterization against a recent BERT-based DNA language model. For allelic-effect prediction, locality introduced by one dimensional convolution shows improved sensitivity and specificity for prioritizing non-coding variants associated with human diseases. In addition, we apply LOGO to interpret type 2 diabetes (T2D) GWAS signals and infer underlying regulatory mechanisms. We make a conceptual analogy between natural language and human genome and demonstrate LOGO is an accurate, fast, scalable, and robust framework to interpret non-coding regions for global sequence labeling as well as for variant prioritization at base-resolution.

Title: Whole-genome functional characterization of RE1 silencers using a modified massively parallel reporter assay
Authors: Kousuke Mouri, Hannah B. Dewey, Rodrigo Castro, Daniel Berenzy, Susan Kales, Ryan Tewhey
Date: 2023-01-11

Abstract:
Both upregulation and downregulation by cis -regulatory elements help modulate precise gene expression. However, our understanding of repressive elements is far more limited than activating elements. To address this gap, we characterized RE1, a group of transcriptional silencers bound by REST, at genome-wide scale using a modified massively parallel reporter assay (MPRAduo). MPRAduo empirically defined a minimal binding strength of REST (REST motif-intrinsic value [m-value]), above which cofactors colocalize and silence transcription. We identified 1,500 human variants that alter RE1 silencing and found that their effect sizes are predictable when they overlap with REST-binding sites above the m-value. Additionally, we demonstrate that non-canonical REST-binding motifs exhibit silencer function only if they precisely align half sites with specific spacer lengths. Our results show mechanistic insights into RE1, which allow us to predict its activity and effect of variants on RE1, providing a paradigm for performing genome-wide functional characterization of transcription-factor-binding sites.

Title: Functional and Molecular Characterization of the Role of CTCF in Human Embryonic Stem Cell Biology
Authors: Sri Kripa Balakrishnan, Michael Witcher, Travis W. Berggren, Beverly M. Emerson
Date: 2012

Abstract:
The CCCTC-binding factor CTCF is the only known vertebrate insulator protein and has been shown to regulate important developmental processes such as imprinting, X-chromosome inactivation and genomic architecture. In this study, we examined the role of CTCF in human embryonic stem cell (hESC) biology. We demonstrate that CTCF associates with several important pluripotency genes, including NANOG, SOX2 , cMYC and LIN28 and is critical for hESC proliferation. CTCF depletion impacts expression of pluripotency genes and accelerates loss of pluripotency upon BMP4 induced differentiation, but does not result in spontaneous differentiation. We find that CTCF associates with the distal ends and internal sites of the co-regulated 160 kb NANOG-DPPA3-GDF3 locus. Each of these sites can function as a CTCF-dependent enhancer-blocking insulator in heterologous assays. In hESCs, CTCF exists in multisubunit protein complexes and can be poly(ADP)ribosylated. Known CTCF cofactors, such as Cohesin, differentially co-localize in the vicinity of specific CTCF binding sites within the NANOG locus. Importantly, the association of some cofactors and protein PARlation selectively changes upon differentiation although CTCF binding remains constant. Understanding how unique cofactors may impart specialized functions to CTCF at specific genomic locations will further illuminate its role in stem cell biology.

Title: An efficient algorithm for improving structure-based prediction of transcription factor binding sites
Authors: Alvin Farrel, Jun-tao Guo
Date: 2017-07-17

Abstract:
Gene expression is regulated by transcription factors binding to specific target DNA sites. Understanding how and where transcription factors bind at genome scale represents an essential step toward our understanding of gene regulation networks. Previously we developed a structure-based method for prediction of transcription factor binding sites using an integrative energy function that combines a knowledge-based multibody potential and two atomic energy terms. While the method performs well, it is not computationally efficient due to the exponential increase in the number of binding sequences to be evaluated for longer binding sites. In this paper, we present an efficient pentamer algorithm by splitting DNA binding sequences into overlapping fragments along with a simplified integrative energy function for transcription factor binding site prediction. A DNA binding sequence is split into overlapping pentamers (5 base pairs) for calculating transcription factor-pentamer interaction energy. To combine the results from overlapping pentamer scores, we developed two methods, Kmer-Sum and PWM (Position Weight Matrix) stacking, for full-length binding motif prediction. Our results show that both Kmer-Sum and PWM stacking in the new pentamer approach along with a simplified integrative energy function improved transcription factor binding site prediction accuracy and dramatically reduced computation time, especially for longer binding sites. Our new fragment-based pentamer algorithm and simplified energy function improve both efficiency and accuracy. To our knowledge, this is the first fragment-based method for structure-based transcription factor binding sites prediction.

Title: DNA-binding properties of the MADS-domain transcription factor SEPALLATA3 and mutant variants characterized by SELEX-seq
Authors: Sandra Käppel, Ralf Eggeling, Florian Rümpler, Marco Groth, Rainer Melzer, Günter Theißen
Date: 2021-01-24

Abstract:
We studied the DNA-binding profile of the MADS-domain transcription factor SEPALLATA3 and mutant variants by SELEX-seq. DNA-binding characteristics of SEPALLATA3 mutant proteins lead us to propose a novel DNA-binding mode. MIKC-type MADS-domain proteins, which function as essential transcription factors in plant development, bind as dimers to a 10-base-pair AT-rich motif termed CArG-box. However, this consensus motif cannot fully explain how the abundant family members in flowering plants can bind different target genes in specific ways. The aim of this study was to better understand the DNA-binding specificity of MADS-domain transcription factors. Also, we wanted to understand the role of a highly conserved arginine residue for binding specificity of the MADS-domain transcription factor family. Here, we studied the DNA-binding profile of the floral homeotic MADS-domain protein SEPALLATA3 by performing SELEX followed by high-throughput sequencing (SELEX-seq). We found a diverse set of bound sequences and could estimate the in vitro binding affinities of SEPALLATA3 to a huge number of different sequences. We found evidence for the preference of AT-rich motifs as flanking sequences. Whereas different CArG-boxes can act as SEPALLATA3 binding sites, our findings suggest that the preferred flanking motifs are almost always the same and thus mostly independent of the identity of the central CArG-box motif. Analysis of SEPALLATA3 proteins with a single amino acid substitution at position 3 of the DNA-binding MADS-domain further revealed that the conserved arginine residue, which has been shown to be involved in a shape readout mechanism, is especially important for the recognition of nucleotides at positions 3 and 8 of the CArG-box motif. This leads us to propose a novel DNA-binding mode for SEPALLATA3, which is different from that of other MADS-domain proteins known.

Title: abc4pwm: affinity based clustering for position weight matrices in applications of DNA sequence analysis
Authors: Omer Ali, Amna Farooq, Mingyi Yang, Victor X. Jin, Magnar Bjørås, Junbai Wang
Date: 2022-03-03

Abstract:
Transcription factor (TF) binding motifs are identified by high throughput sequencing technologies as means to capture Protein-DNA interactions. These motifs are often represented by consensus sequences in form of position weight matrices (PWMs). With ever-increasing pool of TF binding motifs from multiple sources, redundancy issues are difficult to avoid, especially when every source maintains its own database for collection. One solution can be to cluster biologically relevant or similar PWMs, whether coming from experimental detection or in silico predictions. However, there is a lack of efficient tools to cluster PWMs. Assessing quality of PWM clusters is yet another challenge. Therefore, new methods and tools are required to efficiently cluster PWMs and assess quality of clusters. A new Python package Affinity Based Clustering for Position Weight Matrices (abc4pwm) was developed. It efficiently clustered PWMs from multiple sources with or without using DNA-Binding Domain (DBD) information, generated a representative motif for each cluster, evaluated the clustering quality automatically, and filtered out incorrectly clustered PWMs. Additionally, it was able to update human DBD family database automatically, classified known human TF PWMs to the respective DBD family, and performed TF motif searching and motif discovery by a new ensemble learning approach. This work demonstrates applications of abc4pwm in the DNA sequence analysis for various high throughput sequencing data using ~ 1770 human TF PWMs. It recovered known TF motifs at gene promoters based on gene expression profiles (RNA-seq) and identified true TF binding targets for motifs predicted from ChIP-seq experiments. Abc4pwm is a useful tool for TF motif searching, clustering, quality assessment and integration in multiple types of sequence data analysis including RNA-seq, ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq.

Abstract:
Transcription factors control gene expression during development and in response to a broad range of internal and external stimuli. They regulate promoter activity by directly binding cis -regulatory elements in DNA. The angiosperm Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ) contains more than 1,500 annotated transcription factors, each containing a DNA-binding domain that is used to define transcription factor families. Analyzing the binding motifs of 686 and the binding sites of 335 Arabidopsis transcription factors, as well as motifs of 92 transcription factors from other plants, we identified a constrained vocabulary of 74 conserved motifs spanning 50 families in plants. Among 21 transcription factor families, we found 1 core motif for all analyzed members and between 2% and 72% overlapping binding sites. Five families show conservation of the motif along phylogenetic clades. Five families, including the C2H2 zinc finger family, show high diversity among motifs in plants, suggesting potential for the neofunctionalization of duplicated transcription factors based on the motif recognized. We tested whether conserved motifs remained conserved since at least 450 million years ago by determining the binding motifs of 17 transcription factors from 11 families in Marchantia ( Marchantia polymorpha ) using amplified DNA affinity purification sequencing. We detected nearly identical binding motifs as predicted from the angiosperm data. Our findings show a large repertoire of overlapping binding sites within a transcription factor family and species and a high degree of binding motif conservation for at least 450 million years, indicating more potential for evolution in cis- rather than trans -regulatory elements.

Abstract:
Transcriptional enhancers are critical for development and phenotype evolution and are often mutated in disease contexts; however, even in well-studied cell types, the sequence code conferring enhancer activity remains unknown. To examine the enhancer regulatory code for pluripotent stem cells, we identified genomic regions with conserved binding of multiple transcription factors in mouse and human embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Examination of these regions revealed that they contain on average 12.6 conserved transcription factor binding site (TFBS) sequences. Enriched TFBSs are a diverse repertoire of 70 different sequences representing the binding sequences of both known and novel ESC regulators. Using a diverse set of TFBSs from this repertoire was sufficient to construct short synthetic enhancers with activity comparable to native enhancers. Site-directed mutagenesis of conserved TFBSs in endogenous enhancers or TFBS deletion from synthetic sequences revealed a requirement for 10 or more different TFBSs. Furthermore, specific TFBSs, including the POU5F1:SOX2 comotif, are dispensable, despite cobinding the POU5F1 (also known as OCT4), SOX2, and NANOG master regulators of pluripotency. These findings reveal that a TFBS sequence diversity threshold overrides the need for optimized regulatory grammar and individual TFBSs that recruit specific master regulators.

Title: True equilibrium measurement of transcription factor-DNA binding affinities using automated polarization microscopy

Date: 2018-04-23

Abstract:
The complex patterns of gene expression in metazoans are controlled by selective binding of transcription factors (TFs) to regulatory DNA. To improve the quantitative understanding of this process, we have developed a novel method that uses fluorescence anisotropy measurements in a controlled delivery system to determine TF-DNA binding energies in solution with high sensitivity and throughput. Owing to its large dynamic range, the method, named high performance fluorescence anisotropy (HiP-FA), allows for reliable quantification of both weak and strong binding; binding specificities are calculated on the basis of equilibrium constant measurements for mutational DNA variants. We determine the binding preference landscapes for 26 TFs and measure high absolute affinities, but mostly lower binding specificities than reported by other methods. The revised binding preferences give rise to improved predictions of in vivo TF occupancy and enhancer expression. Our approach provides a powerful new tool for the systems-biological analysis of gene regulation.

Title: Pioneer activity distinguishes activating from non‐activating SOX2 binding sites
Authors: Michela Maresca, Teun van den Brand, Hangpeng Li, Hans Teunissen, James Davies, Elzo de Wit
Date: 2023-09-11

Abstract:
Genome‐wide transcriptional activity involves the binding of many transcription factors (TFs) to thousands of sites in the genome. Pioneer TFs are a class of TFs that maintain open chromatin and allow non‐pioneer TFs access to their target sites. Determining which TF binding sites directly drive transcription remains a challenge. Here, we use acute protein depletion of the pioneer TF SOX2 to establish its functionality in maintaining chromatin accessibility. We show that thousands of accessible sites are lost within an hour of protein depletion, indicating rapid turnover of these sites in the absence of the pioneer factor. To understand the relationship with transcription, we performed nascent transcription analysis and found that open chromatin sites that are maintained by SOX2 are highly predictive of gene expression, in contrast to all other SOX2 binding sites. We use CRISPR‐Cas9 genome editing in the Klf2 locus to functionally validate a predicted regulatory element. We conclude that the regulatory activity of SOX2 is exerted mainly at sites where it maintains accessibility and that other binding sites are largely dispensable for gene regulation.

Abstract:
UV (ultraviolet light) irradiation distorts DNA structure. While these distortions are used by DNA repair proteins to recognize UV-induced lesions and subsequently initiate repair, the effects of UV lesions on the binding specificity of regulatory transcription factor (TFs) are poorly understood and have only been studied at a handful of sites. We introduce UV-Bind, a high-throughput method for measuring protein binding to UV-irradiated DNA. UV-Bind reveals widespread changes in the DNA-binding profiles of TFs after UV irradiation, both at consensus and nonconsensus sites. We demonstrate the utility of our data by showing that the TF-binding specificity for UV-irradiated DNA is needed to explain the competition between TFs (here, ETS1) and repair proteins [here, UV-DDB (UV-damaged DNA-binding protein)] for recognition of UV-damaged DNA sites.

Abstract:
The transition to flowering in Arabidopsis thaliana is governed by complex transcriptional regulatory networks, in which promoter-associated cis -regulatory elements integrate both developmental and environmental cues. To investigate these regulatory interactions, we analyzed promoter motifs of 18 flowering-related genes using curated motif resources, including the Eukaryotic Promoter Database (EPD) and JASPAR, applying stringent statistical thresholds. Transcription factors (TFs), which were predicted to bind across all examined promoters, were designated as putative master regulators, resulting in the identification of 36 candidates, predominantly belonging to the MADS-box, DOF, and IDD families. Positional analyses revealed both proximal and distal binding sites, including a notable motif at −1024 in PISTILLATA and at +466 in SEPALLATA3 , potentially indicative of autoregulatory control. Comparative analysis further identified 96 gene-specific associations, reflecting a balance between shared and specialized regulatory mechanisms. Treatment with β-aminobutyric acid (BABA), which has a flowering delaying effect, repressed SQUAMOSA and increased DOF-type TFs, indicating a chromatin-associated reprogramming process, which may coordinate the transcriptional suppression of flowering activators. These findings refine current models of floral regulatory networks and provide testable hypotheses regarding autoregulatory and cross-regulatory circuits in the control of flower development.

Title: Evolution of transcription factor binding through sequence variations and turnover of binding sites
Authors: Gat Krieger, Offir Lupo, Patricia Wittkopp, Naama Barkai
Date: 2022-06

Abstract:
Variations in noncoding regulatory sequences play a central role in evolution. Interpreting such variations, however, remains difficult even in the context of defined attributes such as transcription factor (TF) binding sites. Here, we systematically link variations in cis -regulatory sequences to TF binding by profiling the allele-specific binding of 27 TFs expressed in a yeast hybrid, in which two related genomes are present within the same nucleus. TFs localize preferentially to sites containing their known consensus motifs but occupy only a small fraction of the motif-containing sites available within the genomes. Differential binding of TFs to the orthologous alleles was well explained by variations that alter motif sequence, whereas differences in chromatin accessibility between alleles were of little apparent effect. Motif variations that abolished binding when present in only one allele were still bound when present in both alleles, suggesting evolutionary compensation, with a potential role for sequence conservation at the motif's vicinity. At the level of the full promoter, we identify cases of binding-site turnover, in which binding sites are reciprocally gained and lost, yet most interspecific differences remained uncompensated. Our results show the flexibility of TFs to bind imprecise motifs and the fast evolution of TF binding sites between related species.

Title: Widespread effects of DNA methylation and intra-motif dependencies revealed by novel transcription factor binding models
Authors: Jan Grau, Florian Schmidt, Marcel H Schulz
Date: 2023-10-13

Abstract:
Several studies suggested that transcription factor (TF) binding to DNA may be impaired or enhanced by DNA methylation. We present MeDeMo , a toolbox for TF motif analysis that combines information about DNA methylation with models capturing intra-motif dependencies. In a large-scale study using ChIP-seq data for 335 TFs, we identify novel TFs that show a binding behaviour associated with DNA methylation. Overall, we find that the presence of CpG methylation decreases the likelihood of binding for the majority of methylation-associated TFs. For a considerable subset of TFs, we show that intra-motif dependencies are pivotal for accurately modelling the impact of DNA methylation on TF binding. We illustrate that the novel methylation-aware TF binding models allow to predict differential ChIP-seq peaks and improve the genome-wide analysis of TF binding. Our work indicates that simplistic models that neglect the effect of DNA methylation on DNA binding may lead to systematic underperformance for methylation-associated TFs.

Abstract:
We present a major update of the HOCOMOCO collection that provides DNA binding specificity patterns of 949 human transcription factors and 720 mouse orthologs. To make this release, we performed motif discovery in peak sets that originated from 14 183 ChIP-Seq experiments and reads from 2554 HT-SELEX experiments yielding more than 400 thousand candidate motifs. The candidate motifs were annotated according to their similarity to known motifs and the hierarchy of DNA-binding domains of the respective transcription factors. Next, the motifs underwent human expert curation to stratify distinct motif subtypes and remove non-informative patterns and common artifacts. Finally, the curated subset of 100 thousand motifs was supplied to the automated benchmarking to select the best-performing motifs for each transcription factor. The resulting HOCOMOCO v12 core collection contains 1443 verified position weight matrices, including distinct subtypes of DNA binding motifs for particular transcription factors. In addition to the core collection, HOCOMOCO v12 provides motif sets optimized for the recognition of binding sites in vivo and in vitro , and for annotation of regulatory sequence variants. HOCOMOCO is available at https://hocomoco12.autosome.org and https://hocomoco.autosome.org .

Title: Modeling binding specificities of transcription factor pairs with random forests
Authors: Anni A. Antikainen, Markus Heinonen, Harri Lähdesmäki
Date: 2022-06-03

Abstract:
Transcription factors (TFs) bind regulatory DNA regions with sequence specificity, form complexes and regulate gene expression. In cooperative TF-TF binding, two transcription factors bind onto a shared DNA binding site as a pair. Previous work has demonstrated pairwise TF-TF-DNA interactions with position weight matrices (PWMs), which may however not sufficiently take into account the complexity and flexibility of pairwise binding. We propose two random forest (RF) methods for joint TF-TF binding site prediction: ComBind and JointRF. We train models with previously published large-scale CAP-SELEX DNA libraries, which comprise DNA sequences enriched for binding of a selected TF pair. JointRF builds a random forest with sub-sequences selected from CAP-SELEX DNA reads with previously proposed pairwise PWM. JointRF outperforms (area under receiver operating characteristics curve, AUROC, 0.75) the current state-of-the-art method i.e. orientation and spacing specific pairwise PWMs (AUROC 0.59). Thus, JointRF may be utilized to improve prediction accuracy for pre-determined binding preferences. However, pairwise TF binding is currently considered flexible; a pair may bind DNA with different orientations and amounts of dinucleotide gaps or overlap between the two motifs. Thus, we developed ComBind, which utilizes random forests by considering simultaneously multiple orientations and spacings of the two factors. Our approach outperforms (AUROC 0.78) PWMs, as well as JointRF ( p <0.00195). ComBind provides an approach for predicting TF-TF binding sites without prior knowledge on pairwise binding preferences. However, more research is needed to assess ComBind eligibility for practical applications. Random forest is well suited for modeling pairwise TF-TF-DNA binding specificities, and ComBind provides an improvement to pairwise binding site prediction accuracy.

Abstract:
Positional weight matrix (PWM) is a de facto standard model to describe transcription factor (TF) DNA binding specificities. PWMs inferred from in vivo or in vitro data are stored in many databases and used in a plethora of biological applications. This calls for comprehensive benchmarking of public PWM models with large experimental reference sets. Here we report results from all-against-all benchmarking of PWM models for DNA binding sites of human TFs on a large compilation of in vitro (HT-SELEX, PBM) and in vivo (ChIP-seq) binding data. We observe that the best performing PWM for a given TF often belongs to another TF, usually from the same family. Occasionally, binding specificity is correlated with the structural class of the DNA binding domain, indicated by good cross-family performance measures. Benchmarking-based selection of family-representative motifs is more effective than motif clustering-based approaches. Overall, there is good agreement between in vitro and in vivo performance measures. However, for some in vivo experiments, the best performing PWM is assigned to an unrelated TF, indicating a binding mode involving protein-protein cooperativity. In an all-against-all setting, we compute more than 18 million performance measure values for different PWM-experiment combinations and offer these results as a public resource to the research community. The benchmarking protocols are provided via a web interface and as docker images. The methods and results from this study may help others make better use of public TF specificity models, as well as public TF binding data sets.

Title: Benchmarking transcription factor binding site prediction models: a comparative analysis on synthetic and biological data
Authors: Manuel Tognon, Alisa Kumbara, Andrea Betti, Lorenzo Ruggeri, Rosalba Giugno
Date: 2025-07

Abstract:
Transcription factors (TFs) are essential regulatory proteins controlling the cellular transcriptional states by binding to specific DNA sequences known as transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) or motifs. Accurate TFBS identification is crucial for unraveling regulatory mechanisms driving cellular dynamics. Over the years, various computational approaches have been developed to model TFBSs, with position weight matrices (PWMs) being one of the most widely adopted methods. PWMs provide a probabilistic framework by representing nucleotide frequencies at every position within the binding site. While effective and interpretable, PWMs face significant limitations, such as their inability to capture positional dependencies or model complex interactions. To address these, advanced methods, like support vector machine (SVM)–based, and deep learning (DL)–based models, have been introduced. Leveraging human ChIP-seq data from ENCODE, we systematically benchmarked the predictive performance of PWM, SVM-, and DL-based models across different scenarios. We evaluate the impact of key factors such as training dataset size, sequence length, and kernel functions (for SVMs) on models’ performance. Additionally, we explore the impact of synthetic versus real biological background data during model training. Our analysis highlights strengths and limitations of each approach under different conditions, providing practical guidance for selecting and tailoring models to specific biological datasets. To complement our analysis, we present a comprehensive database of pretrained SVM models for TFBS detection, trained on human ChIP-seq data from diverse cell lines and tissues. This resource aims to facilitate broader adoption of SVM-based methods in TFBS prediction and enhance their practical utility in regulatory genomics research.

Abstract:
The arrangement of transcription factor (TF) binding motifs (syntax) is an important part of the cis-regulatory code, yet remains elusive. We introduce a deep learning model, BPNet, that uses DNA sequence to predict base-resolution ChIP-nexus binding profiles of pluripotency TFs. We develop interpretation tools to learn predictive motif representations and identify soft syntax rules for cooperative TF binding interactions. Strikingly, Nanog preferentially binds with helical periodicity, and TFs often cooperate in a directional manner, which we validate using CRISPR-induced point mutations. Our model represents a powerful general approach to uncover the motifs and syntax of cis-regulatory sequences in genomics data.

Abstract:
Transcription factors (TFs) are the main regulators of eukaryotic gene expression. The cooperative binding of at least two TFs to genomic DNA is a major mechanism of transcription regulation. Massive analysis of the co-occurrence of overrepresented pairs of motifs for different target TFs studied in ChIP-seq experiments can clarify the mechanisms of TF cooperation. We categorized the target TFs from M. musculus ChIP-seq and A. thaliana ChIP-seq/DAP-seq experiments according to the structure of their DNA-binding domains (DBDs) into classes. We studied homotypic pairs of motifs, using the same recognition model for each motif. Asymmetric and symmetric pairs consist of motifs of remote and close recognition scores. We found that asymmetric pairs of motifs predominate for all TF classes. TFs from the murine/plant ‘Basic helix–loop–helix (bHLH)’, ‘Basic leucine zipper (bZIP)’, and ‘Tryptophan cluster’ classes and murine ‘p53 domain’ and ‘Rel homology region’ classes showed the highest enrichment of asymmetric homotypic pairs of motifs. Pioneer TFs, despite their DBD types, have a higher significance of asymmetry within homotypic pairs of motifs compared to other TFs. Asymmetry within homotypic CEs is a promising new feature decrypting the mechanisms of gene transcription regulation.

Abstract:
As transcription factors (TFs) play a major role in gene regulation, we studied their binding motifs (positional weight matrices, PWMs) and binding sites (TFBSs) in the human genome, and how TFs bind DNA motifs, including the involvement of binding co-factors. Using the chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing data recently released by ENCODE (Encyclopedia of DNA Elements), we obtained new PWMs for 196 TFs and revised PWMs for 119 TFs. From these and the PWMs previously obtained for 235 TFs, we inferred the canonical PWMs for 500 TFs, including 243 new PWMs. Analysis revealed that most TFBSs are in introns (42.6%) and intergenic regions (31.6%), with only 11.3% in promoters. However, the TFBS density is considerably higher in promoters, showing a bell-shaped distribution of TFBSs with a peak at the transcription start site. Many TFBSs lie close to CTCF (CCCTC-binding factor) binding sites. Tethered binding is far more frequent than co-binding, with the latter often requiring co-factors.

Title: Experimental approaches to investigate biophysical interactions between homeodomain transcription factors and DNA
Authors: Fadwa Mekkaoui, Robert A. Drewell, Jacqueline M. Dresch, Donald E. Spratt
Date: 2025-03

Abstract:
Homeodomain transcription factors (TFs) bind to specific DNA sequences to regulate the expression of target genes. Structural work has provided insight into molecular identities and aided in unraveling structural features of these TFs. However, the detailed affinity and specificity by which these TFs bind to DNA sequences is still largely unknown. Qualitative methods, such as DNA footprinting, Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSAs), Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (SELEX), Bacterial One Hybrid (B1H) systems, Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR), and Protein Binding Microarrays (PBMs) have been widely used to investigate the biochemical characteristics of TF-DNA binding events. In addition to these qualitative methods, bioinformatic approaches have also assisted in TF binding site discovery. Here we discuss the advantages and limitations of these different approaches, as well as the benefits of utilizing more quantitative approaches, such as Mechanically Induced Trapping of Molecular Interactions (MITOMI), Microscale Thermophoresis (MST) and Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC), in determining the biophysical basis of binding specificity of TF-DNA complexes and improving upon existing computational approaches aimed at affinity predictions.

Title: Transcription Factor Binding Sites Prediction Based on Modified Nucleosomes
Authors: Mohammad Talebzadeh, Fatemeh Zare-Mirakabad
Date: 2014

Abstract:
In computational methods, position weight matrices (PWMs) are commonly applied for transcription factor binding site (TFBS) prediction. Although these matrices are more accurate than simple consensus sequences to predict actual binding sites, they usually produce a large number of false positive (FP) predictions and so are impoverished sources of information. Several studies have employed additional sources of information such as sequence conservation or the vicinity to transcription start sites to distinguish true binding regions from random ones. Recently, the spatial distribution of modified nucleosomes has been shown to be associated with different promoter architectures. These aligned patterns can facilitate DNA accessibility for transcription factors. We hypothesize that using data from these aligned and periodic patterns can improve the performance of binding region prediction. In this study, we propose two effective features, “modified nucleosomes neighboring” and “modified nucleosomes occupancy”, to decrease FP in binding site discovery. Based on these features, we designed a logistic regression classifier which estimates the probability of a region as a TFBS. Our model learned each feature based on Sp1 binding sites on Chromosome 1 and was tested on the other chromosomes in human CD4+T cells. In this work, we investigated 21 histone modifications and found that only 8 out of 21 marks are strongly correlated with transcription factor binding regions. To prove that these features are not specific to Sp1, we combined the logistic regression classifier with the PWM, and created a new model to search TFBSs on the genome. We tested the model using transcription factors MAZ, PU.1 and ELF1 and compared the results to those using only the PWM. The results show that our model can predict Transcription factor binding regions more successfully. The relative simplicity of the model and capability of integrating other features make it a superior method for TFBS prediction.

Title: An interpretable bimodal neural network characterizes the sequence and preexisting chromatin predictors of induced transcription factor binding
Authors: Divyanshi Srivastava, Begüm Aydin, Esteban O. Mazzoni, Shaun Mahony
Date: 2021-01-07

Abstract:
Transcription factor (TF) binding specificity is determined via a complex interplay between the transcription factor’s DNA binding preference and cell type-specific chromatin environments. The chromatin features that correlate with transcription factor binding in a given cell type have been well characterized. For instance, the binding sites for a majority of transcription factors display concurrent chromatin accessibility. However, concurrent chromatin features reflect the binding activities of the transcription factor itself and thus provide limited insight into how genome-wide TF-DNA binding patterns became established in the first place. To understand the determinants of transcription factor binding specificity, we therefore need to examine how newly activated transcription factors interact with sequence and preexisting chromatin landscapes. Here, we investigate the sequence and preexisting chromatin predictors of TF-DNA binding by examining the genome-wide occupancy of transcription factors that have been induced in well-characterized chromatin environments. We develop Bichrom, a bimodal neural network that jointly models sequence and preexisting chromatin data to interpret the genome-wide binding patterns of induced transcription factors. We find that the preexisting chromatin landscape is a differential global predictor of TF-DNA binding; incorporating preexisting chromatin features improves our ability to explain the binding specificity of some transcription factors substantially, but not others. Furthermore, by analyzing site-level predictors, we show that transcription factor binding in previously inaccessible chromatin tends to correspond to the presence of more favorable cognate DNA sequences. Bichrom thus provides a framework for modeling, interpreting, and visualizing the joint sequence and chromatin landscapes that determine TF-DNA binding dynamics.

Title: Disentangling transcription factor binding site complexity
Authors: Ralf Eggeling
Date: 2018-11-16

Abstract:
The binding motifs of many transcription factors (TFs) comprise a higher degree of complexity than a single position weight matrix model permits. Additional complexity is typically taken into account either as intra-motif dependencies via more sophisticated probabilistic models or as heterogeneities via multiple weight matrices. However, both orthogonal approaches have limitations when learning from in vivo data where binding sites of other factors in close proximity can interfere with motif discovery for the protein of interest. In this work, we demonstrate how intra-motif complexity can, purely by analyzing the statistical properties of a given set of TF-binding sites, be distinguished from complexity arising from an intermix with motifs of co-binding TFs or other artifacts. In addition, we study the related question whether intra-motif complexity is represented more effectively by dependencies, heterogeneities or variants in between. Benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of both methods for their respective tasks and applications on motif discovery output from recent tools detect and correct many undesirable artifacts. These results further suggest that the prevalence of intra-motif dependencies may have been overestimated in previous studies on in vivo data and should thus be reassessed.

Title: Physical interaction between MSL2 and CLAMP assures direct cooperativity and prevents competition at composite binding sites
Authors: Nikolas Eggers, Fotios Gkountromichos, Silke Krause, Aline Campos-Sparr, Peter B Becker
Date: 2023-09-22

Abstract:
MSL2, the DNA-binding subunit of the Drosophila dosage compensation complex, cooperates with the ubiquitous protein CLAMP to bind MSL recognition elements (MREs) on the X chromosome. We explore the nature of the cooperative binding to these GA-rich, composite sequence elements in reconstituted naïve embryonic chromatin. We found that the cooperativity requires physical interaction between both proteins. Remarkably, disruption of this interaction does not lead to indirect, nucleosome-mediated cooperativity as expected, but to competition. The protein interaction apparently not only increases the affinity for composite binding sites, but also locks both proteins in a defined dimeric state that prevents competition. High Affinity Sites of MSL2 on the X chromosome contain variable numbers of MREs. We find that the cooperation between MSL2/CLAMP is not influenced by MRE clustering or arrangement, but happens largely at the level of individual MREs. The sites where MSL2/CLAMP bind strongly in vitro locate to all chromosomes and show little overlap to an expanded set of X-chromosomal MSL2 in vivo binding sites generated by CUT&RUN. Apparently, the intrinsic MSL2/CLAMP cooperativity is limited to a small selection of potential sites in vivo . This restriction must be due to components missing in our reconstitution, such as roX2 lncRNA.

Abstract:
Transcription factors bind DNA in specific sequence contexts. In addition to distinguishing one nucleobase from another, some transcription factors can distinguish between unmodified and modified bases. Current models of transcription factor binding tend not to take DNA modifications into account, while the recent few that do often have limitations. This makes a comprehensive and accurate profiling of transcription factor affinities difficult. Here, we develop methods to identify transcription factor binding sites in modified DNA. Our models expand the standard A/C/G/T DNA alphabet to include cytosine modifications. We develop Cytomod to create modified genomic sequences and we also enhance the MEME Suite, adding the capacity to handle custom alphabets. We adapt the well-established position weight matrix (PWM) model of transcription factor binding affinity to this expanded DNA alphabet. Using these methods, we identify modification-sensitive transcription factor binding motifs. We confirm established binding preferences, such as the preference of ZFP57 and C/EBPβ for methylated motifs and the preference of c-Myc for unmethylated E-box motifs. Using known binding preferences to tune model parameters, we discover novel modified motifs for a wide array of transcription factors. Finally, we validate our binding preference predictions for OCT4 using cleavage under targets and release using nuclease (CUT&RUN) experiments across conventional, methylation-, and hydroxymethylation-enriched sequences. Our approach readily extends to other DNA modifications. As more genome-wide single-base resolution modification data becomes available, we expect that our method will yield insights into altered transcription factor binding affinities across many different modifications.

Title: The evaluation of transcription factor binding site prediction tools in human and Arabidopsis genomes
Authors: Dinithi V. Wanniarachchi, Sameera Viswakula, Anushka M. Wickramasuriya
Date: 2024-12-02

Abstract:
The precise prediction of transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) is pivotal for unraveling the gene regulatory networks underlying biological processes. While numerous tools have emerged for in silico TFBS prediction in recent years, the evolving landscape of computational biology necessitates thorough assessments of tool performance to ensure accuracy and reliability. Only a limited number of studies have been conducted to evaluate the performance of TFBS prediction tools comprehensively. Thus, the present study focused on assessing twelve widely used TFBS prediction tools and four de novo motif discovery tools using a benchmark dataset comprising real, generic, Markov, and negative sequences. TFBSs of Arabidopsis thaliana and Homo sapiens genomes downloaded from the JASPAR database were implanted in these sequences and the performance of tools was evaluated using several statistical parameters at different overlap percentages between the lengths of known and predicted binding sites. Overall, the Multiple Cluster Alignment and Search Tool (MCAST) emerged as the best TFBS prediction tool, followed by Find Individual Motif Occurrences (FIMO) and MOtif Occurrence Detection Suite (MOODS). In addition, MotEvo and Dinucleotide Weight Tensor Toolbox (DWT-toolbox) demonstrated the highest sensitivity in identifying TFBSs at 90% and 80% overlap. Further, MCAST and DWT-toolbox managed to demonstrate the highest sensitivity across all three data types real, generic, and Markov. Among the de novo motif discovery tools, the Multiple Em for Motif Elicitation (MEME) emerged as the best performer. An analysis of the promoter regions of genes involved in the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway in plants and the pentose phosphate pathway in humans, using the three best-performing tools, revealed considerable variation among the top 20 motifs identified by these tools. The findings of this study lay a robust groundwork for selecting optimal TFBS prediction tools for future research. Given the variability observed in tool performance, employing multiple tools for identifying TFBSs in a set of sequences is highly recommended. In addition, further studies are recommended to develop an integrated toolbox that incorporates TFBS prediction or motif discovery tools, aiming to streamline result precision and accuracy.

Title: Quantitative analysis of transcription factor binding and expression using calling cards reporter arrays
Authors: Jiayue Liu, Christian A Shively, Robi D Mitra
Date: 2020-05-21

Abstract:
We report a tool, Calling Cards Reporter Arrays (CCRA), that measures transcription factor (TF) binding and the consequences on gene expression for hundreds of synthetic promoters in yeast. Using Cbf1p and MAX, we demonstrate that the CCRA method is able to detect small changes in binding free energy with a sensitivity comparable to in vitro methods, enabling the measurement of energy landscapes in vivo . We then demonstrate the quantitative analysis of cooperative interactions by measuring Cbf1p binding at synthetic promoters with multiple sites. We find that the cooperativity between Cbf1p dimers varies sinusoidally with a period of 10.65 bp and energetic cost of 1.37 K B T for sites that are positioned ‘out of phase’. Finally, we characterize the binding and expression of a group of TFs, Tye7p, Gcr1p and Gcr2p, that act together as a ‘TF collective’, an important but poorly characterized model of TF cooperativity. We demonstrate that Tye7p often binds promoters without its recognition site because it is recruited by other collective members, whereas these other members require their recognition sites, suggesting a hierarchy where these factors recruit Tye7p but not vice versa. Our experiments establish CCRA as a useful tool for quantitative investigations into TF binding and function.

Title: Functional analysis of transcription factor binding sites in human promoters
Authors: Troy W Whitfield, Jie Wang, Patrick J Collins, E Christopher Partridge, Shelley Force Aldred, Nathan D Trinklein, Richard M Myers, Zhiping Weng
Date: 2012

Abstract:
The binding of transcription factors to specific locations in the genome is integral to the orchestration of transcriptional regulation in cells. To characterize transcription factor binding site function on a large scale, we predicted and mutagenized 455 binding sites in human promoters. We carried out functional tests on these sites in four different immortalized human cell lines using transient transfections with a luciferase reporter assay, primarily for the transcription factors CTCF, GABP, GATA2, E2F, STAT, and YY1. In each cell line, between 36% and 49% of binding sites made a functional contribution to the promoter activity; the overall rate for observing function in any of the cell lines was 70%. Transcription factor binding resulted in transcriptional repression in more than a third of functional sites. When compared with predicted binding sites whose function was not experimentally verified, the functional binding sites had higher conservation and were located closer to transcriptional start sites (TSSs). Among functional sites, repressive sites tended to be located further from TSSs than were activating sites. Our data provide significant insight into the functional characteristics of YY1 binding sites, most notably the detection of distinct activating and repressing classes of YY1 binding sites. Repressing sites were located closer to, and often overlapped with, translational start sites and presented a distinctive variation on the canonical YY1 binding motif. The genomic properties that we found to associate with functional TF binding sites on promoters -- conservation, TSS proximity, motifs and their variations -- point the way to improved accuracy in future TFBS predictions.

Title: Revisiting the model for coactivator recruitment: Med15 can select its target sites independent of promoter-bound transcription factors
Authors: Vladimir Mindel, Sagie Brodsky, Hadas Yung, Wajd Manadre, Naama Barkai
Date: 2024-11-11

Abstract:
Activation domains (ADs) within transcription factors (TFs) induce gene expression by recruiting coactivators such as the Mediator complex. Coactivators lack DNA binding domains (DBDs) and are assumed to passively follow their recruiting TFs. This is supported by direct AD-coactivator interactions seen in vitro but has not yet been tested in living cells. To examine that, we targeted two Med15-recruiting ADs to a range of budding yeast promoters through fusion with different DBDs. The DBD-AD fusions localized to hundreds of genomic sites but recruited Med15 and induced transcription in only a subset of bound promoters, characterized by a fuzzy-nucleosome architecture. Direct DBD-Med15 fusions shifted DBD localization towards fuzzy-nucleosome promoters, including promoters devoid of the endogenous Mediator. We propose that Med15, and perhaps other coactivators, possess inherent promoter preference and thus actively contribute to the selection of TF-induced genes.

Abstract:
Development of the malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum , is regulated by a limited number of sequence-specific transcription factors (TFs). However, the mechanisms by which these TFs recognize genome-wide binding sites is largely unknown. To address TF specificity, we investigated the binding of two TF subsets that either bind CACACA or GTGCAC DNA sequence motifs and further characterized two additional ApiAP2 TFs, PfAP2-G and PfAP2-EXP, which bind unique DNA motifs (GTAC and TGCATGCA). We also interrogated the impact of DNA sequence and chromatin context on P. falciparum TF binding by integrating high-throughput in vitro and in vivo binding assays, DNA shape predictions, epigenetic post-translational modifications, and chromatin accessibility. We found that DNA sequence context minimally impacts binding site selection for paralogous CACACA-binding TFs, while chromatin accessibility, epigenetic patterns, co-factor recruitment, and dimerization correlate with differential binding. In contrast, GTGCAC-binding TFs prefer different DNA sequence context in addition to chromatin dynamics. Finally, we determined that TFs that preferentially bind divergent DNA motifs may bind overlapping genomic regions due to low-affinity binding to other sequence motifs. Our results demonstrate that TF binding site selection relies on a combination of DNA sequence and chromatin features, thereby contributing to the complexity of P. falciparum gene regulatory mechanisms.

Title: SEMplMe: a tool for integrating DNA methylation effects in transcription factor binding affinity predictions
Authors: Sierra S. Nishizaki, Alan P. Boyle
Date: 2022-08-04

Abstract:
Aberrant DNA methylation in transcription factor binding sites has been shown to lead to anomalous gene regulation that is strongly associated with human disease. However, the majority of methylation-sensitive positions within transcription factor binding sites remain unknown. Here we introduce SEMplMe, a computational tool to generate predictions of the effect of methylation on transcription factor binding strength in every position within a transcription factor’s motif. SEMplMe uses ChIP-seq and whole genome bisulfite sequencing to predict effects of methylation within binding sites. SEMplMe validates known methylation sensitive and insensitive positions within a binding motif, identifies cell type specific transcription factor binding driven by methylation, and outperforms SELEX-based predictions for CTCF. These predictions can be used to identify aberrant sites of DNA methylation contributing to human disease. SEMplMe is available from https://github.com/Boyle-Lab/SEMplMe .

Date: 2021-02-26

Abstract:
Interactions between transcription factors and chromatin are fundamental to genome organization and regulation and, ultimately, cell state. Here, we use information theory to measure signatures of organized chromatin resulting from transcription factor-chromatin interactions encoded in the patterns of the accessible genome, which we term chromatin information enrichment (CIE). We calculate CIE for hundreds of transcription factor motifs across human samples and identify two classes: low and high CIE. The 10–20% of common and tissue-specific high CIE transcription factor motifs, associate with higher protein–DNA residence time, including different binding site subclasses of the same transcription factor, increased nucleosome phasing, specific protein domains, and the genetic control of both chromatin accessibility and gene expression. These results show that variations in the information encoded in chromatin architecture reflect functional biological variation, with implications for cell state dynamics and memory.

Title: Identification of co‐localised transcription factors based on paired motifs analysis
Authors: Li Liu, Lu Han, Kaiyuan Han, Zheng Zhang, Haojiang Zhang, Lirong Zhang
Date: 2024-11-26

Abstract:
The interaction of transcription factors (TFs) with DNA precisely regulates gene transcription. In mammalian cells, thousands of TFs often interact with DNA cis ‐regulatory elements in a combinatorial manner rather than act alone. The identification of cooperativity between TFs can help to explore the mechanism of transcriptional regulation. However, little is known about the cooperative patterns of TFs in the genome. To identify which TFs prefer co‐localisation, the authors conducted a paired motif analysis in the accessible regions of the human genome based on the Poisson background model. Especially, the authors distinguish the cooperative binding TFs and the competitive binding TFs according to the distance between TF motifs. In the K562 cell line, the authors find that TFs from a same family are always competing the same binding sites, such as FOS_JUN family, whereas KLF family TFs show significant cooperative binding in the adjacency region. Furthermore, the comparative analysis across 16 human cell lines indicates that most TF combination patterns are conserved, but there are still some cell‐line‐specific patterns. Finally, in human prostate cancer cells (PC‐3) and human prostate normal cells (RWPE‐2), the authors investigate the specific TF combination patterns in the disease cell and normal cell. The results show that the cooperative binding TF pairs shared by PC‐3 and RWPE‐2 account for over 90%. Simultaneously, the authors also identify 26 specific TF combination pairs in PC‐3 cancer cells.

Title: Variable structure motifs for transcription factor binding sites
Authors: John E Reid, Kenneth J Evans, Nigel Dyer, Lorenz Wernisch, Sascha Ott
Date: 2010

Abstract:
Classically, models of DNA-transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) have been based on relatively few known instances and have treated them as sites of fixed length using position weight matrices (PWMs). Various extensions to this model have been proposed, most of which take account of dependencies between the bases in the binding sites. However, some transcription factors are known to exhibit some flexibility and bind to DNA in more than one possible physical configuration. In some cases this variation is known to affect the function of binding sites. With the increasing volume of ChIP-seq data available it is now possible to investigate models that incorporate this flexibility. Previous work on variable length models has been constrained by: a focus on specific zinc finger proteins in yeast using restrictive models; a reliance on hand-crafted models for just one transcription factor at a time; and a lack of evaluation on realistically sized data sets. We re-analysed binding sites from the TRANSFAC database and found motivating examples where our new variable length model provides a better fit. We analysed several ChIP-seq data sets with a novel motif search algorithm and compared the results to one of the best standard PWM finders and a recently developed alternative method for finding motifs of variable structure. All the methods performed comparably in held-out cross validation tests. Known motifs of variable structure were recovered for p53, Stat5a and Stat5b. In addition our method recovered a novel generalised version of an existing PWM for Sp1 that allows for variable length binding. This motif improved classification performance. We have presented a new gapped PWM model for variable length DNA binding sites that is not too restrictive nor over-parameterised. Our comparison with existing tools shows that on average it does not have better predictive accuracy than existing methods. However, it does provide more interpretable models of motifs of variable structure that are suitable for follow-up structural studies. To our knowledge, we are the first to apply variable length motif models to eukaryotic ChIP-seq data sets and consequently the first to show their value in this domain. The results include a novel motif for the ubiquitous transcription factor Sp1.

Date: 2018-02

Abstract:
The ability to predict transcription factors based on sequence information in regulatory elements is a key step in systems-level investigation of transcriptional regulation. Here, we have developed a novel tool, IMAGE, for precise prediction of causal transcription factors based on transcriptome profiling and genome-wide maps of enhancer activity. High precision is obtained by combining a near-complete database of position weight matrices (PWMs), generated by compiling public databases and systematic prediction of PWMs for uncharacterized transcription factors, with a state-of-the-art method for PWM scoring and a novel machine learning strategy, based on both enhancers and promoters, to predict the contribution of motifs to transcriptional activity. We applied IMAGE to published data obtained during 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation and showed that IMAGE predicts causal transcriptional regulators of this process with higher confidence than existing methods. Furthermore, we generated genome-wide maps of enhancer activity and transcripts during human mesenchymal stem cell commitment and adipocyte differentiation and used IMAGE to identify positive and negative transcriptional regulators of this process. Collectively, our results demonstrate that IMAGE is a powerful and precise method for prediction of regulators of gene expression.

Title: In-silico identification and comparison of transcription factor binding sites cluster in anterior-posterior patterning genes in Drosophila melanogaster and Tribolium castaneum
Authors: Anshika Moudgil, Ranbir Chander Sobti, Tejinder Kaur
Date: 2023-08-17

Abstract:
The cis-regulatory data that help in transcriptional regulation is arranged into modular pieces of a few hundred base pairs called CRMs (cis-regulatory modules) and numerous binding sites for multiple transcription factors are prominent characteristics of these cis-regulatory modules. The present study was designed to localize transcription factor binding site (TFBS) clusters on twelve Anterior-posterior (A-P) genes in Tribolium castaneum and compare them to their orthologous gene enhancers in Drosophila melanogaster . Out of the twelve A-P patterning genes, six were gap genes ( Kruppel , Knirps , Tailless , Hunchback , Giant , and Caudal ) and six were pair rule genes ( Hairy , Runt , Even-skipped , Fushi-tarazu , Paired , and Odd-skipped ). The genes along with 20 kb upstream and downstream regions were scanned for TFBS clusters using the Motif Cluster Alignment Search Tool (MCAST), a bioinformatics tool that looks for set of nucleotide sequences for statistically significant clusters of non-overlapping occurrence of a given set of motifs. The motifs used in the current study were Hunchback, Caudal, Giant, Kruppel, Knirps, and Even-skipped. The results of the MCAST analysis revealed the maximum number of TFBS for Hunchback, Knirps, Caudal, and Kruppel in both D . melanogaster and T . castaneum , while Bicoid TFBS clusters were found only in D . melanogaster . The size of all the predicted TFBS clusters was less than 1kb in both insect species. These sequences revealed more transversional sites (Tv) than transitional sites (Ti) and the average Ti/Tv ratio was 0.75.

Title: TFBSFootprinter: a multiomics tool for prediction of transcription factor binding sites in vertebrate species
Authors: Harlan R. Barker, Seppo Parkkila, MarttiE.E. Tolvanen
Date: 2025-07-11

Abstract:
Transcription factor (TF) proteins play a critical role in the regulation of eukaryotic gene expression via sequence-specific binding to genomic locations known as transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs). Accurate prediction of TFBSs is essential for understanding gene regulation, disease mechanisms, and drug discovery. These studies are therefore relevant not only in humans but also in model organisms and domesticated and wild animals. However, current tools for the automatic analysis of TFBSs in gene promoter regions are limited in their usability across multiple species. To our knowledge, no tools currently exist that allow for automatic analysis of TFBSs in gene promoter regions for many species. The TFBSFootprinter tool combines multiomic transcription-relevant data for more accurate prediction of functional TFBSs in 317 vertebrate species. In humans, this includes vertebrate sequence conservation (GERP), proximity to transcription start sites (FANTOM5), correlation of expression between target genes and TFs predicted to bind promoters (FANTOM5), overlap with ChIP-Seq TF metaclusters (GTRD), overlap with ATAC-Seq peaks (ENCODE), eQTLs (GTEx), and the observed/expected CpG ratio (Ensembl). In non-human vertebrates, this includes GERP, proximity to transcription start sites, and CpG ratio. TFBSFootprinter analyses are based on the Ensembl transcript ID for simplicity of use and require minimal setup steps. Benchmarking of the TFBSFootprinter on a manually curated and experimentally verified dataset of TFBSs produced superior results when using all multiomic data (average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.881), compared with DeepBind (0.798), DeepSEA (0.682), FIMO (0.817) and traditional PWM (0.854). The results were further improved by selecting the best overall combination of multiomic data (0.910). Additionally, we determined combinations of multiomic data that provide the best model of binding for each TF. TFBSFootprinter is available as Conda and Python packages.

Abstract:
Human nuclear receptors (NRs) are a superfamily of ligand-responsive transcription factors that have central roles in cellular function. Their malfunction is linked to numerous diseases, and the ability to modulate their activity with synthetic ligands has yielded 16% of all FDA-approved drugs. NRs regulate distinct gene networks, however they often function from genomic sites that lack known binding motifs. Here, to annotate genomic binding sites of known and unexamined NRs more accurately, we use high-throughput SELEX to comprehensively map DNA binding site preferences of all full-length human NRs, in complex with their ligands. Furthermore, to identify non-obvious binding sites buried in DNA–protein interactomes, we develop MinSeq Find , a search algorithm based on the MinTerm concept from electrical engineering and digital systems design. The resulting Min Term seq uence s et (MinSeqs) reveal a constellation of binding sites that more effectively annotate NR-binding profiles in cells. MinSeqs also unmask binding sites created or disrupted by 52,106 single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with human diseases. By implicating druggable NRs as hidden drivers of multiple human diseases, our results not only reveal new biological roles of NRs, but they also provide a resource for drug-repurposing and precision medicine.

Abstract:
The Drosophila PAX6 homolog twin of eyeless ( toy ) sits at the pinnacle of the genetic pathway controlling eye development, the retinal determination network. Expression of toy in the embryo is first detectable at cellular blastoderm stage 5 in an anterior–dorsal band in the presumptive procephalic neuroectoderm, which gives rise to the primordia of the visual system and brain. Although several maternal and gap transcription factors that generate positional information in the embryo have been implicated in controlling toy , the regulation of toy expression in the early embryo is currently not well characterized. In this study, we adopt an integrated experimental approach utilizing bioinformatics, molecular genetic testing of putative enhancers in transgenic reporter gene assays and quantitative analysis of expression patterns in the early embryo, to identify 2 novel coacting enhancers at the toy gene. In addition, we apply mathematical modeling to dissect the regulatory landscape for toy . We demonstrate that relatively simple thermodynamic-based models, incorporating only 5 TF binding sites, can accurately predict gene expression from the 2 coacting enhancers and that the HUNCHBACK TF plays a critical regulatory role through a dual-modality function as an activator and repressor. Our analysis also reveals that the molecular architecture of the 2 enhancers is very different, indicating that the underlying regulatory logic they employ is distinct.

Abstract:
Regulation of gene expression requires the combinatorial binding of sequence-specific transcription factors (TFs) at promoters and enhancers. Prior studies showed that alterations in the spacing between TF binding sites can influence promoter and enhancer activity. However, the relative importance of TF spacing alterations resulting from naturally occurring insertions and deletions (InDels) has not been systematically analyzed. To address this question, we first characterized the genome-wide spacing relationships of 73 TFs in human K562 cells as determined by ChIP-seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing). We found a dominant pattern of a relaxed range of spacing between collaborative factors, including 45 TFs exclusively exhibiting relaxed spacing with their binding partners. Next, we exploited millions of InDels provided by genetically diverse mouse strains and human individuals to investigate the effects of altered spacing on TF binding and local histone acetylation. These analyses suggested that spacing alterations resulting from naturally occurring InDels are generally tolerated in comparison to genetic variants directly affecting TF binding sites. To experimentally validate this prediction, we introduced synthetic spacing alterations between PU.1 and C/EBPβ binding sites at six endogenous genomic loci in a macrophage cell line. Remarkably, collaborative binding of PU.1 and C/EBPβ at these locations tolerated changes in spacing ranging from 5 bp increase to >30 bp decrease. Collectively, these findings have implications for understanding mechanisms underlying enhancer selection and for the interpretation of non-coding genetic variation.

Title: Comprehensive analysis of computational approaches in plant transcription factors binding regions discovery
Authors: Jyoti, Ritu, Sagar Gupta, Ravi Shankar
Date: 2024-10-30

Abstract:
Transcription factors (TFs) are regulatory proteins which bind to a specific DNA region known as the transcription factor binding regions (TFBRs) to regulate the rate of transcription process. The identification of TFBRs has been made possible by a number of experimental and computational techniques established during the past few years. The process of TFBR identification involves peak identification in the binding data, followed by the identification of motif characteristics. Using the same binding data attempts have been made to raise computational models to identify such binding regions which could save time and resources spent for binding experiments. These computational approaches depend a lot on what way they learn and how. These existing computational approaches are skewed heavily around human TFBRs discovery, while plants have drastically different genomic setup for regulation which these approaches have grossly ignored. Here, we provide a comprehensive study of the current state of the matters in plant specific TF discovery algorithms. While doing so, we encountered several software tools’ issues rendering the tools not useable to researches. We fixed them and have also provided the corrected scripts for such tools. We expect this study to serve as a guide for better understanding of software tools’ approaches for plant specific TFBRs discovery and the care to be taken while applying them, especially during cross-species applications. The corrected scripts of these software tools are made available at https://github.com/SCBB-LAB/Comparative-analysis-of-plant-TFBS-software.

Patterns of transcriptional activity are encoded in our genome through regulatory elements such as promoters or enhancers that, paradoxically, contain similar assortments of sequence-specific transcription factor (TF) binding sites 1 – 3 . Knowledge of how these sequence motifs encode multiple, often overlapping, gene expression programs is central to understanding gene regulation and how mutations in non-coding DNA manifest in disease 4 , 5 . Here, by studying gene regulation from the perspective of individual transcription start sites (TSSs), using natural genetic variation, perturbation of endogenous TF protein levels and massively parallel analysis of natural and synthetic regulatory elements, we show that the effect of TF binding on transcription initiation is position dependent. Analysing TF-binding-site occurrences relative to the TSS, we identified several motifs with highly preferential positioning. We show that these patterns are a combination of a TF’s distinct functional profiles—many TFs, including canonical activators such as NRF1, NFY and Sp1, activate or repress transcription initiation depending on their precise position relative to the TSS. As such, TFs and their spacing collectively guide the site and frequency of transcription initiation. More broadly, these findings reveal how similar assortments of TF binding sites can generate distinct gene regulatory outcomes depending on their spatial configuration and how DNA sequence polymorphisms may contribute to transcription variation and disease and underscore a critical role for TSS data in decoding the regulatory information of our genome.

Title: Functional signatures of evolutionarily young CTCF binding sites
Authors: Dhoyazan  Azazi, Jonathan M. Mudge, Duncan T. Odom, Paul Flicek
Date: 2020-09-23

Abstract:
The introduction of novel CTCF binding sites in gene regulatory regions in the rodent lineage is partly the effect of transposable element expansion, particularly in the murine lineage. The exact mechanism and functional impact of evolutionarily novel CTCF binding sites are not yet fully understood. We investigated the impact of novel subspecies-specific CTCF binding sites in two Mus genus subspecies, Mus musculus domesticus and Mus musculus castaneus , that diverged 0.5 million years ago. CTCF binding site evolution is influenced by the action of the B2-B4 family of transposable elements independently in both lineages, leading to the proliferation of novel CTCF binding sites. A subset of evolutionarily young sites may harbour transcriptional functionality as evidenced by the stability of their binding across multiple tissues in M. musculus domesticus (BL6), while overall the distance of subspecies-specific CTCF binding to the nearest transcription start sites and/or topologically associated domains (TADs) is largely similar to musculus -common CTCF sites. Remarkably, we discovered a recurrent regulatory architecture consisting of a CTCF binding site and an interferon gene that appears to have been tandemly duplicated to create a 15-gene cluster on chromosome 4, thus forming a novel BL6 specific immune locus in which CTCF may play a regulatory role. Our results demonstrate that thousands of CTCF binding sites show multiple functional signatures rapidly after incorporation into the genome.

Title: A novel k -mer set memory (KSM) motif representation improves regulatory variant prediction
Authors: Yuchun Guo, Kevin Tian, Haoyang Zeng, Xiaoyun Guo, David Kenneth Gifford
Date: 2018-06

Abstract:
The representation and discovery of transcription factor (TF) sequence binding specificities is critical for understanding gene regulatory networks and interpreting the impact of disease-associated noncoding genetic variants. We present a novel TF binding motif representation, the k -mer set memory (KSM), which consists of a set of aligned k -mers that are overrepresented at TF binding sites, and a new method called KMAC for de novo discovery of KSMs. We find that KSMs more accurately predict in vivo binding sites than position weight matrix (PWM) models and other more complex motif models across a large set of ChIP-seq experiments. Furthermore, KSMs outperform PWMs and more complex motif models in predicting in vitro binding sites. KMAC also identifies correct motifs in more experiments than five state-of-the-art motif discovery methods. In addition, KSM-derived features outperform both PWM and deep learning model derived sequence features in predicting differential regulatory activities of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) alleles. Finally, we have applied KMAC to 1600 ENCODE TF ChIP-seq data sets and created a public resource of KSM and PWM motifs. We expect that the KSM representation and KMAC method will be valuable in characterizing TF binding specificities and in interpreting the effects of noncoding genetic variations.

Title: Peak Scores Significantly Depend on the Relationships between Contextual Signals in ChIP-Seq Peaks
Authors: Oleg V. Vishnevsky, Andrey V. Bocharnikov, Elena V. Ignatieva
Date: 2024-01-13

Abstract:
Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by massively parallel DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq) is a central genome-wide method for in vivo analyses of DNA-protein interactions in various cellular conditions. Numerous studies have demonstrated the complex contextual organization of ChIP-seq peak sequences and the presence of binding sites for transcription factors in them. We assessed the dependence of the ChIP-seq peak score on the presence of different contextual signals in the peak sequences by analyzing these sequences from several ChIP-seq experiments using our fully enumerative GPU-based de novo motif discovery method, Argo_CUDA. Analysis revealed sets of significant IUPAC motifs corresponding to the binding sites of the target and partner transcription factors. For these ChIP-seq experiments, multiple regression models were constructed, demonstrating a significant dependence of the peak scores on the presence in the peak sequences of not only highly significant target motifs but also less significant motifs corresponding to the binding sites of the partner transcription factors. A significant correlation was shown between the presence of the target motifs FOXA2 and the partner motifs HNF4G, which found experimental confirmation in the scientific literature, demonstrating the important contribution of the partner transcription factors to the binding of the target transcription factor to DNA and, consequently, their important contribution to the peak score.

Date: 2024-07-10

Abstract:
Characterizing the binding preferences of transcription factors (TFs) in different cell types and conditions is key to understand how they orchestrate gene expression. Here, we develop TFscope, a machine learning approach that identifies sequence features explaining the binding differences observed between two ChIP-seq experiments targeting either the same TF in two conditions or two TFs with similar motifs (paralogous TFs). TFscope systematically investigates differences in the core motif, nucleotide environment and co-factor motifs, and provides the contribution of each key feature in the two experiments. TFscope was applied to > 305 ChIP-seq pairs, and several examples are discussed. The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s13059-024-03321-8.

Title: Discovery of a non-canonical GRHL1 binding site using deep convolutional and recurrent neural networks
Authors: Sebastian Proft, Janna Leiz, Udo Heinemann, Dominik Seelow, Kai M. Schmidt-Ott, Maria Rutkiewicz
Date: 2023-12-04

Abstract:
Transcription factors regulate gene expression by binding to transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs). Most models for predicting TFBSs are based on position weight matrices (PWMs), which require a specific motif to be present in the DNA sequence and do not consider interdependencies of nucleotides. Novel approaches such as Transcription Factor Flexible Models or recurrent neural networks consequently provide higher accuracies. However, it is unclear whether such approaches can uncover novel non-canonical, hitherto unexpected TFBSs relevant to human transcriptional regulation. In this study, we trained a convolutional recurrent neural network with HT-SELEX data for GRHL1 binding and applied it to a set of GRHL1 binding sites obtained from ChIP-Seq experiments from human cells. We identified 46 non-canonical GRHL1 binding sites, which were not found by a conventional PWM approach. Unexpectedly, some of the newly predicted binding sequences lacked the CNNG core motif, so far considered obligatory for GRHL1 binding. Using isothermal titration calorimetry, we experimentally confirmed binding between the GRHL1-DNA binding domain and predicted GRHL1 binding sites, including a non-canonical GRHL1 binding site. Mutagenesis of individual nucleotides revealed a correlation between predicted binding strength and experimentally validated binding affinity across representative sequences. This correlation was neither observed with a PWM-based nor another deep learning approach. Our results show that convolutional recurrent neural networks may uncover unanticipated binding sites and facilitate quantitative transcription factor binding predictions.

Title: Using methylation data to improve transcription factor binding prediction
Authors: Daniel Morgan, Dawn L. DeMeo, Kimberly Glass
Date: 2024-02-01

Abstract:
Modelling the regulatory mechanisms that determine cell fate, response to external perturbation, and disease state depends on measuring many factors, a task made more difficult by the plasticity of the epigenome. Scanning the genome for the sequence patterns defined by Position Weight Matrices (PWM) can be used to estimate transcription factor (TF) binding locations. However, this approach does not incorporate information regarding the epigenetic context necessary for TF binding. CpG methylation is an epigenetic mark influenced by environmental factors that is commonly assayed in human cohort studies. We developed a framework to score inferred TF binding locations using methylation data. We intersected motif locations identified using PWMs with methylation information captured in both whole-genome bisulfite sequencing and Illumina EPIC array data for six cell lines, scored motif locations based on these data, and compared with experimental data characterizing TF binding (ChIP-seq). We found that for most TFs, binding prediction improves using methylation-based scoring compared to standard PWM-scores. We also illustrate that our approach can be generalized to infer TF binding when methylation information is only proximally available, i.e . measured for nearby CpGs that do not directly overlap with a motif location. Overall, our approach provides a framework for inferring context-specific TF binding using methylation data. Importantly, the availability of DNA methylation data in existing patient populations provides an opportunity to use our approach to understand the impact of methylation on gene regulatory processes in the context of human disease.

Abstract:
We describe an effort (“Codebook”) to determine the sequence specificity of 332 putative and largely uncharacterized human transcription factors (TFs), as well as 61 control TFs. Nearly 5,000 independent experiments across multiple in vitro and in vivo assays produced motifs for just over half of the putative TFs analyzed (177, or 53%), of which most are unique to a single TF. The data highlight the extensive contribution of transposable elements to TF evolution, both in cis and trans , and identify tens of thousands of conserved, base-level binding sites in the human genome. The use of multiple assays provides an unprecedented opportunity to benchmark and analyze TF sequence specificity, function, and evolution, as further explored in accompanying manuscripts. 1,421 human TFs are now associated with a DNA binding motif. Extrapolation from the Codebook benchmarking, however, suggests that many of the currently known binding motifs for well-studied TFs may inaccurately describe the TF’s true sequence preferences.

Date: 2023-06-09

Abstract:
Gene expression changes are orchestrated by transcription factors (TFs), which bind to DNA to regulate gene expression. It remains surprisingly difficult to predict basic features of the transcriptional process, including in vivo TF occupancy. Existing thermodynamic models of TF function are often not concordant with experimental measurements, suggesting undiscovered biology. Here, we analyzed one of the most well-studied TFs, the yeast zinc cluster Gal4, constructed a Shea–Ackers thermodynamic model to describe its binding, and compared the results of this model to experimentally measured Gal4p binding in vivo . We found that at many promoters, the model predicted no Gal4p binding, yet substantial binding was observed. These outlier promoters lacked canonical binding motifs, and subsequent investigation revealed Gal4p binds unexpectedly to DNA sequences with high densities of its half site (CGG). We confirmed this novel mode of binding through multiple experimental and computational paradigms; we also found most other zinc cluster TFs we tested frequently utilize this binding mode, at 27% of their targets on average. Together, these results demonstrate a novel mode of binding where zinc clusters, the largest class of TFs in yeast, bind DNA sequences with high densities of half sites.

Title: ChIPulate: A comprehensive ChIP-seq simulation pipeline

Date: 2019-03

Abstract:
ChIP-seq (Chromatin Immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing) is a high-throughput technique to identify genomic regions that are bound in vivo by a particular protein, e.g., a transcription factor (TF). Biological factors, such as chromatin state, indirect and cooperative binding, as well as experimental factors, such as antibody quality, cross-linking, and PCR biases, are known to affect the outcome of ChIP-seq experiments. However, the relative impact of these factors on inferences made from ChIP-seq data is not entirely clear. Here, via a detailed ChIP-seq simulation pipeline, ChIPulate, we assess the impact of various biological and experimental sources of variation on several outcomes of a ChIP-seq experiment, viz., the recoverability of the TF binding motif, accuracy of TF-DNA binding detection, the sensitivity of inferred TF-DNA binding strength, and number of replicates needed to confidently infer binding strength. We find that the TF motif can be recovered despite poor and non-uniform extraction and PCR amplification efficiencies. The recovery of the motif is, however, affected to a larger extent by the fraction of sites that are either cooperatively or indirectly bound. Importantly, our simulations reveal that the number of ChIP-seq replicates needed to accurately measure in vivo occupancy at high-affinity sites is larger than the recommended community standards. Our results establish statistical limits on the accuracy of inferences of protein-DNA binding from ChIP-seq and suggest that increasing the mean extraction efficiency, rather than amplification efficiency, would better improve sensitivity. The source code and instructions for running ChIPulate can be found at https://github.com/vishakad/chipulate .

Authors: Robert Frömel, Julia Rühle, Aina Bernal Martinez, Chelsea Szu-Tu, Felix Pacheco Pastor, Rosa Martinez-Corral, Lars Velten
Date: 2025-06-12

Abstract:
During cellular differentiation, enhancers transform overlapping gradients of transcription factors (TFs) to highly specific gene expression patterns. However, the vast complexity of regulatory DNA impedes the identification of the underlying cis -regulatory rules. Here, we characterized 64,400 fully synthetic DNA sequences to bottom-up dissect design principles of cell-state-specific enhancers in the context of the differentiation of blood stem cells to seven myeloid lineages. Focusing on binding sites for 38 TFs and their pairwise interactions, we found that identical sites displayed both repressive and activating function as a consequence of cell state, site combinatorics, or simply predicted occupancy of a TF on an enhancer. Surprisingly, combinations of activating sites frequently neutralized one another or gained repressive function. These negative synergies convert quantitative imbalances in TF expression into binary activity patterns. We exploit this principle to automatically create enhancers with specificity to user-defined combinations of hematopoietic progenitor cell states from scratch.

Title: Canonical and single-cell Hi-C reveal distinct chromatin interaction sub-networks of mammalian transcription factors
Authors: Xiaoyan Ma, Daphne Ezer, Boris Adryan, Tim J. Stevens
Date: 2018-10-25

Abstract:
Transcription factor (TF) binding to regulatory DNA sites is a key determinant of cell identity within multi-cellular organisms and has been studied extensively in relation to site affinity and chromatin modifications. There has been a strong focus on the inference of TF-gene regulatory networks and TF-TF physical interaction networks. Here, we present a third type of TF network, the spatial network of co-localized TF binding sites within the three-dimensional genome. Using published canonical Hi-C data and single-cell genome structures, we assess the spatial proximity of a genome-wide array of potential TF-TF co-localizations in human and mouse cell lines. For individual TFs, the abundance of occupied binding sites shows a positive correspondence with their clustering in three dimensions, and this is especially apparent for weak TF binding sites and at enhancer regions. An analysis between different TF proteins identifies significantly proximal pairs, which are enriched in reported physical interactions. Furthermore, clustering of different TFs based on proximity enrichment identifies two partially segregated co-localization sub-networks, involving different TFs in different cell types. Using data from both human lymphoblastoid cells and mouse embryonic stem cells, we find that these sub-networks are enriched within, but not exclusive to, different chromosome sub-compartments that have been identified previously in Hi-C data. This suggests that the association of TFs within spatial networks is closely coupled to gene regulatory networks. This applies to both differentiated and undifferentiated cells and is a potential causal link between lineage-specific TF binding and chromosome sub-compartment segregation. The online version of this article (10.1186/s13059-018-1558-2) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.

Abstract:
Single-nucleotide variants that underlie phenotypic variation can affect chromatin occupancy of transcription factors (TFs). To delineate determinants of in vivo TF binding and chromatin accessibility, we introduce an approach that compares ChIP-seq and DNase-seq data sets from genetically divergent murine erythroid cell lines. The impact of discriminatory single-nucleotide variants on TF ChIP signal enables definition at single base resolution of in vivo binding characteristics of nuclear factors GATA1, TAL1, and CTCF. We further develop a facile complementary approach to more deeply test the requirements of critical nucleotide positions for TF binding by combining CRISPR-Cas9-mediated mutagenesis with ChIP and targeted deep sequencing. Finally, we extend our analytical pipeline to identify nearby contextual DNA elements that modulate chromatin binding by these three TFs, and to define sequences that impact kb-scale chromatin accessibility. Combined, our approaches reveal insights into the genetic basis of TF occupancy and their interplay with chromatin features.

Abstract:
Endometritis is an inflammatory disease that negatively influences fertility and is common in milk-producing cows. An in vitro model for bovine endometrial inflammation was used to identify enrichment of cis -acting regulatory elements in differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in the genome of in vitro-cultured primary bovine endometrial epithelial cells (bEECs) before and after treatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from E. coli , a key player in the development of endometritis. The enriched regulatory elements contain binding sites for transcription factors with established roles in inflammation and hypoxia including NFKB and Hif-1α. We further showed co-localization of certain enriched cis -acting regulatory motifs including ARNT, Hif-1α, and NRF1. Our results show an intriguing interplay between increased mRNA levels in LPS-treated bEECs of the mRNAs encoding the key transcription factors such as AHR, EGR2, and STAT1, whose binding sites were enriched in the DMRs. Our results demonstrate an extraordinary cis -regulatory complexity in these DMRs having binding sites for both inflammatory and hypoxia-dependent transcription factors. Obtained data using this in vitro model for bacterial-induced endometrial inflammation have provided valuable information regarding key transcription factors relevant for clinical endometritis in both cattle and humans.

Abstract:
A sequence motif representing the DNA-binding specificity of a transcription factor (TF) is commonly modelled with a positional weight matrix (PWM). Focusing on understudied human TFs, we processed results of 4,237 experiments for 394 TFs, assayed using five different experimental platforms. By human curation, we approved a subset of experiments that yielded consistent motifs across platforms and replicates, and evaluated quantitatively the cross-platform performance of PWMs obtained with ten motif discovery tools. Notably, nucleotide composition and information content are not correlated with motif performance and do not help in detecting underperformers, while motifs with low information content, in many cases, describe well the binding specificity assessed across different experimental platforms. By combining multiple PMWs into a random forest, we demonstrate the potential of accounting for multiple modes of TF binding. Finally, we present the Codebook Motif Explorer ( https://mex.autosome.org ), cataloguing motifs, benchmarking results, and the underlying experimental data.

Abstract:
Many eukaryotic transcription factors (TF) form homodimer or heterodimer complexes to regulate gene expression. Dimerization of BASIC LEUCINE ZIPPER (bZIP) TFs are critical for their functions, but the molecular mechanism underlying the DNA binding and functional specificity of homo- versus heterodimers remains elusive. To address this gap, we present the double DNA Affinity Purification-sequencing (dDAP-seq) technique that maps heterodimer binding sites on endogenous genomic DNA. Using dDAP-seq we profile twenty pairs of C/S1 bZIP heterodimers and S1 homodimers in Arabidopsis and show that heterodimerization significantly expands the DNA binding preferences of these TFs. Analysis of dDAP-seq binding sites reveals the function of bZIP9 in abscisic acid response and the role of bZIP53 heterodimer-specific binding in seed maturation. The C/S1 heterodimers show distinct preferences for the ACGT elements recognized by plant bZIPs and motifs resembling the yeast GCN4 cis -elements. This study demonstrates the potential of dDAP-seq in deciphering the DNA binding specificities of interacting TFs that are key for combinatorial gene regulation.

Title: Genome-Wide Mapping of the Escherichia coli PhoB Regulon Reveals Many Transcriptionally Inert, Intragenic Binding Sites
Authors: Devon M. Fitzgerald, Anne M. Stringer, Carol Smith, Pascal Lapierre, Joseph T. Wade
Date: 2023-04-17

Abstract:
Genome-scale analyses have revealed many transcription factor binding sites within, rather than upstream of, genes, raising questions as to the function of these binding sites. Here, we use complementary approaches to map the regulon of the Escherichia coli transcription factor PhoB, a response regulator that controls transcription of genes involved in phosphate homeostasis. Strikingly, the majority of PhoB binding sites are located within genes, but these intragenic sites are not associated with detectable transcription regulation and are not evolutionarily conserved. Many intragenic PhoB sites are located in regions bound by H-NS, likely due to shared sequence preferences of PhoB and H-NS. However, these PhoB binding sites are not associated with transcription regulation even in the absence of H-NS. We propose that for many transcription factors, including PhoB, binding sites not associated with promoter sequences are transcriptionally inert and hence are tolerated as genomic “noise.”

Title: Functional Diversification of Paralogous Transcription Factors via Divergence in DNA Binding Site Motif and in Expression
Authors: Larry N. Singh, Sridhar Hannenhalli
Date: 2008

Abstract:
Gene duplication is a major driver of evolutionary innovation as it allows for an organism to elaborate its existing biological functions via specialization or diversification of initially redundant gene paralogs. Gene function can diversify in several ways. Transcription factor gene paralogs in particular, can diversify either by changes in their tissue-specific expression pattern or by changes in the DNA binding site motif recognized by their protein product, which in turn alters their gene targets. The relationship between these two modes of functional diversification of transcription factor paralogs has not been previously investigated, and is essential for understanding adaptive evolution of transcription factor gene families. Based on a large set of human paralogous transcription factor pairs, we show that when the DNA binding site motifs of transcription factor paralogs are similar, the expressions of the genes that encode the paralogs have diverged, so in general, at most one of the paralogs is highly expressed in a tissue. Moreover, paralogs with diverged DNA binding site motifs tend to be diverged in their function. Conversely, two paralogs that are highly expressed in a tissue tend to have dissimilar DNA binding site motifs. We have also found that in general, within a paralogous family, tissue-specific decrease in gene expression is more frequent than what is expected by chance. While previous investigations of paralogous gene diversification have only considered coding sequence divergence, by explicitly quantifying divergence in DNA binding site motif, our work presents a new paradigm for investigating functional diversification. Consistent with evolutionary expectation, our quantitative analysis suggests that paralogous transcription factors have survived extinction in part, either through diversification of their DNA binding site motifs or through alterations in their tissue-specific expression levels.

Abstract:
Free-living bacteria adapt to environmental change by reprogramming gene expression through precise interactions of hundreds of DNA-binding proteins. A predictive understanding of bacterial physiology requires us to globally monitor all such protein–DNA interactions across a range of environmental and genetic perturbations. Here, we show that such global observations are possible using an optimized version of in vivo protein occupancy display technology (in vivo protein occupancy display—high resolution, IPOD-HR) and present a pilot application to Escherichia coli . We observe that the E . coli protein–DNA interactome organizes into 2 distinct prototypic features: ( 1 ) highly dynamic condition-dependent transcription factor (TF) occupancy; and ( 2 ) robust kilobase scale occupancy by nucleoid factors, forming silencing domains analogous to eukaryotic heterochromatin. We show that occupancy dynamics across a range of conditions can rapidly reveal the global transcriptional regulatory organization of a bacterium. Beyond discovery of previously hidden regulatory logic, we show that these observations can be utilized to computationally determine sequence specificity models for the majority of active TFs. Our study demonstrates that global observations of protein occupancy combined with statistical inference can rapidly and systematically reveal the transcriptional regulatory and structural features of a bacterial genome. This capacity is particularly crucial for non-model bacteria that are not amenable to routine genetic manipulation.

Abstract:
Advances in DNA sequencing have revolutionized our ability to read genomes. However, even in the most well-studied of organisms, the bacterium Escherichia coli , for ≈65% of promoters we remain ignorant of their regulation. Until we crack this regulatory Rosetta Stone, efforts to read and write genomes will remain haphazard. We introduce a new method, Reg-Seq, that links massively parallel reporter assays with mass spectrometry to produce a base pair resolution dissection of more than a E. coli promoters in 12 growth conditions. We demonstrate that the method recapitulates known regulatory information. Then, we examine regulatory architectures for more than 80 promoters which previously had no known regulatory information. In many cases, we also identify which transcription factors mediate their regulation. This method clears a path for highly multiplexed investigations of the regulatory genome of model organisms, with the potential of moving to an array of microbes of ecological and medical relevance.

Abstract:
Chromatin accessibility is integral to the process by which transcription factors (TFs) read out cis -regulatory DNA sequences, but it is difficult to differentiate between TFs that drive accessibility and those that do not. Deep learning models that learn complex sequence rules provide an unprecedented opportunity to dissect this problem. Using zygotic genome activation in Drosophila as a model, we analyzed high-resolution TF binding and chromatin accessibility data with interpretable deep learning and performed genetic validation experiments. We identify a hierarchical relationship between the pioneer TF Zelda and the TFs involved in axis patterning. Zelda consistently pioneers chromatin accessibility proportional to motif affinity, whereas patterning TFs augment chromatin accessibility in sequence contexts where they mediate enhancer activation. We conclude that chromatin accessibility occurs in two tiers: one through pioneering, which makes enhancers accessible but not necessarily active, and the second when the correct combination of TFs leads to enhancer activation.

Title: MD-SVM: a novel SVM-based algorithm for the motif discovery of transcription factor binding sites

Abstract:
Transcription factors (TFs) play important roles in the regulation of gene expression. They can activate or block transcription of downstream genes in a manner of binding to specific genomic sequences. Therefore, motif discovery of these binding preference patterns is of central significance in the understanding of molecular regulation mechanism. Many algorithms have been proposed for the identification of transcription factor binding sites. However, it remains a challengeable problem. Here, we proposed a novel motif discovery algorithm based on support vector machine (MD-SVM) to learn a discriminative model for TF binding sites. MD-SVM firstly obtains position weight matrix (PWM) from a set of training datasets. Then it translates the MD problem into a computational framework of multiple instance learning (MIL). It was applied to several real biological datasets. Results show that our algorithm outperforms MI-SVM in terms of both accuracy and specificity. In this paper, we modeled the TF motif discovery problem as a MIL optimization problem. The SVM algorithm was adapted to discriminate positive and negative bags of instances. Compared to other svm-based algorithms, MD-SVM show its superiority over its competitors in term of ROC AUC. Hopefully, it could be of benefit to the research community in the understanding of molecular functions of DNA functional elements and transcription factors.

Title: Flanking sequence context-dependent transcription factor binding in early Drosophila development
Authors: Jessica L Stringham, Adam S Brown, Robert A Drewell, Jacqueline M Dresch
Date: 2013

Abstract:
Gene expression in the Drosophila embryo is controlled by functional interactions between a large network of protein transcription factors (TFs) and specific sequences in DNA cis -regulatory modules (CRMs). The binding site sequences for any TF can be experimentally determined and represented in a position weight matrix (PWM). PWMs can then be used to predict the location of TF binding sites in other regions of the genome, although there are limitations to this approach as currently implemented. In this proof-of-principle study, we analyze 127 CRMs and focus on four TFs that control transcription of target genes along the anterio-posterior axis of the embryo early in development. For all four of these TFs, there is some degree of conserved flanking sequence that extends beyond the predicted binding regions. A potential role for these conserved flanking sequences may be to enhance the specificity of TF binding, as the abundance of these sequences is greatly diminished when we examine only predicted high-affinity binding sites. Expanding PWMs to include sequence context-dependence will increase the information content in PWMs and facilitate a more efficient functional identification and dissection of CRMs.

Title: A General Pairwise Interaction Model Provides an Accurate Description of In Vivo Transcription Factor Binding Sites
Authors: Marc Santolini, Thierry Mora, Vincent Hakim
Date: 2014

Abstract:
The identification of transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) on genomic DNA is of crucial importance for understanding and predicting regulatory elements in gene networks. TFBS motifs are commonly described by Position Weight Matrices (PWMs), in which each DNA base pair contributes independently to the transcription factor (TF) binding. However, this description ignores correlations between nucleotides at different positions, and is generally inaccurate: analysing fly and mouse in vivo ChIPseq data, we show that in most cases the PWM model fails to reproduce the observed statistics of TFBSs. To overcome this issue, we introduce the pairwise interaction model (PIM), a generalization of the PWM model. The model is based on the principle of maximum entropy and explicitly describes pairwise correlations between nucleotides at different positions, while being otherwise as unconstrained as possible. It is mathematically equivalent to considering a TF-DNA binding energy that depends additively on each nucleotide identity at all positions in the TFBS, like the PWM model, but also additively on pairs of nucleotides. We find that the PIM significantly improves over the PWM model, and even provides an optimal description of TFBS statistics within statistical noise. The PIM generalizes previous approaches to interdependent positions: it accounts for co-variation of two or more base pairs, and predicts secondary motifs, while outperforming multiple-motif models consisting of mixtures of PWMs. We analyse the structure of pairwise interactions between nucleotides, and find that they are sparse and dominantly located between consecutive base pairs in the flanking region of TFBS. Nonetheless, interactions between pairs of non-consecutive nucleotides are found to play a significant role in the obtained accurate description of TFBS statistics. The PIM is computationally tractable, and provides a general framework that should be useful for describing and predicting TFBSs beyond PWMs.

Abstract:
The transcriptional response driven by Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) is central to the adaptation to oxygen restriction. Despite recent characterization of genome-wide HIF DNA binding locations and hypoxia-regulated transcripts in different cell types, the molecular bases of HIF target selection remain unresolved. Herein, we combined multi-level experimental data and computational predictions to identify sequence motifs that may contribute to HIF target selectivity. We obtained a core set of bona fide HIF binding regions by integrating multiple HIF1 DNA binding and hypoxia expression profiling datasets. This core set exhibits evolutionarily conserved binding regions and is enriched in functional responses to hypoxia. Computational prediction of enriched transcription factor binding sites identified sequence motifs corresponding to several stress-responsive transcription factors, such as activator protein 1 (AP1), cAMP response element-binding (CREB), or CCAAT-enhancer binding protein (CEBP). Experimental validations on HIF-regulated promoters suggest a functional role of the identified motifs in modulating HIF-mediated transcription. Accordingly, transcriptional targets of these factors are over-represented in a sorted list of hypoxia-regulated genes. Altogether, our results implicate cooperativity among stress-responsive transcription factors in fine-tuning the HIF transcriptional response.

Title: Genome‐wide off‐rates reveal how DNA binding dynamics shape transcription factor function
Authors: Wim J de Jonge, Mariël Brok, Philip Lijnzaad, Patrick Kemmeren, Frank CP Holstege
Date: 2020-10-14

Abstract:
Protein– DNA interactions are dynamic, and these dynamics are an important aspect of chromatin‐associated processes such as transcription or replication. Due to a lack of methods to study on‐ and off‐rates across entire genomes, protein– DNA interaction dynamics have not been studied extensively. Here, we determine in vivo off‐rates for the Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromatin organizing factor Abf1, at 191 sites simultaneously across the yeast genome. Average Abf1 residence times span a wide range, varying between 4.2 and 33 min. Sites with different off‐rates are associated with different functional characteristics. This includes their transcriptional dependency on Abf1, nucleosome positioning and the size of the nucleosome‐free region, as well as the ability to roadblock RNA polymerase II for termination. The results show how off‐rates contribute to transcription factor function and that DIVORSEQ (Determining In Vivo Off‐Rates by SEQ uencing) is a meaningful way of investigating protein– DNA binding dynamics genome‐wide.

Title: Leveraging the MethMotif Toolkit to Characterize Context‐Specific Features and Roles of Methylation Sensitive Transcription Factors
Authors: Matthew Dyer, Gastongay Siu, Denis Thieffry, Touati Benoukraf
Date: 2025-04-25

Abstract:
This article presents a comprehensive guide for using the MethMotif platform, which includes the MethMotif database, the TFregulomeR R package, and a new R library, Forked‐TF, designed specifically for analyzing leucine‐zipper transcription factors (TFs) that bind DNA as dimers. The MethMotif platform integrates transcription factor binding site (TFBS) motifs with DNA methylation profiles, providing an in‐depth analysis of how methylation modulates TF binding across different cell types and conditions. The protocols are organized into three main workflows: (1) Exploration of transcription factor dimerization partners, (2) visualization of methylation‐specific TF motifs using TFregulomeR, and (3) characterization of leucine‐zipper TF binding patterns with a focus on dimerization. Using the platform's MethMotif database, users can retrieve ChIP‐seq and DNA methylation data, intersect TFBS peak regions, and generate TFBS‐methylation‐informed motif logos. A case study of CEBPB in K562 cells is included to demonstrate the use of the platform, showing how to identify TF dimers, analyze their co‐binding behavior, and visualize the impact of DNA methylation on binding specificity. The protocols also provide step‐by‐step instructions for software installation, data input formats, and interpretation of results, making it accessible to researchers with varying levels of computational expertise. Through these protocols, users can uncover how DNA methylation and TF dimerization influence gene regulatory networks, with a focus on leucine‐zipper TFs in a cell‐type‐specific context. © 2025 The Author(s).

Title: Inferring intra-motif dependencies of DNA binding sites from ChIP-seq data
Authors: Ralf Eggeling, Teemu Roos, Petri Myllymäki, Ivo Grosse
Date: 2015-11-09

Abstract:
Statistical modeling of transcription factor binding sites is one of the classical fields in bioinformatics. The position weight matrix (PWM) model, which assumes statistical independence among all nucleotides in a binding site, used to be the standard model for this task for more than three decades but its simple assumptions are increasingly put into question. Recent high-throughput sequencing methods have provided data sets of sufficient size and quality for studying the benefits of more complex models. However, learning more complex models typically entails the danger of overfitting, and while model classes that dynamically adapt the model complexity to data have been developed, effective model selection is to date only possible for fully observable data, but not, e.g., within de novo motif discovery. To address this issue, we propose a stochastic algorithm for performing robust model selection in a latent variable setting. This algorithm yields a solution without relying on hyperparameter-tuning via massive cross-validation or other computationally expensive resampling techniques. Using this algorithm for learning inhomogeneous parsimonious Markov models, we study the degree of putative higher-order intra-motif dependencies for transcription factor binding sites inferred via de novo motif discovery from ChIP-seq data. We find that intra-motif dependencies are prevalent and not limited to first-order dependencies among directly adjacent nucleotides, but that second-order models appear to be the significantly better choice. The traditional PWM model appears to be indeed insufficient to infer realistic sequence motifs, as it is on average outperformed by more complex models that take into account intra-motif dependencies. Moreover, using such models together with an appropriate model selection procedure does not lead to a significant performance loss in comparison with the PWM model for any of the studied transcription factors. Hence, we find it worthwhile to recommend that any modern motif discovery algorithm should attempt to take into account intra-motif dependencies.

Title: Assessing phylogenetic motif models for predicting transcription factor binding sites
Authors: John Hawkins, Charles Grant, William Stafford Noble, Timothy L. Bailey
Date: 2009-06-15

Abstract:
Motivation: A variety of algorithms have been developed to predict transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) within the genome by exploiting the evolutionary information implicit in multiple alignments of the genomes of related species. One such approach uses an extension of the standard position-specific motif model that incorporates phylogenetic information via a phylogenetic tree and a model of evolution. However, these phylogenetic motif models (PMMs) have never been rigorously benchmarked in order to determine whether they lead to better prediction of TFBSs than obtained using simple position weight matrix scanning. Results: We evaluate three PMM-based prediction algorithms, each of which uses a different treatment of gapped alignments, and we compare their prediction accuracy with that of a non-phylogenetic motif scanning approach. Surprisingly, all of these algorithms appear to be inferior to simple motif scanning, when accuracy is measured using a gold standard of validated yeast TFBSs. However, the PMM scanners perform much better than simple motif scanning when we abandon the gold standard and consider the number of statistically significant sites predicted, using column-shuffled ‘random’ motifs to measure significance. These results suggest that the common practice of measuring the accuracy of binding site predictors using collections of known sites may be dangerously misleading since such collections may be missing ‘weak’ sites, which are exactly the type of sites needed to discriminate among predictors. We then extend our previous theoretical model of the statistical power of PMM-based prediction algorithms to allow for loss of binding sites during evolution, and show that it gives a more accurate upper bound on scanner accuracy. Finally, utilizing our theoretical model, we introduce a new method for predicting the number of real binding sites in a genome. The results suggest that the number of true sites for a yeast TF is in general several times greater than the number of known sites listed in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Database (SCPD). Among the three scanning algorithms that we test, the MONKEY algorithm has the highest accuracy for predicting yeast TFBSs. Contact:  j.hawkins@imb.uq.edu.au

Title: Degenerate Pax2 and Senseless binding motifs improve detection of low-affinity sites required for enhancer specificity
Authors: Arya Zandvakili, Ian Campbell, Lisa M. Gutzwiller, Matthew T. Weirauch, Brian Gebelein
Date: 2018-04-04

Abstract:
Cells use thousands of regulatory sequences to recruit transcription factors (TFs) and produce specific transcriptional outcomes. Since TFs bind degenerate DNA sequences, discriminating functional TF binding sites (TFBSs) from background sequences represents a significant challenge. Here, we show that a Drosophila regulatory element that activates Epidermal Growth Factor signaling requires overlapping, low-affinity TFBSs for competing TFs (Pax2 and Senseless) to ensure cell- and segment-specific activity. Testing available TF binding models for Pax2 and Senseless, however, revealed variable accuracy in predicting such low-affinity TFBSs. To better define parameters that increase accuracy, we developed a method that systematically selects subsets of TFBSs based on predicted affinity to generate hundreds of position-weight matrices (PWMs). Counterintuitively, we found that degenerate PWMs produced from datasets depleted of high-affinity sequences were more accurate in identifying both low- and high-affinity TFBSs for the Pax2 and Senseless TFs. Taken together, these findings reveal how TFBS arrangement can be constrained by competition rather than cooperativity and that degenerate models of TF binding preferences can improve identification of biologically relevant low affinity TFBSs.

Title: Mechanisms of Binding Specificity among bHLH Transcription Factors
Authors: Xabier de Martin, Reza Sodaei, Gabriel Santpere
Date: 2021-08-24

Abstract:
The transcriptome of every cell is orchestrated by the complex network of interaction between transcription factors (TFs) and their binding sites on DNA. Disruption of this network can result in many forms of organism malfunction but also can be the substrate of positive natural selection. However, understanding the specific determinants of each of these individual TF-DNA interactions is a challenging task as it requires integrating the multiple possible mechanisms by which a given TF ends up interacting with a specific genomic region. These mechanisms include DNA motif preferences, which can be determined by nucleotide sequence but also by DNA’s shape; post-translational modifications of the TF, such as phosphorylation; and dimerization partners and co-factors, which can mediate multiple forms of direct or indirect cooperative binding. Binding can also be affected by epigenetic modifications of putative target regions, including DNA methylation and nucleosome occupancy. In this review, we describe how all these mechanisms have a role and crosstalk in one specific family of TFs, the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH), with a very conserved DNA binding domain and a similar DNA preferred motif, the E-box. Here, we compile and discuss a rich catalog of strategies used by bHLH to acquire TF-specific genome-wide landscapes of binding sites.

Title: The orientation of transcription factor binding site motifs in gene promoter regions: does it matter?
Authors: Monika Lis, Dirk Walther
Date: 2016-03-03

Abstract:
Gene expression is to large degree regulated by the specific binding of protein transcription factors to cis-regulatory transcription factor binding sites in gene promoter regions. Despite the identification of hundreds of binding site sequence motifs, the question as to whether motif orientation matters with regard to the gene expression regulation of the respective downstream genes appears surprisingly underinvestigated. We pursued a statistical approach by probing 293 reported non-palindromic transcription factor binding site and ten core promoter motifs in Arabidopsis thaliana for evidence of any relevance of motif orientation based on mapping statistics and effects on the co-regulation of gene expression of the respective downstream genes. Although positional intervals closer to the transcription start site (TSS) were found with increased frequencies of motifs exhibiting orientation preference, a corresponding effect with regard to gene expression regulation as evidenced by increased co-expression of genes harboring the favored orientation in their upstream sequence could not be established. Furthermore, we identified an intrinsic orientational asymmetry of sequence regions close to the TSS as the likely source of the identified motif orientation preferences. By contrast, motif presence irrespective of orientation was found associated with pronounced effects on gene expression co-regulation validating the pursued approach. Inspecting motif pairs revealed statistically preferred orientational arrangements, but no consistent effect with regard to arrangement-dependent gene expression regulation was evident. Our results suggest that for the motifs considered here, either no specific orientation rendering them functional across all their instances exists with orientational requirements instead depending on gene-locus specific additional factors, or that the binding orientation of transcription factors may generally not be relevant, but rather the event of binding itself.

Title: Interpreting regulatory mechanisms of Hippo signaling through a deep learning sequence model
Authors: Khyati Dalal, Charles McAnany, Melanie Weilert, Mary Cathleen McKinney, Sabrina Krueger, Julia Zeitlinger
Date: 2025-04-09

Abstract:
Signaling pathway components are well studied, but how they mediate cell-type-specific transcription responses is an unresolved problem. Using the Hippo pathway in mouse trophoblast stem cells as a model, we show that the DNA binding of signaling effectors is driven by cell-type-specific sequence rules that can be learned genome wide by deep learning models. Through model interpretation and experimental validation, we show that motifs for the cell-type-specific transcription factor TFAP2C enhance TEAD4/YAP1 binding in a nucleosome-range and distance-dependent manner, driving synergistic enhancer activation. We also discovered that Tead double motifs are widespread, highly active canonical response elements. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that TEAD4 binds them cooperatively through surprisingly labile protein-protein interactions that depend on the DNA template. These results show that the response to signaling pathways is encoded in the cis -regulatory sequences and that interpreting the rules reveals insights into the mechanisms by which signaling effectors influence cell-type-specific enhancer activity.

Abstract:
Transcription factors (TFs) are proteins that promote or reduce the expression of genes by binding short genomic DNA sequences known as transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). While several tools have been developed to scan for potential occurrences of TFBS in linear DNA sequences or reference genomes, no tool exists to find them in pangenome variation graphs (VGs). VGs are sequence-labelled graphs that can efficiently encode collections of genomes and their variants in a single, compact data structure. Because VGs can losslessly compress large pangenomes, TFBS scanning in VGs can efficiently capture how genomic variation affects the potential binding landscape of TFs in a population of individuals. Here we present GRAFIMO (GRAph-based Finding of Individual Motif Occurrences), a command-line tool for the scanning of known TF DNA motifs represented as Position Weight Matrices (PWMs) in VGs. GRAFIMO extends the standard PWM scanning procedure by considering variations and alternative haplotypes encoded in a VG. Using GRAFIMO on a VG based on individuals from the 1000 Genomes project we recover several potential binding sites that are enhanced, weakened or missed when scanning only the reference genome, and which could constitute individual-specific binding events. GRAFIMO is available as an open-source tool, under the MIT license, at https://github.com/pinellolab/GRAFIMO and https://github.com/InfOmics/GRAFIMO .

Date: 2023-09-08

Abstract:
Transcription factors (TFs) are proteins that affect gene expression by binding to regulatory regions of DNA in a sequence specific manner. The binding of TFs to DNA is controlled by many factors, including the DNA sequence, concentration of TF, chromatin accessibility and co-factors. Here, we systematically investigated the binding mechanism of hundreds of TFs by analysing ChIP-seq data with our explainable statistical model, ChIPanalyser. This tool uses as inputs the DNA sequence binding motif; the capacity to distinguish between strong and weak binding sites; the concentration of TF; and chromatin accessibility. We found that approximately one third of TFs are predicted to bind the genome in a DNA accessibility independent fashion, which includes TFs that can open the chromatin, their co-factors and TFs with similar motifs. Our model predicted this to be the case when the TF binds to its strongest binding regions in the genome, and only a small number of TFs have the capacity to bind dense chromatin at their weakest binding regions, such as CTCF, USF2 and CEBPB. Our study demonstrated that the binding of hundreds of human and mouse TFs is predicted by ChIPanalyser with high accuracy and showed that many TFs can bind dense chromatin.

Title: CTF: a CRF-based transcription factor binding sites finding system
Authors: Yupeng He, Yizhe Zhang, Guangyong Zheng, Chaochun Wei
Date: 2012

Abstract:
Identifying the location of transcription factor bindings is crucial to understand transcriptional regulation. Currently, Chromatin Immunoprecipitation followed with high-throughput Sequencing (ChIP-seq) is able to locate the transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) accurately in high throughput and it has become the gold-standard method for TFBS finding experimentally. However, due to its high cost, it is impractical to apply the method in a very large scale. Considering the large number of transcription factors, numerous cell types and various conditions, computational methods are still very valuable to accurate TFBS identification. In this paper, we proposed a novel integrated TFBS prediction system, CTF, based on Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) . Integrating information from different sources, CTF was able to capture patterns of TFBSs contained in different features (sequence, chromatin and etc) and predicted the TFBS locations with a high accuracy. We compared CTF with several existing tools as well as the PWM baseline method on a dataset generated by ChIP-seq experiments (TFBSs of 13 transcription factors in mouse genome). Results showed that CTF performed significantly better than existing methods tested. CTF is a powerful tool to predict TFBSs by integrating high throughput data and different features. It can be a useful complement to ChIP-seq and other experimental methods for TFBS identification and thus improve our ability to investigate functional elements in post-genomic era.

Title: Transcription factor-binding k -mer analysis clarifies the cell type dependency of binding specificities and cis-regulatory SNPs in humans
Authors: Saeko Tahara, Takaho Tsuchiya, Hirotaka Matsumoto, Haruka Ozaki
Date: 2023-10-07

Abstract:
Transcription factors (TFs) exhibit heterogeneous DNA-binding specificities in individual cells and whole organisms under natural conditions, and de novo motif discovery usually provides multiple motifs, even from a single chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) sample. Despite the accumulation of ChIP-seq data and ChIP-seq-derived motifs, the diversity of DNA-binding specificities across different TFs and cell types remains largely unexplored. Here, we applied MOCCS2, our k -mer-based motif discovery method, to a collection of human TF ChIP-seq samples across diverse TFs and cell types, and systematically computed profiles of TF-binding specificity scores for all k -mers. After quality control, we compiled a set of TF-binding specificity score profiles for 2,976 high-quality ChIP-seq samples, comprising 473 TFs and 398 cell types. Using these high-quality samples, we confirmed that the k -mer-based TF-binding specificity profiles reflected TF- or TF-family dependent DNA-binding specificities. We then compared the binding specificity scores of ChIP-seq samples with the same TFs but with different cell type classes and found that half of the analyzed TFs exhibited differences in DNA-binding specificities across cell type classes. Additionally, we devised a method to detect differentially bound k -mers between two ChIP-seq samples and detected k -mers exhibiting statistically significant differences in binding specificity scores. Moreover, we demonstrated that differences in the binding specificity scores between k -mers on the reference and alternative alleles could be used to predict the effect of variants on TF binding, as validated by in vitro and in vivo assay datasets. Finally, we demonstrated that binding specificity score differences can be used to interpret disease-associated non-coding single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as TF-affecting SNPs and provide candidates responsible for TFs and cell types.

Abstract:
Deep learning has become an essential tool for identifying transcription factor (TF) binding sites, yet conventional approaches often struggle with limited training data for specific TFs. Here, we introduce QTFPred (Quantum-based TF Predictor), a quantum-classical hybrid framework that integrates quantum convolutional layers within neural networks to predict TF binding at base resolution. By leveraging the exponential feature space offered by quantum circuits and training from scratch via GPU simulation, QTFPred achieves robust performance even in data-sparse scenarios. In benchmarks on 49 Encyclopedia of DNA elements ChIP-seq datasets, QTFPred delivered state-of-the-art accuracy in 92% of binary prediction and 96% of signal prediction tasks, outperforming conventional models in precision and stability. Moreover, the method reveals underlying TF motif representations, offering insights into cooperative binding mechanisms. These results highlight the potential of quantum machine learning to overcome the limitations of traditional deep learning in genomics modeling.

Title: Genome access is transcription factor-specific and defined by nucleosome position
Authors: Ralph Stefan Grand, Marco Pregnolato, Lisa Baumgartner, Leslie Hoerner, Lukas Burger, Dirk Schübeler
Date: 2024-09-19

Abstract:
Mammalian gene expression is controlled by transcription factors (TFs) that engage sequence motifs in a chromatinized genome, where nucleosomes can restrict DNA access. Yet, how nucleosomes affect individual TFs remains unclear. Here, we measure the ability of over one hundred TF motifs to recruit TFs in a defined chromosomal locus in mouse embryonic stem cells. This identifies a set sufficient to enable the binding of TFs with diverse tissue specificities, functions, and DNA-binding domains. These chromatin-competent factors are further classified when challenged to engage motifs within a highly phased nucleosome. The pluripotency factors OCT4-SOX2 preferentially engage non-nucleosomal and entry-exit motifs, but not nucleosome-internal sites, a preference that also guides binding genome wide. By contrast, factors such as BANP, REST, or CTCF engage throughout, causing nucleosomal displacement. This supports that TFs vary widely in their sensitivity to nucleosomes and that genome access is TF specific and influenced by nucleosome position in the cell.

Title: Evolution of binding preferences among whole-genome duplicated transcription factors
Authors: Tamar Gera, Felix Jonas, Roye More, Naama Barkai, Christian R Landry
Date: 2022-04-11

Abstract:
Throughout evolution, new transcription factors (TFs) emerge by gene duplication, promoting growth and rewiring of transcriptional networks. How TF duplicates diverge was studied in a few cases only. To provide a genome-scale view, we considered the set of budding yeast TFs classified as whole-genome duplication (WGD)-retained paralogs (~35% of all specific TFs). Using high-resolution profiling, we find that ~60% of paralogs evolved differential binding preferences. We show that this divergence results primarily from variations outside the DNA-binding domains (DBDs), while DBD preferences remain largely conserved. Analysis of non-WGD orthologs revealed uneven splitting of ancestral preferences between duplicates, and the preferential acquiring of new targets by the least conserved paralog (biased neo/sub-functionalization). Interactions between paralogs were rare, and, when present, occurred through weak competition for DNA-binding or dependency between dimer-forming paralogs. We discuss the implications of our findings for the evolutionary design of transcriptional networks.

Title: BertSNR: an interpretable deep learning framework for single-nucleotide resolution identification of transcription factor binding sites based on DNA language model
Authors: Hanyu Luo, Li Tang, Min Zeng, Rui Yin, Pingjian Ding, Lingyun Luo, Min Li
Date: 2024-08

Abstract:
Transcription factors are pivotal in the regulation of gene expression, and accurate identification of transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) at high resolution is crucial for understanding the mechanisms underlying gene regulation. The task of identifying TFBSs from DNA sequences is a significant challenge in the field of computational biology today. To address this challenge, a variety of computational approaches have been developed. However, these methods face limitations in their ability to achieve high-resolution identification and often lack interpretability. We propose BertSNR, an interpretable deep learning framework for identifying TFBSs at single-nucleotide resolution. BertSNR integrates sequence-level and token-level information by multi-task learning based on pre-trained DNA language models. Benchmarking comparisons show that our BertSNR outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods in TFBS predictions. Importantly, we enhanced the interpretability of the model through attentional weight visualization and motif analysis, and discovered the subtle relationship between attention weight and motif. Moreover, BertSNR effectively identifies TFBSs in promoter regions, facilitating the study of intricate gene regulation. The BertSNR source code can be found at https://github.com/lhy0322/BertSNR .

Title: A Structural-Based Strategy for Recognition of Transcription Factor Binding Sites
Authors: Beisi Xu, Dustin E. Schones, Yongmei Wang, Haojun Liang, Guohui Li
Date: 2013

Abstract:
Scanning through genomes for potential transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) is becoming increasingly important in this post-genomic era. The position weight matrix (PWM) is the standard representation of TFBSs utilized when scanning through sequences for potential binding sites. However, many transcription factor (TF) motifs are short and highly degenerate, and methods utilizing PWMs to scan for sites are plagued by false positives. Furthermore, many important TFs do not have well-characterized PWMs, making identification of potential binding sites even more difficult. One approach to the identification of sites for these TFs has been to use the 3D structure of the TF to predict the DNA structure around the TF and then to generate a PWM from the predicted 3D complex structure. However, this approach is dependent on the similarity of the predicted structure to the native structure. We introduce here a novel approach to identify TFBSs utilizing structure information that can be applied to TFs without characterized PWMs, as long as a 3D complex structure (TF/DNA) exists. This approach utilizes an energy function that is uniquely trained on each structure. Our approach leads to increased prediction accuracy and robustness compared with those using a more general energy function. The software is freely available upon request.

Abstract:
ChIP-Seq is widely used to detect genomic segments bound by transcription factors (TF), either directly at DNA binding sites (BSs) or indirectly via other proteins. Currently, there are many software tools implementing different approaches to identify TFBSs within ChIP-Seq peaks. However, their use for the interpretation of ChIP-Seq data is usually complicated by the absence of direct experimental verification, making it difficult both to set a threshold to avoid recognition of too many false-positive BSs, and to compare the actual performance of different models. Using ChIP-Seq data for FoxA2 binding loci in mouse adult liver and human HepG2 cells we compared FoxA binding-site predictions for four computational models of two fundamental classes: pattern matching based on existing training set of experimentally confirmed TFBSs (oPWM and SiteGA) and de novo motif discovery (ChIPMunk and diChIPMunk). To properly select prediction thresholds for the models, we experimentally evaluated affinity of 64 predicted FoxA BSs using EMSA that allows safely distinguishing sequences able to bind TF. As a result we identified thousands of reliable FoxA BSs within ChIP-Seq loci from mouse liver and human HepG2 cells. It was found that the performance of conventional position weight matrix (PWM) models was inferior with the highest false positive rate. On the contrary, the best recognition efficiency was achieved by the combination of SiteGA & diChIPMunk/ChIPMunk models, properly identifying FoxA BSs in up to 90% of loci for both mouse and human ChIP-Seq datasets. The experimental study of TF binding to oligonucleotides corresponding to predicted sites increases the reliability of computational methods for TFBS-recognition in ChIP-Seq data analysis. Regarding ChIP-Seq data interpretation, basic PWMs have inferior TFBS recognition quality compared to the more sophisticated SiteGA and de novo motif discovery methods. A combination of models from different principles allowed identification of proper TFBSs.

Abstract:
A long-standing challenge in human regulatory genomics is that transcription factor (TF) DNA-binding motifs are short and degenerate, while the genome is large. Motif scans therefore produce many false-positive binding site predictions. By surveying 179 TFs across 25 families using >1,500 cyclic in vitro selection experiments with fragmented, naked, and unmodified genomic DNA – a method we term GHT-SELEX (Genomic HT-SELEX) – we find that many human TFs possess much higher sequence specificity than anticipated. Moreover, genomic binding regions from GHT-SELEX are often surprisingly similar to those obtained in vivo (i.e. ChIP-seq peaks). We find that comparable specificity can also be obtained from motif scans, but performance is highly dependent on derivation and use of the motifs, including accounting for multiple local matches in the scans. We also observe alternative engagement of multiple DNA-binding domains within the same protein: long C2H2 zinc finger proteins often utilize modular DNA recognition, engaging different subsets of their DNA binding domain (DBD) arrays to recognize multiple types of distinct target sites, frequently evolving via internal duplication and divergence of one or more DBDs. Thus, contrary to conventional wisdom, it is common for TFs to possess sufficient intrinsic specificity to independently delineate cellular targets.

Title: PRISM offers a comprehensive genomic approach to transcription factor function prediction
Authors: Aaron M. Wenger, Shoa L. Clarke, Harendra Guturu, Jenny Chen, Bruce T. Schaar, Cory Y. McLean, Gill Bejerano
Date: 2013-05

Abstract:
The human genome encodes 1500–2000 different transcription factors (TFs). ChIP-seq is revealing the global binding profiles of a fraction of TFs in a fraction of their biological contexts. These data show that the majority of TFs bind directly next to a large number of context-relevant target genes, that most binding is distal, and that binding is context specific. Because of the effort and cost involved, ChIP-seq is seldom used in search of novel TF function. Such exploration is instead done using expression perturbation and genetic screens. Here we propose a comprehensive computational framework for transcription factor function prediction. We curate 332 high-quality nonredundant TF binding motifs that represent all major DNA binding domains, and improve cross-species conserved binding site prediction to obtain 3.3 million conserved, mostly distal, binding site predictions. We combine these with 2.4 million facts about all human and mouse gene functions, in a novel statistical framework, in search of enrichments of particular motifs next to groups of target genes of particular functions. Rigorous parameter tuning and a harsh null are used to minimize false positives. Our novel PRISM (predicting regulatory information from single motifs) approach obtains 2543 TF function predictions in a large variety of contexts, at a false discovery rate of 16%. The predictions are highly enriched for validated TF roles, and 45 of 67 (67%) tested binding site regions in five different contexts act as enhancers in functionally matched cells.

Title: Motif models proposing independent and interdependent impacts of nucleotides are related to high and low affinity transcription factor binding sites in Arabidopsis
Authors: Anton V. Tsukanov, Victoria V. Mironova, Victor G. Levitsky
Date: 2022-07-28

Abstract:
Position weight matrix (PWM) is the traditional motif model representing the transcription factor (TF) binding sites. It proposes that the positions contribute independently to TFs binding affinity, although this hypothesis does not fit the data perfectly. This explains why PWM hits are missing in a substantial fraction of ChIP-seq peaks. To study various modes of the direct binding of plant TFs, we compiled the benchmark collection of 111 ChIP-seq datasets for Arabidopsis thaliana , and applied the traditional PWM, and two alternative motif models BaMM and SiteGA, proposing the dependencies of the positions. The variation in the stringency of the recognition thresholds for the models proposed that the hits of PWM, BaMM, and SiteGA models are associated with the sites of high/medium, any, and low affinity, respectively. At the medium recognition threshold, about 60% of ChIP-seq peaks contain PWM hits consisting of conserved core consensuses, while BaMM and SiteGA provide hits for an additional 15% of peaks in which a weaker core consensus is compensated through intra-motif dependencies. The presence/absence of these dependencies in the motifs of alternative/traditional models was confirmed by the dependency logo DepLogo visualizing the position-wise partitioning of the alignments of predicted sites. We exemplify the detailed analysis of ChIP-seq profiles for plant TFs CCA1, MYC2, and SEP3. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis revealed that among the three motif models, the SiteGA had the highest portions of genes with the significantly enriched GO terms among all predicted genes. We showed that both alternative motif models provide for traditional PWM greater extensions in predicted sites for TFs MYC2/SEP3 with condition/tissue specific functions, compared to those for TF CCA1 with housekeeping functions. Overall, the combined application of standard and alternative motif models is beneficial to detect various modes of the direct TF-DNA interactions in the maximal portion of ChIP-seq loci.

Date: 2025-08-07

Abstract:
Transcription factors (TFs) recognizing DNA motifs within regulatory regions drive cell identity. Despite recent advances, their specificity remains incompletely understood. Here, we address this by contrasting two TFs, Neurogenin-2 (NGN2) and MyoD1, which recognize ubiquitous E-box motifs yet drive distinct cell fates toward neurons and muscles, respectively. Upon induction in mouse embryonic stem cells, we monitor binding across differentiation, employing an interpretable machine learning approach that integrates preexisting DNA accessibility. This reveals a chromatin-dependent motif syntax, delineating both common and factor-specific binding, validated by cellular and in vitro assays. Shared binding sites reside in open chromatin, locally influenced by nucleosomes. In contrast, factor-specific binding in closed chromatin involves NGN2 and MyoD1 acting as pioneer factors, influenced by motif variant frequencies, motif spacing, and interaction partners, which together account for subsequent lineage divergence. Transferring our methodology to other models demonstrates how a combination of opportunistic binding and context-specific chromatin-opening underpin TF specificity, driving differentiation trajectories.

Title: Modulation of protein-DNA binding reveals mechanisms of spatiotemporal gene control in early Drosophila embryos
Authors: Sahla Syed, Yifei Duan, Bomyi Lim, Job Dekker
Date: 2023-11-07

Abstract:
It is well known that enhancers regulate the spatiotemporal expression of their target genes by recruiting transcription factors (TFs) to the cognate binding sites in the region. However, the role of multiple binding sites for the same TFs and their specific spatial arrangement in determining the overall competency of the enhancer has yet to be fully understood. In this study, we utilized the MS2-MCP live imaging technique to quantitatively analyze the regulatory logic of the snail distal enhancer in early Drosophila embryos. Through systematic modulation of Dorsal and Twist binding motifs in this enhancer, we found that a mutation in any one of these binding sites causes a drastic reduction in transcriptional amplitude, resulting in a reduction in mRNA production of the target gene. We provide evidence of synergy, such that multiple binding sites with moderate affinities cooperatively recruit more TFs to drive stronger transcriptional activity than a single site. Moreover, a Hidden Markov-based stochastic model of transcription reveals that embryos with mutated binding sites have a higher probability of returning to the inactive promoter state. We propose that TF-DNA binding regulates spatial and temporal gene expression and drives robust pattern formation by modulating transcriptional kinetics and tuning bursting rates.

Abstract:
Notch signaling controls many developmental processes by regulating gene expression. Notch-dependent enhancers recruit activation complexes consisting of the Notch intracellular domain, the C bf/ S u(H)/ L ag1 (CSL) transcription factor (TF), and the Mastermind co-factor via two types of DNA sites: monomeric CSL sites and cooperative dimer sites called S u(H) p aired s ites (SPS). Intriguingly, the CSL TF can also bind co-repressors to negatively regulate transcription via these same sites. Here, we tested how synthetic enhancers with monomeric CSL sites versus dimeric SPSs bind Drosophila Su(H) complexes in vitro and mediate transcriptional outcomes in vivo . Our findings reveal that while the Su(H)/Hairless co-repressor complex similarly binds SPS and CSL sites in an additive manner, the Notch activation complex binds SPSs, but not CSL sites, in a cooperative manner. Moreover, transgenic reporters with SPSs mediate stronger, more consistent transcription and are more resistant to increased Hairless co-repressor expression compared to reporters with the same number of CSL sites. These findings support a model in which SPS containing enhancers preferentially recruit cooperative Notch activation complexes over Hairless repression complexes to ensure consistent target gene activation.

Abstract:
BTB (bric-a-brack, Tramtrack, and broad complex) is a diverse group of protein-protein interaction domains found within metazoan proteins. Transcription factors contain a dimerizing BTB subtype with a characteristic N-terminal extension. The Tramtrack group (TTK) is a distinct type of BTB domain, which can multimerize. Single-particle cryo-EM microscopy revealed that the TTK-type BTB domains assemble into a hexameric structure consisting of three canonical BTB dimers connected through a previously uncharacterized interface. We demonstrated that the TTK-type BTB domains are found only in Arthropods and have undergone lineage-specific expansion in modern insects. The Drosophila genome encodes 24 transcription factors with TTK-type BTB domains, whereas only four have non-TTK-type BTB domains. Yeast two-hybrid analysis revealed that the TTK-type BTB domains have an unusually broad potential for heteromeric associations presumably through a dimer-dimer interaction interface. Thus, the TTK-type BTB domains are a structurally and functionally distinct group of protein domains specific to Arthropodan transcription factors.

Authors: Tingting Wang, Wenju Sun, Ligang Fan, Canfeng Hua, Nan Wu, Shaorong Fan, Jilin Zhang, Xin Deng, Jian Yan
Date: 2021-03-29

Abstract:
A high-throughput systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment assay was applied to 371 putative TFs in Pseudomonas aeruginosa , which resulted in the robust enrichment of 199 unique sequence motifs describing the binding specificities of 182 TFs. By scanning the genome, we predicted in total 33,709 significant interactions between TFs and their target loci, which were more than 11-fold enriched in the intergenic regions but depleted in the gene body regions. To further explore and delineate the physiological and pathogenic roles of TFs in P. aeruginosa , we constructed regulatory networks for nine major virulence-associated pathways and found that 51 TFs were potentially significantly associated with these virulence pathways, 32 of which had not been characterized before, and some were even involved in multiple pathways. These results will significantly facilitate future studies on transcriptional regulation in P. aeruginosa and other relevant pathogens, and accelerate to discover effective treatment and prevention strategies for the associated infectious diseases.

Abstract:
Pseudomonas syringae is a Gram-negative and model pathogenic bacterium that causes plant diseases worldwide. Here, we set out to identify binding motifs for all 301 annotated transcription factors (TFs) of P. syringae using HT-SELEX. We successfully identify binding motifs for 100 TFs. We map functional interactions between the TFs and their targets in virulence-associated pathways, and validate many of these interactions and functions using additional methods such as ChIP-seq, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), RT-qPCR, and reporter assays. Our work identifies 25 virulence-associated master regulators, 14 of which had not been characterized as TFs before.

Title: A general integrative genomic feature transcription factor binding site prediction method applied to analysis of USF1 binding in cardiovascular disease
Authors: Tianyuan Wang, Terrence S Furey, Jessica J Connelly, Shihao Ji, Sarah Nelson, Steffen Heber, Simon G Gregory, Elizabeth R Hauser
Date: 2009

Abstract:
Transcription factors are key mediators of human complex disease processes. Identifying the target genes of transcription factors will increase our understanding of the biological network leading to disease risk. The prediction of transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) is one method to identify these target genes; however, current prediction methods need improvement. We chose the transcription factor upstream stimulatory factor l ( USF1 ) to evaluate the performance of our novel TFBS prediction method because of its known genetic association with coronary artery disease (CAD) and the recent availability of USF1 chromatin immunoprecipitation microarray (ChIP-chip) results. The specific goals of our study were to develop a novel and accurate genome-scale method for predicting USF1 binding sites and associated target genes to aid in the study of CAD. Previously published USF1 ChIP-chip data for 1 per cent of the genome were used to develop and evaluate several kernel logistic regression prediction models. A combination of genomic features (phylogenetic conservation, regulatory potential, presence of a CpG island and DNaseI hypersensitivity), as well as position weight matrix (PWM) scores, were used as variables for these models. Our most accurate predictor achieved an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve of 0.827 during cross-validation experiments, significantly outperforming standard PWM-based prediction methods. When applied to the whole human genome, we predicted 24,010 USF1 binding sites within 5 kilobases upstream of the transcription start site of 9,721 genes. These predictions included 16 of 20 genes with strong evidence of USF1 regulation. Finally, in the spirit of genomic convergence, we integrated independent experimental CAD data with these USF1 binding site prediction results to develop a prioritised set of candidate genes for future CAD studies. We have shown that our novel prediction method, which employs genomic features related to the presence of regulatory elements, enables more accurate and efficient prediction of USF1 binding sites. This method can be extended to other transcription factors identified in human disease studies to help further our understanding of the biology of complex disease.

Title: Beyond Trees: Regulons and Regulatory Motif Characterization
Authors: Xuhua Xia
Date: 2020-08-25

Abstract:
Trees and their seeds regulate their germination, growth, and reproduction in response to environmental stimuli. These stimuli, through signal transduction, trigger transcription factors that alter the expression of various genes leading to the unfolding of the genetic program. A regulon is conceptually defined as a set of target genes regulated by a transcription factor by physically binding to regulatory motifs to accomplish a specific biological function, such as the CO-FT regulon for flowering timing and fall growth cessation in trees. Only with a clear characterization of regulatory motifs, can candidate target genes be experimentally validated, but motif characterization represents the weakest feature of regulon research, especially in tree genetics. I review here relevant experimental and bioinformatics approaches in characterizing transcription factors and their binding sites, outline problems in tree regulon research, and demonstrate how transcription factor databases can be effectively used to aid the characterization of tree regulons.

Title: A Network-Based Approach for Improving Annotation of Transcription Factor Functions and Binding Sites in Arabidopsis thaliana
Authors: Tanzira Najnin, Sakhawat Hossain Saimon, Garry Sunter, Jianhua Ruan
Date: 2023-01-21

Abstract:
Transcription factors are an integral component of the cellular machinery responsible for regulating many biological processes, and they recognize distinct DNA sequence patterns as well as internal/external signals to mediate target gene expression. The functional roles of an individual transcription factor can be traced back to the functions of its target genes. While such functional associations can be inferred through the use of binding evidence from high-throughput sequencing technologies available today, including chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, such experiments can be resource-consuming. On the other hand, exploratory analysis driven by computational techniques can alleviate this burden by narrowing the search scope, but the results are often deemed low-quality or non-specific by biologists. In this paper, we introduce a data-driven, statistics-based strategy to predict novel functional associations for transcription factors in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana . To achieve this, we leverage one of the largest available gene expression compendia to build a genome-wide transcriptional regulatory network and infer regulatory relationships among transcription factors and their targets. We then use this network to build a pool of likely downstream targets for each transcription factor and query each target pool for functionally enriched gene ontology terms. The results exhibited sufficient statistical significance to annotate most of the transcription factors in Arabidopsis with highly specific biological processes. We also perform DNA binding motif discovery for transcription factors based on their target pool. We show that the predicted functions and motifs strongly agree with curated databases constructed from experimental evidence. In addition, statistical analysis of the network revealed interesting patterns and connections between network topology and system-level transcriptional regulation properties. We believe that the methods demonstrated in this work can be extended to other species to improve the annotation of transcription factors and understand transcriptional regulation on a system level.

Title: Comparative analysis of binding patterns of MADS-domain proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana
Authors: Niels Aerts, Suzanne de Bruijn, Hilda van Mourik, Gerco C. Angenent, Aalt D. J. van Dijk
Date: 2018-06-25

Abstract:
Correct flower formation requires highly specific temporal and spatial regulation of gene expression. In Arabidopsis thaliana the majority of the master regulators that determine flower organ identity belong to the MADS-domain transcription factor family. The canonical DNA binding motif for this transcription factor family is the CArG-box, which has the consensus CC(A/T) 6 GG. However, so far, a comprehensive analysis of MADS-domain binding patterns has not yet been performed. Eight publicly available ChIP-seq datasets of MADS-domain proteins that regulate the floral transition and flower formation were analyzed. Surprisingly, the preferred DNA binding motif of each protein was a CArG-box with an NAA extension. Furthermore, motifs of other transcription factors were found in the vicinity of binding sites of MADS-domain transcription factors, suggesting that interaction of MADS-domain proteins with other transcription factors is important for target gene regulation. Finally, conservation of CArG-boxes between Arabidopsis ecotypes was assessed to obtain information about their evolutionary importance. CArG-boxes that fully matched the consensus were more conserved than other CArG-boxes, suggesting that the perfect CArG-box is evolutionary more important than other CArG-box variants.

Title: Prediction of cooperative homeodomain DNA binding sites from high-throughput-SELEX data

Abstract:
Homeodomain proteins constitute one of the largest families of metazoan transcription factors. Genetic studies have demonstrated that homeodomain proteins regulate many developmental processes. Yet, biochemical data reveal that most bind highly similar DNA sequences. Defining how homeodomain proteins achieve DNA binding specificity has therefore been a long-standing goal. Here, we developed a novel computational approach to predict cooperative dimeric binding of homeodomain proteins using High-Throughput (HT) SELEX data. Importantly, we found that 15 of 88 homeodomain factors form cooperative homodimer complexes on DNA sites with precise spacing requirements. Approximately one third of the paired-like homeodomain proteins cooperatively bind palindromic sequences spaced 3 bp apart, whereas other homeodomain proteins cooperatively bind sites with distinct orientation and spacing requirements. Combining structural models of a paired-like factor with our cooperativity predictions identified key amino acid differences that help differentiate between cooperative and non-cooperative factors. Finally, we confirmed predicted cooperative dimer sites in vivo using available genomic data for a subset of factors. These findings demonstrate how HT-SELEX data can be computationally mined to predict cooperativity. In addition, the binding site spacing requirements of select homeodomain proteins provide a mechanism by which seemingly similar AT-rich DNA sequences can preferentially recruit specific homeodomain factors.

Abstract:
A DNA sequence pattern, or “motif”, is an essential representation of DNA-binding specificity of a transcription factor (TF). Any particular motif model has potential flaws due to shortcomings of the underlying experimental data and computational motif discovery algorithm. As a part of the Codebook/GRECO-BIT initiative, here we evaluated at large scale the cross-platform recognition performance of positional weight matrices (PWMs), which remain popular motif models in many practical applications. We applied ten different DNA motif discovery tools to generate PWMs from the “Codebook” data comprised of 4,237 experiments from five different platforms profiling the DNA-binding specificity of 394 human proteins, focusing on understudied transcription factors of different structural families. For many of the proteins, there was no prior knowledge of a genuine motif. By benchmarking-supported human curation, we constructed an approved subset of experiments comprising about 30% of all experiments and 50% of tested TFs which displayed consistent motifs across platforms and replicates. We present the Codebook Motif Explorer ( https://mex.autosome.org ), a detailed online catalog of DNA motifs, including the top-ranked PWMs, and the underlying source and benchmarking data. We demonstrate that in the case of high-quality experimental data, most of the popular motif discovery tools detect valid motifs and generate PWMs, which perform well both on genomic and synthetic data. Yet, for each of the algorithms, there were problematic combinations of proteins and platforms, and the basic motif properties such as nucleotide composition and information content offered little help in detecting such pitfalls. By combining multiple PMWs in decision trees, we demonstrate how our setup can be readily adapted to train and test binding specificity models more complex than PWMs. Overall, our study provides a rich motif catalog as a solid baseline for advanced models and highlights the power of the multi-platform multi-tool approach for reliable mapping of DNA binding specificities.

Title: Reliable scaling of position weight matrices for binding strength comparisons between transcription factors
Authors: Xiaoyan Ma, Daphne Ezer, Carmen Navarro, Boris Adryan
Date: 2015-08-20

Abstract:
Scoring DNA sequences against Position Weight Matrices (PWMs) is a widely adopted method to identify putative transcription factor binding sites. While common bioinformatics tools produce scores that can reflect the binding strength between a specific transcription factor and the DNA, these scores are not directly comparable between different transcription factors. Other methods, including p-value associated approaches (Touzet H, Varré J-S. Efficient and accurate p-value computation for position weight matrices. Algorithms Mol Biol. 2007;2(1510.1186):1748–7188), provide more rigorous ways to identify potential binding sites, but their results are difficult to interpret in terms of binding energy, which is essential for the modeling of transcription factor binding dynamics and enhancer activities. Here, we provide two different ways to find the scaling parameter λ that allows us to infer binding energy from a PWM score. The first approach uses a PWM and background genomic sequence as input to estimate λ for a specific transcription factor, which we applied to show that λ distributions for different transcription factor families correspond with their DNA binding properties. Our second method can reliably convert λ between different PWMs of the same transcription factor, which allows us to directly compare PWMs that were generated by different approaches. These two approaches provide computationally efficient ways to scale PWM scores and estimate the strength of transcription factor binding sites in quantitative studies of binding dynamics. Their results are consistent with each other and previous reports in most of cases.

Title: A ChIP-Seq Benchmark Shows That Sequence Conservation Mainly Improves Detection of Strong Transcription Factor Binding Sites
Authors: Tony Håndstad, Morten Beck Rye, Finn Drabløs, Pål Sætrom
Date: 2011

Abstract:
Transcription factors are important controllers of gene expression and mapping transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) is key to inferring transcription factor regulatory networks. Several methods for predicting TFBS exist, but there are no standard genome-wide datasets on which to assess the performance of these prediction methods. Also, it is believed that information about sequence conservation across different genomes can generally improve accuracy of motif-based predictors, but it is not clear under what circumstances use of conservation is most beneficial. Here we use published ChIP-seq data and an improved peak detection method to create comprehensive benchmark datasets for prediction methods which use known descriptors or binding motifs to detect TFBS in genomic sequences. We use this benchmark to assess the performance of five different prediction methods and find that the methods that use information about sequence conservation generally perform better than simpler motif-scanning methods. The difference is greater on high-affinity peaks and when using short and information-poor motifs. However, if the motifs are specific and information-rich, we find that simple motif-scanning methods can perform better than conservation-based methods. Our benchmark provides a comprehensive test that can be used to rank the relative performance of transcription factor binding site prediction methods. Moreover, our results show that, contrary to previous reports, sequence conservation is better suited for predicting strong than weak transcription factor binding sites.

Title: Master regulator genes and their impact on major diseases
Authors: Wanwan Cai, Wanbang Zhou, Zhe Han, Junrong Lei, Jian Zhuang, Ping Zhu, Xiushan Wu, Wuzhou Yuan
Date: 2020-10-06

Abstract:
Master regulator genes (MRGs) have become a hot topic in recent decades. They not only affect the development of tissue and organ systems but also play a role in other signal pathways by regulating additional MRGs. Because a MRG can regulate the concurrent expression of several genes, its mutation often leads to major diseases. Moreover, the occurrence of many tumors and cardiovascular and nervous system diseases are closely related to MRG changes. With the development in omics technology, an increasing amount of investigations will be directed toward MRGs because their regulation involves all aspects of an organism’s development. This review focuses on the definition and classification of MRGs as well as their influence on disease regulation.

Title: Methylation-directed regulatory networks determine enhancing and silencing of mutation disease driver genes and explain inter-patient expression variation
Authors: Yifat Edrei, Revital Levy, Daniel Kaye, Anat Marom, Bernhard Radlwimmer, Asaf Hellman
Date: 2023-11-28

Abstract:
Common diseases manifest differentially between patients, but the genetic origin of this variation remains unclear. To explore possible involvement of gene transcriptional-variation, we produce a DNA methylation-oriented, driver-gene-wide dataset of regulatory elements in human glioblastomas and study their effect on inter-patient gene expression variation. In 175 of 177 analyzed gene regulatory domains, transcriptional enhancers and silencers are intermixed. Under experimental conditions, DNA methylation induces enhancers to alter their enhancing effects or convert into silencers, while silencers are affected inversely. High-resolution mapping of the association between DNA methylation and gene expression in intact genomes reveals methylation-related regulatory units (average size = 915.1 base-pairs). Upon increased methylation of these units, their target-genes either increased or decreased in expression. Gene-enhancing and silencing units constitute cis -regulatory networks of genes. Mathematical modeling of the networks highlights indicative methylation sites, which signified the effect of key regulatory units, and add up to make the overall transcriptional effect of the network. Methylation variation in these sites effectively describe inter-patient expression variation and, compared with DNA sequence-alterations, appears as a major contributor of gene-expression variation among glioblastoma patients. We describe complex cis -regulatory networks, which determine gene expression by summing the effects of positive and negative transcriptional inputs. In these networks, DNA methylation induces both enhancing and silencing effects, depending on the context. The revealed mechanism sheds light on the regulatory role of DNA methylation, explains inter-individual gene-expression variation, and opens the way for monitoring the driving forces behind deferential courses of cancer and other diseases.

Date: 2021-05-21

Abstract:
Many of the gene regulatory processes of Plasmodium falciparum , the deadliest malaria parasite, remain poorly understood. To develop a comprehensive guide for exploring this organism's gene regulatory network, we generated a systems-level model of P. falciparum gene regulation using a well-validated, machine-learning approach for predicting interactions between transcription regulators and their targets. The resulting network accurately predicts expression levels of transcriptionally coherent gene regulatory programs in independent transcriptomic data sets from parasites collected by different research groups in diverse laboratory and field settings. Thus, our results indicate that our gene regulatory model has predictive power and utility as a hypothesis-generating tool for illuminating clinically relevant gene regulatory mechanisms within P. falciparum . Using the set of regulatory programs we identified, we also investigated correlates of artemisinin resistance based on gene expression coherence. We report that resistance is associated with incoherent expression across many regulatory programs, including those controlling genes associated with erythrocyte-host engagement. These results suggest that parasite populations with reduced artemisinin sensitivity are more transcriptionally heterogenous. This pattern is consistent with a model where the parasite utilizes bet-hedging strategies to diversify the population, rendering a subpopulation more able to navigate drug treatment.

Title: Prevalence of and gene regulatory constraints on transcriptional adaptation in single cells
Authors: Ian A. Mellis, Madeline E. Melzer, Nicholas Bodkin, Yogesh Goyal
Date: 2024-08-12

Abstract:
Cells and tissues have a remarkable ability to adapt to genetic perturbations via a variety of molecular mechanisms. Nonsense-induced transcriptional compensation, a form of transcriptional adaptation, has recently emerged as one such mechanism, in which nonsense mutations in a gene trigger upregulation of related genes, possibly conferring robustness at cellular and organismal levels. However, beyond a handful of developmental contexts and curated sets of genes, no comprehensive genome-wide investigation of this behavior has been undertaken for mammalian cell types and conditions. How the regulatory-level effects of inherently stochastic compensatory gene networks contribute to phenotypic penetrance in single cells remains unclear. We analyze existing bulk and single-cell transcriptomic datasets to uncover the prevalence of transcriptional adaptation in mammalian systems across diverse contexts and cell types. We perform regulon gene expression analyses of transcription factor target sets in both bulk and pooled single-cell genetic perturbation datasets. Our results reveal greater robustness in expression of regulons of transcription factors exhibiting transcriptional adaptation compared to those of transcription factors that do not. Stochastic mathematical modeling of minimal compensatory gene networks qualitatively recapitulates several aspects of transcriptional adaptation, including paralog upregulation and robustness to mutation. Combined with machine learning analysis of network features of interest, our framework offers potential explanations for which regulatory steps are most important for transcriptional adaptation. Our integrative approach identifies several putative hits—genes demonstrating possible transcriptional adaptation—to follow-up on experimentally and provides a formal quantitative framework to test and refine models of transcriptional adaptation.

Title: Evolution of Regulated Transcription
Authors: Oleg V. Bylino, Airat N. Ibragimov, Yulii V. Shidlovskii
Date: 2020-07-12

Abstract:
The genomes of all organisms abound with various cis -regulatory elements, which control gene activity. Transcriptional enhancers are a key group of such elements in eukaryotes and are DNA regions that form physical contacts with gene promoters and precisely orchestrate gene expression programs. Here, we follow gradual evolution of this regulatory system and discuss its features in different organisms. In eubacteria, an enhancer-like element is often a single regulatory element, is usually proximal to the core promoter, and is occupied by one or a few activators. Activation of gene expression in archaea is accompanied by the recruitment of an activator to several enhancer-like sites in the upstream promoter region. In eukaryotes, activation of expression is accompanied by the recruitment of activators to multiple enhancers, which may be distant from the core promoter, and the activators act through coactivators. The role of the general DNA architecture in transcription control increases in evolution. As a whole, it can be seen that enhancers of multicellular eukaryotes evolved from the corresponding prototypic enhancer-like regulatory elements with the gradually increasing genome size of organisms.

Title: Deciphering the intricate hierarchical gene regulatory network: unraveling multi-level regulation and modifications driving secondary cell wall formation
Authors: Zhigang Wei, Hairong Wei
Date: 2024-02

Abstract:
Wood quality is predominantly determined by the amount and the composition of secondary cell walls (SCWs). Consequently, unraveling the molecular regulatory mechanisms governing SCW formation is of paramount importance for genetic engineering aimed at enhancing wood properties. Although SCW formation is known to be governed by a hierarchical gene regulatory network (HGRN), our understanding of how a HGRN operates and regulates the formation of heterogeneous SCWs for plant development and adaption to ever-changing environment remains limited. In this review, we examined the HGRNs governing SCW formation and highlighted the significant key differences between herbaceous Arabidopsis and woody plant poplar. We clarified many confusions in existing literatures regarding the HGRNs and their orthologous gene names and functions. Additionally, we revealed many network motifs including feed-forward loops, feed-back loops, and negative and positive autoregulation in the HGRNs. We also conducted a thorough review of post-transcriptional and post-translational aspects, protein–protein interactions, and epigenetic modifications of the HGRNs. Furthermore, we summarized how the HGRNs respond to environmental factors and cues, influencing SCW biosynthesis through regulatory cascades, including many regulatory chains, wiring regulations, and network motifs. Finally, we highlighted the future research directions for gaining a further understanding of molecular regulatory mechanisms underlying SCW formation.

Title: A convolutional neural network for the prediction and forward design of ribozyme-based gene-control elements
Authors: Calvin M Schmidt, Christina D Smolke
Date: 2021-04-16

Abstract:
Ribozyme switches are a class of RNA-encoded genetic switch that support conditional regulation of gene expression across diverse organisms. An improved elucidation of the relationships between sequence, structure, and activity can improve our capacity for de novo rational design of ribozyme switches. Here, we generated data on the activity of hundreds of thousands of ribozyme sequences. Using automated structural analysis and machine learning, we leveraged these large data sets to develop predictive models that estimate the in vivo gene-regulatory activity of a ribozyme sequence. These models supported the de novo design of ribozyme libraries with low mean basal gene-regulatory activities and new ribozyme switches that exhibit changes in gene-regulatory activity in the presence of a target ligand, producing functional switches for four out of five aptamers. Our work examines how biases in the model and the data set that affect prediction accuracy can arise and demonstrates that machine learning can be applied to RNA sequences to predict gene-regulatory activity, providing the basis for design tools for functional RNAs.

Authors: Anna Nagy-Staron, Kathrin Tomasek, Caroline Caruso Carter, Elisabeth Sonnleitner, Bor Kavčič, Tiago Paixão, Calin C Guet
Date: 2021-03-08

Abstract:
Gene expression levels are influenced by multiple coexisting molecular mechanisms. Some of these interactions such as those of transcription factors and promoters have been studied extensively. However, predicting phenotypes of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) remains a major challenge. Here, we use a well-defined synthetic GRN to study in Escherichia coli how network phenotypes depend on local genetic context, i.e. the genetic neighborhood of a transcription factor and its relative position. We show that one GRN with fixed topology can display not only quantitatively but also qualitatively different phenotypes, depending solely on the local genetic context of its components. Transcriptional read-through is the main molecular mechanism that places one transcriptional unit (TU) within two separate regulons without the need for complex regulatory sequences. We propose that relative order of individual TUs, with its potential for combinatorial complexity, plays an important role in shaping phenotypes of GRNs.

Authors: Mineto Ota, Jeffrey P. Spence, Tony Zeng, Emma Dann, Alexander Marson, Jonathan K. Pritchard
Date: 2025-01-24

Abstract:
Genetic association studies provide a unique tool for identifying causal links from genes to human traits and diseases. However, it is challenging to determine the biological mechanisms underlying most associations, and we lack genome-scale approaches for inferring causal mechanistic pathways from genes to cellular functions to traits. Here we propose new approaches to bridge this gap by combining quantitative estimates of gene-trait relationships from loss-of-function burden tests with gene-regulatory connections inferred from Perturb-seq experiments in relevant cell types. By combining these two forms of data, we aim to build causal graphs in which the directional associations of genes with a trait can be explained by their regulatory effects on biological programs or direct effects on the trait. As a proof-of-concept, we constructed a causal graph of the gene regulatory hierarchy that jointly controls three partially co-regulated blood traits. We propose that perturbation studies in trait-relevant cell types, coupled with gene-level effect sizes for traits, can bridge the gap between genetics and biology.

Date: 2022-01-18

Abstract:
Methods for time series prediction and classification of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) from gene expression data have been treated separately so far. The recent emergence of attention-based recurrent neural network (RNN) models boosted the interpretability of RNN parameters, making them appealing for the understanding of gene interactions. In this work, we generated synthetic time series gene expression data from a range of archetypal GRNs and we relied on a dual attention RNN to predict the gene temporal dynamics. We show that the prediction is extremely accurate for GRNs with different architectures. Next, we focused on the attention mechanism of the RNN and, using tools from graph theory, we found that its graph properties allow one to hierarchically distinguish different architectures of the GRN. We show that the GRN responded differently to the addition of noise in the prediction by the RNN and we related the noise response to the analysis of the attention mechanism. In conclusion, this work provides a way to understand and exploit the attention mechanism of RNNs and it paves the way to RNN-based methods for time series prediction and inference of GRNs from gene expression data.

Abstract:
Immune cells need to sustain a state of constant alertness over a lifetime. Yet, little is known about the regulatory processes that control the fluent and fragile balance that is called homeostasis. Here we demonstrate that JAK-STAT signaling, beyond its role in immune responses, is a major regulator of immune cell homeostasis. We investigated JAK-STAT-mediated transcription and chromatin accessibility across 12 mouse models, including knockouts of all STAT transcription factors and of the TYK2 kinase. Baseline JAK-STAT signaling was detected in CD8 + T cells and macrophages of unperturbed mice—but abrogated in the knockouts and in unstimulated immune cells deprived of their normal tissue context. We observed diverse gene-regulatory programs, including effects of STAT2 and IRF9 that were independent of STAT1. In summary, our large-scale dataset and integrative analysis of JAK-STAT mutant and wild-type mice uncovered a crucial role of JAK-STAT signaling in unstimulated immune cells, where it contributes to a poised epigenetic and transcriptional state and helps prepare these cells for rapid response to immune stimuli.

Title: Regulation of Flavonoid Biosynthesis by the MYB-bHLH-WDR (MBW) Complex in Plants and Its Specific Features in Cereals
Authors: Andrey N. Bulanov, Elena A. Andreeva, Natalia V. Tsvetkova, Pavel A. Zykin
Date: 2025-01-16

Abstract:
Flavonoids are a large group of secondary metabolites, which are responsible for pigmentation, signaling, protection from unfavorable environmental conditions, and other important functions, as well as providing numerous benefits for human health. Various stages of flavonoid biosynthesis are subject to complex regulation by three groups of transcription regulators—MYC-like bHLH, R2R3-MYB and WDR which form the MBW regulatory complex. We attempt to cover the main aspects of this intriguing regulatory system in plants, as well as to summarize information on their distinctive features in cereals. Published data revealed the following perspectives for further research: (1) In cereals, a large number of paralogs of MYC and MYB transcription factors are present, and their diversification has led to spatial and biochemical specialization, providing an opportunity to fine-tune the distribution and composition of flavonoid compounds; (2) Regulatory systems formed by MBW proteins in cereals possess distinctive features that are not yet fully understood and require further investigation; (3) Non-classical MB-EMSY-like complexes, WDR-independent MB complexes, and solely acting R2R3-MYB transcription factors are of particular interest for studying unique regulatory mechanisms in plants. More comprehensive understanding of flavonoid biosynthesis regulation will allow us to develop cereal varieties with the required flavonoid content and spatial distribution.

Title: Somatic mutations in early metazoan genes disrupt regulatory links between unicellular and multicellular genes in cancer
Authors: Anna S Trigos, Richard B Pearson, Anthony T Papenfuss, David L Goode
Date: 2019-02-26

Abstract:
Extensive transcriptional alterations are observed in cancer, many of which activate core biological processes established in unicellular organisms or suppress differentiation pathways formed in metazoans. Through rigorous, integrative analysis of genomics data from a range of solid tumors, we show many transcriptional changes in tumors are tied to mutations disrupting regulatory interactions between unicellular and multicellular genes within human gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Recurrent point mutations were enriched in regulator genes linking unicellular and multicellular subnetworks, while copy-number alterations affected downstream target genes in distinctly unicellular and multicellular regions of the GRN. Our results depict drivers of tumourigenesis as genes that created key regulatory links during the evolution of early multicellular life, whose dysfunction creates widespread dysregulation of primitive elements of the GRN. Several genes we identified as important in this process were associated with drug response, demonstrating the potential clinical value of our approach.

Title: The choreography of chromatin in RNA polymerase III regulation
Authors: Maria Elize van Breugel, Alan Gerber, Fred van Leeuwen
Date: 2024-06-26

Abstract:
Regulation of eukaryotic gene expression involves a dynamic interplay between the core transcriptional machinery, transcription factors, and chromatin organization and modification. While this applies to transcription by all RNA polymerase complexes, RNA polymerase III (RNAPIII) seems to be atypical with respect to its mechanisms of regulation. One distinctive feature of most RNAPIII transcribed genes is that they are devoid of nucleosomes, which relates to the high levels of transcription. Moreover, most of the regulatory sequences are not outside but within the transcribed open chromatin regions. Yet, several lines of evidence suggest that chromatin factors affect RNAPIII dynamics and activity and that gene sequence alone does not explain the observed regulation of RNAPIII. Here we discuss the role of chromatin modification and organization of RNAPIII transcribed genes and how they interact with the core transcriptional RNAPIII machinery and regulatory DNA elements in and around the transcribed genes.

Abstract:
Transition metals
function as structural and catalytic cofactors
for a large diversity of proteins and enzymes that collectively comprise
the metalloproteome. Metallostasis considers all cellular processes,
notably metal sensing, metalloproteome remodeling, and trafficking
(or allocation) of metals that collectively ensure the functional
integrity and adaptability of the metalloproteome. Bacteria employ
both protein and RNA-based mechanisms that sense intracellular transition
metal bioavailability and orchestrate systems-level outputs that maintain
metallostasis. In this review, we contextualize metallostasis by briefly
discussing the metalloproteome and specialized roles that metals play
in biology. We then offer a comprehensive perspective on the diversity
of metalloregulatory proteins and metal-sensing riboswitches, defining
general principles within each sensor superfamily that capture how
specificity is encoded in the sequence, and how selectivity can be
leveraged in downstream synthetic biology and biotechnology applications.
This is followed by a discussion of recent work that highlights selected
metalloregulatory outputs, including metalloproteome remodeling and
metal allocation by metallochaperones to both client proteins and
compartments. We close by briefly discussing places where more work
is needed to fill in gaps in our understanding of metallostasis.

Date: 2023-04

Abstract:
Identifying the causal interactions in gene-regulatory networks requires an accurate understanding of the time-lagged relationships between transcription factors and their target genes. Here we describe DELAY (short for De picting La gged Causalit y ), a convolutional neural network for the inference of gene-regulatory relationships across pseudotime-ordered single-cell trajectories. We show that combining supervised deep learning with joint probability matrices of pseudotime-lagged trajectories allows the network to overcome important limitations of ordinary Granger causality-based methods, for example, the inability to infer cyclic relationships such as feedback loops. Our network outperforms several common methods for inferring gene regulation and, when given partial ground-truth labels, predicts novel regulatory networks from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-cell ATAC sequencing (scATAC-seq) data sets. To validate this approach, we used DELAY to identify important genes and modules in the regulatory network of auditory hair cells, as well as likely DNA-binding partners for two hair cell cofactors (Hist1h1c and Ccnd1) and a novel binding sequence for the hair cell-specific transcription factor Fiz1. We provide an easy-to-use implementation of DELAY under an open-source license at https://github.com/calebclayreagor/DELAY .

Title: Decoding complexity: tackling the challenge of how many transcription factors regulate a plant gene
Authors: John Gray, Erich Grotewold
Date: 2025-06-25

Abstract:
The regulation of transcription is a major control point in the flow of information from the genome to the phenome. Central to this regulation are transcription factors (TFs), which bind specific DNA motifs in gene regulatory regions. In both metazoans and plants, 5–7% of all genes encode TFs. Although individual TFs can recognize and regulate thousands of target genes, an important question remains: how many TFs are required to precisely control the expression of a single gene? In this review, we compare the regulation of gene expression in plants and metazoans, outline key methodologies for identifying genes recognized or regulated by TFs, and explore what is currently known about the number of TFs needed to define the expression of any given plant gene. As the volume of high-throughput sequencing data continues to grow exponentially, it becomes increasingly clear that transcriptional regulatory networks exhibit remarkable complexity, characterized by many targets influenced by each TF; and that many TFs, often several dozens, contribute to the regulation of individual genes.

Abstract:
Here, we determined the relative importance of different transcriptional mechanisms in the genome-reduced bacterium Mycoplasma pneumoniae , by employing an array of experimental techniques under multiple genetic and environmental perturbations. Of the 143 genes tested (21% of the bacterium’s annotated proteins), only 55% showed an altered phenotype, highlighting the robustness of biological systems. We identified nine transcription factors (TFs) and their targets, representing 43% of the genome, and 16 regulators that indirectly affect transcription. Only 20% of transcriptional regulation is mediated by canonical TFs when responding to perturbations. Using a Random Forest, we quantified the non-redundant contribution of different mechanisms such as supercoiling, metabolic control, RNA degradation, and chromosome topology to transcriptional changes. Model-predicted gene changes correlate well with experimental data in 95% of the tested perturbations, explaining up to 70% of the total variance when also considering noise. This analysis highlights the importance of considering non-TF-mediated regulation when engineering bacteria.

Title: The read-through transcription-mediated autoactivation circuit for virulence regulator expression drives robust type III secretion system 2 expression in Vibrio parahaemolyticus

Abstract:
Vibrio parahaemolyticus is the leading cause of seafood-borne gastroenteritis in humans worldwide. The major virulence factor responsible for the enteropathogenicity of this pathogen is type III secretion system 2 (T3SS2), which is encoded on the 80-kb V . parahaemolyticus pathogenicity island (Vp-PAI), the gene expression of which is governed by the OmpR-family transcriptional regulator VtrB. Here, we found a positive autoregulatory feature of vtrB transcription, which is often observed with transcriptional regulators of bacteria, but the regulation was not canonically dependent on its own promoter. Instead, this autoactivation was induced by heterogeneous transcripts derived from the VtrB-regulated operon upstream of vtrB . VtrB-activated transcription overcame the intrinsic terminator downstream of the operon, resulting in transcription read-through with read-in transcription of the vtrB gene and thus completing the autoregulatory loop for vtrB gene expression. The dampening of read-through transcription with an exogenous strong terminator reduced vtrB gene expression. Furthermore, a V . parahaemolyticus mutant with defects in the vtrB autoregulatory loop also showed compromises in T3SS2 expression and T3SS2-dependent cytotoxicity in vitro and enterotoxicity in vivo , indicating that this autoregulatory loop is essential for sustained vtrB activation and the consequent robust expression of T3SS2 genes for pathogenicity. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the regulatory loop for vtrB gene expression based on read-through transcription from the upstream operon is a crucial pathway in T3SS2 gene regulatory network to ensure T3SS2-mediated virulence of V . parahaemolyticus .

Title: The Role of Transposable Elements of the Human Genome in Neuronal Function and Pathology
Authors: Ekaterina Chesnokova, Alexander Beletskiy, Peter Kolosov
Date: 2022-05-23

Abstract:
Transposable elements (TEs) have been extensively studied for decades. In recent years, the introduction of whole-genome and whole-transcriptome approaches, as well as single-cell resolution techniques, provided a breakthrough that uncovered TE involvement in host gene expression regulation underlying multiple normal and pathological processes. Of particular interest is increased TE activity in neuronal tissue, and specifically in the hippocampus, that was repeatedly demonstrated in multiple experiments. On the other hand, numerous neuropathologies are associated with TE dysregulation. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of literature about the role of TEs in neurons published over the last three decades. The first chapter of the present review describes known mechanisms of TE interaction with host genomes in general, with the focus on mammalian and human TEs; the second chapter provides examples of TE exaptation in normal neuronal tissue, including TE involvement in neuronal differentiation and plasticity; and the last chapter lists TE-related neuropathologies. We sought to provide specific molecular mechanisms of TE involvement in neuron-specific processes whenever possible; however, in many cases, only phenomenological reports were available. This underscores the importance of further studies in this area.

Title: Efficient approximations of transcriptional bursting effects on the dynamics of a gene regulatory network
Authors: Jochen Kursawe, Antoine Moneyron, Tobias Galla
Date: 2025-06

Abstract:
Mathematical models of gene regulatory networks are widely used to study cell fate changes and transcriptional regulation. When designing such models, it is important to accurately account for sources of stochasticity. However, doing so can be computationally expensive and analytically untractable, posing limits on the extent of our explorations and on parameter inference. Here, we explore this challenge using the example of a simple auto-negative feedback motif, in which we incorporate stochastic variation due to transcriptional bursting and noise from finite copy numbers. We find that transcriptional bursting may change the qualitative dynamics of the system by inducing oscillations when they would not otherwise be present, or by magnifying existing oscillations. We describe multiple levels of approximation for the model in the form of differential equations, piecewise-deterministic processes and stochastic differential equations. Importantly, we derive how the classical chemical Langevin equation can be extended to include a noise term representing transcriptional bursting. This approximation drastically decreases computation times and allows us to analytically calculate properties of the dynamics, such as their power spectrum. We explore when these approximations break down and provide recommendations for their use. Our analysis illustrates the importance of accounting for transcriptional bursting when simulating gene regulatory network dynamics and provides recommendations to do so with computationally efficient methods.

Title: Multi-modular structure of the gene regulatory network for specification and commitment of murine T cells
Authors: Boyoung Shin, Ellen V. Rothenberg
Date: 2023-01-31

Abstract:
T cells develop from multipotent progenitors by a gradual process dependent on intrathymic Notch signaling and coupled with extensive proliferation. The stages leading them to T-cell lineage commitment are well characterized by single-cell and bulk RNA analyses of sorted populations and by direct measurements of precursor-product relationships. This process depends not only on Notch signaling but also on multiple transcription factors, some associated with stemness and multipotency, some with alternative lineages, and others associated with T-cell fate. These factors interact in opposing or semi-independent T cell gene regulatory network (GRN) subcircuits that are increasingly well defined. A newly comprehensive picture of this network has emerged. Importantly, because key factors in the GRN can bind to markedly different genomic sites at one stage than they do at other stages, the genes they significantly regulate are also stage-specific. Global transcriptome analyses of perturbations have revealed an underlying modular structure to the T-cell commitment GRN, separating decisions to lose “stem-ness” from decisions to block alternative fates. Finally, the updated network sheds light on the intimate relationship between the T-cell program, which depends on the thymus, and the innate lymphoid cell (ILC) program, which does not.

Abstract:
Expression noise, the variability of the amount of gene product among isogenic cells grown in identical conditions, originates from the inherent stochasticity of diffusion and binding of the molecular players involved in transcription and translation. It has been shown that expression noise is an evolvable trait and that central genes exhibit less noise than peripheral genes in gene networks. A possible explanation for this pattern is increased selective pressure on central genes since they propagate their noise to downstream targets, leading to noise amplification. To test this hypothesis, we developed a new gene regulatory network model with inheritable stochastic gene expression and simulated the evolution of gene-specific expression noise under constraint at the network level. Stabilizing selection was imposed on the expression level of all genes in the network and rounds of mutation, selection, replication and recombination were performed. We observed that local network features affect both the probability to respond to selection, and the strength of the selective pressure acting on individual genes. In particular, the reduction of gene-specific expression noise as a response to stabilizing selection on the gene expression level is higher in genes with higher centrality metrics. Furthermore, global topological structures such as network diameter, centralization and average degree affect the average expression variance and average selective pressure acting on constituent genes. Our results demonstrate that selection at the network level leads to differential selective pressure at the gene level, and local and global network characteristics are an essential component of gene-specific expression noise evolution.

Abstract:
This work studies the effects of the two rounds of Whole Genome Duplication (WGD) at the origin of the vertebrate lineage on the architecture of the human gene regulatory networks. We integrate information on transcriptional regulation, miRNA regulation, and protein-protein interactions to comparatively analyse the role of WGD and Small Scale Duplications (SSD) in the structural properties of the resulting multilayer network. We show that complex network motifs, such as combinations of feed-forward loops and bifan arrays, deriving from WGD events are specifically enriched in the network. Pairs of WGD-derived proteins display a strong tendency to interact both with each other and with common partners and WGD-derived transcription factors play a prominent role in the retention of a strong regulatory redundancy. Combinatorial regulation and synergy between different regulatory layers are in general enhanced by duplication events, but the two types of duplications contribute in different ways. Overall, our findings suggest that the two WGD events played a substantial role in increasing the multi-layer complexity of the vertebrate regulatory network by enhancing its combinatorial organization, with potential consequences on its overall robustness and ability to perform high-level functions like signal integration and noise control. Lastly, we discuss in detail the RAR/RXR pathway as an illustrative example of the evolutionary impact of WGD duplications in human.

Abstract:
Climate change threatens global crop yield and food security due to rising temperatures, erratic rainfall, and increased abiotic stresses like drought, heat, and salinity. Gene editing technologies, including CRISPR/Cas9, base editors, and prime editors, offer precise tools for enhancing crop resilience. This review explores the mechanisms of these technologies and their applications in developing climate-resilient crops to address future challenges. While CRISPR/enables targeted modifications of plant DNA, the base editors allow for direct base conversion without inducing double-stranded breaks, and the prime editors enable precise insertions, deletions, and substitutions. By understanding and manipulating key regulator genes involved in stress responses, such as DREB, HSP, SOS, ERECTA, HsfA1, and NHX; crop tolerance can be enhanced against drought, heat, and salt stress. Gene editing can improve traits related to root development, water use efficiency, stress response pathways, heat shock response, photosynthesis, membrane stability, ion homeostasis, osmotic adjustment, and oxidative stress response. Advancements in gene editing technologies, integration with genomics, phenomics, artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML) hold great promise. However, challenges such as off-target effects, delivery methods, and regulatory barriers must be addressed. This review highlights the potential of gene editing to develop climate-resilient crops, contributing to food security and sustainable agriculture.

Title: Transcriptional co-activators: emerging roles in signaling pathways and potential therapeutic targets for diseases
Authors: Priyanka Dey Talukdar, Urmi Chatterji
Date: 2023-11-13

Abstract:
Specific cell states in metazoans are established by the symphony of gene expression programs that necessitate intricate synergic interactions between transcription factors and the co-activators. Deregulation of these regulatory molecules is associated with cell state transitions, which in turn is accountable for diverse maladies, including developmental disorders, metabolic disorders, and most significantly, cancer. A decade back most transcription factors, the key enablers of disease development, were historically viewed as ‘undruggable’; however, in the intervening years, a wealth of literature validated that they can be targeted indirectly through transcriptional co-activators, their confederates in various physiological and molecular processes. These co-activators, along with transcription factors, have the ability to initiate and modulate transcription of diverse genes necessary for normal physiological functions, whereby, deregulation of such interactions may foster tissue-specific disease phenotype. Hence, it is essential to analyze how these co-activators modulate specific multilateral processes in coordination with other factors. The proposed review attempts to elaborate an in-depth account of the transcription co-activators, their involvement in transcription regulation, and context-specific contributions to pathophysiological conditions. This review also addresses an issue that has not been dealt with in a comprehensive manner and hopes to direct attention towards future research that will encompass patient-friendly therapeutic strategies, where drugs targeting co-activators will have enhanced benefits and reduced side effects. Additional insights into currently available therapeutic interventions and the associated constraints will eventually reveal multitudes of advanced therapeutic targets aiming for disease amelioration and good patient prognosis.

Title: Gene network centrality analysis identifies key regulators coordinating day-night metabolic transitions in Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 despite limited accuracy in predicting direct regulator-gene interactions
Authors: Zachary Johnson, David Anderson, Margaret S. Cheung, Pavlo Bohutskyi
Date: 2025-03-26

Abstract:
Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 is a model organism for studying circadian regulation and bioproduction, where precise temporal control of metabolism significantly impacts photosynthetic efficiency and CO 2 -to-bioproduct conversion. Despite extensive research on core clock components, our understanding of the broader regulatory network orchestrating genome-wide metabolic transitions remains incomplete. We address this gap by applying machine learning tools and network analysis to investigate the transcriptional architecture governing circadian-controlled gene expression. While our approach showed moderate accuracy in predicting individual transcription factor-gene interactions - a common challenge with real expression data - network-level topological analysis successfully revealed the organizational principles of circadian regulation. Our analysis identified distinct regulatory modules coordinating day-night metabolic transitions, with photosynthesis and carbon/nitrogen metabolism controlled by day-phase regulators, while nighttime modules orchestrate glycogen mobilization and redox metabolism. Through network centrality analysis, we identified potentially significant but previously understudied transcriptional regulators: HimA as a putative DNA architecture regulator, and TetR and SrrB as potential coordinators of nighttime metabolism, working alongside established global regulators RpaA and RpaB. This work demonstrates how network-level analysis can extract biologically meaningful insights despite limitations in predicting direct regulatory interactions. The regulatory principles uncovered here advance our understanding of how cyanobacteria coordinate complex metabolic transitions and may inform metabolic engineering strategies for enhanced photosynthetic bioproduction from CO 2 .

Title: Robust partitioning of microRNA targets from downstream regulatory changes
Authors: Ravi K Patel, Jessica D West, Ya Jiang, Elizabeth A Fogarty, Andrew Grimson
Date: 2020-09-25

Abstract:
The biological impact of microRNAs (miRNAs) is determined by their targets, and robustly identifying direct miRNA targets remains challenging. Existing methods suffer from high false-positive rates and are unable to effectively differentiate direct miRNA targets from downstream regulatory changes. Here, we present an experimental and computational framework to deconvolute post-transcriptional and transcriptional changes using a combination of RNA-seq and PRO-seq. This novel approach allows us to systematically profile the regulatory impact of a miRNA. We refer to this approach as CARP: C ombined A nalysis of R NA-seq and P RO-seq. We apply CARP to multiple miRNAs and show that it robustly distinguishes direct targets from downstream changes, while greatly reducing false positives. We validate our approach using Argonaute eCLIP-seq and ribosome profiling, demonstrating that CARP defines a comprehensive repertoire of targets. Using this approach, we identify miRNA-specific activity of target sites within the open reading frame. Additionally, we show that CARP facilitates the dissection of complex changes in gene regulatory networks triggered by miRNAs and identification of transcription factors that mediate downstream regulatory changes. Given the robustness of the approach, CARP would be particularly suitable for dissecting miRNA regulatory networks in vivo .

Title: Inferring gene regulatory network from single-cell transcriptomes with graph autoencoder model
Authors: Jiacheng Wang, Yaojia Chen, Quan Zou, David Balding, Xiaojie Qiu, David Balding, David Balding
Date: 2023-09-13

Abstract:
The gene regulatory structure of cells involves not only the regulatory relationship between two genes, but also the cooperative associations of multiple genes. However, most gene regulatory network inference methods for single cell only focus on and infer the regulatory relationships of pairs of genes, ignoring the global regulatory structure which is crucial to identify the regulations in the complex biological systems. Here, we proposed a graph-based Deep learning model for Regulatory networks Inference among Genes (DeepRIG) from single-cell RNA-seq data. To learn the global regulatory structure, DeepRIG builds a prior regulatory graph by transforming the gene expression of data into the co-expression mode. Then it utilizes a graph autoencoder model to embed the global regulatory information contained in the graph into gene latent embeddings and to reconstruct the gene regulatory network. Extensive benchmarking results demonstrate that DeepRIG can accurately reconstruct the gene regulatory networks and outperform existing methods on multiple simulated networks and real-cell regulatory networks. Additionally, we applied DeepRIG to the samples of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and triple-negative breast cancer, and presented that DeepRIG can provide accurate cell-type-specific gene regulatory networks inference and identify novel regulators of progression and inhibition.

Abstract:
Cellular differentiation during hematopoiesis is guided by gene regulatory networks (GRNs) comprising transcription factors (TFs) and the effectors of cytokine signaling. Based largely on analyses conducted at steady state, these GRNs are thought to be organized as a hierarchy of bistable switches, with antagonism between Gata1 and PU.1 driving red- and white-blood cell differentiation. Here, we utilize transient gene expression patterns to infer the genetic architecture—the type and strength of regulatory interconnections—and dynamics of a twelve-gene GRN including key TFs and cytokine receptors. We trained gene circuits, dynamical models that learn genetic architecture, on high temporal-resolution gene-expression data from the differentiation of an inducible cell line into erythrocytes and neutrophils. The model is able to predict the consequences of gene knockout, knockdown, and overexpression experiments and the inferred interconnections are largely consistent with prior empirical evidence. The inferred genetic architecture is densely interconnected rather than hierarchical, featuring extensive cross-antagonism between genes from alternative lineages and positive feedback from cytokine receptors. The analysis of the dynamics of gene regulation in the model reveals that PU.1 is one of the last genes to be upregulated in neutrophil conditions and that the upregulation of PU.1 and other neutrophil genes is driven by Cebpa and Gfi1 instead. This model inference is confirmed in an independent single-cell RNA-Seq dataset from mouse bone marrow in which Cebpa and Gfi1 expression precedes the neutrophil-specific upregulation of PU.1 during differentiation. These results demonstrate that full PU.1 upregulation during neutrophil development involves regulatory influences extrinsic to the Gata1-PU.1 bistable switch. Furthermore, although there is extensive cross-antagonism between erythroid and neutrophil genes, it does not have a hierarchical structure. More generally, we show that the combination of high-resolution time series data and data-driven dynamical modeling can uncover the dynamics and causality of developmental events that might otherwise be obscured.

Title: BINDER: computationally inferring a gene regulatory network for Mycobacterium abscessus
Authors: Patrick M. Staunton, Aleksandra A. Miranda-CasoLuengo, Brendan J. Loftus, Isobel Claire Gormley
Date: 2019-09-10

Abstract:
Although many of the genic features in Mycobacterium abscessus have been fully validated, a comprehensive understanding of the regulatory elements remains lacking. Moreover, there is little understanding of how the organism regulates its transcriptomic profile, enabling cells to survive in hostile environments. Here, to computationally infer the gene regulatory network for Mycobacterium abscessus we propose a novel statistical computational modelling approach: BayesIan gene regulatory Networks inferreD via gene coExpression and compaRative genomics (BINDER). In tandem with derived experimental coexpression data, the property of genomic conservation is exploited to probabilistically infer a gene regulatory network in Mycobacterium abscessus .Inference on regulatory interactions is conducted by combining ‘primary’ and ‘auxiliary’ data strata. The data forming the primary and auxiliary strata are derived from RNA-seq experiments and sequence information in the primary organism Mycobacterium abscessus as well as ChIP-seq data extracted from a related proxy organism Mycobacterium tuberculosis . The primary and auxiliary data are combined in a hierarchical Bayesian framework, informing the apposite bivariate likelihood function and prior distributions respectively. The inferred relationships provide insight to regulon groupings in Mycobacterium abscessus . We implement BINDER on data relating to a collection of 167,280 regulator-target pairs resulting in the identification of 54 regulator-target pairs, across 5 transcription factors, for which there is strong probability of regulatory interaction. The inferred regulatory interactions provide insight to, and a valuable resource for further studies of, transcriptional control in Mycobacterium abscessus , and in the family of Mycobacteriaceae more generally. Further, the developed BINDER framework has broad applicability, useable in settings where computational inference of a gene regulatory network requires integration of data sources derived from both the primary organism of interest and from related proxy organisms.

Abstract:
Spike architecture influences both grain weight and grain number per spike, which are the two major components of grain yield in bread wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.). However, the complex wheat genome and the influence of various environmental factors pose challenges in mapping the causal genes that affect spike traits. Here, we systematically identified genes involved in spike trait formation by integrating information on genomic variation and gene regulatory networks controlling young spike development in wheat. We identified 170 loci that are responsible for variations in spike length, spikelet number per spike, and grain number per spike through genome-wide association study and meta-QTL analyses. We constructed gene regulatory networks for young inflorescences at the double ridge stage and the floret primordium stage, in which the spikelet meristem and the floret meristem are predominant, respectively, by integrating transcriptome, histone modification, chromatin accessibility, eQTL, and protein–protein interactome data. From these networks, we identified 169 hub genes located in 76 of the 170 QTL regions whose polymorphisms are significantly associated with variation in spike traits. The functions of TaZF-B1 , VRT-B2 , and TaSPL15-A/D in establishment of wheat spike architecture were verified. This study provides valuable molecular resources for understanding spike traits and demonstrates that combining genetic analysis and developmental regulatory networks is a robust approach for dissection of complex traits.

Title: Mapping integral cell-type-specific interferon-induced gene regulatory networks (GRNs) involved in systemic lupus erythematosus using systems and computational analysis
Authors: Blessy Kiruba, Akshayata Naidu, Vino Sundararajan, Sajitha Lulu S
Date: 2025-01-15

Abstract:
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a systemic autoimmune disorder characterized by the production of autoantibodies, resulting in inflammation and organ damage. Although extensive research has been conducted on SLE pathogenesis, a comprehensive understanding of its molecular landscape in different cell types has not been achieved. This study uncovers the molecular mechanisms of the disease by thoroughly examining gene regulatory networks within neutrophils, dendritic cells, T cells, and B cells. Firstly, we identified genes and ncRNAs with differential expression in SLE patients compared to controls for different cell types. Furthermore, the derived differentially expressed genes were curated based on immune functions using functional enrichment analysis to create a protein-protein interaction network. Topological network analysis of the formed genes revealed key hub genes associated with each of the cell types. To understand the regulatory mechanism through which these hub genes function in the diseased state, their associations with transcription factors, and non-coding RNAs in different immune cell types were investigated through correlation analysis and regression models. Finally, by integrating these findings, distinct gene regulatory networks were constructed, which provide a novel perspective on the molecular, cellular, and immunological landscapes of SLE. Importantly, we reveal the crucial role of IRF3, IRF7, and STAT1 in neutrophils, dendritic cells, and T cells, where their aberrant upregulation in disease states might enhance the production of type I IFN. Furthermore, we found MYB to be a crucial regulator that might activate T cells toward autoimmune responses in SLE. Similarly, in B-cell lymphocytes, we found FOXO1 to be a key player in autophagy and chemokine regulation. These findings were also validated using single-cell RNASeq analysis using an independent dataset. Genotype variations of these genes were also explored using the GWAS central database to ensure their targetability. These findings indicate that IRF3, IRF7, STAT1, MYB, and FOXO1 are promising targets for therapeutic interventions for SLE.

Title: Developmental disorders caused by haploinsufficiency of transcriptional regulators: a perspective based on cell fate determination
Authors: Roman Zug
Date: 2022-01-15

Abstract:
Many human birth defects and neurodevelopmental disorders are caused by loss-of-function mutations in a single copy of transcription factor (TF) and chromatin regulator genes. Although this dosage sensitivity has long been known, how and why haploinsufficiency (HI) of transcriptional regulators leads to developmental disorders (DDs) is unclear. Here I propose the hypothesis that such DDs result from defects in cell fate determination that are based on disrupted bistability in the underlying gene regulatory network (GRN). Bistability, a crucial systems biology concept to model binary choices such as cell fate decisions, requires both positive feedback and ultrasensitivity, the latter often achieved through TF cooperativity. The hypothesis explains why dosage sensitivity of transcriptional regulators is an inherent property of fate decisions, and why disruption of either positive feedback or cooperativity in the underlying GRN is sufficient to cause disease. I present empirical and theoretical evidence in support of this hypothesis and discuss several issues for which it increases our understanding of disease, such as incomplete penetrance. The proposed framework provides a mechanistic, systems-level explanation of HI of transcriptional regulators, thus unifying existing theories, and offers new insights into outstanding issues of human disease.  This article has an associated Future Leader to Watch interview with the author of the paper.

Title: The transcriptional landscape of a rewritten bacterial genome reveals control elements and genome design principles
Authors: Mariëlle J. F. M. van Kooten, Clio A. Scheidegger, Matthias Christen, Beat Christen
Date: 2021-05-24

Abstract:
Sequence rewriting enables low-cost genome synthesis and the design of biological systems with orthogonal genetic codes. The error-free, robust rewriting of nucleotide sequences can be achieved with a complete annotation of gene regulatory elements. Here, we compare transcription in Caulobacter crescentus to transcription from plasmid-borne segments of the synthesized genome of C. ethensis 2.0 . This rewritten derivative contains an extensive amount of supposedly neutral mutations, including 123’562 synonymous codon changes. The transcriptional landscape refines 60 promoter annotations, exposes 18 termination elements and links extensive transcription throughout the synthesized genome to the unintentional introduction of sigma factor binding motifs. We reveal translational regulation for 20 CDS and uncover an essential translational regulatory element for the expression of ribosomal protein RplS. The annotation of gene regulatory elements allowed us to formulate design principles that improve design schemes for synthesized DNA, en route to a bright future of iteration-free programming of biological systems.

Title: Gene regulatory network reconstruction using single-cell RNA sequencing of barcoded genotypes in diverse environments
Authors: Christopher A Jackson, Dayanne M Castro, Giuseppe-Antonio Saldi, Richard Bonneau, David Gresham
Date: 2020-01-27

Abstract:
Understanding how gene expression programs are controlled requires identifying regulatory relationships between transcription factors and target genes. Gene regulatory networks are typically constructed from gene expression data acquired following genetic perturbation or environmental stimulus. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) captures the gene expression state of thousands of individual cells in a single experiment, offering advantages in combinatorial experimental design, large numbers of independent measurements, and accessing the interaction between the cell cycle and environmental responses that is hidden by population-level analysis of gene expression. To leverage these advantages, we developed a method for scRNAseq in budding yeast ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae ). We pooled diverse transcriptionally barcoded gene deletion mutants in 11 different environmental conditions and determined their expression state by sequencing 38,285 individual cells. We benchmarked a framework for learning gene regulatory networks from scRNAseq data that incorporates multitask learning and constructed a global gene regulatory network comprising 12,228 interactions.

Abstract:
We design a “wisdom-of-the-crowds” GRN inference pipeline and couple it to complex network analysis to understand the organizational principles governing gene regulation in long-lived glp-1 /Notch Caenorhabditis elegans . The GRN has three layers (input, core, and output) and is topologically equivalent to bow-tie/hourglass structures prevalent among metabolic networks. To assess the functional importance of structural layers, we screened 80% of regulators and discovered 50 new aging genes, 86% with human orthologues. Genes essential for longevity—including ones involved in insulin-like signaling (ILS)—are at the core, indicating that GRN's structure is predictive of functionality. We used in vivo reporters and a novel functional network covering 5,497 genetic interactions to make mechanistic predictions. We used genetic epistasis to test some of these predictions, uncovering a novel transcriptional regulator, sup-37 , that works alongside DAF-16/FOXO. We present a framework with predictive power that can accelerate discovery in C. elegans and potentially humans.

Title: Mechanisms of Globin Gene Regulation in Mammals
Authors: Ross C. Hardison
Date: 2025-11

Abstract:
Studies of globin gene clusters have established many paradigms of gene regulation. This review focuses on the alpha- and beta-globin gene clusters of humans and mice, summarizing important insights from high-throughput biochemical assays and directed genetic dissections, emphasizing similarities across the types of gene clusters and between species. The overall arrangements and architectures are similar, with each gene cluster being localized within a topologically constrained unit of chromatin containing a multi-component enhancer (locus control region) and other regulatory elements bound by a similar set of transcription factors and co-activators. Differential expression of the globin genes within each cluster during ontogeny is associated with changes in contacts with the locus control region and involves the action of gene-specific repressors. Detailed study of the fetal beta-like HBG1 and HBG2 globin genes has revealed a remarkable diversity of regulatory pathways that provide candidates for therapeutic approaches to reactivate these genes for beta-hemoglobinopathies.

Abstract:
Fruiting bodies (sporocarps, sporophores or basidiomata) of mushroom-forming fungi ( Agaricomycetes ) are among the most complex structures produced by fungi. Unlike vegetative hyphae, fruiting bodies grow determinately and follow a genetically encoded developmental program that orchestrates their growth, tissue differentiation and sexual sporulation. In spite of more than a century of research, our understanding of the molecular details of fruiting body morphogenesis is still limited and a general synthesis on the genetics of this complex process is lacking. In this paper, we aim at a comprehensive identification of conserved genes related to fruiting body morphogenesis and distil novel functional hypotheses for functionally poorly characterised ones. As a result of this analysis, we report 921 conserved developmentally expressed gene families, only a few dozens of which have previously been reported to be involved in fruiting body development. Based on literature data, conserved expression patterns and functional annotations, we provide hypotheses on the potential role of these gene families in fruiting body development, yielding the most complete description of molecular processes in fruiting body morphogenesis to date. We discuss genes related to the initiation of fruiting, differentiation, growth, cell surface and cell wall, defence, transcriptional regulation as well as signal transduction. Based on these data we derive a general model of fruiting body development, which includes an early, proliferative phase that is mostly concerned with laying out the mushroom body plan (via cell division and differentiation), and a second phase of growth via cell expansion as well as meiotic events and sporulation. Altogether, our discussions cover 1 480 genes of Coprinopsis cinerea , and their orthologs in Agaricus bisporus, Cyclocybe aegerita, Armillaria ostoyae, Auriculariopsis ampla, Laccaria bicolor, Lentinula edodes, Lentinus tigrinus, Mycena kentingensis, Phanerochaete chrysosporium, Pleurotus ostreatus , and Schizophyllum commune , providing functional hypotheses for ~10 % of genes in the genomes of these species. Although experimental evidence for the role of these genes will need to be established in the future, our data provide a roadmap for guiding functional analyses of fruiting related genes in the Agaricomycetes . We anticipate that the gene compendium presented here, combined with developments in functional genomics approaches will contribute to uncovering the genetic bases of one of the most spectacular multicellular developmental processes in fungi.

Title: Recent advances in exploring transcriptional regulatory landscape of crops
Authors: Qiang Huo, Rentao Song, Zeyang Ma
Date: 2024-06-05

Abstract:
Crop breeding entails developing and selecting plant varieties with improved agronomic traits. Modern molecular techniques, such as genome editing, enable more efficient manipulation of plant phenotype by altering the expression of particular regulatory or functional genes. Hence, it is essential to thoroughly comprehend the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms that underpin these traits. In the multi-omics era, a large amount of omics data has been generated for diverse crop species, including genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and single-cell omics. The abundant data resources and the emergence of advanced computational tools offer unprecedented opportunities for obtaining a holistic view and profound understanding of the regulatory processes linked to desirable traits. This review focuses on integrated network approaches that utilize multi-omics data to investigate gene expression regulation. Various types of regulatory networks and their inference methods are discussed, focusing on recent advancements in crop plants. The integration of multi-omics data has been proven to be crucial for the construction of high-confidence regulatory networks. With the refinement of these methodologies, they will significantly enhance crop breeding efforts and contribute to global food security.

Title: Mini-review: Gene regulatory network benefits from three-dimensional chromatin conformation and structural biology
Authors: Xiusheng Zhu, Qitong Huang, Jing Luo, Dashuai Kong, Yubo Zhang
Date: 2023

Abstract:
Gene regulatory networks are now at the forefront of precision biology, which can help researchers better understand how genes and regulatory elements interact to control cellular gene expression, offering a more promising molecular mechanism in biological research. Interactions between the genes and regulatory elements involve different promoters, enhancers, transcription factors, silencers, insulators, and long-range regulatory elements, which occur at a ∼10 µm nucleus in a spatiotemporal manner. In this way, three-dimensional chromatin conformation and structural biology are critical for interpreting the biological effects and the gene regulatory networks. In the review, we have briefly summarized the latest processes in three-dimensional chromatin conformation, microscopic imaging, and bioinformatics, and we have presented the outlook and future directions for these three aspects.

Abstract:
V0v spinal interneurons are highly conserved, glutamatergic, commissural neurons that function in locomotor circuits. We have previously shown that Evx1 and Evx2 are required to specify the neurotransmitter phenotype of these cells. However, we still know very little about the gene regulatory networks that act downstream of these transcription factors in V0v cells. To identify candidate members of V0v gene regulatory networks, we FAC-sorted WT and evx1;evx2 double mutant zebrafish V0v spinal interneurons and expression-profiled them using microarrays and single cell RNA-seq. We also used in situ hybridization to compare expression of a subset of candidate genes in evx1;evx2 double mutants and wild-type siblings. Our data reveal two molecularly distinct subtypes of V0v spinal interneurons at 48 h and suggest that, by this stage of development, evx1;evx2 double mutant cells transfate into either inhibitory spinal interneurons, or motoneurons. Our results also identify 25 transcriptional regulator genes that require Evx1/2 for their expression in V0v interneurons, plus a further 11 transcriptional regulator genes that are repressed in V0v interneurons by Evx1/2. Two of the latter genes are hmx2 and hmx3a . Intriguingly, we show that Hmx 2 /3a, repress dI2 interneuronal expression of skor1a and nefma , two genes that require Evx1/2 for their expression in V0v interneurons. This suggests that Evx1/2 might regulate skor1a and nefma expression in V0v interneurons by repressing Hmx2 /3a expression. This study identifies two molecularly distinct subsets of V0v spinal interneurons, as well as multiple transcriptional regulators that are strong candidates for acting downstream of Evx1/2 to specify the essential functional characteristics of these cells. Our data further suggest that in the absence of both Evx1 and Evx2, V0v spinal interneurons initially change their neurotransmitter phenotypes from excitatory to inhibitory and then, later, start to express markers of distinct types of inhibitory spinal interneurons, or motoneurons. Taken together, our findings significantly increase our knowledge of V0v and spinal development and move us closer towards the essential goal of identifying the complete gene regulatory networks that specify this crucial cell type.

Title: Nrf1 acts as a highly-conserved determinon for maintaining robust redox homeostasis in the eco-evo-devo process of life histories
Authors: Yiguo Zhang, Xi Chen, Meng Wang, Yuping Zhu, Wei Shi, Chao Li, Zhengwen Zhang, Hiroaki Taniguchi, Ping Ao

Abstract:
Differential and even opposing functions of two major antioxidant transcription factors Nrf1 and Nrf2 (encoded by Nfe2l1 and Nfe2l2 , respectively) are determined by distinctions in their tempospatial positioning, topological repartitioning, proteolytic processing, and biochemical modification, as well as in their shared evolutionary origin. As a matter of fact, the allelopathic potentials of Nrf1 and Nrf2 (both resembling two entangled ‘Yin-Yang’ quanta that comply with a dialectic law of the unity of opposites) are fulfilled to coordinately control redox physiological homeostasis so as to be maintained within the presetting thresholds. By putative exponential curves of redox stress and intrinsic anti-redox capability, there is inferable to exist a set point at approaching zero with the ‘Golden Mean’ for the healthy survival (i.e., dubbed the ‘zero theory’). A bulk of the hitherto accumulating evidence demonstrates that the set point of redox homeostasis is dictated selectively by multi-hierarchical threshold settings, in which the living fossil-like Nrf1 acts as a robust indispensable determinon, whereas Nrf2 serves as a versatile chameleon-like master regulon, in governing the redox homeodynamic ranges. This is attributable to the facts that Nrf2 has exerted certain ‘double-edged sword’ effects on life process, whereas Nrf1 executes its essential physiobiological functions, along with unique pathophysiological phenotypes, by integrating its ‘three-in-one’ roles elicited as a specific triplet of direct sensor, transducer and effector within multi-hierarchical stress responsive signaling to redox metabolism and target gene reprogramming. Here, we also critically reviewed redox regulation of physio-pathological functions from the eco-evo-devo perspectives, through those coding rules (redox code, stress-coping code, and topogenetic code). The evolving concepts on stress and redox stress were also further revisited by scientific principles of physics and chemistry. Besides, several novel concepts such as oncoprotists, Reverse Central Dogma, and Grand Redox-Unifying Theory’ (GRUT) of life, together with diffusive reactive species (DRS)-based murburn concept integrating all stochastic electron-, proton- and/or moiety-transfer reactive and interactive processes (e.g., PCHEMS), are introduced in this interdisciplinary and synthetic review.

Title: Kinetic networks identify TWIST2 as a key regulatory node in adipogenesis

Abstract:
Adipocytes contribute to metabolic disorders such as obesity, diabetes, and atherosclerosis. Prior characterizations of the transcriptional network driving adipogenesis have overlooked transiently acting transcription factors (TFs), genes, and regulatory elements that are essential for proper differentiation. Moreover, traditional gene regulatory networks provide neither mechanistic details about individual regulatory element–gene relationships nor temporal information needed to define a regulatory hierarchy that prioritizes key regulatory factors. To address these shortcomings, we integrate kinetic chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq) and nascent transcription (PRO-seq) data to generate temporally resolved networks that describe TF binding events and resultant effects on target gene expression. Our data indicate which TF families cooperate with and antagonize each other to regulate adipogenesis. Compartment modeling of RNA polymerase density quantifies how individual TFs mechanistically contribute to distinct steps in transcription. The glucocorticoid receptor activates transcription by inducing RNA polymerase pause release, whereas SP and AP-1 factors affect RNA polymerase initiation. We identify Twist2 as a previously unappreciated effector of adipocyte differentiation. We find that TWIST2 acts as a negative regulator of 3T3-L1 and primary preadipocyte differentiation. We confirm that Twist2 knockout mice have compromised lipid storage within subcutaneous and brown adipose tissue. Previous phenotyping of Twist2 knockout mice and Setleis syndrome Twist2 − / − patients noted deficiencies in subcutaneous adipose tissue. This network inference framework is a powerful and general approach for interpreting complex biological phenomena and can be applied to a wide range of cellular processes.

Title: Human gene regulatory evolution is driven by the divergence of regulatory element function in both cis and trans
Authors: Tyler Hansen, Sarah Fong, John A. Capra, Emily Hodges
Date: 2023-02-15

Abstract:
Gene regulatory divergence between species can result from cis -acting local changes to regulatory element DNA sequences or global trans -acting changes to the regulatory environment. Understanding how these mechanisms drive regulatory evolution has been limited by challenges in identifying trans- acting changes. We present a comprehensive approach to directly identify cis- and trans- divergent regulatory elements between human and rhesus macaque lymphoblastoid cells using ATAC-STARR-seq. In addition to thousands of cis changes, we discover an unexpected number (~10,000) of trans changes and show that cis and trans elements exhibit distinct patterns of sequence divergence and function. We further identify differentially expressed transcription factors that underlie >50% of trans differences and trace how cis changes can produce cascades of trans changes. Overall, we find that most divergent elements (67%) experienced changes in both cis and trans , revealing a substantial role for trans divergence—alone and together with cis changes—to regulatory differences between species.

Abstract:
The unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a long-established model organism for studies on photosynthesis and carbon metabolism-related physiology. Under conditions of air-level carbon dioxide concentration [CO 2 ], a carbon concentrating mechanism (CCM) is induced to facilitate cellular carbon uptake. CCM increases the availability of carbon dioxide at the site of cellular carbon fixation. To improve our understanding of the transcriptional control of the CCM, we employed FAIRE-seq (formaldehyde-assisted Isolation of Regulatory Elements, followed by deep sequencing) to determine nucleosome-depleted chromatin regions of algal cells subjected to carbon deprivation. Our FAIRE data recapitulated the positions of known regulatory elements in the promoter of the periplasmic carbonic anhydrase ( Cah1 ) gene, which is upregulated during CCM induction, and revealed new candidate regulatory elements at a genome-wide scale. In addition, time series expression patterns of 130 transcription factor (TF) and transcription regulator (TR) genes were obtained for cells cultured under photoautotrophic condition and subjected to a shift from high to low [CO 2 ]. Groups of co-expressed genes were identified and a putative directed gene-regulatory network underlying the CCM was reconstructed from the gene expression data using the recently developed IOTA (inner composition alignment) method. Among the candidate regulatory genes, two members of the MYB-related TF family, Lcr1 ( Low- C O  2  response regulator 1 ) and Lcr2 ( Low- C O  2  response regulator 2 ), may play an important role in down-regulating the expression of a particular set of TF and TR genes in response to low [CO 2 ]. The results obtained provide new insights into the transcriptional control of the CCM and revealed more than 60 new candidate regulatory genes. Deep sequencing of nucleosome-depleted genomic regions indicated the presence of new, previously unknown regulatory elements in the C. reinhardtii genome. Our work can serve as a basis for future functional studies of transcriptional regulator genes and genomic regulatory elements in Chlamydomonas .

Title: Plant Signaling Hormones and Transcription Factors: Key Regulators of Plant Responses to Growth, Development, and Stress
Authors: Ayomi S. Thilakarathne, Fei Liu, Zhongwei Zou
Date: 2025-03-31

Abstract:
Plants constantly encounter a wide range of biotic and abiotic stresses that adversely affect their growth, development, and productivity. Phytohormones such as abscisic acid, jasmonic acid, salicylic acid, and ethylene serve as crucial regulators, integrating internal and external signals to mediate stress responses while also coordinating key developmental processes, including seed germination, root and shoot growth, flowering, and senescence. Transcription factors (TFs) such as WRKY, NAC, MYB, and AP2/ERF play complementary roles by orchestrating complex transcriptional reprogramming, modulating stress-responsive genes, and facilitating physiological adaptations. Recent advances have deepened our understanding of hormonal networks and transcription factor families, revealing their intricate crosstalk in shaping plant resilience and development. Additionally, the synthesis, transport, and signaling of these molecules, along with their interactions with stress-responsive pathways, have emerged as critical areas of study. The integration of cutting-edge biotechnological tools, such as CRISPR-mediated gene editing and omics approaches, provides new opportunities to fine-tune these regulatory networks for enhanced crop resilience. By leveraging insights into transcriptional regulation and hormone signaling, these advancements provide a foundation for developing stress-tolerant, high-yielding crop varieties tailored to the challenges of climate change.

Abstract:
Gene regulatory divergence between species can result from cis -acting local changes to regulatory element DNA sequences or global trans -acting changes to the regulatory environment. Understanding how these mechanisms drive regulatory evolution has been limited by challenges in identifying trans -acting changes. We present a comprehensive approach to directly identify cis - and trans -divergent regulatory elements between human and rhesus macaque lymphoblastoid cells using assay for transposase-accessible chromatin coupled to self-transcribing active regulatory region (ATAC-STARR) sequencing. In addition to thousands of cis changes, we discover an unexpected number (∼10,000) of trans changes and show that cis and trans elements exhibit distinct patterns of sequence divergence and function. We further identify differentially expressed transcription factors that underlie ∼37% of trans differences and trace how cis changes can produce cascades of trans changes. Overall, we find that most divergent elements (67%) experienced changes in both cis and trans , revealing a substantial role for trans divergence—alone and together with cis changes—in regulatory differences between species.

Abstract:
Here, Fursova et al. investigated the role of BAP1, an H2AK119ub1 deubiquitylating enzyme, in regulating gene expression in mouse ESCs. Using inducible genetic perturbations and quantitative genomics, they show that BAP1 plays a widespread role in promoting gene expression and that this relies on BAP1 counteracting pervasive H2AK119ub1. In the absence of BAP1, accumulation of H2AK119ub1 throughout the genome leads to widespread reductions in transcription.

Title: Identification of master regulator genes controlling pathogenic CD4 + T cell fate in inflammatory bowel disease through transcriptional network analysis
Authors: José M. Jiménez, J. Sebastián Contreras-Riquelme, Pía M. Vidal, Carolina Prado, Macarena Bastías, Claudio Meneses, Alberto J. M. Martín, Tomás Perez-Acle, Rodrigo Pacheco

Abstract:
Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are a group of chronic inflammatory conditions of the gastrointestinal tract associated with multiple pathogenic factors, including dysregulation of the immune response. Effector CD4 + T cells and regulatory CD4 + T cells (Treg) are central players in maintaining the balance between tolerance and inflammation. Interestingly, genetic modifications in these cells have been implicated in regulating the commitment of specific phenotypes and immune functions. However, the transcriptional program controlling the pathogenic behavior of T helper cells in IBD progression is still unknown. In this study, we aimed to find master transcription regulators controlling the pathogenic behavior of effector CD4 + T cells upon gut inflammation. To achieve this goal, we used an animal model of IBD induced by the transfer of naïve CD4 + T cells into recombination-activating gene 1 ( Rag1 ) deficient mice, which are devoid of lymphocytes. As a control, a group of Rag1 −/− mice received the transfer of the whole CD4 + T cells population, which includes both effector T cells and Treg. When gut inflammation progressed, we isolated CD4 + T cells from the colonic lamina propria and spleen tissue, and performed bulk RNA-seq. We identified differentially up- and down-regulated genes by comparing samples from both experimental groups. We found 532 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the colon and 30 DEGs in the spleen, mostly related to Th1 response, leukocyte migration, and response to cytokines in lamina propria T-cells. We integrated these data into Gene Regulatory Networks to identify Master Regulators, identifying four up-regulated master gene regulators (Lef1, Dnmt1, Mybl2, and Jup ) and only one down-regulated master regulator ( Foxo3 ). The altered expression of master regulators observed in the transcriptomic analysis was confirmed by qRT-PCR analysis and found an up-regulation of Lef1 and Mybl2 , but without differences on Dnmt1, Jup, and Foxo3 . These two master regulators have been involved in T cells function and cell cycle progression, respectively. We identified two master regulator genes associated with the pathogenic behavior of effector CD4 + T cells in an animal model of IBD. These findings provide two new potential molecular targets for treating IBD.

Title: Neurogenesis in Caenorhabditis elegans
Authors: Richard J Poole, Nuria Flames, Luisa Cochella
Date: 2024-10

Abstract:
Animals rely on their nervous systems to process sensory inputs, integrate these with internal signals, and produce behavioral outputs. This is enabled by the highly specialized morphologies and functions of neurons. Neuronal cells share multiple structural and physiological features, but they also come in a large diversity of types or classes that give the nervous system its broad range of functions and plasticity. This diversity, first recognized over a century ago, spurred classification efforts based on morphology, function, and molecular criteria. Caenorhabditis elegans , with its precisely mapped nervous system at the anatomical level, an extensive molecular description of most of its neurons, and its genetic amenability, has been a prime model for understanding how neurons develop and diversify at a mechanistic level. Here, we review the gene regulatory mechanisms driving neurogenesis and the diversification of neuron classes and subclasses in C. elegans . We discuss our current understanding of the specification of neuronal progenitors and their differentiation in terms of the transcription factors involved and ensuing changes in gene expression and chromatin landscape. The central theme that has emerged is that the identity of a neuron is defined by modules of gene batteries that are under control of parallel yet interconnected regulatory mechanisms. We focus on how, to achieve these terminal identities, cells integrate information along their developmental lineages. Moreover, we discuss how neurons are diversified postembryonically in a time-, genetic sex-, and activity-dependent manner. Finally, we discuss how the understanding of neuronal development can provide insights into the evolution of neuronal diversity.

Abstract:
Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by the progressive and irreversible destruction of the periodontium. Its aetiopathogenesis lies in the constant challenge of the dysbiotic biofilm, which triggers a deregulated immune response responsible for the disease phenotype. Although the molecular mechanisms underlying periodontitis have been extensively studied, the regulatory mechanisms at the transcriptional level remain unclear. To generate transcriptomic data, we performed RNA shotgun sequencing of the oral mucosa of periodontitis-affected mice. Since genes are not expressed in isolation during pathological processes, we disclose here the complete repertoire of differentially expressed genes (DEG) and co-expressed modules to build Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) and identify the Master Transcriptional Regulators of periodontitis. The transcriptional changes revealed 366 protein-coding genes and 42 non-coding genes differentially expressed and enriched in the immune response. Furthermore, we found 13 co-expression modules with different representation degrees and gene expression levels. Our GRN comprises genes from 12 gene clusters, 166 nodes, of which 33 encode Transcription Factors, and 201 connections. Finally, using these strategies, 26 master regulators of periodontitis were identified. In conclusion, combining the transcriptomic analyses with the regulatory network construction represents a powerful and efficient strategy for identifying potential periodontitis-therapeutic targets.

Title: From genes to patterns: a framework for modeling the emergence of embryonic development from transcriptional regulation
Authors: Jimena Garcia-Guillen, Ezzat El-Sherif
Date: 2025-03-20

Abstract:
Understanding embryonic patterning, the process by which groups of cells are partitioned into distinct identities defined by gene expression, is a central challenge in developmental biology. This complex phenomenon is driven by precise spatial and temporal regulation of gene expression across many cells, resulting in the emergence of highly organized tissue structures. While similar emergent behavior is well understood in other fields, such as statistical mechanics, the regulation of gene expression in development remains less clear, particularly regarding how molecular-level gene interactions lead to the large-scale patterns observed in embryos. In this study, we present a modeling framework that bridges the gap between molecular gene regulation and tissue-level embryonic patterning. Beginning with basic chemical reaction models of transcription at the single-gene level, we progress to model gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that mediate specific cellular functions. We then introduce phenomenological models of pattern formation, including the French Flag and Temporal Patterning/Speed Regulation models, and integrate them with molecular/GRN realizations. To facilitate understanding and application of our models, we accompany our mathematical framework with computer simulations, providing intuitive and simple code for each model. A key feature of our framework is the explicit articulation of underlying assumptions at each level of the model, from transcriptional regulation to tissue patterning. By making these assumptions clear, we provide a foundation for future experimental and theoretical work to critically examine and challenge them, thereby improving the accuracy and relevance of gene regulatory models in developmental biology. As a case study, we explore how different strategies for integrating enhancer activity affect the robustness and evolvability of GRNs that govern embryonic pattern formation. Our simulations suggest that a two-step regulation strategy, enhancer activation followed by competitive integration at the promoter, ensures more standardized integration of new enhancers into developmental GRNs, highlighting the adaptability of eukaryotic transcription. These findings shed new light on the transcriptional mechanisms underlying embryonic patterning, while the overall modeling framework serves as a foundation for future experimental and theoretical investigations.

Title: Histone deacetylase MdHDA6 is an antagonist in regulation of transcription factor MdTCP15 to promote cold tolerance in apple

Abstract:
Understanding the molecular regulation of plant cold response is the basis for cold resistance germplasm improvement. Here, we revealed that the apple histone deacetylase MdHDA6 can perform histone deacetylation on cold‐negative regulator genes and repress their expression, leading to the positive regulation of cold tolerance in apples. Moreover, MdHDA6 directly interacts with the transcription factor MdTCP15. Phenotypic analysis of MdTCP15 transgenic apple lines and wild types reveals that MdTCP15 negatively regulates cold tolerance in apples. Furthermore, we found that MdHDA6 can facilitate histone deacetylation of MdTCP15 and repress the expression of MdTCP15 , which positively contributes to cold tolerance in apples. Additionally, the transcription factor MdTCP15 can directly bind to the promoter of the cold‐negative regulator gene MdABI1 and activate its expression, and it can also directly bind to the promoter of the cold‐positive regulator gene MdCOR47 and repress its expression. However, the co‐expression of MdHDA6 and MdTCP15 can inhibit MdTCP15‐induced activation of MdABI1 and repression of MdCOR47 , suggesting that MdHDA6 suppresses the transcriptional regulation of MdTCP15 on its downstream genes. Our results demonstrate that histone deacetylase MdHDA6 plays an antagonistic role in the regulation of MdTCP15‐induced transcriptional activation or repression to positively regulate cold tolerance in apples, revealing a new regulatory mechanism of plant cold response.

Regulators
Authors: Wouter Demeester, Brecht De Paepe, Marjan De Mey
Date: 2024-09-22

Abstract:
LysR-type
transcriptional regulators (LTTRs) are emerging as a
promising group of macromolecules for the field of biosensors. As
the largest family of bacterial transcription factors, the LTTRs represent
a vast and mostly untapped repertoire of sensor proteins. To fully
harness these regulators for transcription factor-based biosensor
development, it is crucial to understand their underlying mechanisms
and functionalities. In the first part, this Review discusses the
established model and features of LTTRs. As dual-function regulators,
these inducible transcription factors exude precise control over their
regulatory targets. In the second part of this Review, an overview
is given of the exceptions to the “classic” LTTR model.
While a general regulatory mechanism has helped elucidate the intricate
regulation performed by LTTRs, it is essential to recognize the variations
within the family. By combining this knowledge, characterization of
new regulators can be done more efficiently and accurately, accelerating
the expansion of transcriptional sensors for biosensor development.
Unlocking the pool of LTTRs would significantly expand the currently
limited range of detectable molecules and regulatory functions available
for the implementation of novel synthetic genetic circuitry.

Title: Diversity, versatility and complexity of bacterial gene regulation mechanisms: opportunities and drawbacks for applications in synthetic biology
Authors: Indra Bervoets, Daniel Charlier
Date: 2019-02-04

Abstract:
Gene expression occurs in two essential steps: transcription and translation. In bacteria, the two processes are tightly coupled in time and space, and highly regulated. Tight regulation of gene expression is crucial. It limits wasteful consumption of resources and energy, prevents accumulation of potentially growth inhibiting reaction intermediates, and sustains the fitness and potential virulence of the organism in a fluctuating, competitive and frequently stressful environment. Since the onset of studies on regulation of enzyme synthesis, numerous distinct regulatory mechanisms modulating transcription and/or translation have been discovered. Mostly, various regulatory mechanisms operating at different levels in the flow of genetic information are used in combination to control and modulate the expression of a single gene or operon. Here, we provide an extensive overview of the very diverse and versatile bacterial gene regulatory mechanisms with major emphasis on their combined occurrence, intricate intertwinement and versatility. Furthermore, we discuss the potential of well-characterized basal expression and regulatory elements in synthetic biology applications, where they may ensure orthogonal, predictable and tunable expression of (heterologous) target genes and pathways, aiming at a minimal burden for the host.

Abstract:
Bacteria belonging to Streptomyces have the ability to produce a wide range of secondary metabolites through a shift from primary to secondary metabolism regulated by complex networks activated after vegetative growth terminates. Despite considerable effort to understand the regulatory elements governing gene expression related to primary and secondary metabolism in Streptomyces , system-level information remains limited. In this study, we integrated four multi-omics datasets from Streptomyces griseus NBRC 13350: RNA-seq, ribosome profiling, dRNA-seq, and Term-Seq, to analyze the regulatory elements of transcription and translation of differentially expressed genes during cell growth. With the functional enrichment of gene expression in different growth phases, one sigma factor regulon and four transcription factor regulons governing differential gene transcription patterns were found. In addition, the regulatory elements of transcription termination and post-transcriptional processing at transcript 3′-end positions were elucidated, including their conserved motifs, stem-loop RNA structures, and non-terminal locations within the polycistronic operons, and the potential regulatory elements of translation initiation and elongation such as 5′-UTR length, RNA structures at ribosome-bound sites, and codon usage were investigated. This comprehensive genetic information provides a foundational genetic resource for strain engineering to enhance secondary metabolite production in Streptomyces .

Abstract:
During early vertebrate development, signals from a special region of the embryo, the organizer, can redirect the fate of non-neural ectoderm cells to form a complete, patterned nervous system. This is called neural induction and has generally been imagined as a single signalling event, causing a switch of fate. Here, we undertake a comprehensive analysis, in very fine time course, of the events following exposure of competent ectoderm of the chick to the organizer (the tip of the primitive streak, Hensen’s node). Using transcriptomics and epigenomics we generate a gene regulatory network comprising 175 transcriptional regulators and 5614 predicted interactions between them, with fine temporal dynamics from initial exposure to the signals to expression of mature neural plate markers. Using in situ hybridization, single-cell RNA-sequencing, and reporter assays, we show that the gene regulatory hierarchy of responses to a grafted organizer closely resembles the events of normal neural plate development. The study is accompanied by an extensive resource, including information about conservation of the predicted enhancers in other vertebrates.

Title: Shared Gene Targets of the ATF4 and p53 Transcriptional Networks
Authors: Gabriele Baniulyte, Serene A. Durham, Lauren E. Merchant, Morgan A. Sammons
Date: 2023-08-02

Abstract:
The master tumor suppressor p53 regulates multiple cell fate decisions, such as cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, via transcriptional control of a broad gene network. Dysfunction in the p53 network is common in cancer, often through mutations that inactivate p53 or other members of the pathway. Induction of tumor-specific cell death by restoration of p53 activity without off-target effects has gained significant interest in the field. In this study, we explore the gene regulatory mechanisms underlying a putative anticancer strategy involving stimulation of the p53-independent integrated stress response (ISR). Our data demonstrate the p53 and ISR pathways converge to independently regulate common metabolic and proapoptotic genes. We investigated the architecture of multiple gene regulatory elements bound by p53 and the ISR effector ATF4 controlling this shared regulation. We identified additional key transcription factors that control basal and stress-induced regulation of these shared p53 and ATF4 target genes. Thus, our results provide significant new molecular and genetic insight into gene regulatory networks and transcription factors that are the target of numerous antitumor therapies.

Date: 2025-09

Abstract:
Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) are intricate biological systems that control gene expression and regulation in response to environmental and developmental cues. Advances in computational biology, coupled with high-throughput sequencing technologies, have significantly improved the accuracy of GRN inference and modeling. Modern approaches increasingly leverage artificial intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning techniques—including supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and contrastive learning—to analyze large-scale omics data and uncover regulatory gene interactions. To support both the application of GRN inference in studying gene regulation and the development of novel machine learning methods, we present a comprehensive review of machine learning-based GRN inference methodologies, along with the datasets and evaluation metrics commonly used. Special emphasis is placed on the emerging role of cutting-edge deep learning techniques in enhancing inference performance. The major challenges and potential future directions for improving GRN inference are also discussed.

Authors: Skyler D. Hebdon, Alida T. Gerritsen, Yi-Pei Chen, Joan G. Marcano, Katherine J. Chou
Date: 2021-09-07

Abstract:
Clostridium thermocellum is a thermophilic bacterium recognized for its natural ability to effectively deconstruct cellulosic biomass. While there is a large body of studies on the genetic engineering of this bacterium and its physiology to-date, there is limited knowledge in the transcriptional regulation in this organism and thermophilic bacteria in general. The study herein is the first report of a large-scale application of DNA-affinity purification sequencing (DAP-seq) to transcription factors (TFs) from a bacterium. We applied DAP-seq to > 90 TFs in C. thermocellum and detected genome-wide binding sites for 11 of them. We then compiled and aligned DNA binding sequences from these TFs to deduce the primary DNA-binding sequence motifs for each TF. These binding motifs are further validated with electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and are used to identify individual TFs’ regulatory targets in C. thermocellum . Our results led to the discovery of novel, uncharacterized TFs as well as homologues of previously studied TFs including RexA-, LexA-, and LacI-type TFs. We then used these data to reconstruct gene regulatory networks for the 11 TFs individually, which resulted in a global network encompassing the TFs with some interconnections. As gene regulation governs and constrains how bacteria behave, our findings shed light on the roles of TFs delineated by their regulons, and potentially provides a means to enable rational, advanced genetic engineering of C. thermocellum and other organisms alike toward a desired phenotype.

Title: Inferring gene regulatory networks by thermodynamic modeling
Authors: Chieh-Chun Chen, Sheng Zhong
Date: 2008

Abstract:
To date, the reconstruction of gene regulatory networks from gene expression data has primarily relied on the correlation between the expression of transcription regulators and that of target genes. We developed a network reconstruction method based on quantities that are closely related to the biophysical properties of TF-TF interaction, TF-DNA binding and transcriptional activation and repression. The Network-Identifier method utilized a thermodynamic model for gene regulation to infer regulatory relationships from multiple time course gene expression datasets. Applied to five datasets of differentiating embryonic stem cells, Network-Identifier identified a gene regulatory network among 87 transcription regulator genes. This network suggests that Oct4, Sox2 and Klf4 indirectly repress lineage specific differentiation genes by activating transcriptional repressors of Ctbp2, Rest and Mtf2.

Title: Exploring the effects of genetic variation on gene regulation in cancer in the context of 3D genome structure
Authors: Noha Osman, Abd-El-Monsif Shawky, Michal Brylinski
Date: 2022-02-17

Abstract:
Numerous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) conducted to date revealed genetic variants associated with various diseases, including breast and prostate cancers. Despite the availability of these large-scale data, relatively few variants have been functionally characterized, mainly because the majority of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) map to the non-coding regions of the human genome. The functional characterization of these non-coding variants and the identification of their target genes remain challenging. In this communication, we explore the potential functional mechanisms of non-coding SNPs by integrating GWAS with the high-resolution chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) data for breast and prostate cancers. We show that more genetic variants map to regulatory elements through the 3D genome structure than the 1D linear genome lacking physical chromatin interactions. Importantly, the association of enhancers, transcription factors, and their target genes with breast and prostate cancers tends to be higher when these regulatory elements are mapped to high-risk SNPs through spatial interactions compared to simply using a linear proximity. Finally, we demonstrate that topologically associating domains (TADs) carrying high-risk SNPs also contain gene regulatory elements whose association with cancer is generally higher than those belonging to control TADs containing no high-risk variants. Our results suggest that many SNPs may contribute to the cancer development by affecting the expression of certain tumor-related genes through long-range chromatin interactions with gene regulatory elements. Integrating large-scale genetic datasets with the 3D genome structure offers an attractive and unique approach to systematically investigate the functional mechanisms of genetic variants in disease risk and progression.

Abstract:
Genetic and experimental evidence suggests that Alzheimer’s disease (AD) risk alleles and genes may influence disease susceptibility by altering the transcriptional and cellular responses of macrophages, including microglia, to damage of lipid-rich tissues like the brain. Recently, sc/nRNA sequencing studies identified similar transcriptional activation states in subpopulations of macrophages in aging and degenerating brains and in other diseased lipid-rich tissues. We collectively refer to these subpopulations of microglia and peripheral macrophages as DLAMs. Using macrophage sc/nRNA-seq data from healthy and diseased human and mouse lipid-rich tissues, we reconstructed gene regulatory networks and identified 11 strong candidate transcriptional regulators of the DLAM response across species. Loss or reduction of two of these transcription factors, BHLHE40/41, in iPSC-derived microglia and human THP-1 macrophages as well as loss of Bhlhe40/41 in mouse microglia, resulted in increased expression of DLAM genes involved in cholesterol clearance and lysosomal processing, increased cholesterol efflux and storage, and increased lysosomal mass and degradative capacity. These findings provide targets for therapeutic modulation of macrophage/microglial function in AD and other disorders affecting lipid-rich tissues.

Title: Role of primary aging hallmarks in Alzheimer´s disease
Authors: Jin Zhao, Jisen Huai
Date: 2023

Abstract:
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease, which severely threatens the health of the elderly and causes significant economic and social burdens. The causes of AD are complex and include heritable but mostly aging-related factors. The primary aging hallmarks include genomic instability, telomere wear, epigenetic changes, and loss of protein stability, which play a dominant role in the aging process. Although AD is closely associated with the aging process, the underlying mechanisms involved in AD pathogenesis have not been well characterized. This review summarizes the available literature about primary aging hallmarks and their roles in AD pathogenesis. By analyzing published literature, we attempted to uncover the possible mechanisms of aberrant epigenetic markers with related enzymes, transcription factors, and loss of proteostasis in AD. In particular, the importance of oxidative stress-induced DNA methylation and DNA methylation-directed histone modifications and proteostasis are highlighted. A molecular network of gene regulatory elements that undergoes a dynamic change with age may underlie age-dependent AD pathogenesis, and can be used as a new drug target to treat AD.

Abstract:
Multistep phosphorelay (MSP) signaling integrates hormonal and environmental signals to control both plant development and adaptive responses. Type-A RESPONSE REGULATOR ( RRA ) genes, the downstream members of the MSP cascade and cytokinin primary response genes, are thought to mediate primarily the negative feedback regulation of (cytokinin-induced) MSP signaling. However, transcriptional data also suggest the involvement of RRA genes in stress-related responses. By employing evolutionary conservation with the well-characterized Arabidopsis thaliana RRA genes, we identified five and 38 novel putative RRA genes in Brassica oleracea and Brassica napus , respectively. Our phylogenetic analysis suggests the existence of gene-specific selective pressure, maintaining the homologs of ARR3 , ARR6 , and ARR16 as singletons during the evolution of Brassicaceae . We categorized RRA genes based on the kinetics of their cytokinin-mediated up-regulation and observed both similarities and specificities in this type of response across Brassicaceae species. Using bioinformatic analysis and experimental data demonstrating the cytokinin and abiotic stress responsiveness of the A. thaliana -derived TCSv2 reporter, we unveil the mechanistic conservation of cytokinin- and stress-mediated up-regulation of RRA genes in B. rapa and B. napus . Notably, we identify partial cytokinin dependency of cold stress-induced RRA transcription, thus further demonstrating the role of cytokinin signaling in crop adaptive responses.

Title: Nearby transposable elements impact plant stress gene regulatory networks: a meta-analysis in A. thaliana and S. lycopersicum
Authors: Jan Deneweth, Yves Van de Peer, Vanessa Vermeirssen
Date: 2022-01-04

Abstract:
Transposable elements (TE) make up a large portion of many plant genomes and are playing innovative roles in genome evolution. Several TEs can contribute to gene regulation by influencing expression of nearby genes as stress-responsive regulatory motifs. To delineate TE-mediated plant stress regulatory networks, we took a 2-step computational approach consisting of identifying TEs in the proximity of stress-responsive genes, followed by searching for cis-regulatory motifs in these TE sequences and linking them to known regulatory factors. Through a systematic meta-analysis of RNA-seq expression profiles and genome annotations, we investigated the relation between the presence of TE superfamilies upstream, downstream or within introns of nearby genes and the differential expression of these genes in various stress conditions in the TE-poor Arabidopsis thaliana and the TE-rich Solanum lycopersicum . We found that stress conditions frequently expressed genes having members of various TE superfamilies in their genomic proximity, such as SINE upon proteotoxic stress and Copia and Gypsy upon heat stress in A. thaliana , and EPRV and hAT upon infection, and Harbinger, LINE and Retrotransposon upon light stress in S. lycopersicum . These stress-specific gene-proximal TEs were mostly located within introns and more detected near upregulated than downregulated genes. Similar stress conditions were often related to the same TE superfamily. Additionally, we detected both novel and known motifs in the sequences of those TEs pointing to regulatory cooption of these TEs upon stress. Next, we constructed the regulatory network of TFs that act through binding these TEs to their target genes upon stress and discovered TE-mediated regulons targeted by TFs such as BRB/BPC, HD, HSF, GATA, NAC, DREB/CBF and MYB factors in Arabidopsis and AP2/ERF/B3, NAC, NF-Y, MYB, CXC and HD factors in tomato. Overall, we map TE-mediated plant stress regulatory networks using numerous stress expression profile studies for two contrasting plant species to study the regulatory role TEs play in the response to stress. As TE-mediated gene regulation allows plants to adapt more rapidly to new environmental conditions, this study contributes to the future development of climate-resilient plants.

Title: Modulated termination of non-coding transcription partakes in the regulation of gene expression
Authors: Nouhou Haidara, Marta Giannini, Odil Porrua
Date: 2022-02-22

Abstract:
Pervasive transcription is a universal phenomenon leading to the production of a plethora of non-coding RNAs. If left uncontrolled, pervasive transcription can be harmful for genome expression and stability. However, non-coding transcription can also play important regulatory roles, for instance by promoting the repression of specific genes by a mechanism of transcriptional interference. The efficiency of transcription termination can strongly influence the regulatory capacity of non-coding transcription events, yet very little is known about the mechanisms modulating the termination of non-coding transcription in response to environmental cues. Here, we address this question by investigating the mechanisms that regulate the activity of the main actor in termination of non-coding transcription in budding yeast, the helicase Sen1. We identify a phosphorylation at a conserved threonine of the catalytic domain of Sen1 and we provide evidence that phosphorylation at this site reduces the efficiency of Sen1-mediated termination. Interestingly, we find that this phosphorylation impairs termination at an unannotated non-coding gene, thus repressing the expression of a downstream gene encoding the master regulator of Zn homeostasis, Zap1. Consequently, many additional genes exhibit an expression pattern mimicking conditions of Zn excess, where ZAP1 is naturally repressed. Our findings provide a novel paradigm of gene regulatory mechanism relying on the direct modulation of non-coding transcription termination.

Abstract:
Cis -regulatory elements (CREs) interact with trans regulators to orchestrate gene expression, but how transcriptional regulation is coordinated in multi-gene loci has not been experimentally defined. We sought to characterize the CREs controlling dynamic expression of the adjacent costimulatory genes CD28 , CTLA4 and ICOS , encoding regulators of T cell-mediated immunity. Tiling CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screens in primary human T cells, both conventional and regulatory subsets, uncovered gene-, cell subset- and stimulation-specific CREs. Integration with CRISPR knockout screens and assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (ATAC-seq) profiling identified trans regulators influencing chromatin states at specific CRISPRi-responsive elements to control costimulatory gene expression. We then discovered a critical CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) boundary that reinforces CRE interaction with CTLA4 while also preventing promiscuous activation of CD28 . By systematically mapping CREs and associated trans regulators directly in primary human T cell subsets, this work overcomes longstanding experimental limitations to decode context-dependent gene regulatory programs in a complex, multi-gene locus critical to immune homeostasis.

Abstract:
Renal proximal tubule epithelial cells have considerable intrinsic repair capacity following injury. However, a fraction of injured proximal tubule cells fails to undergo normal repair and assumes a proinflammatory and profibrotic phenotype that may promote fibrosis and chronic kidney disease. The healthy to failed repair change is marked by cell state-specific transcriptomic and epigenomic changes. Single nucleus joint RNA- and ATAC-seq sequencing offers an opportunity to study the gene regulatory networks underpinning these changes in order to identify key regulatory drivers. We develop a regularized regression approach to construct genome-wide parametric gene regulatory networks using multiomic datasets. We generate a single nucleus multiomic dataset from seven adult human kidney samples and apply our method to study drivers of a failed injury response associated with kidney disease. We demonstrate that our approach is a highly effective tool for predicting key cis- and trans- regulatory elements underpinning the healthy to failed repair transition and use it to identify NFAT5 as a driver of the maladaptive proximal tubule state.

Title: Tumor suppressor p53: from engaging DNA to target gene regulation
Authors: Morgan A Sammons, Thuy-Ai T Nguyen, Simon S McDade, Martin Fischer
Date: 2020-09-18

Abstract:
The p53 transcription factor confers its potent tumor suppressor functions primarily through the regulation of a large network of target genes. The recent explosion of next generation sequencing protocols has enabled the study of the p53 gene regulatory network (GRN) and underlying mechanisms at an unprecedented depth and scale, helping us to understand precisely how p53 controls gene regulation. Here, we discuss our current understanding of where and how p53 binds to DNA and chromatin, its pioneer-like role, and how this affects gene regulation. We provide an overview of the p53 GRN and the direct and indirect mechanisms through which p53 affects gene regulation. In particular, we focus on delineating the ubiquitous and cell type-specific network of regulatory elements that p53 engages; reviewing our understanding of how, where, and when p53 binds to DNA and the mechanisms through which these events regulate transcription. Finally, we discuss the evolution of the p53 GRN and how recent work has revealed remarkable differences between vertebrates, which are of particular importance to cancer researchers using mouse models.

Title: Molecular characterization, clinical relevance and immune feature of m7G regulator genes across 33 cancer types
Authors: Zhanzhan Li, Yanyan Li, Lin Shen, Liangfang Shen, Na Li
Date: 2022-08-25

Abstract:
Over 170 RNA modifications have been identified after transcriptions, involving in regulation of RNA splicing, processing, translation and decay. Growing evidence has unmasked the crucial role of N 6 -methyladenosine (m6A) in cancer development and progression, while, as a relative newly found RNA modification, N 7 -methylguanosine (m7G) is also certified to participate in tumorigenesis via different catalytic machinery from that of m6A. However, system analysis on m7G RNA modification-related regulator genes is lack. In this study, we first investigated the genetic alteration of m7G related regulator genes in 33 cancers, and found mRNA expression levels of most regulator genes were positively correlated with copy number variation (CNV) and negatively correlated with methylation in most cancers. We built a m7G RNA modification model based on the enrichment of the regulator gene scores to evaluate the m7G modification levels in 33 cancers, and investigated the connections of m7G scores to clinical outcomes. Furthermore, we paid close attention to the role of m7G in immunology due to the widely used immune checkpoint blockade therapy. Our results showed the higher m7G scores related to immunosuppression of tumor cells. Further confirmation with phase 3 clinical data with application of anti-PDL1/PDL indicated the impact of m7G modification level on immunotherapy effect. Relevance of m7G regulator genes and drug sensitivity was also evaluated to provide a better treatment choice when treating cancers. In summary, our study uncovered the profile of m7G RNA modification through various cancers, and figured out the connection of m7G modification levels with therapeutical outcomes, providing potential better options of cancer treatment.

Title: Gene regulatory network inference from CRISPR perturbations in primary CD4 + T cells elucidates the genomic basis of immune disease
Authors: Joshua S. Weinstock, Maya M. Arce, Jacob W. Freimer, Mineto Ota, Alexander Marson, Alexis Battle, Jonathan K. Pritchard
Date: 2024-11-13

Abstract:
The effects of genetic variation on complex traits act mainly through changes in gene regulation. Although many genetic variants have been linked to target genes in cis , the trans -regulatory cascade mediating their effects remains largely uncharacterized. Mapping trans -regulators based on natural genetic variation has been challenging due to small effects, but experimental perturbations offer a complementary approach. Using CRISPR, we knocked out 84 genes in primary CD4 + T cells, targeting inborn error of immunity (IEI) disease transcription factors (TFs) and TFs without immune disease association. We developed a novel gene network inference method called linear latent causal Bayes (LLCB) to estimate the network from perturbation data and observed 211 regulatory connections between genes. We characterized programs affected by the TFs, which we associated with immune genome-wide association study (GWAS) genes, finding that JAK-STAT family members are regulated by KMT2A , an epigenetic regulator. These analyses reveal the trans -regulatory cascades linking GWAS genes to signaling pathways.

Abstract:
Regulation of gene expression plays an essential role in controlling the phenotypes of plants. Brassica napus ( B. napus ) is an important source for the vegetable oil in the world, and the seed oil content is an important trait of B. napus . We perform a comprehensive analysis of the transcriptional variability in the seeds of B. napus at two developmental stages, 20 and 40 days after flowering (DAF). We detect 53,759 and 53,550 independent expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) for 79,605 and 76,713 expressed genes at 20 and 40 DAF, respectively. Among them, the local eQTLs are mapped to the adjacent genes more frequently. The adjacent gene pairs are regulated by local eQTLs with the same open chromatin state and show a stronger mode of expression piggybacking. Inter-subgenomic analysis indicates that there is a feedback regulation for the homoeologous gene pairs to maintain partial expression dosage. We also identify 141 eQTL hotspots and find that hotspot87-88 co-localizes with a QTL for the seed oil content. To further resolve the regulatory network of this eQTL hotspot, we construct the XGBoost model using 856 RNA-seq datasets and the Basenji model using 59 ATAC-seq datasets. Using these two models, we predict the mechanisms affecting the seed oil content regulated by hotspot87-88 and experimentally validate that the transcription factors, NAC13 and SCL31, positively regulate the seed oil content. We comprehensively characterize the gene regulatory features in the seeds of B. napus and reveal the gene networks regulating the seed oil content of B. napus .

Date: 2021-07-02

Abstract:
Cadmium is an exceptionally toxic industrial and environmental pollutant classified as a human carcinogen. In order to provide insight into how we can keep our environment safe from cadmium contamination and prevent the accumulation of it in the food chain, we aim to elucidate how Aspergillus nidulans , one of the most abundant fungi in soil, survives and handles cadmium stress. As AtfA is the main transcription factor governing stress responses in A. nidulans , we examined genome-wide expression responses of wild-type and the atfA null mutant exposed to CdCl 2 . Both strains showed up-regulation of the crpA Cu 2+ /Cd 2+ pump gene and AN7729 predicted to encode a putative bis(glutathionato)-cadmium transporter, and transcriptional changes associated with elevated intracellular Cys availability leading to the efficient adaptation to Cd 2+ . Although the deletion of atfA did not alter the cadmium tolerance of the fungus, the cadmium stress response of the mutant differed from that of a reference strain. Promoter and transcriptional analyses of the “Phospho-relay response regulator” genes suggest that the AtfA-dependent regulation of these genes can be relevant in this phenomenon. We concluded that the regulatory network of A. nidulans has a high flexibility allowing the fungus to adapt efficiently to stress both in the presence and absence of this important transcription factor.

Abstract:
A lingering question in developmental biology has centered on how transcription factors with widespread distribution in vertebrate embryos can perform tissue-specific functions. Here, using the murine hindlimb as a model, we investigate the elusive mechanisms whereby PBX TALE homeoproteins, viewed primarily as HOX cofactors, attain context-specific developmental roles despite ubiquitous presence in the embryo. We first demonstrate that mesenchymal-specific loss of PBX1/2 or the transcriptional regulator HAND2 generates similar limb phenotypes. By combining tissue-specific and temporally controlled mutagenesis with multi-omics approaches, we reconstruct a gene regulatory network (GRN) at organismal-level resolution that is collaboratively directed by PBX1/2 and HAND2 interactions in subsets of posterior hindlimb mesenchymal cells. Genome-wide profiling of PBX1 binding across multiple embryonic tissues further reveals that HAND2 interacts with subsets of PBX-bound regions to regulate limb-specific GRNs. Our research elucidates fundamental principles by which promiscuous transcription factors cooperate with cofactors that display domain-restricted localization to instruct tissue-specific developmental programs.

Abstract:
Water is essential for living organisms. Terrestrial organisms are incessantly exposed to the stress of losing water, desiccation stress. Avoiding the mortality caused by desiccation stress, many organisms acquired molecular mechanisms to tolerate desiccation. Larvae of the African midge, Polypedilum vanderplanki , and its embryonic cell line Pv11 tolerate desiccation stress by entering an ametabolic state, anhydrobiosis, and return to active life after rehydration. The genes related to desiccation tolerance have been comprehensively analyzed, but transcriptional regulatory mechanisms to induce these genes after desiccation or rehydration remain unclear. Here, we comprehensively analyzed the gene regulatory network in Pv11 cells and compared it with that of Drosophila melanogaster , a desiccation sensitive species. We demonstrated that nuclear transcription factor Y subunit gamma-like, which is important for drought stress tolerance in plants, and its transcriptional regulation of downstream positive feedback loops have a pivotal role in regulating various anhydrobiosis-related genes. This study provides an initial insight into the systemic mechanism of desiccation tolerance.

Abstract:
Dysregulation of gene expression in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) remains elusive, especially at the cell type level. Gene regulatory network, a key molecular mechanism linking transcription factors (TFs) and regulatory elements to govern gene expression, can change across cell types in the human brain and thus serve as a model for studying gene dysregulation in AD. However, AD-induced regulatory changes across brain cell types remains uncharted. To address this, we integrated single-cell multi-omics datasets to predict the gene regulatory networks of four major cell types, excitatory and inhibitory neurons, microglia and oligodendrocytes, in control and AD brains. Importantly, we analyzed and compared the structural and topological features of networks across cell types and examined changes in AD. Our analysis shows that hub TFs are largely common across cell types and AD-related changes are relatively more prominent in some cell types (e.g., microglia). The regulatory logics of enriched network motifs (e.g., feed-forward loops) further uncover cell type-specific TF-TF cooperativities in gene regulation. The cell type networks are also highly modular and several network modules with cell-type-specific expression changes in AD pathology are enriched with AD-risk genes. The further disease-module-drug association analysis suggests cell-type candidate drugs and their potential target genes. Finally, our network-based machine learning analysis systematically prioritized cell type risk genes likely involved in AD. Our strategy is validated using an independent dataset which showed that top ranked genes can predict clinical phenotypes (e.g., cognitive impairment) of AD with reasonable accuracy. Overall, this single-cell network biology analysis provides a comprehensive map linking genes, regulatory networks, cell types and drug targets and reveals cell-type gene dysregulation in AD.

Abstract:
Super-enhancers (SEs) are regions of the genome that play a crucial regulatory role in gene expression by promoting large-scale transcriptional responses in various cell types and tissues. Recent research suggests that alterations in super-enhancer activity can contribute to the development and progression of various disorders. The aim of this research is to explore the multifaceted roles of super-enhancers in gene regulation and their significant implications for understanding and treating complex diseases. Here, we study and summarise the classification of super-enhancer constituents, their possible modes of interaction, and cross-regulation, including super-enhancer RNAs (seRNAs). We try to investigate the opportunity of SE dynamics prediction based on the hierarchy of enhancer single elements (enhancers) and their aggregated action. To further our understanding, we conducted an in silico experiment to compare and differentiate between super-enhancers and locus-control regions (LCRs), shedding light on the enigmatic relationship between LCRs and SEs within the human genome. Particular attention is paid to the classification of specific mechanisms and their diversity, exemplified by various oncological, cardiovascular, and immunological diseases, as well as an overview of several anti-SE therapies. Overall, the work presents a comprehensive analysis of super-enhancers across different diseases, aiming to provide insights into their regulatory roles and may act as a rationale for future clinical interventions targeting these regulatory elements.

Title: Approaches for Benchmarking Single-Cell Gene Regulatory Network Methods
Authors: Karamveer, Yasin Uzun
Date: 2024-11-04

Abstract:
Gene regulatory networks are powerful tools for modeling genetic interactions that control the expression of genes driving cell differentiation, and single-cell sequencing offers a unique opportunity to build these networks with high-resolution genomic data. There are many proposed computational methods to build these networks using single-cell data, and different approaches are used to benchmark these methods. However, a comprehensive discussion specifically focusing on benchmarking approaches is missing. In this article, we lay the GRN terminology, present an overview of common gold-standard studies and data sets, and define the performance metrics for benchmarking network construction methodologies. We also point out the advantages and limitations of different benchmarking approaches, suggest alternative ground truth data sets that can be used for benchmarking, and specify additional considerations in this context.

Abstract:
Coordinated regulation of gene activity by transcriptional and translational mechanisms poise stem cells for a timely cell-state transition during differentiation. Although important for all stemness-to-differentiation transitions, mechanistic understanding of the fine-tuning of gene transcription is lacking due to the compensatory effect of translational control. We used intermediate neural progenitor (INP) identity commitment to define the mechanisms that fine-tune stemness gene transcription in fly neural stem cells (neuroblasts). We demonstrate that the transcription factor Fruitless C (Fru C ) binds cis -regulatory elements of most genes uniquely transcribed in neuroblasts. Loss of fru C function alone has no effect on INP commitment but drives INP dedifferentiation when translational control is reduced. Fru C negatively regulates gene expression by promoting low-level enrichment of the repressive histone mark H3K27me3 in gene cis -regulatory regions. Identical to fru C loss-of-function, reducing Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 activity increases stemness gene activity. We propose low-level H3K27me3 enrichment fine-tunes gene transcription in stem cells, a mechanism likely conserved from flies to humans.

Date: 2023-01-05

Abstract:
The transcriptomic analysis of microarray and RNA-Seq datasets followed our own bioinformatic pipeline to identify a transcriptional regulatory network of lung cancer. Twenty-six transcription factors are dysregulated and co-expressed in most of the lung cancer and pulmonary arterial hypertension datasets, which makes them the most frequently dysregulated transcription factors. Co-expression, gene regulatory, coregulatory, and transcriptional regulatory networks, along with fibration symmetries, were constructed to identify common connection patterns, alignments, main regulators, and target genes in order to analyze transcription factor complex formation, as well as its synchronized co-expression patterns in every type of lung cancer. The regulatory function of the most frequently dysregulated transcription factors over lung cancer deregulated genes was validated with ChEA3 enrichment analysis. A Kaplan–Meier plotter analysis linked the dysregulation of the top transcription factors with lung cancer patients’ survival. Our results indicate that lung cancer has unique and common deregulated genes and transcription factors with pulmonary arterial hypertension, co-expressed and regulated in a coordinated and cooperative manner by the transcriptional regulatory network that might be associated with critical biological processes and signaling pathways related to the acquisition of the hallmarks of cancer, making them potentially relevant tumor biomarkers for lung cancer early diagnosis and targets for the development of personalized therapies against lung cancer.

Abstract:
Recent research has indicated the presence of heterochromatin-like regions of extended protein occupancy and transcriptional silencing of bacterial genomes. We utilized an integrative approach to track chromatin structure and transcription in E. coli K-12 across a wide range of nutrient conditions. In the process, we identified multiple loci which act similarly to facultative heterochromatin in eukaryotes, normally silenced but permitting expression of genes under specific conditions. We also found a strong enrichment of small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) among the set of differentially expressed transcripts during nutrient stress. Using a newly developed bioinformatic pipeline, the transcription factors regulating sRNA expression were bioinformatically predicted, with experimental follow-up revealing novel relationships for 36 sRNA-transcription factors candidates. Direct regulation of sRNA expression was confirmed by mutational analysis for five sRNAs of metabolic interest: IsrB, CsrB and CsrC, GcvB, and GadY. Our integrative analysis thus reveals additional layers of complexity in the nutrient stress response in E. coli and provides a framework for revealing similar poorly understood regulatory logic in other organisms.

Abstract:
Illuminating the precise stepwise genetic programs directing cardiac development provides insights into the mechanisms of congenital heart disease and strategies for cardiac regenerative therapies. Here, we integrate in vitro and in vivo human single-cell multi-omic studies with high-throughput functional genomic screening to reveal dynamic, cardiac-specific gene regulatory networks (GRNs) and transcriptional regulators during human cardiomyocyte development. Interrogating developmental trajectories reconstructed from single-cell data unexpectedly reveal divergent cardiomyocyte lineages with distinct gene programs based on developmental signaling pathways. High-throughput functional genomic screens identify key transcription factors from inferred GRNs that are functionally relevant for cardiomyocyte lineages derived from each pathway. Notably, we discover a critical heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1)-mediated cardiometabolic GRN controlling cardiac mitochondrial/metabolic function and cell survival, also observed in fetal human cardiomyocytes. Overall, these multi-modal genomic studies enable the systematic discovery and validation of coordinated GRNs and transcriptional regulators controlling the development of distinct human cardiomyocyte populations.

Title: Predicting brain-regional gene regulatory networks from multi-omics for Alzheimer’s disease phenotypes and Covid-19 severity
Authors: Saniya Khullar, Daifeng Wang
Date: 2023-06-01

Abstract:
Neuroinflammation and immune dysregulation play a key role in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and are also associated with severe Covid-19 and neurological symptoms. Also, genome-wide association studies found many risk single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for AD and Covid-19. However, our understanding of underlying gene regulatory mechanisms from risk SNPs to AD, Covid-19 and phenotypes is still limited. To this end, we performed an integrative multi-omics analysis to predict gene regulatory networks for major brain regions from population data in AD. Our networks linked transcription factors (TFs) to TF binding sites (TFBSs) on regulatory elements to target genes. Comparative network analyses revealed cross-region-conserved and region-specific regulatory networks, in which many immunological genes are present. Furthermore, we identified a list of AD–Covid genes using our networks involving known and Covid-19 genes. Our machine learning analysis prioritized 36 AD–Covid candidate genes for predicting Covid severity. Our independent validation analyses found that these genes outperform known genes for classifying Covid-19 severity and AD. Finally, we mapped genome-wide association study SNPs of AD and severe Covid that interrupt TFBSs on our regulatory networks, revealing potential mechanistic insights of those disease risk variants. Our analyses and results are open-source available, providing an AD–Covid functional genomic resource at the brain region level.

Abstract:
ATAC-seq is widely used to measure chromatin accessibility and identify open chromatin regions (OCRs). OCRs usually indicate active regulatory elements in the genome and are directly associated with the gene regulatory network. The identification of differential accessibility regions (DARs) between different biological conditions is critical in determining the differential activity of regulatory elements. Differential analysis of ATAC-seq shares many similarities with differential expression analysis of RNA-seq data. However, the distribution of ATAC-seq signal intensity is different from that of RNA-seq data, and higher sensitivity is required for DARs identification. Many different tools can be used to perform differential analysis of ATAC-seq data, but a comprehensive comparison and benchmarking of these methods is still lacking. Here, we used simulated datasets to systematically measure the sensitivity and specificity of six different methods. We further discussed the statistical and signal density cut-offs in the differential analysis of ATAC-seq by applying them to real data. Batch effects are very common in high-throughput sequencing experiments. We illustrated that batch-effect correction can dramatically improve sensitivity in the differential analysis of ATAC-seq data. Finally, we developed a user-friendly package, BeCorrect, to perform batch effect correction and visualization of corrected ATAC-seq signals in a genome browser.

Abstract:
Single-cell RNA-seq methods can be used to delineate cell types and states at unprecedented resolution but do little to explain why certain genes are expressed. Single-cell ATAC-seq and multiome (ATAC + RNA) have emerged to give a complementary view of the cell state. It is however unclear what additional information can be extracted from ATAC-seq data besides transcription factor binding sites. Here, we show that ATAC-seq telomere-like reads counter-inituively cannot be used to infer telomere length, as they mostly originate from the subtelomere, but can be used as a biomarker for chromatin condensation. Using long-read sequencing, we further show that modern hyperactive Tn5 does not duplicate 9 bp of its target sequence, contrary to common belief. We provide a new tool, Telomemore, which can quantify nonaligning subtelomeric reads. By analyzing several public datasets and generating new multiome fibroblast and B-cell atlases, we show how this new readout can aid single-cell data interpretation. We show how drivers of condensation processes can be inferred, and how it complements common RNA-seq-based cell cycle inference, which fails for monocytes. Telomemore-based analysis of the condensation state is thus a valuable complement to the single-cell analysis toolbox.

Title: Genome-Wide Analysis of Yeast Metabolic Cycle through Metabolic Network Models Reveals Superiority of Integrated ATAC-seq Data over RNA-seq Data
Authors: Müberra Fatma Cesur, Tunahan Çakır, Pınar Pir
Date: 2022-06-13

Abstract:
Saccharomyces cerevisiae undergoes robust oscillations to regulate its physiology for adaptation and survival under nutrient-limited conditions. Environmental cues can induce rhythmic metabolic alterations in order to facilitate the coordination of dynamic metabolic behaviors. Of such metabolic processes, the yeast metabolic cycle enables adaptation of the cells to varying nutritional status through oscillations in gene expression and metabolite production levels. In this process, yeast metabolism is altered between diverse cellular states based on changing oxygen consumption levels: quiescent (reductive charging [RC]), growth (oxidative [OX]), and proliferation (reductive building [RB]) phases. We characterized metabolic alterations during the yeast metabolic cycle using a variety of approaches. Gene expression levels are widely used for condition-specific metabolic simulations, whereas the use of epigenetic information in metabolic modeling is still limited despite the clear relationship between epigenetics and metabolism. This prompted us to investigate the contribution of epigenomic information to metabolic predictions for progression of the yeast metabolic cycle. In this regard, we determined altered pathways through the prediction of regulated reactions and corresponding model genes relying on differential chromatin accessibility levels. The predicted metabolic alterations were confirmed via data analysis and literature. We subsequently utilized RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) data sets in the contextualization of the yeast model. The use of ATAC-seq data considerably enhanced the predictive capability of the model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to use genome-wide chromatin accessibility data in metabolic modeling. The preliminary results showed that epigenomic data sets can pave the way for more accurate metabolic simulations. IMPORTANCE Dynamic chromatin organization mediates the emergence of condition-specific phenotypes in eukaryotic organisms. Saccharomyces cerevisiae can alter its metabolic profile via regulation of genome accessibility and robust transcriptional oscillations under nutrient-limited conditions. Thus, both epigenetic information and transcriptomic information are crucial in the understanding of condition-specific metabolic behavior in this organism. Based on genome-wide alterations in chromatin accessibility and transcription, we investigated the yeast metabolic cycle, which is a remarkable example of coordinated and dynamic yeast behavior. In this regard, we assessed the use of ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data sets in condition-specific metabolic modeling. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to use chromatin accessibility data in the reconstruction of context-specific metabolic models, despite the extensive use of transcriptomic data. As a result of comparative analyses, we propose that the incorporation of epigenetic information is a promising approach in the accurate prediction of metabolic dynamics.

Abstract:
Schizophrenia genome-wide association studies have identified >150 regions of the genome associated with disease risk, yet there is little evidence that coding mutations contribute to this disorder. To explore the mechanism of non-coding regulatory elements in schizophrenia, we performed ATAC-seq on adult prefrontal cortex brain samples from 135 individuals with schizophrenia and 137 controls, and identified 118,152 ATAC-seq peaks. These accessible chromatin regions in the brain are highly enriched for schizophrenia SNP heritability. Accessible chromatin regions that overlap evolutionarily conserved regions exhibit an even higher heritability enrichment, indicating that sequence conservation can further refine functional risk variants. We identify few differences in chromatin accessibility between cases and controls, in contrast to thousands of age-related differential accessible chromatin regions. Altogether, we characterize chromatin accessibility in the human prefrontal cortex, the effect of schizophrenia and age on chromatin accessibility, and provide evidence that our dataset will allow for fine mapping of risk variants.

Title: Global prediction of chromatin accessibility using small-cell-number and single-cell RNA-seq
Authors: Weiqiang Zhou, Zhicheng Ji, Weixiang Fang, Hongkai Ji
Date: 2019-11-04

Abstract:
Conventional high-throughput genomic technologies for mapping regulatory element activities in bulk samples such as ChIP-seq, DNase-seq and FAIRE-seq cannot analyze samples with small numbers of cells. The recently developed low-input and single-cell regulome mapping technologies such as ATAC-seq and single-cell ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq) allow analyses of small-cell-number and single-cell samples, but their signals remain highly discrete or noisy. Compared to these regulome mapping technologies, transcriptome profiling by RNA-seq is more widely used. Transcriptome data in single-cell and small-cell-number samples are more continuous and often less noisy. Here, we show that one can globally predict chromatin accessibility and infer regulatory element activities using RNA-seq. Genome-wide chromatin accessibility predicted by RNA-seq from 30 cells can offer better accuracy than ATAC-seq from 500 cells. Predictions based on single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) can more accurately reconstruct bulk chromatin accessibility than using scATAC-seq. Integrating ATAC-seq with predictions from RNA-seq increases the power and value of both methods. Thus, transcriptome-based prediction provides a new tool for decoding gene regulatory circuitry in samples with limited cell numbers.

Abstract:
The regenerative potential of brain stem cell niches deteriorates during aging. Yet the mechanisms underlying this decline are largely unknown. Here we characterize genome-wide chromatin accessibility of neurogenic niche cells in vivo during aging. Interestingly, chromatin accessibility at adhesion and migration genes decreases with age in quiescent neural stem cells (NSCs) but increases with age in activated (proliferative) NSCs. Quiescent and activated NSCs exhibit opposing adhesion behaviors during aging: quiescent NSCs become less adhesive, whereas activated NSCs become more adhesive. Old activated NSCs also show decreased migration in vitro and diminished mobilization out of the niche for neurogenesis in vivo. Using tension sensors, we find that aging increases force-producing adhesions in activated NSCs. Inhibiting the cytoskeletal-regulating kinase ROCK reduces these adhesions, restores migration in old activated NSCs in vitro, and boosts neurogenesis in vivo. These results have implications for restoring the migratory potential of NSCs and for improving neurogenesis in the aged brain.

Abstract:
Gene regulation is highly cell type-specific and understanding the function of non-coding genetic variants associated with complex traits requires molecular phenotyping at cell type resolution. In this study we performed single nucleus ATAC-seq (snATAC-seq) and genotyping in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 13 individuals. Clustering chromatin accessibility profiles of 96,002 total nuclei identified 17 immune cell types and sub-types. We mapped chromatin accessibility QTLs (caQTLs) in each immune cell type and sub-type using individuals of European ancestry which identified 6,901 caQTLs at FDR < .10 and 4,220 caQTLs at FDR < .05, including those obscured from assays of bulk tissue such as with divergent effects on different cell types. For 3,941 caQTLs we further annotated putative target genes of variant activity using single cell co-accessibility, and caQTL variants were significantly correlated with the accessibility level of linked gene promoters. We fine-mapped loci associated with 16 complex immune traits and identified immune cell caQTLs at 622 candidate causal variants, including those with cell type-specific effects. At the 6q15 locus associated with type 1 diabetes, in line with previous reports, variant rs72928038 was a naïve CD4+ T cell caQTL linked to BACH2 and we validated the allelic effects of this variant on regulatory activity in Jurkat T cells. These results highlight the utility of snATAC-seq for mapping genetic effects on accessible chromatin in specific cell types.

Abstract:
The Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) is a fundamental epigenomics approach and has been widely used in profiling the chromatin accessibility dynamics in multiple species. A comprehensive reference of ATAC-seq datasets for mammalian tissues is important for the understanding of regulatory specificity and developmental abnormality caused by genetic or environmental alterations. Here, we report an adult mouse ATAC-seq atlas by producing a total of 66 ATAC-seq profiles from 20 primary tissues of both male and female mice. The ATAC-seq read enrichment, fragment size distribution, and reproducibility between replicates demonstrated the high quality of the full dataset. We identified a total of 296,574 accessible elements, of which 26,916 showed tissue-specific accessibility. Further, we identified key transcription factors specific to distinct tissues and found that the enrichment of each motif reflects the developmental similarities across tissues. In summary, our study provides an important resource on the mouse epigenome and will be of great importance to various scientific disciplines such as development, cell reprogramming, and genetic disease.

Title: Review and Evaluate the Bioinformatics Analysis Strategies of ATAC-seq and CUT&Tag Data
Authors: Siyuan Cheng, Benpeng Miao, Tiandao Li, Guoyan Zhao, Bo Zhang
Date: 2024-06

Abstract:
Efficient and reliable profiling methods are essential to study epigenetics. Tn5, one of the first identified prokaryotic transposases with high DNA-binding and tagmentation efficiency, is widely adopted in different genomic and epigenomic protocols for high-throughputly exploring the genome and epigenome. Based on Tn5, the Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) and the Cleavage Under Targets and Tagmentation (CUT&Tag) were developed to measure chromatin accessibility and detect DNA–protein interactions. These methodologies can be applied to large amounts of biological samples with low-input levels, such as rare tissues, embryos, and sorted single cells. However, fast and proper processing of these epigenomic data has become a bottleneck because massive data production continues to increase quickly. Furthermore, inappropriate data analysis can generate biased or misleading conclusions. Therefore, it is essential to evaluate the performance of Tn5-based ATAC-seq and CUT&Tag data processing bioinformatics tools, many of which were developed mostly for analyzing chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) data. Here, we conducted a comprehensive benchmarking analysis to evaluate the performance of eight popular software for processing ATAC-seq and CUT&Tag data. We compared the sensitivity, specificity, and peak width distribution for both narrow-type and broad-type peak calling. We also tested the influence of the availability of control IgG input in CUT&Tag data analysis. Finally, we evaluated the differential analysis strategies commonly used for analyzing the CUT&Tag data. Our study provided comprehensive guidance for selecting bioinformatics tools and recommended analysis strategies, which were implemented into Docker/Singularity images for streamlined data analysis.

Abstract:
The nucleolus is a large nuclear body that serves as the primary site for ribosome biogenesis. Recent studies have suggested that it also plays an important role in organizing chromatin architecture. However, to establish a causal relationship between nucleolar ribosome assembly and chromatin architecture, genetic tools are required to disrupt nucleolar ribosome biogenesis. In this study, we used ATAC-seq to investigate changes in chromatin accessibility upon specific depletion of two ribosome biogenesis components, RPOA-2 and GRWD-1, in the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans . To facilitate the analysis of ATAC-seq data, we introduced two tools: SRAlign, an extensible NGS data processing workflow, and SRAtac, a customizable end-to-end ATAC-seq analysis pipeline. Our results revealed highly comparable changes in chromatin accessibility following both RPOA-2 and GRWD-1 perturbations. However, we observed a weak correlation between changes in chromatin accessibility and gene expression. While our findings corroborate the idea of a feedback mechanism between ribosomal RNA synthesis, nucleolar ribosome large subunit biogenesis, and chromatin structure during the L1 stage of C. elegans development, they also prompt questions regarding the functional impact of these alterations on gene expression.

Abstract:
 Vitis vinifera is an economically important crop and a useful model in which to study chromatin dynamics. In contrast to the small and relatively simple genome of Arabidopsis thaliana , grapevine contains a complex genome of 487 Mb that exhibits extensive colonization by transposable elements. We used Hi‐C, ChIP‐seq and ATAC‐seq to measure how chromatin features correlate to the expression of 31 845 grapevine genes. ATAC‐seq revealed the presence of more than 16 000 open chromatin regions, of which we characterize nearly 5000 as possible distal enhancer candidates that occur in intergenic space > 2 kb from the nearest transcription start site (TSS). A motif search identified more than 480 transcription factor (TF) binding sites in these regions, with those for TCP family proteins in greatest abundance. These open chromatin regions are typically within 15 kb from their nearest promoter, and a gene ontology analysis indicated that their nearest genes are significantly enriched for TF activity. The presence of a candidate cis‐regulatory element (cCRE) > 2 kb upstream of the TSS, location in the active nuclear compartment as determined by Hi‐C, and the enrichment of H3K4me3, H3K4me1 and H3K27ac at the gene are correlated with gene expression. Taken together, these results suggest that regions of intergenic open chromatin identified by ATAC‐seq can be considered potential candidates for cis‐regulatory regions in V. vinifera . Our findings enhance the characterization of a valuable agricultural crop, and help to clarify the understanding of unique plant biology.

Title: Profiling of chromatin accessibility and identification of general cis -regulatory mechanisms that control two ocular lens differentiation pathways
Authors: Yilin Zhao, Deyou Zheng, Ales Cvekl
Date: 2019-05-03

Abstract:
Promoters and enhancers are cis -regulatory DNA sequences that control specificity and quantity of transcription. Both are rich on clusters of cis -acting sites that interact with sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factors (TFs). At the level of chromatin, these regions display increased nuclease sensitivity, reduced nucleosome density, including nucleosome-free regions, and specific combinations of posttranslational modifications of core histone proteins. Together, “open” and “closed” chromatins represent transcriptionally active and repressed states of individual genes, respectively. Cellular differentiation is marked by changes in local chromatin structure. Lens morphogenesis, regulated by TF Pax6, includes differentiation of epithelial precursor cells into lens fibers in parallel with differentiation of epithelial precursors into the mature lens epithelium. Using ATAC-seq, we investigated dynamics of chromatin changes during mouse lens fibers and epithelium differentiation. Tissue-specific features of these processes are demonstrated via comparative studies of embryonic stem cells, forebrain, and liver chromatins. Unbiased analysis reveals cis -regulatory logic of lens differentiation through known (e.g., AP-1, Ets, Hsf4, Maf, and Pax6 sites) and novel (e.g., CTCF, Tead, and NF1) motifs. Twenty-six DNA-binding TFs, recognizing these cis -motifs, are markedly up-regulated in differentiating lens fibers. As specific examples, our ATAC-seq data uncovered both the regulatory regions and TF binding motifs in Foxe3 , Prox1 , and Mip loci that are consistent with previous, though incomplete, experimental data. A cross-examination of Pax6 binding with ATAC-seq data demonstrated that Pax6 bound to both open (H3K27ac and P300-enriched) and closed chromatin domains in lens and forebrain. Our study has generated the first lens chromatin accessibility maps that support a general model of stage-specific chromatin changes associated with transcriptional activities of batteries of genes required for lens fiber cell formation. Analysis of active (or open) promoters and enhancers reveals important cis -DNA motifs that establish the molecular foundation for temporally and spatially regulated gene expression in lens. Together, our data and models open new avenues for the field to conduct mechanistic studies of transcriptional control regions, reconstruction of gene regulatory networks that govern lens morphogenesis, and identification of cataract-causing mutations in noncoding sequences.

Abstract:
We develop a large-scale single-cell ATAC-seq method by combining Tn5-based pre-indexing with 10× Genomics barcoding, enabling the indexing of up to 200,000 nuclei across multiple samples in a single reaction. We profile 449,953 nuclei across diverse tissues, including the human cortex, mouse brain, human lung, mouse lung, mouse liver, and lung tissue from a club cell secretory protein knockout (CC16 −/− ) model. Our study of CC16 −/− nuclei uncovers previously underappreciated technical artifacts derived from remnant 129 mouse strain genetic material, which cause profound cell-type-specific changes in regulatory elements near many genes, thereby confounding the interpretation of this commonly referenced mouse model.

Abstract:
Myofibers are the main components of skeletal muscle, which is the largest tissue in the body. Myofibers are highly adaptive and can be altered under different biological and disease conditions. Therefore, transcriptional and epigenetic studies on myofibers are crucial to discover how chromatin alterations occur in the skeletal muscle under different conditions. However, due to the heterogenous nature of skeletal muscle, studying myofibers in isolation proves to be a challenging task. Single-cell sequencing has permitted the study of the epigenome of isolated myonuclei. While this provides sequencing with high dimensionality, the sequencing depth is lacking, which makes comparisons between different biological conditions difficult. Here, we report the first implementation of single myofiber ATAC-Seq, which allows for the sequencing of an individual myofiber at a depth sufficient for peak calling and for comparative analysis of chromatin accessibility under various physiological and disease conditions. Application of this technique revealed significant differences in chromatin accessibility between resting and regenerating myofibers, as well as between myofibers from a mouse model of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (mdx) and wild-type (WT) counterparts. This technique can lead to a wide application in the identification of chromatin regulatory elements and epigenetic mechanisms in muscle fibers during development and in muscle-wasting diseases.

Abstract:
Breast cancer drugs including anthracyclines (ACs) and Trastuzumab increase the risk for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) such as atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure (HF) that ultimately affect the heart muscle. These CVDs are associated with hundreds of genetic variants in non-coding regions of the genome. However, how these drugs affect the regulatory potential of the non-coding genome of the heart and CVD risk loci is unknown. We therefore measured global chromatin accessibility across iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes derived from four healthy individuals that we treated with topoisomerase II (TOP2) inhibiting ACs, Doxorubicin, Epirubicin, and Daunorubicin, and the anthracenedione, Mitoxantrone as well as the TOP2-independent monoclonal antibody Trastuzumab, for three and 24 hours. We identified tens of thousands of open chromatin regions that are differentially accessible in response to TOP2 inhibitor treatments over time, and no changes in response to Trastuzumab. Early AC-responsive regions are promoter-proximal and are enriched for regions bound by TOP2 beta. Late AC-responsive regions are enriched for AC response genes particularly those associated with mismatch repair. AC-response regions near AC response genes are enriched for FOS:JUNB transcription factor motifs. Three AC-induced cardiotoxicity-, 28 AF- and 14 HF-associated SNPs directly overlap late AC-responsive regions. Early AC-responsive regions are enriched for AF SNPs including rs3176326, which is also associated with HF, and is an eQTL for CDKN1A in heart tissue. This SNP associates with increased chromatin accessibility at a TOP2 beta-bound region, increased histone acetylation, and increased CDKN1A expression in response to all ACs. Our results demonstrate large-scale changes in chromatin accessibility in cardiomyocytes treated with ACs, which correspond to several regions harboring AF and HF risk loci. The identified drug-responsive chromatin regions can be used to annotate variants in cancer patient populations to contribute to risk estimation for CVD.

Abstract:
Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin sequencing (ATAC-Seq) is a widely used technique to explore gene regulatory mechanisms. For most ATAC-Seq data from healthy and diseased tissues such as tumors, chromatin accessibility measurement represents a mixed signal from multiple cell types. In this work, we derive reliable chromatin accessibility marker peaks and reference profiles for most non-malignant cell types frequently observed in the microenvironment of human tumors. We then integrate these data into the EPIC deconvolution framework (Racle et al., 2017) to quantify cell-type heterogeneity in bulk ATAC-Seq data. Our EPIC-ATAC tool accurately predicts non-malignant and malignant cell fractions in tumor samples. When applied to a human breast cancer cohort, EPIC-ATAC accurately infers the immune contexture of the main breast cancer subtypes.

Abstract:
High throughput sequencing has enabled the interrogation of the transcriptomic landscape of glucagon-secreting alpha cells, insulin-secreting beta cells, and somatostatin-secreting delta cells. These approaches have furthered our understanding of expression patterns that define healthy or diseased islet cell types and helped explicate some of the intricacies between major islet cell crosstalk and glucose regulation. All three endocrine cell types derive from a common pancreatic progenitor, yet alpha and beta cells have partially opposing functions, and delta cells modulate and control insulin and glucagon release. While gene expression signatures that define and maintain cellular identity have been widely explored, the underlying epigenetic components are incompletely characterized and understood. However, chromatin accessibility and remodeling is a dynamic attribute that plays a critical role to determine and maintain cellular identity. Here, we compare and contrast the chromatin landscape between mouse alpha, beta, and delta cells using ATAC-Seq to evaluate the significant differences in chromatin accessibility. The similarities and differences in chromatin accessibility between these related islet endocrine cells help define their fate in support of their distinct functional roles. We identify patterns that suggest that both alpha and delta cells are poised, but repressed, from becoming beta-like. We also identify patterns in differentially enriched chromatin that have transcription factor motifs preferentially associated with different regions of the genome. Finally, we not only confirm and visualize previously discovered common endocrine- and cell specific- enhancer regions across differentially enriched chromatin, but identify novel regions as well. We compiled our chromatin accessibility data in a freely accessible database of common endocrine- and cell specific-enhancer regions that can be navigated with minimal bioinformatics expertise. Both alpha and delta cells appear poised, but repressed, from becoming beta cells in murine pancreatic islets. These data broadly support earlier findings on the plasticity in identity of non-beta cells under certain circumstances. Furthermore, differential chromatin accessibility shows preferentially enriched distal-intergenic regions in beta cells, when compared to either alpha or delta cells.

Abstract:
The use of Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin (ATAC-seq) to profile chromatin accessibility has surged over the past years, but its applicability to tissues has been very limited. With the intent of preserving nuclear architecture during long-term storage, cryopreserved nuclei preparations from chicken lung were used to optimize ATAC-seq. Sequencing data were compared with existing DNase-seq, ChIP-seq, and RNA-seq data to evaluate library quality, ultimately resulting in a modified ATAC-seq method capable of generating high quality chromatin accessibility data from cryopreserved nuclei preparations. Using this method, nucleosome-free regions (NFR) identified in chicken lung overlapped half of DNase-I hypersensitive sites, coincided with active histone modifications, and specifically marked actively expressed genes. Notably, sequencing only the subnucleosomal fraction dramatically improved signal, while separation of subnucleosomal reads post-sequencing did not improve signal or peak calling. The broader applicability of this modified ATAC-seq technique was tested using cryopreserved nuclei preparations from pig tissues, resulting in NFR that were highly consistent among biological replicates. Furthermore, tissue-specific NFR were enriched for binding motifs of transcription factors related to tissue-specific functions, and marked genes functionally enriched for tissue-specific processes. Overall, these results provide insights into the optimization of ATAC-seq and a platform for profiling open chromatin in animal tissues.

Title: Quantitative analysis of cis-regulatory elements in transcription with KAS-ATAC-seq
Authors: Ruitu Lyu, Yun Gao, Tong Wu, Chang Ye, Pingluan Wang, Chuan He
Date: 2024-08-10

Abstract:
Cis-regulatory elements (CREs) are pivotal in orchestrating gene expression throughout diverse biological systems. Accurate identification and in-depth characterization of functional CREs are crucial for decoding gene regulation networks during cellular processes. In this study, we develop Kethoxal-Assisted Single-stranded DNA Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin with Sequencing (KAS-ATAC-seq) to quantitatively analyze the transcriptional activity of CREs. A main advantage of KAS-ATAC-seq lies in its precise measurement of ssDNA levels within both proximal and distal ATAC-seq peaks, enabling the identification of transcriptional regulatory sequences. This feature is particularly adept at defining Single-Stranded Transcribing Enhancers (SSTEs). SSTEs are highly enriched with nascent RNAs and specific transcription factors (TFs) binding sites that define cellular identity. Moreover, KAS-ATAC-seq provides a detailed characterization and functional implications of various SSTE subtypes. Our analysis of CREs during mouse neural differentiation demonstrates that KAS-ATAC-seq can effectively identify immediate-early activated CREs in response to retinoic acid (RA) treatment. Our findings indicate that KAS-ATAC-seq provides more precise annotation of functional CREs in transcription. Future applications of KAS-ATAC-seq would help elucidate the intricate dynamics of gene regulation in diverse biological processes.

Abstract:
Nitrogen (N) is essential for rice growth; however, the transcriptional regulation of the primary nitrogen response (PNR), characterized by the rapid upregulation of N uptake and assimilation genes upon N resupply, remains poorly understood. This study investigated the dynamics of the PNR in the roots of two rice cultivars (Zhenshan 97 and Nipponbare) via time-series Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing and RNA sequencing analyses within 2 h of ammonium nitrate resupply. Regulatory regions responsive to N induction were precisely identified. Coordinated and cascading changes in chromatin accessibility and gene expression were observed, with chromatin state frequently preceding transcriptional changes. Integrative analysis of expression–chromatin accessibility associations revealed a redundant N-responsive regulatory network. OsLBD38 and OsLBD39 , identified as early-response regulators, transcriptionally suppress nitrate reductases while enhancing nitrite reductases; they may function as metabolic safeguarders to prevent nitrite accumulation. OsbZIP23 was identified as a novel regulator directly binding to the promoters of N uptake and metabolism genes, regulating genes in patterns opposite to LBD -regulated genes, suggesting a complex regulatory interplay. Cross-species comparisons with Arabidopsis highlighted the conserved N-responsive regulatory roles of these hub regulators and their targets. Comparative analyses between cultivars revealed expression divergence and genetic differentiation in N-responsive genes, implying indica/japonica -specific adaptations. Furthermore, deep learning predictions of chromatin accessibility between cultivars indicated that expression variation in N uptake and metabolism genes is primarily influenced by trans -acting regulatory factors. These findings provide a comprehensive view of the dynamic regulatory landscape governing the PNR in rice.

Abstract:
We report the generation of an organism-wide catalog of 976,813 cis -acting regulatory elements for the bovine detected by the assay for transposase accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq). We regroup these regulatory elements in 16 components by nonnegative matrix factorization. Correlation between the genome-wide density of peaks and transcription start sites, correlation between peak accessibility and expression of neighboring genes, and enrichment in transcription factor binding motifs support their regulatory potential. Using a previously established catalog of 12,736,643 variants, we show that the proportion of single-nucleotide polymorphisms mapping to ATAC-seq peaks is higher than expected and that this is owing to an approximately 1.3-fold higher mutation rate within peaks. Their site frequency spectrum indicates that variants in ATAC-seq peaks are subject to purifying selection. We generate eQTL data sets for liver and blood and show that variants that drive eQTL fall into liver- and blood-specific ATAC-seq peaks more often than expected by chance. We combine ATAC-seq and eQTL data to estimate that the proportion of regulatory variants mapping to ATAC-seq peaks is approximately one in three and that the proportion of variants mapping to ATAC-seq peaks that are regulatory is approximately one in 25. We discuss the implication of these findings on the utility of ATAC-seq information to improve the accuracy of genomic selection.

Abstract:
Archived formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples are the global standard format for preservation of the majority of biopsies in both basic research and translational cancer studies, and profiling chromatin accessibility in the archived FFPE tissues is fundamental to understanding gene regulation. Accurate mapping of chromatin accessibility from FFPE specimens is challenging because of the high degree of DNA damage. Here, we first showed that standard ATAC-seq can be applied to purified FFPE nuclei but yields lower library complexity and a smaller proportion of long DNA fragments. We then present FFPE-ATAC, the first highly sensitive method for decoding chromatin accessibility in FFPE tissues that combines Tn5-mediated transposition and T7 in vitro transcription. The FFPE-ATAC generates high-quality chromatin accessibility profiles with 500 nuclei from a single FFPE tissue section, enables the dissection of chromatin profiles from the regions of interest with the aid of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, and reveals disease-associated chromatin regulation from the human colorectal cancer FFPE tissue archived for >10 yr. In summary, the approach allows decoding of the chromatin states that regulate gene expression in archival FFPE tissues, thereby permitting investigators to better understand epigenetic regulation in cancer and precision medicine.

Abstract:
Identifying the regulatory mechanisms of genome-wide association study (GWAS) loci affecting adipose tissue has been restricted due to limited characterization of adipose transcriptional regulatory elements. We profiled chromatin accessibility in three frozen human subcutaneous adipose tissue needle biopsies and preadipocytes and adipocytes from the Simpson Golabi-Behmel Syndrome (SGBS) cell strain using an assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (ATAC-seq). We identified 68,571 representative accessible chromatin regions (peaks) across adipose tissue samples (FDR < 5%). GWAS loci for eight cardiometabolic traits were enriched in these peaks ( P < 0.005), with the strongest enrichment for waist-hip ratio. Of 110 recently described cardiometabolic GWAS loci colocalized with adipose tissue eQTLs, 59 loci had one or more variants overlapping an adipose tissue peak. Annotated variants at the SNX10 waist-hip ratio locus and the ATP2A1-SH2B1 body mass index locus showed allelic differences in regulatory assays. These adipose tissue accessible chromatin regions elucidate genetic variants that may alter adipose tissue function to impact cardiometabolic traits.

Abstract:
Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) causes adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) and HTLV-1-associated myelopathy (HAM) after a long latent period in a fraction of infected individuals. These HTLV-1-infected cells typically have phenotypes similar to that of CD4 + T cells, but the cell status is not well understood. To extract the inherent information of HTLV-1-infected CD4 + cells, we integratively analyzed the ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data of the infected cells. Compared to CD4 + T cells from healthy donors, we found anomalous chromatin accessibility in HTLV-1infected CD4 + cells derived from ATL cases in terms of location and sample-to-sample fluctuations in open chromatin regions. Further, by focusing on systematically selected genes near the open chromatin regions, we quantified the difference between the infected CD4 + cells in ATL cases and healthy CD4 + T cells in terms of the correlation between the chromatin structures and the gene expressions. Based on a further analysis of chromatin accessibility, we detected TLL1 (Tolloid Like 1) as one of the key genes that exhibit unique gene expressions in ATL cases. A luciferase assay indicated that TLL1 has an isoform-dependent regulatory effect on TGF- β . Overall, this study provides results about the status of HTLV-1-infected cells, which are qualitatively consistent across the different scales of chromatin accessibility, transcription, and immunophenotype.

Abstract:
Although considerable progress has been made towards annotating the noncoding portion of the human and mouse genomes, regulatory elements in other species, such as livestock, remain poorly characterized. This lack of functional annotation poses a substantial roadblock to agricultural research and diminishes the value of these species as model organisms. As active regulatory elements are typically characterized by chromatin accessibility, we implemented the Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin (ATAC-seq) to annotate and characterize regulatory elements in pigs and cattle, given a set of eight adult tissues. Overall, 306,304 and 273,594 active regulatory elements were identified in pig and cattle, respectively. 71,478 porcine and 47,454 bovine regulatory elements were highly tissue-specific and were correspondingly enriched for binding motifs of known tissue-specific transcription factors. However, in every tissue the most prevalent accessible motif corresponded to the insulator CTCF, suggesting pervasive involvement in 3-D chromatin organization. Taking advantage of a similar dataset in mouse, open chromatin in pig, cattle, and mice were compared, revealing that the conservation of regulatory elements, in terms of sequence identity and accessibility, was consistent with evolutionary distance; whereas pig and cattle shared about 20% of accessible sites, mice and ungulates only had about 10% of accessible sites in common. Furthermore, conservation of accessibility was more prevalent at promoters than at intergenic regions. The lack of conserved accessibility at distal elements is consistent with rapid evolution of enhancers, and further emphasizes the need to annotate regulatory elements in individual species, rather than inferring elements based on homology. This atlas of chromatin accessibility in cattle and pig constitutes a substantial step towards annotating livestock genomes and dissecting the regulatory link between genome and phenome.

Abstract:
The Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin by sequencing (ATAC-seq) is becoming popular in the neuroscience field where chromatin regulation is thought to be involved in neurodevelopment, activity-dependent gene regulation, hormonal and environmental responses, and pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders. The advantages of using ATAC-seq include a small amount of material needed, fast protocol, and the ability to capture a range of gene regulatory elements with a single assay. With increasing interest in chromatin research, it is an imperative to have feasible, reliable assays that are compatible with a range of neuroscience study designs. Here we tested three protocols for neuronal chromatin accessibility analysis, including a varying brain tissue freezing method followed by fluorescence-activated nuclei sorting (FANS) and ATAC-seq. Our study shows that the cryopreservation method impacts the number of open chromatin regions identified from frozen brain tissue using ATAC-seq. However, we show that all protocols generate consistent and robust data and enable the identification of functional regulatory elements in neuronal cells. Our study implies that the broad biological interpretation of chromatin accessibility data is not significantly affected by the freezing condition. We also reveal additional challenges of doing chromatin analysis on post-mortem human brain tissue. Overall, ATAC-seq coupled with FANS is a powerful method to capture cell-type-specific chromatin accessibility information in mouse and human brain. Our study provides alternative brain preservation methods that generate high-quality ATAC-seq data while fitting in different study designs, and further encourages the use of this method to uncover the role of epigenetic (dys)regulation in the brain.

Authors: Udayakumar S. Vishnu, Pierre-Olivier Estève, Hang Gyeong Chin, Sriharsa Pradhan

Abstract:
Accessible chromatin landscape allows binding of transcription factors, and remodeling of promoter and enhancer elements during development. Chromatin accessibility along with integrated multiomics approaches have been used for determining molecular subtypes of cancer in patient samples. One-pot Universal NicE-seq (One-pot UniNicE-seq) is an improved accessible chromatin profiling method that negate DNA purification and incorporate sonication free enzymatic fragmentation before library preparation and is suited to a variety of mammalian cells. One-pot UniNicE-seq is versatile, capable of profiling 4% formaldehyde fixed chromatin in as low as 25 fixed cells. Accessible chromatin profile is more efficient on formaldehyde-fixed cells using one-pot UniNicE-seq compared to Tn5 transposon mediated methods, demonstrating its versatility. One-pot UniNicE-seq allows the entire process of accessible chromatin labeling and enrichment in one pot at 4% formaldehyde cross-linking conditions. It doesn’t require enzyme titration, compared to other technologies, since accessible chromatin is labelled with 5mC incorporation and deter degradation by nicking enzyme, thus opening the possibility for automation.

Title: A tissue dissociation method for ATAC-seq and CUT&RUN in Drosophila pupal tissues
Authors: Elli M. Buchert, Elizabeth A. Fogarty, Christopher M. Uyehara, Daniel J. McKay, Laura A. Buttitta
Date: 2023-05-21

Abstract:
Chromatin accessibility, histone modifications, and transcription factor binding are highly dynamic during Drosophila metamorphosis and drive global changes in gene expression as larval tissues differentiate into adult structures. Unfortunately, the presence of pupa cuticle on many Drosophila tissues during metamorphosis prevents enzyme access to cells and has limited the use of enzymatic in situ methods for assessing chromatin accessibility and histone modifications. Here, we present a dissociation method for cuticle-bound pupal tissues that is compatible for use with ATAC-Seq and CUT&RUN to interrogate chromatin accessibility and histone modifications. We show this method provides comparable chromatin accessibility data to the non-enzymatic approach FAIRE-seq, with only a fraction of the amount of input tissue required. This approach is also compatible with CUT&RUN, which allows genome-wide mapping of histone modifications with less than 1/10th of the tissue input required for more conventional approaches such as Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Sequencing (ChIP-seq). Our protocol makes it possible to use newer, more sensitive enzymatic in situ approaches to interrogate gene regulatory networks during Drosophila metamorphosis.

Authors: Duo Xu, Andre Neil Forbes, Sandra Cohen, Ann Palladino, Tatiana Karadimitriou, Ekta Khurana
Date: 2023-09-25

Abstract:
Regulatory networks containing enhancer-gene edges define cellular states. Multiple efforts have revealed these networks for reference tissues and cell lines by integrating multi-omics data. However, the methods developed cannot be applied for large patient cohorts due to the infeasibility of chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) for limited biopsy material. We trained machine-learning models using chromatin interaction analysis with paired-end tag sequencing (ChIA-PET) and high-throughput chromosome conformation capture combined with chromatin immunoprecipitation (HiChIP) data that can predict connections using only assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) and RNA-seq data as input, which can be generated from biopsies. Our method overcomes limitations of correlation-based approaches that cannot distinguish between distinct target genes of given enhancers or between active vs. poised states in different samples, a hallmark of network rewiring in cancer. Application of our model on 371 samples across 22 cancer types revealed 1,780 enhancer-gene connections for 602 cancer genes. Using CRISPR interference (CRISPRi), we validated enhancers predicted to regulate ESR1 in estrogen receptor (ER)+ breast cancer and A1CF in liver hepatocellular carcinoma.

Title: Differences in H3K4me3 and chromatin accessibility contribute to altered T‐cell receptor signaling in neonatal naïve CD4 T cells
Authors: Jennifer R Bermick, Priya Issuree, Aaron denDekker, Katherine A Gallagher, Donna Santillan, Steven Kunkel, Nicholas Lukacs, Matthew Schaller

Abstract:
Neonatal CD4 + T cells have reduced or delayed T‐cell receptor (TCR) signaling responses compared with adult cells, but the mechanisms underlying this are poorly understood. This study tested the hypothesis that human neonatal naïve CD4 + TCR signaling and activation deficits are related to differences in H3K4me3 patterning and chromatin accessibility. Following initiation of TCR signaling using anti‐CD3/anti‐CD28 beads, adult naïve CD4 + T cells demonstrated increased CD69, phospho‐CD3ε and interleukin (IL)‐2, tumor necrosis factor‐α (TNF‐α), interferon‐γ and IL‐17A compared with neonatal cells. By contrast, following TCR‐independent activation using phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)/ionomycin, neonatal cells demonstrated increased expression of CD69, IL‐2 and TNF‐α and equivalent phospho‐ERK compared with adult cells. H3K4me3 chromatin immunoprecipitation‐sequencing (ChIP‐seq) and assay for transposase‐accessible chromatin with high‐throughput sequencing (ATAC‐seq) were performed on separate cohorts of naïve CD4 + T cells from term neonates and adults, and RNA‐seq data from neonatal and adult naïve CD4 + T cells were obtained from the Blueprint Consortium. Adult cells demonstrated overall increased chromatin accessibility and a higher proportion of H3K4me3 sites associated with open chromatin and active gene transcription compared with neonatal cells. Adult cells demonstrated increased mRNA expression of the TCR‐associated genes FYN , ITK , CD4 , LCK and LAT , which was associated with increased H3K4me3 at the FYN and ITK gene loci and increased chromatin accessibility at the CD4 , LCK and LAT loci. These findings indicate that neonatal TCR‐dependent defects in activation are epigenetically regulated and provide a potentially targetable mechanism to enhance neonatal CD4 + T‐cell responses.

Abstract:
Most GWAS loci are presumed to affect gene regulation; however, only ∼43% colocalize with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). To address this colocalization gap, we map eQTLs, chromatin accessibility QTLs (caQTLs), and histone acetylation QTLs (haQTLs) using molecular samples from three early developmental-like tissues. Through colocalization, we annotate 10.4% ( n = 540) of GWAS loci in 15 traits by QTL phenotype, temporal specificity, and complexity. We show that integration of chromatin QTLs results in a 2.3-fold higher annotation rate of GWAS loci because they capture distal GWAS loci missed by eQTLs, and that 5.4% ( n = 13) of GWAS colocalizing eQTLs are early developmental specific. Finally, we utilize the iPSCORE multiomic QTLs to prioritize putative causal variants overlapping transcription factor motifs to elucidate the potential genetic underpinnings of 296 GWAS-QTL colocalizations.

Abstract:
Chromatin accessibility and gene expression in relevant cell contexts can guide identification of regulatory elements and mechanisms at genome-wide association study (GWAS) loci. To identify regulatory elements that display differential activity across adipocyte differentiation, we performed ATAC-seq and RNA-seq in a human cell model of preadipocytes and adipocytes at days 4 and 14 of differentiation. For comparison, we created a consensus map of ATAC-seq peaks in 11 human subcutaneous adipose tissue samples. We identified 58,387 context-dependent chromatin accessibility peaks and 3,090 context-dependent genes between all timepoint comparisons (log2 fold change>1, FDR<5%) with 15,919 adipocyte- and 18,244 preadipocyte-dependent peaks. Adipocyte-dependent peaks showed increased overlap (60.1%) with Roadmap Epigenomics adipocyte nuclei enhancers compared to preadipocyte-dependent peaks (11.5%). We linked context-dependent peaks to genes based on adipocyte promoter capture Hi-C data, overlap with adipose eQTL variants, and context-dependent gene expression. Of 16,167 context-dependent peaks linked to a gene, 5,145 were linked by two or more strategies to 1,670 genes. Among GWAS loci for cardiometabolic traits, adipocyte-dependent peaks, but not preadipocyte-dependent peaks, showed significant enrichment (LD score regression P<0.005) for waist-to-hip ratio and modest enrichment (P < 0.05) for HDL-cholesterol. We identified 659 peaks linked to 503 genes by two or more approaches and overlapping a GWAS signal, suggesting a regulatory mechanism at these loci. To identify variants that may alter chromatin accessibility between timepoints, we identified 582 variants in 454 context-dependent peaks that demonstrated allelic imbalance in accessibility (FDR<5%), of which 55 peaks also overlapped GWAS variants. At one GWAS locus for palmitoleic acid, rs603424 was located in an adipocyte-dependent peak linked to SCD and exhibited allelic differences in transcriptional activity in adipocytes (P = 0.003) but not preadipocytes (P = 0.09). These results demonstrate that context-dependent peaks and genes can guide discovery of regulatory variants at GWAS loci and aid identification of regulatory mechanisms.

Title: scATAC-seq generates more accurate and complete regulatory maps than bulk ATAC-seq
Authors: E. Ravza Gur, Jim R. Hughes
Date: 2025-01-29

Abstract:
Bulk ATAC-seq assays have been used to map and profile the chromatin accessibility of regulatory elements such as enhancers, promoters, and insulators. This has provided great insight into the regulation of gene expression in many cell types in a variety of organisms. To date, ATAC-seq has most often been used to provide an average evaluation of chromatin accessibility in populations of cells. The development of a single cell approach (scATAC-seq) assay enables researchers to evaluate chromatin accessibility in individual cells and identify sub-groups in mixed populations of cells. To investigate the full potential of single-cell epigenomic data, we have comprehensively compared the information derived from bulk ATAC-seq and scATAC-seq in populations of cells. We found that the chromatin architecture signal is the same using bulk ATAC-seq and scATAC-seq to analyse aliquots of the same cell population. However, scATAC-seq provides substantially higher data quality compared to bulk ATAC-seq improving the sensitivity to detect relatively weak, but functionally important ATAC-seq signals. Furthermore, we found that scATAC-seq identified differences in what was previously assumed to be a homogenous population of cells. Finally, we determined the number of cells required to generate aggregated open chromatin profiles from single cells and to identify biologically meaningful clusters after pseudo-bulking of data. This study illustrates the added value of using scATAC-seq rather than bulk ATAC-seq in evaluating both homogeneous and heterogeneous populations of cells. This paper provides a comprehensive guide on the benefits of using scATAC-seq data to study gene regulation.

Title: Optimized assay for transposase-accessible chromatin by sequencing (ATAC-seq) library preparation from adult Drosophila melanogaster neurons

Abstract:
Assay for transposase-accessible chromatin by sequencing (ATAC-seq) is rapidly becoming the assay of choice to investigate chromatin-mediated gene regulation, largely because of low input requirements, a fast workflow, and the ability to interrogate the entire genome in an untargeted manner. Many studies using ATAC-seq use mammalian or human-derived tissues, and established protocols work well in these systems. However, ATAC-seq is not yet widely used in Drosophila . Vinegar flies present several advantages over mammalian systems that make them an excellent model for ATAC-seq studies, including abundant genetic tools that allow straightforward targeting, transgene expression, and genetic manipulation that are not available in mammalian models. Because current ATAC-seq protocols are not optimized to use flies, we developed an optimized workflow that accounts for several complicating factors present in Drosophila . We examined parameters affecting nuclei isolation, including input size, freezing time, washing, and possible confounds from retinal pigments. Then, we optimized the enzymatic steps of library construction to account for the smaller Drosophila genome size. Finally, we used our optimized protocol to generate ATAC-seq libraries that meet ENCODE quality metrics. Our optimized protocol enables extensive ATAC-seq experiments in Drosophila , thereby leveraging the advantages of this powerful model system to understand chromatin-mediated gene regulation.

Abstract:
Drought resistance in plants is influenced by multiple signaling pathways that involve various transcription factors, many target genes, and multiple types of epigenetic modifications. Studies on epigenetic modifications of drought focus on DNA methylation and histone modifications, with fewer on chromatin remodeling. Changes in chromatin accessibility can play an important role in abiotic stress in plants by affecting RNA polymerase binding and various regulatory factors. However, the changes in chromatin accessibility during drought in apples are not well understood. In this study, the landscape of chromatin accessibility associated with the gene expression of apple (GL3) under drought conditions was analyzed by Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) and RNA-seq. Differential analysis between drought treatment and control identified 23,466 peaks of upregulated chromatin accessibility and 2447 peaks of downregulated accessibility. The drought-induced chromatin accessibility changed genes were mainly enriched in metabolism, stimulus, and binding pathways. By combining results from differential analysis of RNA-seq and ATAC-seq, we identified 240 genes with higher chromatin accessibility and increased gene expression under drought conditions that may play important functions in the drought response process. Among them, a total of nine transcription factor genes were identified, including ATHB7, HAT5, and WRKY26. These transcription factor genes are differentially expressed with different chromatin accessibility motif binding loci that may participate in apple response to drought by regulating downstream genes. Our study provides a reference for chromatin accessibility under drought stress in apples and the results will facilitate subsequent studies on chromatin remodelers and transcription factors.

Date: 2022-05-25

Abstract:
Gene regulation is critical for proper cellular function. Next-generation sequencing technology has revealed the presence of regulatory networks that regulate gene expression and essential cellular functions. Studies investigating the epigenome have begun to uncover the complex mechanisms regulating transcription. Assay for transposase-accessible chromatin by sequencing (ATAC-seq) is quickly becoming the assay of choice for many epigenomic investigations. However, whether intervention-mediated changes in accessible chromatin determined by ATAC-seq can be harnessed to generate intervention-inducible reporter constructs has not been systematically assayed. We used the insulin signaling pathway as a model to investigate chromatin regions and gene expression changes using ATAC- and RNA-seq in insulin-treated Drosophila S2 cells. We found correlations between ATAC- and RNA-seq data, especially when stratifying differentially-accessible chromatin regions by annotated feature type. In particular, our data demonstrated a weak but significant correlation between chromatin regions annotated to enhancers (1-2 kb from the transcription start site) and downstream gene expression. We cloned candidate enhancer regions upstream of luciferase and demonstrate insulin-inducibility of several of these reporters. Insulin-induced chromatin accessibility determined by ATAC-seq reveals enhancer regions that drive insulin-inducible reporter gene expression.

Date: 2023-11-22

Abstract:
Correlation metrics are widely utilized in genomics analysis and often implemented with little regard to assumptions of normality, homoscedasticity, and independence of values. This is especially true when comparing values between replicated sequencing experiments that probe chromatin accessibility, such as assays for transposase-accessible chromatin via sequencing (ATAC-seq). Such data can possess several regions across the human genome with little to no sequencing depth and are thus non-normal with a large portion of zero values. Despite distributed use in the epigenomics field, few studies have evaluated and benchmarked how correlation and association statistics behave across ATAC-seq experiments with known differences or the effects of removing specific outliers from the data. Here, we developed a computational simulation of ATAC-seq data to elucidate the behavior of correlation statistics and to compare their accuracy under set conditions of reproducibility. Using these simulations, we monitored the behavior of several correlation statistics, including the Pearson’s R and Spearman’s \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

Collectively, this study demonstrates how measures of correlation and association can behave in epigenomics experiments. We provide improved strategies for quantifying relationships in these increasingly prevalent and important chromatin accessibility assays.

Title: ATAC-seq reveals alterations in open chromatin in pancreatic islets from subjects with type 2 diabetes

Abstract:
Impaired insulin secretion from pancreatic islets is a hallmark of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Altered chromatin structure may contribute to the disease. We therefore studied the impact of T2D on open chromatin in human pancreatic islets. We used assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) to profile open chromatin in islets from T2D and non-diabetic donors. We identified 57,105 and 53,284 ATAC-seq peaks representing open chromatin regions in islets of non-diabetic and diabetic donors, respectively. The majority of ATAC-seq peaks mapped near transcription start sites. Additionally, peaks were enriched in enhancer regions and in regions where islet-specific transcription factors (TFs), e.g. FOXA2, MAFB, NKX2.2, NKX6.1 and PDX1, bind. Islet ATAC-seq peaks overlap with 13 SNPs associated with T2D (e.g. rs7903146, rs2237897, rs757209, rs11708067 and rs878521 near TCF7L2 , KCNQ1 , HNF1B , ADCY5 and GCK , respectively) and with additional 67 SNPs in LD with known T2D SNPs (e.g. SNPs annotated to GIPR , KCNJ11 , GLIS3 , IGF2BP2 , FTO and PPARG ). There was enrichment of open chromatin regions near highly expressed genes in human islets. Moreover, 1,078 open chromatin peaks, annotated to 898 genes, differed in prevalence between diabetic and non-diabetic islet donors. Some of these peaks are annotated to candidate genes for T2D and islet dysfunction (e.g. HHEX , HMGA2 , GLIS3 , MTNR1B and PARK2 ) and some overlap with SNPs associated with T2D (e.g. rs3821943 near WFS1 and rs508419 near ANK1 ). Enhancer regions and motifs specific to key TFs including BACH2, FOXO1, FOXA2, NEUROD1, MAFA and PDX1 were enriched in differential islet ATAC-seq peaks of T2D versus non-diabetic donors. Our study provides new understanding into how T2D alters the chromatin landscape, and thereby accessibility for TFs and gene expression, in human pancreatic islets.

Abstract:
Regulation of chromatin structure and accessibility determines the transcription activities of genes, which endows the host with function-specific patterns of gene expression. Upon viral infection, the innate immune responses provide the first line of defense, allowing rapid production of variegated antiviral cytokines. Knowledge on how chromatin accessibility is regulated during host defense against viral infection remains limited. Our previous work found that the nuclear matrix protein SAFA surveilled viral RNA and regulated antiviral immune genes expression. However, how SAFA regulates the specific induction of antiviral immune genes remains unknown. Here, through integration of RNA-seq, ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq assays, we found that the depletion of SAFA specifically decreased the chromatin accessibility, activation and expression of virus induced genes. And mutation assays suggested that the RNA-binding ability of SAFA was essential for its function in regulating antiviral chromatin accessibility. RIP-seq results showed that SAFA exclusively bound with antiviral related RNAs following viral infection. Further, we combined the CRISPR-Cas13d mediated RNA knockdown system with ATAC-qPCR, and demonstrated that the binding between SAFA and according antiviral RNAs specifically mediated the openness of the corresponding chromatin and following robust transcription of antiviral genes. Moreover, knockdown of these associated RNAs dampened the accessibility of related genes in an extranuclear signaling pathway dependent manner. Interestingly, VSV infection cleaved SAFA protein at the C-terminus which deprived its RNA binding ability for immune evasion. Thus, our results demonstrated that SAFA and the interacting RNA products collaborated and remodeled chromatin accessibility to facilitate antiviral innate immune responses.

Abstract:
There is very little information about how the genome is regulated in domestic pigs ( Sus scrofa ). This lack of knowledge hinders efforts to define and predict the effects of genetic variants in pig breeding programs. To address this knowledge gap, we need to identify regulatory sequences in the pig genome starting with regions of open chromatin. We used the “Improved Protocol for the Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin (Omni-ATAC-Seq)” to identify putative regulatory regions in flash-frozen semitendinosus muscle from 24 male piglets. We collected samples from the smallest-, average-, and largest-sized male piglets from each litter through five developmental time points. Of the 4661 ATAC-Seq peaks identified that represent regions of open chromatin, >50% were within 1 kb of known transcription start sites. Differential read count analysis revealed 377 ATAC-Seq defined genomic regions where chromatin accessibility differed significantly across developmental time points. We found regions of open chromatin associated with downregulation of genes involved in muscle development that were present in small-sized fetal piglets but absent in large-sized fetal piglets at day 90 of gestation. The dataset that we have generated provides a resource for studies of genome regulation in pigs and contributes valuable functional annotation information to filter genetic variants for use in genomic selection in pig breeding programs.

Abstract:
The “Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin sequencing” (ATAC-seq) is an efficient and easy to implement protocol to measure chromatin accessibility that has been widely used in multiple applications studying gene regulation. While several modifications or variants of the protocol have been published since it was first described, there has not yet been an extensive evaluation of the effects of specific protocol choices head-to-head in a consistent experimental setting. In this study, we tested multiple protocol options for major ATAC-seq components (including three reaction buffers, two reaction temperatures, two enzyme sources, and the use of either native or fixed nuclei) in a well-characterized cell line. With all possible combinations of components, we created 24 experimental conditions with four replicates for each (a total of 96 samples). In addition, we tested the 12 native conditions in a primary sample type (mouse lung tissue) with two different input amounts. Through these extensive comparisons, we were able to observe the effect of different ATAC-seq conditions on data quality and to examine the utility and potential redundancy of various quality metrics. In general, native samples yielded more peaks (particularly at loci not overlapping transcription start sites) than fixed samples, and the temperature at which the enzymatic reaction was carried out had a major impact on data quality metrics for both fixed and native nuclei. However, the effect of various conditions tested was not always consistent between the native and fixed samples. For example, the Nextera and Omni buffers were largely interchangeable across all other conditions, while the THS buffer resulted in markedly different profiles in native samples. In-house and commercial enzymes performed similarly. We found that the relationship between commonly used measures of library quality differed across temperature and fixation, and so evaluating multiple metrics in assessing the quality of a sample is recommended. Notably, we also found that these choices can bias the functional class of elements profiled and so we recommend evaluating several formulations in any new experiments. Finally, we hope the ATAC-seq workflow formulated in this study on crosslinked samples will help to profile archival clinical specimens.

Title: Characterization of the accessible genome in the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum

Date: 2018-10-12

Abstract:
Human malaria is a devastating disease and a major cause of poverty in resource-limited countries. To develop and adapt within hosts Plasmodium falciparum undergoes drastic switches in gene expression. To identify regulatory regions in the parasite genome, we performed genome-wide profiling of chromatin accessibility in two culture-adapted isogenic subclones at four developmental stages during the intraerythrocytic cycle by using the Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin by sequencing (ATAC-seq). Tn5 transposase hypersensitivity sites (THSSs) localize preferentially at transcriptional start sites (TSSs). Chromatin accessibility by ATAC-seq is predictive of active transcription and of the levels of histone marks H3K9ac and H3K4me3. Our assay allows the identification of novel regulatory regions including TSS and enhancer-like elements. We show that the dynamics in the accessible chromatin profile matches temporal transcription during development. Motif analysis of stage-specific ATAC-seq sites predicts the in vivo binding sites and function of multiple ApiAP2 transcription factors. At last, the alternative expression states of some clonally variant genes (CVGs), including eba, phist, var and clag genes, associate with a differential ATAC-seq signal at their promoters. Altogether, this study identifies genome-wide regulatory regions likely to play an essential function in the developmental transitions and in CVG expression in P. falciparum .

Abstract:
Cellular function in tissue is dependent on the local environment, requiring new methods for spatial mapping of biomolecules and cells in the tissue context 1 . The emergence of spatial transcriptomics has enabled genome-scale gene expression mapping 2 – 5 , but the ability to capture spatial epigenetic information of tissue at the cellular level and genome scale is lacking. Here we describe a method for spatially resolved chromatin accessibility profiling of tissue sections using next-generation sequencing (spatial-ATAC-seq) by combining in situ Tn5 transposition chemistry 6 and microfluidic deterministic barcoding 5 . Profiling mouse embryos using spatial-ATAC-seq delineated tissue-region-specific epigenetic landscapes and identified gene regulators involved in the development of the central nervous system. Mapping the accessible genome in the mouse and human brain revealed the intricate arealization of brain regions. Applying spatial-ATAC-seq to tonsil tissue resolved the spatially distinct organization of immune cell types and states in lymphoid follicles and extrafollicular zones. This technology progresses spatial biology by enabling spatially resolved chromatin accessibility profiling to improve our understanding of cell identity, cell state and cell fate decision in relation to epigenetic underpinnings in development and disease.

Abstract:
Recently developed single-cell technologies allow researchers to characterize cell states at ever greater resolution and scale. Caenorhabditis elegans is a particularly tractable system for studying development, and recent single-cell RNA-seq studies characterized the gene expression patterns for nearly every cell type in the embryo and at the second larval stage (L2). Gene expression patterns give insight about gene function and into the biochemical state of different cell types; recent advances in other single-cell genomics technologies can now also characterize the regulatory context of the genome that gives rise to these gene expression levels at a single-cell resolution. To explore the regulatory DNA of individual cell types in C. elegans , we collected single-cell chromatin accessibility data using the sci-ATAC-seq assay in L2 larvae to match the available single-cell RNA-seq data set. By using a novel implementation of the latent Dirichlet allocation algorithm, we identify 37 clusters of cells that correspond to different cell types in the worm, providing new maps of putative cell type–specific gene regulatory sites, with promise for better understanding of cellular differentiation and gene regulation.

Abstract:
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), like many other neurodegenerative diseases, is highly heritable, but with only a small fraction of cases explained by monogenic disease alleles. To better understand sporadic ALS, we report epigenomic profiles, as measured by ATAC-seq, of motor neuron cultures derived from a diverse group of 380 ALS patients and 80 healthy controls. We find that chromatin accessibility is heavily influenced by sex, the iPSC cell type of origin, ancestry, and the inherent variance arising from sequencing. Once these covariates are corrected for, we are able to identify ALS-specific signals in the data. Additionally, we find that the ATAC-seq data is able to predict ALS disease progression rates with similar accuracy to methods based on biomarkers and clinical status. These results suggest that iPSC-derived motor neurons recapitulate important disease-relevant epigenomic changes.

Title: Profiling of chromatin accessibility identifies transcription factor binding sites across the genome of Aspergillus species
Authors: Lianggang Huang, Xuejie Li, Liangbo Dong, Bin Wang, Li Pan
Date: 2021-09-06

Abstract:
The identification of open chromatin regions and transcription factor binding sites (TFBs) is an important step in understanding the regulation of gene expression in diverse species. ATAC-seq is a technique used for such purpose by providing high-resolution measurements of chromatin accessibility revealed through integration of Tn5 transposase. However, the existence of cell walls in filamentous fungi and associated difficulty in purifying nuclei have precluded the routine application of this technique, leading to a lack of experimentally determined and computationally inferred data on the identity of genome-wide cis -regulatory elements (CREs) and TFBs. In this study, we constructed an ATAC-seq platform suitable for filamentous fungi and generated ATAC-seq libraries of Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus oryzae grown under a variety of conditions. We applied the ATAC-seq assay for filamentous fungi to delineate the syntenic orthologue and differentially changed chromatin accessibility regions among different Aspergillus species, during different culture conditions, and among specific TF-deleted strains. The syntenic orthologues of accessible regions were responsible for the conservative functions across Aspergillus species, while regions differentially changed between culture conditions and TFs mutants drove differential gene expression programs. Importantly, we suggest criteria to determine TFBs through the analysis of unbalanced cleavage of distinct TF-bound DNA strands by Tn5 transposase. Based on this criterion, we constructed data libraries of the in vivo genomic footprint of A. niger under distinct conditions, and generated a database of novel transcription factor binding motifs through comparison of footprints in TF-deleted strains. Furthermore, we validated the novel TFBs in vivo through an artificial synthetic minimal promoter system. We characterized the chromatin accessibility regions of filamentous fungi species, and identified a complete TFBs map by ATAC-seq, which provides valuable data for future analyses of transcriptional regulation in filamentous fungi.

Abstract:
Single‐cell technologies allow measuring chromatin accessibility and gene expression in each cell, but jointly utilizing both layers to map bona fide gene regulatory networks and enhancers remains challenging. Here, we generate independent single‐cell RNA ‐seq and single‐cell ATAC ‐seq atlases of the Drosophila eye‐antennal disc and spatially integrate the data into a virtual latent space that mimics the organization of the 2D tissue using Sco MAP (Single‐Cell Omics Mapping into spatial Axes using Pseudotime ordering). To validate spatially predicted enhancers, we use a large collection of enhancer–reporter lines and identify ~ 85% of enhancers in which chromatin accessibility and enhancer activity are coupled. Next, we infer enhancer‐to‐gene relationships in the virtual space, finding that genes are mostly regulated by multiple, often redundant, enhancers. Exploiting cell type‐specific enhancers, we deconvolute cell type‐specific effects of bulk‐derived chromatin accessibility QTL s. Finally, we discover that Prospero drives neuronal differentiation through the binding of a GGG motif. In summary, we provide a comprehensive spatial characterization of gene regulation in a 2D tissue.

Date: 2020-02-03

Abstract:
Assay of Transposase Accessible Chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq) is widely used in studying chromatin biology, but a comprehensive review of the analysis tools has not been completed yet. Here, we discuss the major steps in ATAC-seq data analysis, including pre-analysis (quality check and alignment), core analysis (peak calling), and advanced analysis (peak differential analysis and annotation, motif enrichment, footprinting, and nucleosome position analysis). We also review the reconstruction of transcriptional regulatory networks with multiomics data and highlight the current challenges of each step. Finally, we describe the potential of single-cell ATAC-seq and highlight the necessity of developing ATAC-seq specific analysis tools to obtain biologically meaningful insights. Supplementary information accompanies this paper at 10.1186/s13059-020-1929-3.

Title: Reorganization of postmitotic neuronal chromatin accessibility for maturation of serotonergic identity
Authors: Xinrui L Zhang, William C Spencer, Nobuko Tabuchi, Meagan M Kitt, Evan S Deneris, Paschalis Kratsios
Date: 2022-04-26

Abstract:
Assembly of transcriptomes encoding unique neuronal identities requires selective accessibility of transcription factors to cis-regulatory sequences in nucleosome-embedded postmitotic chromatin. Yet, the mechanisms controlling postmitotic neuronal chromatin accessibility are poorly understood. Here, we show that unique distal enhancers define the Pet1 neuron lineage that generates serotonin (5-HT) neurons in mice. Heterogeneous single-cell chromatin landscapes are established early in postmitotic Pet1 neurons and reveal the putative regulatory programs driving Pet1 neuron subtype identities. Distal enhancer accessibility is highly dynamic as Pet1 neurons mature, suggesting the existence of regulatory factors that reorganize postmitotic neuronal chromatin. We find that Pet1 and Lmx1b control chromatin accessibility to select Pet1 -lineage-specific enhancers for 5-HT neurotransmission. Additionally, these factors are required to maintain chromatin accessibility during early maturation suggesting that postmitotic neuronal open chromatin is unstable and requires continuous regulatory input. Together, our findings reveal postmitotic transcription factors that reorganize accessible chromatin for neuron specialization.

Abstract:
Transcription factors read the genome, fundamentally connecting DNA sequence to gene expression across diverse cell types. Determining how, where, and when TFs bind chromatin will advance our understanding of gene regulatory networks and cellular behavior. The 2017 ENCODE-DREAM in vivo Transcription-Factor Binding Site ( TFBS ) Prediction Challenge highlighted the value of chromatin accessibility data to TFBS prediction, establishing state-of-the-art methods for TFBS prediction from DNase-seq. However, the more recent Assay-for-Transposase-Accessible-Chromatin (ATAC)-seq has surpassed DNase-seq as the most widely-used chromatin accessibility profiling method. Furthermore, ATAC-seq is the only such technique available at single-cell resolution from standard commercial platforms. While ATAC-seq datasets grow exponentially, suboptimal motif scanning is unfortunately the most common method for TFBS prediction from ATAC-seq. To enable community access to state-of-the-art TFBS prediction from ATAC-seq, we (1) curated an extensive benchmark dataset (127 TFs) for ATAC-seq model training and (2) built “ maxATAC ”, a suite of user-friendly, deep neural network models for genome-wide TFBS prediction from ATAC-seq in any cell type. With models available for 127 human TFs, maxATAC is the largest collection of high-performance TFBS prediction models for ATAC-seq. maxATAC performance extends to primary cells and single-cell ATAC-seq, enabling improved TFBS prediction in vivo . We demonstrate maxATAC’s capabilities by identifying TFBS associated with allele-dependent chromatin accessibility at atopic dermatitis genetic risk loci.

Date: 2021-08

Abstract:
Assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing ( ATAC-seq ) is a technique widely used to investigate genome-wide chromatin accessibility . The recently published Omni-ATAC-seq protocol substantially improves the signal/noise ratio and reduces the input cell number. High-quality data are critical to ensure accurate analysis. Several tools have been developed for assessing sequencing quality and insertion size distribution for ATAC-seq data; however, key quality control (QC) metrics have not yet been established to accurately determine the quality of ATAC-seq data. Here, we optimized the analysis strategy for ATAC-seq and defined a series of QC metrics for ATAC-seq data, including reads under peak ratio (RUPr), background (BG), promoter enrichment (ProEn), subsampling enrichment (SubEn), and other measurements. We incorporated these QC tests into our recently developed ATAC-seq Integrative Analysis Package (AIAP) to provide a complete ATAC-seq analysis system, including quality assurance, improved peak calling, and downstream differential analysis . We demonstrated a significant improvement of sensitivity (20%–60%) in both peak calling and differential analysis by processing paired-end ATAC-seq datasets using AIAP. AIAP is compiled into Docker/Singularity, and it can be executed by one command line to generate a comprehensive QC report. We used ENCODE ATAC-seq data to benchmark and generate QC recommendations, and developed qATACViewer for the user-friendly interaction with the QC report. The software, source code, and documentation of AIAP are freely available at https://github.com/Zhang-lab/ATAC-seq_QC_analysis .

Abstract:
Inositol polyphosphate multikinase (IPMK), a key enzyme in inositol polyphosphate (IP) metabolism, is a pleiotropic signaling factor involved in major biological events, including transcriptional control. In the yeast, IPMK and its IP products promote the activity of the chromatin remodeling complex SWI/SNF, which plays a critical role in gene expression by regulating chromatin accessibility. However, the direct link between IPMK and chromatin remodelers remains unclear, raising the question of how IPMK contributes to transcriptional regulation in mammals. By employing unbiased screening approaches and in vivo/in vitro immunoprecipitation, here we demonstrate that mammalian IPMK physically interacts with the SWI/SNF complex by directly binding to SMARCB1, BRG1, and SMARCC1. Furthermore, we identified the specific domains required for IPMK-SMARCB1 binding. Notably, using CUT&RUN and ATAC-seq assays, we discovered that IPMK co-localizes with BRG1 and regulates BRG1 localization as well as BRG1-mediated chromatin accessibility in a genome-wide manner in mouse embryonic stem cells. Together, these findings show that IPMK regulates the promoter targeting of the SWI/SNF complex, thereby contributing to SWI/SNF-meditated chromatin accessibility, transcription, and differentiation in mouse embryonic stem cells.

Date: 2021-03-08

Abstract:
ATAC-seq is a widely-applied assay used to measure genome-wide chromatin accessibility; however, its ability to detect active regulatory regions can depend on the depth of sequencing coverage and the signal-to-noise ratio. Here we introduce AtacWorks, a deep learning toolkit to denoise sequencing coverage and identify regulatory peaks at base-pair resolution from low cell count, low-coverage, or low-quality ATAC-seq data. Models trained by AtacWorks can detect peaks from cell types not seen in the training data, and are generalizable across diverse sample preparations and experimental platforms. We demonstrate that AtacWorks enhances the sensitivity of single-cell experiments by producing results on par with those of conventional methods using ~10 times as many cells, and further show that this framework can be adapted to enable cross-modality inference of protein-DNA interactions. Finally, we establish that AtacWorks can enable new biological discoveries by identifying active regulatory regions associated with lineage priming in rare subpopulations of hematopoietic stem cells.

Title: SeATAC: a tool for exploring the chromatin landscape and the role of pioneer factors
Authors: Wuming Gong, Nikita Dsouza, Daniel J. Garry
Date: 2023-05-22

Abstract:
Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin with sequencing (ATAC-seq) reveals chromatin accessibility across the genome. Currently, no method specifically detects differential chromatin accessibility. Here, SeATAC uses a conditional variational autoencoder model to learn the latent representation of ATAC-seq V-plots and outperforms MACS2 and NucleoATAC on six separate tasks. Applying SeATAC to several pioneer factor-induced differentiation or reprogramming ATAC-seq datasets suggests that induction of these factors not only relaxes the closed chromatin but also decreases chromatin accessibility of 20% to 30% of their target sites. SeATAC is a novel tool to accurately reveal genomic regions with differential chromatin accessibility from ATAC-seq data.

Title: ATAC-seq normalization method can significantly affect differential accessibility analysis and interpretation
Authors: Jake J. Reske, Mike R. Wilson, Ronald L. Chandler
Date: 2020-04-22

Abstract:
Chromatin dysregulation is associated with developmental disorders and cancer. Numerous methods for measuring genome-wide chromatin accessibility have been developed in the genomic era to interrogate the function of chromatin regulators. A recent technique which has gained widespread use due to speed and low input requirements with native chromatin is the Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin, or ATAC-seq. Biologists have since used this method to compare chromatin accessibility between two cellular conditions. However, approaches for calculating differential accessibility can yield conflicting results, and little emphasis is placed on choice of normalization method during differential ATAC-seq analysis, especially when global chromatin alterations might be expected. Using an in vivo ATAC-seq data set generated in our recent report, we observed differences in chromatin accessibility patterns depending on the data normalization method used to calculate differential accessibility. This observation was further verified on published ATAC-seq data from yeast. We propose a generalized workflow for differential accessibility analysis using ATAC-seq data. We further show this workflow identifies sites of differential chromatin accessibility that correlate with gene expression and is sensitive to differential analysis using negative controls. We argue that researchers should systematically compare multiple normalization methods before continuing with differential accessibility analysis. ATAC-seq users should be aware of the interpretations of potential bias within experimental data and the assumptions of the normalization method implemented.

Abstract:
Spatially resolved omics technologies reveal context-dependent cellular regulatory networks in tissues of interest. Beyond transcriptome analysis, information on epigenetic traits and chromatin accessibility can provide further insights on gene regulation in health and disease. Nevertheless, compared to the enormous advancements in spatial transcriptomics technologies, the field of spatial epigenomics is much younger and still underexplored. In this study, we report laser capture microdissection coupled to ATAC-seq (LCM-ATAC-seq) applied to fresh frozen samples for the spatial characterization of chromatin accessibility. We first demonstrate the efficient use of LCM coupled to in situ tagmentation and evaluate its performance as a function of cell number, microdissected areas, and tissue type. Further, we demonstrate its use for the targeted chromatin accessibility analysis of discrete contiguous or scattered cell populations in tissues via single-nuclei capture based on immunostaining for specific cellular markers.

Title: Optimization of ATAC-seq in wheat seedling roots using INTACT-isolated nuclei

Date: 2023-05-22

Abstract:
The genetic information contained in the genome of an organism is organized in genes and regulatory elements that control gene expression. The genomes of multiple plants species have already been sequenced and the gene repertory have been annotated, however, cis -regulatory elements remain less characterized, limiting our understanding of genome functionality. These elements act as open platforms for recruiting both positive- and negative-acting transcription factors, and as such, chromatin accessibility is an important signature for their identification. In this work we developed a transgenic INTACT [isolation of nuclei tagged in specific cell types] system in tetraploid wheat for nuclei purifications. Then, we combined the INTACT system together with the assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing [ATAC-seq] to identify open chromatin regions in wheat root tip samples. Our ATAC-seq results showed a large enrichment of open chromatin regions in intergenic and promoter regions, which is expected for regulatory elements and that is similar to ATAC-seq results obtained in other plant species. In addition, root ATAC-seq peaks showed a significant overlap with a previously published ATAC-seq data from wheat leaf protoplast, indicating a high reproducibility between the two experiments and a large overlap between open chromatin regions in root and leaf tissues. Importantly, we observed overlap between ATAC-seq peaks and cis -regulatory elements that have been functionally validated in wheat, and a good correlation between normalized accessibility and gene expression levels. We have developed and validated an INTACT system in tetraploid wheat that allows rapid and high-quality nuclei purification from root tips. Those nuclei were successfully used to performed ATAC-seq experiments that revealed open chromatin regions in the wheat genome that will be useful to identify cis-regulatory elements. The INTACT system presented here will facilitate the development of ATAC-seq datasets in other tissues, growth stages, and under different growing conditions to generate a more complete landscape of the accessible DNA regions in the wheat genome.

Abstract:
We apply a single-molecule chromatin fiber sequencing (Fiber-seq) protocol designed for amplification-free cell-type-specific mapping of the regulatory architecture at nucleosome resolution along extended ∼10-kb chromatin fibers to neuronal and non-neuronal nuclei sorted from human brain tissue . Specifically, application of this method enables the resolution of cell-selective promoter and enhancer architectures on single fibers, including transcription factor footprinting and position mapping, with sequence-specific fixation of nucleosome arrays flanking transcription start sites and regulatory motifs. We uncover haplotype-specific chromatin patterns, multiple regulatory elements cis -aligned on individual fibers, and accessible chromatin at 20,000 unique sites encompassing retrotransposons and other repeat sequences hitherto “unmappable” by short-read epigenomic sequencing. Overall, we show that Fiber-seq is applicable to human brain tissue, offering sharp demarcation of nucleosome-depleted regions at sites of open chromatin in conjunction with multi-kilobase nucleosomal positioning at single-fiber resolution on a genome-wide scale.

Abstract:
Mammalian sperm show an unusual and heavily compacted genomic packaging state. In addition to its role in organizing the compact and hydrodynamic sperm head, it has been proposed that sperm chromatin architecture helps to program gene expression in the early embryo. Scores of genome-wide surveys in sperm have reported patterns of chromatin accessibility, nucleosome localization, histone modification, and chromosome folding. Here, we revisit these studies in light of recent reports that sperm obtained from the mouse epididymis are contaminated with low levels of cell-free chromatin. In the absence of proper sperm lysis, we readily recapitulate multiple prominent genome-wide surveys of sperm chromatin, suggesting that these profiles primarily reflect contaminating cell-free chromatin. Removal of cell-free DNA, and appropriate lysis conditions, are together required to reveal a sperm chromatin state distinct from most previous reports. Using ATAC-seq to explore relatively accessible genomic loci, we identify a landscape of open loci associated with early development and transcriptional control. Histone modification and chromosome folding profiles also strongly support the hypothesis that prior studies suffer from contamination, but technical challenges associated with reliably preserving the architecture of the compacted sperm head prevent us from confidently assaying true localization patterns for these epigenetic marks. Together, our studies show that our knowledge of chromosome packaging in mammalian sperm remains largely incomplete, and motivate future efforts to more accurately characterize genome organization in mature sperm.

Abstract:
Identification of the cis-regulatory elements controlling cell-type specific gene expression patterns is essential for understanding the origin of cellular diversity. Conventional assays to map regulatory elements via open chromatin analysis of primary tissues is hindered by sample heterogeneity. Single cell analysis of accessible chromatin (scATAC-seq) can overcome this limitation. However, the high-level noise of each single cell profile and the large volume of data pose unique computational challenges. Here, we introduce SnapATAC, a software package for analyzing scATAC-seq datasets. SnapATAC dissects cellular heterogeneity in an unbiased manner and map the trajectories of cellular states. Using the Nyström method, SnapATAC can process data from up to a million cells. Furthermore, SnapATAC incorporates existing tools into a comprehensive package for analyzing single cell ATAC-seq dataset. As demonstration of its utility, SnapATAC is applied to 55,592 single-nucleus ATAC-seq profiles from the mouse secondary motor cortex. The analysis reveals ~370,000 candidate regulatory elements in 31 distinct cell populations in this brain region and inferred candidate cell-type specific transcriptional regulators.

Abstract:
The assay for transposase accessible chromatin (ATAC-seq) is a method for mapping genome-wide chromatin accessibility. Coupled with high-throughput sequencing, it enables integrative epigenomics analyses. ATAC-seq requires direct access to cell nuclei, a major challenge in non-model species such as small invertebrates, whose soft tissue is surrounded by a protective exoskeleton. Here, we present modifications of the ATAC-seq protocol for applications in small crustaceans, extending applications to non-model species.

Title: Comparative epigenetics of domestic animals: focusing on DNA accessibility and its impact on gene regulation and traits
Authors: Jeong-Woon Lee, Je-Yoel Cho
Date: 2025-01

Abstract:
Chromatin accessibility is vital for gene regulation, determining the ability of DNA-binding proteins to access the genomic regions and drive transcriptional activity, reflecting environmental changes. Although human and murine studies have advanced the understanding of chromatin dynamics, domestic animals remain comparatively underexplored despite their importance in agriculture and veterinary medicine. Investigating the accessibility of chromatin in these species is crucial for improving traits such as productivity, disease resistance, and environmental adaptation. This review assessed chromatin accessibility research in domestic animals, highlighting its significance in understanding and improving livestock traits. This review outlines chromatin accessibility research in domestic animals, focusing on critical developmental processes, tissue-specific regulation, and economically significant traits. Advances in techniques, such as Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing, have enabled detailed mapping of regulatory elements, shedding light on epigenetic regulation of traits, such as muscle development and productivity. Comparative studies have uncovered conserved and species-specific cis-regulatory elements across multiple species. These findings offer insights into regulatory mechanisms that can enhance breeding strategies and animal management. In addition, high-throughput techniques, such as single-cell analysis and deep-learning models, have advanced the study of chromatin accessibility in lesser-studied species. Chromatin accessibility is crucial in gene regulation in domestic animals, influencing development, immune response, and productivity. Despite the progress, more comprehensive epigenomic datasets and cross-species analytical tools are needed to harness chromatin accessibility in domestic animal research. Understanding these mechanisms has practical applications in improving livestock traits, advancing breeding programs, and developing disease-resistant animals, highlighting the importance of integrating epigenetic and genomic tools for enhancing animal health and productivity.

Abstract:
Precise gene dosage of the X chromosomes is critical for normal development and cellular function. In mice, XX female somatic cells show transcriptional X chromosome upregulation of their single active X chromosome, while the other X chromosome is inactive. Moreover, the inactive X chromosome is reactivated during development in the inner cell mass and in germ cells through X chromosome reactivation, which can be studied in vitro by reprogramming of somatic cells to pluripotency. How chromatin processes and gene regulatory networks evolved to regulate X chromosome dosage in the somatic state and during X chromosome reactivation remains unclear. Using genome-wide approaches, allele-specific ATAC-seq and single-cell RNA-seq, in female embryonic fibroblasts and during reprogramming to pluripotency, we show that chromatin accessibility on the upregulated mammalian active X chromosome is increased compared to autosomes. We further show that increased accessibility on the active X chromosome is erased by reprogramming, accompanied by erasure of transcriptional X chromosome upregulation and the loss of increased transcriptional burst frequency. In addition, we characterize gene regulatory networks during reprogramming and X chromosome reactivation, revealing changes in regulatory states. Our data show that ZFP42/REX1, a pluripotency-associated gene that evolved specifically in placental mammals, targets multiple X-linked genes, suggesting an evolutionary link between ZFP42/REX1, X chromosome reactivation, and pluripotency. Our data reveal the existence of intrinsic compensatory mechanisms that involve modulation of chromatin accessibility to counteract X-to-Autosome gene dosage imbalances caused by evolutionary or in vitro X chromosome loss and X chromosome inactivation in mammalian cells.

Title: Dynamics and regulation of mitotic chromatin accessibility bookmarking at single-cell resolution
Authors: Qiaoni Yu, Xu Liu, Jingwen Fang, Huihui Wu, Chuang Guo, Wen Zhang, Nianping Liu, Chen Jiang, Qing Sha, Xiao Yuan, Zhikai Wang, Kun Qu
Date: 2023-01

Abstract:
Although mitotic chromosomes are highly compacted and transcriptionally inert, some active chromatin features are retained during mitosis to ensure the proper postmitotic reestablishment of maternal transcriptional programs, a phenomenon termed “mitotic bookmarking.” However, the dynamics and regulation of mitotic bookmarking have not been systemically surveyed. Using single-cell transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (scATAC-seq), we examined 6538 mitotic L02 human liver cells of variable stages and found that chromatin accessibility remained changing throughout cell division, with a constant decrease until metaphase and a gradual increase as chromosomes segregated. In particular, a subset of chromatin regions were identified to remain open throughout mitosis, and genes associated with these bookmarked regions are primarily linked to rapid reactivation upon mitotic exit. We also demonstrated that nuclear transcription factor Y subunit α (NF-YA) preferentially occupied bookmarked regions and contributed to transcriptional reactivation after mitosis. Our study uncovers the dynamic and regulatory blueprint of mitotic bookmarking.

Title: ERK1/2 signalling dynamics promote neural differentiation by regulating chromatin accessibility and the polycomb repressive complex
Authors: Claudia I. Semprich, Lindsay Davidson, Adriana Amorim Torres, Harshil Patel, James Briscoe, Vicki Metzis, Kate G. Storey
Date: 2022-12-01

Abstract:
Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) is a neural inducer in many vertebrate embryos, but how it regulates chromatin organization to coordinate the activation of neural genes is unclear. Moreover, for differentiation to progress, FGF signalling must decline. Why these signalling dynamics are required has not been determined. Here, we show that dephosphorylation of the FGF effector kinase ERK1/2 rapidly increases chromatin accessibility at neural genes in mouse embryos, and, using ATAC-seq in human embryonic stem cell derived spinal cord precursors, we demonstrate that this occurs genome-wide across neural genes. Importantly, ERK1/2 inhibition induces precocious neural gene transcription, and this involves dissociation of the polycomb repressive complex from key gene loci. This takes place independently of subsequent loss of the repressive histone mark H3K27me3 and transcriptional onset. Transient ERK1/2 inhibition is sufficient for the dissociation of the repressive complex, and this is not reversed on resumption of ERK1/2 signalling. Moreover, genomic footprinting of sites identified by ATAC-seq together with ChIP-seq for polycomb protein Ring1B revealed that ERK1/2 inhibition promotes the occupancy of neural transcription factors (TFs) at non-polycomb as well as polycomb associated sites. Together, these findings indicate that ERK1/2 signalling decline promotes global changes in chromatin accessibility and TF binding at neural genes by directing polycomb and other regulators and appears to serve as a gating mechanism that provides directionality to the process of differentiation.

Title: CoRE-ATAC: A deep learning model for the functional classification of regulatory elements from single cell and bulk ATAC-seq data

Abstract:
Cis -Regulatory elements ( cis -REs) include promoters, enhancers, and insulators that regulate gene expression programs via binding of transcription factors. ATAC-seq technology effectively identifies active cis -REs in a given cell type (including from single cells) by mapping accessible chromatin at base-pair resolution. However, these maps are not immediately useful for inferring specific functions of cis -REs. For this purpose, we developed a deep learning framework (CoRE-ATAC) with novel data encoders that integrate DNA sequence (reference or personal genotypes) with ATAC-seq cut sites and read pileups. CoRE-ATAC was trained on 4 cell types (n = 6 samples/replicates) and accurately predicted known cis -RE functions from 7 cell types (n = 40 samples) that were not used in model training (mean average precision = 0.80, mean F1 score = 0.70). CoRE-ATAC enhancer predictions from 19 human islet samples coincided with genetically modulated gain/loss of enhancer activity, which was confirmed by massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs). Finally, CoRE-ATAC effectively inferred cis -RE function from aggregate single nucleus ATAC-seq (snATAC) data from human blood-derived immune cells that overlapped with known functional annotations in sorted immune cells, which established the efficacy of these models to study cis -RE functions of rare cells without the need for cell sorting. ATAC-seq maps from primary human cells reveal individual- and cell-specific variation in cis -RE activity. CoRE-ATAC increases the functional resolution of these maps, a critical step for studying regulatory disruptions behind diseases.

Abstract:
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major global health concern, accounting for a significant proportion of liver cancer cases and related deaths. Clonorchis sinensis ( C. sinensis ) infection, a recognized carcinogen, has been implicated in the progression of liver diseases, including HCC. However, the precise epigenetic mechanisms underlying C. sinensis -associated HCC remain to be elucidated. To investigate the role of chromatin accessibility in C. sinensis -related HCC progression, we performed an assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses of C. sinensis -infected ( C. sinensis + ) and non- C. sinensis -infected ( C. sinensis − ) HCC tumors. Integrated analyses were conducted to assess chromatin accessibility, transcription factor (TF) motifs, and histone modifications using ATAC-seq, RNA-seq, and classical chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) datasets. A scratch wound assay was used to evaluate the effects of C. sinensis excretory/secretory products ( Cs ESPs) on HCC cell migration. ATAC-seq analysis revealed 9,396 differentially accessible regions (DARs) in C. sinensis + HCC tumors compared with C. sinensis − HCC tumors. Additionally, several crucial TFs enriched in DARs were identified, including HNF4A, FOXO1, ELF4, and RELA. Combined ATAC-seq and RNA-seq analyses further revealed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with metabolism, immune regulation, and cytoskeletal dynamics. Chromatin accessibility was closely associated with histone modifications such as H3K9ac, H3K4me2, H3K4me3, H3K27ac, H3K4me1, and CTCF binding. Notably, C. sinensis infection significantly increased the migratory capacity of HCC cells, as confirmed by molecular assays and clinical observations. Our study demonstrates that C. sinensis infection remodels chromatin accessibility and may contribute to HCC progression. Our work offers valuable insights into the pathogenesis of HCC in the context of parasitic infection and lays the groundwork for future biomarker and therapeutic target discovery.

Abstract:
We use ATAC-seq to examine chromatin accessibility for four different tissues in Drosophila melanogaster : adult female brain, ovaries, and both wing and eye-antennal imaginal discs from males. Each tissue is assayed in eight different inbred strain genetic backgrounds, seven associated with a reference quality genome assembly. We develop a method for the quantile normalization of ATAC-seq fragments and test for differences in coverage among genotypes, tissues, and their interaction at 44099 peaks throughout the euchromatic genome. For the strains with reference quality genome assemblies, we correct ATAC-seq profiles for read mis-mapping due to nearby polymorphic structural variants (SVs). Comparing coverage among genotypes without accounting for SVs results in a highly elevated rate (55%) of identifying false positive differences in chromatin state between genotypes. After SV correction, we identify 1050, 30383, and 4508 regions whose peak heights are polymorphic among genotypes, among tissues, or exhibit genotype-by-tissue interactions, respectively. Finally, we identify 3988 candidate causative variants that explain at least 80% of the variance in chromatin state at nearby ATAC-seq peaks.

Abstract:
Chromatin structure plays a pivotal role in maintaining the precise regulation of gene expression. Accessible chromatin regions act as the binding sites of transcription factors (TFs) and cis-elements. Therefore, information from these open regions will enhance our understanding of the relationship between TF binding, chromatin status and the regulation of gene expression. We employed an assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) and RNA-seq analyses in the gonads of protogynous hermaphroditic orange-spotted groupers during sex reversal to profile open chromatin regions and TF binding sites. We focused on several crucial TFs, including ZNF263, SPIB, and KLF9, and analyzed the networks of TF-target genes. We identified numerous transcripts exhibiting sex-preferred expression among their target genes, along with their associated open chromatin regions. We then investigated the expression patterns of sex-related genes as well as the mRNA localization of certain genes during sex reversal. We found a set of sex-related genes that—upon further study—might be identified as the sex-specific or cell-specific marker genes that trigger sex reversal. Moreover, we discovered the core genes ( gnas , ccnb2 , and cyp21a ) of several pathways related to sex reversal that provide the guideposts for future study.

Abstract:
The Assay for Transposase‐Accessible Chromatin with sequencing (ATAC‐seq) is a versatile and widely utilized method for identifying potential regulatory regions, such as promoters and enhancers, within a genome. ATAC‐seq has been successfully applied to a wide range of established and emerging model organisms. However, implementing this method in emerging model systems, such as arthropods, can be challenging due to several factors that influence data quality. These factors include the availability of a sufficient amount and quality of tissue or cells, the need for species‐ and tissue‐specific protocol optimization, the completeness and accuracy of the reference genome, and the quality of the genome annotation. In this article, we emphasize the key steps in the ATAC‐seq protocol that, based on our experience, have the greatest impact on data quality when adapting this method for emerging model organisms. Specifically, we discuss the importance of nuclei isolation, the incubation conditions of the Tn5 transposase, and PCR amplification of the library. Furthermore, we outline essential quality checkpoints during the bioinformatic analysis of ATAC‐seq data to assist in assessing data integrity and consistency. Given that many emerging model organisms may not be readily available in laboratory cultures, we also emphasize the importance of evaluating how different preservation methods affect ATAC‐seq data quality. Based on examples in one spider and one ant species, we demonstrate that replication and thorough quality controls at all steps of the protocol and data analysis are essential to assess the usability of ATAC‐seq data. Our data highlights the importance of isolating the right number of intact nuclei, as well as ensuring optimal amplification conditions during library preparation to obtain good‐quality sequence data for downstream analyses. We recommend using fresh tissue samples if possible because we show that direct cryopreservation of the tissue may affect chromatin integrity. This effect could be avoided or reduced by preserving the homogenate in cell culture medium. Overall, we explain the ATAC‐seq protocol and downstream analyses in detail and give step‐by‐step advice to researchers who are new to the field and want to implement this method. With careful planning and validation, ATAC‐seq can reveal the regulatory landscape of a genome and aid in identifying elements that govern gene expression.

Abstract:
Although major advances have been made in bovine epigenome study, the epigenetic basis for fetal skeletal muscle development still remains poorly understood. The aim is to recapitulated the time course of fetal skeletal muscle development in vitro , and explore the dynamic changes of chromatin accessibility and gene expression during bovine myoblasts proliferation and differentiation. PDGFR‐ cells were isolated from bovine fetal skeletal muscle, then cultured and induced myogenic differentiation in vitro in a time‐course study (P, D0, D2,and D4). The assay for transposase‐accessible chromatin sequencing (ATAC‐seq) and RNA sequencing (RNA‐seq) were performed. Among the enriched transcriptional factors with high variability, we determined the effects of MAFF , ZNF384 , and KLF6 in myogenesis using RNA interference (RNAi). In addition, we identified both stage‐specific genes and chromatin accessibility regions to reveal the sequential order of gene expression, transcriptional regulatory, and signal pathways involved in bovine skeletal muscle development. Further investigation integrating chromatin accessibility and transcriptome data was conducted to explore cis‐regulatory regions in line with gene expression. Moreover, we combined bovine GWAS results of growth traits with regulatory regions defined by chromatin accessibility, providing a suggestive means for a more precise annotation of genetic variants of bovine growth traits. Overall, these findings provide valuable information for understanding the stepwise regulatory mechanisms in skeletal muscle development and conducting beef cattle genetic improvement programs.

Abstract:
Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) localizes to focal adhesions and is overexpressed in many cancers. FAK can also translocate to the nucleus, where it binds to, and regulates, several transcription factors, including MBD2, p53 and IL-33, to control gene expression by unknown mechanisms. We have used ATAC-seq to reveal that FAK controls chromatin accessibility at a subset of regulated genes. Integration of ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data showed that FAK-dependent chromatin accessibility is linked to differential gene expression, including of the FAK-regulated cytokine and transcriptional regulator interleukin-33 ( Il33 ), which controls anti-tumor immunity. Analysis of the accessibility peaks on the Il33 gene promoter/enhancer regions revealed sequences for several transcription factors, including ETS and AP-1 motifs, and we show that c-Jun, a component of AP-1, regulates Il33 gene expression by binding to its enhancer in a FAK kinase-dependent manner. This work provides the first demonstration that FAK controls transcription via chromatin accessibility, identifying a novel mechanism by which nuclear FAK regulates biologically important gene expression.

Title: ATAC-seq reveals regional differences in enhancer accessibility during the establishment of spatial coordinates in the Drosophila blastoderm
Authors: Marta Bozek, Roberto Cortini, Andrea Ennio Storti, Ulrich Unnerstall, Ulrike Gaul, Nicolas Gompel
Date: 2019-05

Abstract:
Establishment of spatial coordinates during Drosophila embryogenesis relies on differential regulatory activity of axis patterning enhancers. Concentration gradients of activator and repressor transcription factors (TFs) provide positional information to each enhancer, which in turn promotes transcription of a target gene in a specific spatial pattern. However, the interplay between an enhancer regulatory activity and its accessibility as determined by local chromatin organization is not well understood. We profiled chromatin accessibility with ATAC-seq in narrow, genetically tagged domains along the antero-posterior axis in the Drosophila blastoderm. We demonstrate that one-quarter of the accessible genome displays significant regional variation in its ATAC-seq signal immediately after zygotic genome activation. Axis patterning enhancers are enriched among the most variable intervals, and their accessibility changes correlate with their regulatory activity. In an embryonic domain where an enhancer receives a net activating TF input and promotes transcription, it displays elevated accessibility in comparison to a domain where it receives a net repressive input. We propose that differential accessibility is a signature of patterning cis -regulatory elements in the Drosophila blastoderm and discuss potential mechanisms by which accessibility of enhancers may be modulated by activator and repressor TFs.

Abstract:
Researches show that chronic viral infection and persistent antigen and/or inflammatory signal exposure in cancer causes the functional status of T cells to be altered, mainly by major changes in the epigenetic and metabolic environment, which then leads to T cell exhaustion. The discovery of the immune checkpoint pathway is an important milestone in understanding and reversing T cell exhaustion. Antibodies targeting these pathways have shown superior ability to reverse T cell exhaustion. However, there are still some limitations in immune checkpoint blocking therapy, such as the short-term nature of therapeutic effects and high individual heterogeneity. Assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing(ATAC-seq) is a method used to analyze the accessibility of whole-genome chromatin. It uses hyperactive Tn5 transposase to assess chromatin accessibility. Recently, a growing number of studies have reported that ATAC-seq can be used to characterize the dynamic changes of epigenetics in the process of T cell exhaustion. It has been determined that immune checkpoint blocking can only temporarily restore the function of exhausted T cells because of an irreversible change in the epigenetics of exhausted T cells. In this study, we review the latest developments, which provide a clearer molecular understanding of T cell exhaustion, reveal potential new therapeutic targets for persistent viral infection and cancer, and provide new insights for designing effective immunotherapy for treating cancer and chronic infection.

Title: Interrogation of the interplay between DNA N 6 -methyladenosine (6mA) and hypoxia-induced chromatin accessibility by a randomized empirical model (EnrichShuf)
Authors: Joseph Chieh-Yu Lai, Kai-Wen Hsu, Kou-Juey Wu
Date: 2024-12-11

Abstract:
 N  6 -Methyladenosine (6mA) is an epigenetic mark in eukaryotes regulating development, stress response and tumor progression. METTL4 has been reported as a 6mA methyltransferase induced by hypoxia. The detection and annotation of 6mA signals in mammalian cells have been hampered by the techniques and analytical methods developed so far. Here we developed a 6mA-ChIP-exo-5.1-seq to improve the sensitivity of detecting 6mAs in human cell lines. Furthermore, an EnrichShuf analysis tool for comprehensively comparing 6mA-ChIP-exo-5.1-seq, ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq and RNA-seq has been developed to annotate the functional relevance of 6mA in relation to chromatin accessibility and histone marks. Using a hypoxia-induced 6mA induction system as a model, we showed that hypoxic 6mA signals positively correlated with accessible chromatin regions. These 6mA signals correlate with their regulation by METTL4 under hypoxia, consistent with previous results. 6mAs also co-exist with H3K4me1, a histone mark for enhancers. Further analysis of enhancers using an ABC (active-by-contact) model shows that hypoxia-inducible factor-1α-induced H3K4me3 surrounds the 6mA/H3K4me1 site to augment active enhancers. These results suggest that correlation between 6mA and accessible chromatin regions plays a significant role in enhancer–promoter interactions during hypoxia-induced gene expression.

Title: Changes in chromatin accessibility landscape and histone H3 core acetylation during valproic acid-induced differentiation of embryonic stem cells
Authors: Claudia Baumann, Xiangyu Zhang, Ling Zhu, Yuhong Fan, Rabindranath De La Fuente
Date: 2021-12-27

Abstract:
Directed differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) provides powerful models to dissect the molecular mechanisms leading to the formation of specific cell lineages. Treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitors can significantly enhance the efficiency of directed differentiation. However, the mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we use CUT&RUN in combination with ATAC-seq to determine changes in both histone modifications and genome-wide chromatin accessibility following valproic acid (VPA) exposure. VPA induced a significant increase in global histone H3 acetylation (H3K56ac), a core histone modification affecting nucleosome stability, as well as enrichment at loci associated with cytoskeletal organization and cellular morphogenesis. In addition, VPA altered the levels of linker histone H1 subtypes and the total histone H1/nucleosome ratio indicative of initial differentiation events. Notably, ATAC-seq analysis revealed changes in chromatin accessibility of genes involved in regulation of CDK serine/threonine kinase activity and DNA duplex unwinding. Importantly, changes in chromatin accessibility were evident at several key genomic loci, such as the pluripotency factor Lefty, cardiac muscle troponin Tnnt2, and the homeodomain factor Hopx, which play critical roles in cardiomyocyte differentiation. Massive parallel transcription factor (TF) footprinting also indicates an increased occupancy of TFs involved in differentiation toward mesoderm and endoderm lineages and a loss of footprints of POU5F1/SOX2 pluripotency factors following VPA treatment. Our results provide the first genome-wide analysis of the chromatin landscape following VPA-induced differentiation in mESCs and provide new mechanistic insight into the intricate molecular processes that govern departure from pluripotency and early lineage commitment.

Title: Proteasome Inhibition Reprograms Chromatin Landscape in Breast Cancer
Authors: H. Karimi Kinyamu, Brian D. Bennett, James M. Ward, Trevor K. Archer
Date: 2024-04

Abstract:
The 26S proteasome is the major protein degradation machinery in cells. Cancer cells use the proteasome to modulate gene expression networks that promote tumor growth. Proteasome inhibitors have emerged as effective cancer therapeutics, but how they work mechanistically remains unclear. Here, using integrative genomic analysis, we discovered unexpected reprogramming of the chromatin landscape and RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) transcription initiation in breast cancer cells treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132. The cells acquired dynamic changes in chromatin accessibility at specific genomic loci termed differentially open chromatin regions (DOCR). DOCRs with decreased accessibility were promoter proximal and exhibited unique chromatin architecture associated with divergent RNAPII transcription. Conversely, DOCRs with increased accessibility were primarily distal to transcription start sites and enriched in oncogenic superenhancers predominantly accessible in non-basal breast tumor subtypes. These findings describe the mechanisms by which the proteasome modulates the expression of gene networks intrinsic to breast cancer biology. Our study provides a strong basis for understanding the mechanisms by which proteasome inhibitors exert anticancer effects. We find open chromatin regions that change during proteasome inhibition, are typically accessible in non-basal breast cancers.

Title: Changes in chromatin accessibility are not concordant with transcriptional changes for single‐factor perturbations
Authors: Karun Kiani, Eric M Sanford, Yogesh Goyal, Arjun Raj
Date: 2022-09-07

Abstract:
A major goal in the field of transcriptional regulation is the mapping of changes in the binding of transcription factors to the resultant changes in gene expression. Recently, methods for measuring chromatin accessibility have enabled us to measure changes in accessibility across the genome, which are thought to correspond to transcription factor‐binding events. In concert with RNA‐sequencing, these data in principle enable such mappings; however, few studies have looked at their concordance over short‐duration treatments with specific perturbations. Here, we used tandem, bulk ATAC‐seq, and RNA‐seq measurements from MCF‐7 breast carcinoma cells to systematically evaluate the concordance between changes in accessibility and changes in expression in response to retinoic acid and TGF‐β. We found two classes of genes whose expression showed a significant change: those that showed some changes in the accessibility of nearby chromatin, and those that showed virtually no change despite strong changes in expression. The peaks associated with genes in the former group had lower baseline accessibility prior to exposure to signal. Focusing the analysis specifically on peaks with motifs for transcription factors associated with retinoic acid and TGF‐β signaling did not reduce the lack of correspondence. Analysis of paired chromatin accessibility and gene expression data from distinct paths along the hematopoietic differentiation trajectory showed a much stronger correspondence, suggesting that the multifactorial biological processes associated with differentiation may lead to changes in chromatin accessibility that reflect rather than driving altered transcriptional status. Together, these results show many gene expression changes can happen independently of changes in the accessibility of local chromatin in the context of a single‐factor perturbation.

Abstract:
Histone lysine methylations have primarily been linked to selective recruitment of reader or effector proteins that subsequently modify chromatin regions and mediate genome functions. Here, we describe a divergent role for histone H4 lysine 20 mono-methylation (H4K20me1) and demonstrate that it directly facilitates chromatin openness and accessibility by disrupting chromatin folding. Thus, accumulation of H4K20me1 demarcates highly accessible chromatin at genes, and this is maintained throughout the cell cycle. In vitro, H4K20me1-containing nucleosomal arrays with nucleosome repeat lengths (NRL) of 187 and 197 are less compact than unmethylated (H4K20me0) or trimethylated (H4K20me3) arrays. Concordantly, and in contrast to trimethylated and unmethylated tails, solid-state NMR data shows that H4K20 mono-methylation changes the H4 conformational state and leads to more dynamic histone H4-tails. Notably, the increased chromatin accessibility mediated by H4K20me1 facilitates gene expression, particularly of housekeeping genes. Altogether, we show how the methylation state of a single histone H4 residue operates as a focal point in chromatin structure control. While H4K20me1 directly promotes chromatin openness at highly transcribed genes, it also serves as a stepping-stone for H4K20me3-dependent chromatin compaction.

Abstract:
The transcription factor Oct4 is essential for the maintenance and induction of stem cell pluripotency, but its functional roles are not fully understood. Here, we investigate the functions of Oct4 by depleting and subsequently recovering it in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and conducting a time-resolved multiomics analysis. Oct4 depletion leads to an immediate loss of its binding to enhancers, accompanied by a decrease in mRNA synthesis from its target genes that are part of the transcriptional network that maintains pluripotency. Gradual decrease of Oct4 binding to enhancers does not immediately change the chromatin accessibility but reduces transcription of enhancers. Conversely, partial recovery of Oct4 expression results in a rapid increase in chromatin accessibility, whereas enhancer transcription does not fully recover. These results indicate different concentration-dependent activities of Oct4. Whereas normal ESC levels of Oct4 are required for transcription of pluripotency enhancers, low levels of Oct4 are sufficient to retain chromatin accessibility, likely together with other factors such as Sox2.

Title: Genome-wide distribution of 5-hydroxymethyluracil and chromatin accessibility in the Breviolum minutum genome
Authors: Georgi K. Marinov, Xinyi Chen, Matthew P. Swaffer, Tingting Xiang, Arthur R. Grossman, William J. Greenleaf
Date: 2024-05-06

Abstract:
In dinoflagellates, a unique and extremely divergent genomic and nuclear organization has evolved. The highly unusual features of dinoflagellate nuclei and genomes include permanently condensed liquid crystalline chromosomes, primarily packaged by proteins other than histones, genes organized in very long unidirectional gene arrays, a general absence of transcriptional regulation, high abundance of the otherwise very rare DNA modification 5-hydroxymethyluracil (5-hmU), and many others. While most of these fascinating properties are originally identified in the 1970s and 1980s, they have not yet been investigated using modern genomic tools. In this work, we address some of the outstanding questions regarding dinoflagellate genome organization by mapping the genome-wide distribution of 5-hmU (using both immunoprecipitation-based and basepair-resolution chemical mapping approaches) and of chromatin accessibility in the genome of the Symbiodiniaceae dinoflagellate Breviolum minutum . We find that the 5-hmU modification is preferentially enriched over certain classes of repetitive elements, often coincides with the boundaries between gene arrays, and is generally correlated with decreased chromatin accessibility, the latter otherwise being largely uniform along the genome.

Title: Iterative assay for transposase-accessible chromatin by sequencing to isolate functionally relevant neuronal subtypes

Abstract:
The Drosophila brain contains tens of thousands of distinct cell types. Thousands of different transgenic lines reproducibly target specific neuron subsets, yet most still express in several cell types. Furthermore, most lines were developed without a priori knowledge of where the transgenes would be expressed. To aid in the development of cell type–specific tools for neuronal identification and manipulation, we developed an iterative assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (ATAC) approach. Open chromatin regions (OCRs) enriched in neurons, compared to whole bodies, drove transgene expression preferentially in subsets of neurons. A second round of ATAC-seq from these specific neuron subsets revealed additional enriched OCR2s that further restricted transgene expression within the chosen neuron subset. This approach allows for continued refinement of transgene expression, and we used it to identify neurons relevant for sleep behavior. Furthermore, this approach is widely applicable to other cell types and to other organisms.

Abstract:
The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project has established a genomic resource for mammalian development, profiling a diverse panel of mouse tissues at 8 developmental stages from 10.5 days after conception until birth, including transcriptomes, methylomes and chromatin states. Here we systematically examined the state and accessibility of chromatin in the developing mouse fetus. In total we performed 1,128 chromatin immunoprecipitation with sequencing (ChIP–seq) assays for histone modifications and 132 assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC–seq) assays for chromatin accessibility across 72 distinct tissue-stages. We used integrative analysis to develop a unified set of chromatin state annotations, infer the identities of dynamic enhancers and key transcriptional regulators, and characterize the relationship between chromatin state and accessibility during developmental gene regulation. We also leveraged these data to link enhancers to putative target genes and demonstrate tissue-specific enrichments of sequence variants associated with disease in humans. The mouse ENCODE data sets provide a compendium of resources for biomedical researchers and achieve, to our knowledge, the most comprehensive view of chromatin dynamics during mammalian fetal development to date.

Abstract:
Connecting genes to their cis-regulatory elements has been enabled by genome-wide mapping of chromatin interactions using proximity ligation in ChIA-PET, Hi-C, and their derivatives. However, these methods require millions of input cells for high-quality data and thus are unsuitable for many studies when only limited cells are available. Conversely, epigenomic profiling via transposase digestion in ATAC-seq requires only hundreds to thousands of cells to robustly map open chromatin associated with transcription activity, but it cannot directly connect active genes to their distal enhancers. Here, we combine proximity ligation in ChIA-PET and transposase accessibility in ATAC-seq into ChIATAC to efficiently map interactions between open chromatin loci in low numbers of input cells. We validate ChIATAC in Drosophila cells and optimize it for mapping 3D epigenomes in human cells robustly. Applying ChIATAC to primary human T cells, we reveal mechanisms that topologically regulate transcriptional programs during T cell activation.

Abstract:
The mammalian heart arises from various populations of Mesp1-expressing cardiovascular progenitors (CPs) that are specified during the early stages of gastrulation. Mesp1 is a transcription factor (TF) that acts as a master regulator of CP specification and differentiation. However, how Mesp1 regulates the chromatin landscape of nascent mesodermal cells to define the temporal and spatial patterning of the distinct populations of CPs remains unknown. Here, by combining ChIP-seq, RNA-seq and ATAC-seq during mouse pluripotent stem cell differentiation, we defined the dynamic remodelling of the chromatin landscape mediated by Mesp1. We identified different enhancers that are temporally regulated to erase the pluripotent state and specify the pools of CPs that mediate heart development. We identified Zic2 and Zic3 as essential cofactors that act with Mesp1 to regulate its TF activity at key mesodermal enhancers, thereby regulating the chromatin remodelling and gene expression associated with the specification of the different populations of CPs in vivo . Our study identifies the dynamics of the chromatin landscape and enhancer remodelling associated with temporal patterning of early mesodermal cells into the distinct populations of CPs that mediate heart development.

Abstract:
In mammals, spermatogonial cells (SPGs) are undifferentiated male germ cells in testis that are quiescent until birth and then self-renew and differentiate to produce spermatogenic cells and functional sperm from early postnatal life throughout adulthood. The transcriptome of SPGs is highly dynamic and timely regulated during postnatal development. We examined if such dynamics involves changes in chromatin organization by profiling the transcriptome and chromatin accessibility of SPGs from early postnatal stages to adulthood in mice using deep RNA-seq, ATAC-seq and computational deconvolution analyses. By integrating transcriptomic and epigenomic features, we show that SPGs undergo massive chromatin remodeling during postnatal development that partially correlates with distinct gene expression profiles and transcription factors (TF) motif enrichment. We identify genomic regions with significantly different chromatin accessibility in adult SPGs that are marked by histone modifications associated with enhancers and promoters. Some of the regions with increased accessibility correspond to transposable element subtypes enriched in multiple TFs motifs and close to differentially expressed genes. Our results underscore the dynamics of chromatin organization in developing germ cells and complement existing datasets on SPGs by providing maps of the regulatory genome at high resolution from the same cell populations at early postnatal, late postnatal and adult stages collected from single individuals.

Title: A network of transcription factors governs the dynamics of NODAL/Activin transcriptional responses

Date: 2022-04-15

Abstract:
SMAD2, an effector of the NODAL/Activin signalling pathway, regulates developmental processes by sensing distinct chromatin states and interacting with different transcriptional partners. However, the network of factors that controls SMAD2 chromatin binding and shapes its transcriptional programme over time is poorly characterised. Here, we combine ATAC-seq with computational footprinting to identify temporal changes in chromatin accessibility and transcription factor activity upon NODAL/Activin signalling. We show that SMAD2 binding induces chromatin opening genome wide. We discover footprints for FOXI3, FOXO3 and ZIC3 at the SMAD2-bound enhancers of the early response genes, Pmepa1 and Wnt3 , respectively, and demonstrate their functionality. Finally, we determine a mechanism by which NODAL/Activin signalling induces delayed gene expression, by uncovering a self-enabling transcriptional cascade whereby activated SMADs, together with ZIC3, induce the expression of Wnt3 . The resultant activated WNT pathway then acts together with the NODAL/Activin pathway to regulate expression of delayed target genes in prolonged NODAL/Activin signalling conditions.  This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper.

Title: Bibliometric review of ATAC-Seq and its application in gene expression
Authors: Liheng Luo, Michael Gribskov, Sufang Wang
Date: 2022-05

Abstract:
With recent advances in high-throughput next-generation sequencing, it is possible to describe the regulation and expression of genes at multiple levels. An assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq), which uses Tn5 transposase to sequence protein-free binding regions of the genome, can be combined with chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) and ribonucleic acid sequencing (RNA-seq) to provide a detailed description of gene expression. Here, we reviewed the literature on ATAC-seq and described the characteristics of ATAC-seq publications. We then briefly introduced the principles of RNA-seq, ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq, focusing on the main features of the techniques. We built a phylogenetic tree from species that had been previously studied by using ATAC-seq. Studies of Mus musculus and Homo sapiens account for approximately 90% of the total ATAC-seq data, while other species are still in the process of accumulating data. We summarized the findings from human diseases and other species, illustrating the cutting-edge discoveries and the role of multi-omics data analysis in current research. Moreover, we collected and compared ATAC-seq analysis pipelines, which allowed biological researchers who lack programming skills to better analyze and explore ATAC-seq data. Through this review, it is clear that multi-omics analysis and single-cell sequencing technology will become the mainstream approach in future research.

Abstract:
Mutation of tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 (encoded by TET2 ) drives myeloid malignancy initiation and progression 1 – 3 . TET2 deficiency is known to cause a globally opened chromatin state and activation of genes contributing to aberrant haematopoietic stem cell self-renewal 4 , 5 . However, the open chromatin observed in TET2-deficient mouse embryonic stem cells, leukaemic cells and haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells 5 is inconsistent with the designated role of DNA 5-methylcytosine oxidation of TET2. Here we show that chromatin-associated retrotransposon RNA 5-methylcytosine (m 5 C) can be recognized by the methyl-CpG-binding-domain protein MBD6, which guides deubiquitination of nearby monoubiquitinated Lys119 of histone H2A (H2AK119ub) to promote an open chromatin state. TET2 oxidizes m 5 C and antagonizes this MBD6-dependent H2AK119ub deubiquitination. TET2 depletion thereby leads to globally decreased H2AK119ub, more open chromatin and increased transcription in stem cells. TET2- mutant human leukaemia becomes dependent on this gene activation pathway, with MBD6 depletion selectively blocking proliferation of TET2 -mutant leukaemic cells and largely reversing the haematopoiesis defects caused by Tet2 loss in mouse models. Together, our findings reveal a chromatin regulation pathway by TET2 through retrotransposon RNA m 5 C oxidation and identify the downstream MBD6 protein as a feasible target for developing therapies specific against TET2 mutant malignancies.

Abstract:
The extravillous trophoblast cell lineage is a key feature of placentation and successful pregnancy. Knowledge of transcriptional regulation driving extravillous trophoblast cell development is limited. Here, we map the transcriptome and epigenome landscape as well as chromatin interactions of human trophoblast stem cells and their transition into extravillous trophoblast cells. We show that integrating chromatin accessibility, long-range chromatin interactions, transcriptomic, and transcription factor binding motif enrichment enables identification of transcription factors and regulatory mechanisms critical for extravillous trophoblast cell development. We elucidate functional roles for TFAP2C , SNAI1 , and EPAS1 in the regulation of extravillous trophoblast cell development. EPAS1 is identified as an upstream regulator of key extravillous trophoblast cell transcription factors, including ASCL2 and SNAI1 and together with its target genes, is linked to pregnancy loss and birth weight. Collectively, we reveal activation of a dynamic regulatory network and provide a framework for understanding extravillous trophoblast cell specification in trophoblast cell lineage development and human placentation.

Abstract:
Assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) generates genome-wide chromatin accessibility profiles, providing valuable insights into epigenetic gene regulation at both pooled-cell and single-cell population levels. Comprehensive analysis of ATAC-seq data involves the use of various interdependent programs. Learning the correct sequence of steps needed to process the data can represent a major hurdle. Selecting appropriate parameters at each stage, including pre-analysis, core analysis, and advanced downstream analysis, is important to ensure accurate analysis and interpretation of ATAC-seq data. Additionally, obtaining and working within a limited computational environment presents a significant challenge to non-bioinformatic researchers. Therefore, we present Cloud ATAC, an open-source, cloud-based interactive framework with a scalable, flexible, and streamlined analysis framework based on the best practices approach for pooled-cell and single-cell ATAC-seq data. These frameworks use on-demand computational power and memory, scalability, and a secure and compliant environment provided by the Google Cloud. Additionally, we leverage Jupyter Notebook's interactive computing platform that combines live code, tutorials, narrative text, flashcards, quizzes, and custom visualizations to enhance learning and analysis. Further, leveraging GPU instances has significantly improved the run-time of the single-cell framework. The source codes and data are publicly available through NIH Cloud lab https://github.com/NIGMS/ATAC-Seq-and-Single-Cell-ATAC-Seq-Analysis . This manuscript describes the development of a resource module that is part of a learning platform named ``NIGMS Sandbox for Cloud-based Learning'' https://github.com/NIGMS/NIGMS-Sandbox . The overall genesis of the Sandbox is described in the editorial NIGMS Sandbox [ 1 ] at the beginning of this Supplement. This module delivers learning materials on the analysis of bulk and single-cell ATAC-seq data in an interactive format that uses appropriate cloud resources for data access and analyses.

Abstract:
Most common genetic variants associated with disease are located in non-coding regions of the genome. One mechanism by which they function is through altering transcription factor (TF) binding. In this study, we explore how genetic variation is connected to differences in the regulatory landscape of livers from C57BL/6J and 129S1/SvImJ mice fed either chow or a high-fat diet. To identify sites where regulatory variation affects TF binding and nearby gene expression, we employed an integrative analysis of H3K27ac ChIP-seq (active enhancers), ATAC-seq (chromatin accessibility) and RNA-seq (gene expression). We show that, across all these assays, the genetically driven (i.e. strain-specific) differences in the regulatory landscape are more pronounced than those modified by diet. Most notably, our analysis revealed that differentially accessible regions (DARs, N = 29635, FDR < 0.01 and fold change > 50%) are almost always strain-specific and enriched with genetic variation. Moreover, proximal DARs are highly correlated with differentially expressed genes. We also show that TF binding is affected by genetic variation, which we validate experimentally using ChIP-seq for TCF7L2 and CTCF. This study provides detailed insights into how non-coding genetic variation alters the gene regulatory landscape, and demonstrates how this can be used to study the regulatory variation influencing TF binding.

Abstract:
Chromatin undergoes extensive reprogramming during immune cell differentiation. Here we report repression of controlled histone H3 amino-terminus proteolytic cleavage (H3ΔN) during monocyte-to-macrophage development. This abundant histone mark in human peripheral blood monocytes is catalyzed by neutrophil serine proteases (NSPs) cathepsin G, neutrophil elastase, and proteinase 3. NSPs are repressed as monocytes mature into macrophages. Integrative epigenomic analysis reveals widespread H3ΔN distribution across the genome in a monocytic cell line and primary monocytes, which becomes largely undetectable in fully differentiated macrophages. H3ΔN is enriched at permissive chromatin and actively transcribed genes. Simultaneous NSP depletion in monocytic cells results in H3ΔN loss and further increase in chromatin accessibility, which likely primes the chromatin for gene expression reprogramming. Importantly, H3ΔN is reduced in monocytes from patients with systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA), an autoinflammatory disease with prominent macrophage involvement. Together, we uncover an epigenetic mechanism that primes the chromatin to facilitate macrophage development.

Title: Profiling chromatin regulatory landscape: insights into the development of ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq
Authors: Shaoqian Ma, Yongyou Zhang
Date: 2020-10-10

Abstract:
Chromatin regulatory landscape plays a critical role in many disease processes and embryo development. Epigenome sequencing technologies such as chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) and assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) have enabled us to dissect the pan-genomic regulatory landscape of cells and tissues in both time and space dimensions by detecting specific chromatin state and its corresponding transcription factors. Pioneered by the advancement of chromatin immunoprecipitation-chip (ChIP-chip) technology, abundant epigenome profiling technologies have become available such as ChIP-seq, DNase I hypersensitive site sequencing (DNase-seq), ATAC-seq and so on. The advent of single-cell sequencing has revolutionized the next-generation sequencing, applications in single-cell epigenetics are enriched rapidly. Epigenome sequencing technologies have evolved from low-throughput to high-throughput and from bulk sample to the single-cell scope, which unprecedentedly benefits scientists to interpret life from different angles. In this review, after briefly introducing the background knowledge of epigenome biology, we discuss the development of epigenome sequencing technologies, especially ChIP-seq & ATAC-seq and their current applications in scientific research. Finally, we provide insights into future applications and challenges.

Title: ATAC-Seq Identifies Chromatin Landscapes Linked to the Regulation of Oxidative Stress in the Human Fungal Pathogen Candida albicans
Authors: Sabrina Jenull, Michael Tscherner, Theresia Mair, Karl Kuchler
Date: 2020-09-21

Abstract:
Human fungal pathogens often encounter fungicidal stress upon host invasion, but they can swiftly adapt by transcriptional reprogramming that enables pathogen survival. Fungal immune evasion is tightly connected to chromatin regulation. Hence, fungal chromatin modifiers pose alternative treatment options to combat fungal infections. Here, we present an assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) protocol adapted for the opportunistic pathogen Candida albicans to gain further insight into the interplay of chromatin accessibility and gene expression mounted during fungal adaptation to oxidative stress. The ATAC-seq workflow not only facilitates the robust detection of genomic regions with accessible chromatin but also allows for the precise modeling of nucleosome positions in C. albicans . Importantly, the data reveal genes with altered chromatin accessibility in upstream regulatory regions, which correlate with transcriptional regulation during oxidative stress. Interestingly, many genes show increased chromatin accessibility without change in gene expression upon stress exposure. Such chromatin signatures could predict yet unknown regulatory factors under highly dynamic transcriptional control. Additionally, de novo motif analysis in genomic regions with increased chromatin accessibility upon H 2 O 2 treatment shows significant enrichment for Cap1 binding sites, a major factor of oxidative stress responses in C. albicans . Taken together, the ATAC-seq workflow enables the identification of chromatin signatures and highlights the dynamics of regulatory mechanisms mediating environmental adaptation of C. albicans .

Abstract:
Cis-regulatory elements (CREs) direct precise gene expression for development and environmental response, yet their spatial organization in crops is largely unknown. We introduce transposase-accessible chromosome conformation capture (TAC-C), a method integrating ATAC-seq and Hi-C to capture fine-scale chromatin interactions in four major crops: rice, sorghum, maize, and wheat. TAC-C reveals a strong association between chromatin interaction frequency and gene expression, particularly emphasizing the conserved roles of chromatin interaction hub anchors and hub genes across crop species. Integrating chromatin structure with population genetics data highlights that chromatin loops connect distal regulatory elements to phenotypic variation. In addition, asymmetrical open chromatin interactions among subgenomes, driven by transposon insertions and sequence variations, contribute to biased homoeolog expression. Furthermore, TaSPL7/15 regulate photosynthesis-related genes through chromatin interactions, with enhanced photosynthetic efficiency and starch content in Taspl7&15 mutant. TAC-C provides insights into the spatial organization of regulatory elements in crops, especially for SPL-mediated photosynthesis regulation in wheat.

Title: The Expanding Constellation of Histone Post-Translational Modifications in the Epigenetic Landscape
Authors: Vincenzo Cavalieri
Date: 2021-10-10

Abstract:
The emergence of a nucleosome-based chromatin structure accompanied the evolutionary transition from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. In this scenario, histones became the heart of the complex and precisely timed coordination between chromatin architecture and functions during adaptive responses to environmental influence by means of epigenetic mechanisms. Notably, such an epigenetic machinery involves an overwhelming number of post-translational modifications at multiple residues of core and linker histones. This review aims to comprehensively describe old and recent evidence in this exciting field of research. In particular, histone post-translational modification establishing/removal mechanisms, their genomic locations and implication in nucleosome dynamics and chromatin-based processes, as well as their harmonious combination and interdependence will be discussed.

Abstract:
Epigenetic regulation plays a key role in plant development and stress response processes. Although previous studies have found that epigenetic modifications are involved in the drought response in apple, a comprehensive epigenomic profile of the response of apple to drought is needed. To characterize epigenomic profiles during the response of apple to drought, we conducted transcriptome, whole‐genome bisulfite sequencing, and ChIP‐seq analyses of six histone modifications (H3ac, H3K9ac, H3K14ac, H3K4me3, H3K27me3, and H3K36me3) in Malus hupehensis at 0, 3, 6, and 9 days after drought treatment. The greatest changes in differentially expressed genes were observed after 6 days of drought treatment. However, the highest levels of DNA methylation near the gene region were observed after only 3 days of drought treatment. The global enrichment of six histone modifications slightly decreased under drought treatment. Up‐regulated drought‐responsive genes with higher fold changes were associated with the hypo‐regulation of H3K27me3, and up‐regulated genes with lower fold changes were associated with the hyper‐regulation of H3K4me3. Many drought‐responsive genes such as MYB88 , NCED3 , and JAZ1 are regulated by epigenetic modifications. We verified the functions of two candidate drought‐responsive genes regulated by multiple epigenetic modifications, MdABI5 (regulated by H3K14ac and H3K27me3) and MdOCP3 (regulated by H3K9ac and H3K36me3) in the drought response. The phenotypes of transgenic apple under drought showed that MdABI5 and MdOCP3 positively regulate drought tolerance in apple. Our results provide new insights t for studies of the molecular mechanism of epigenetic modifications and have implications for improving the drought resistance of apple.

Abstract:
Advancements in genome sequencing technologies have uncovered the multifaceted roles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in human cells. Recent discoveries have identified lncRNAs as major players in gene regulatory pathways, highlighting their pivotal role in human cell growth and development. Their dysregulation is implicated in the onset of genetic disorders and age-related diseases, including cancer. Specifically, they have been found to orchestrate molecular mechanisms impacting epigenetics, including DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation, histone modifications, and chromatin remodeling, thereby significantly influencing gene expression. This review provides an overview of the current knowledge on lncRNA-mediated epigenetic regulation of gene expression, emphasizing the biomedical implications of lncRNAs in the development of different types of cancers and genetic diseases.

Title: Epigenetic control of cell identities from epiblast to gastrulation
Authors: Katrin M. Schüle, Simone Probst
Date: 2025-02-22

Abstract:
Epigenetic modifications of chromatin are essential for the establishment of cell identities during embryogenesis. Between embryonic days 3.5–7.5 of murine development, major cell lineage decisions are made that discriminate extraembryonic and embryonic tissues, and the embryonic primary germ layers are formed, thereby laying down the basic body plan. In this review, we cover the contribution of dynamic chromatin modifications by DNA methylation, changes of chromatin accessibility, and histone modifications, that in combination with transcription factors control gene expression programs of different cell types. We highlight the differences in regulation of enhancer and promoter marks and discuss their requirement in cell lineage specification. Importantly, in many cases, lineage‐specific targeting of epigenetic modifiers is carried out by pioneer or master transcription factors, that in sum mediate the chromatin landscape and thereby control the transcription of cell‐type‐specific gene programs and thus, cell identities.

Title: Histone modifications in the regulation of erythropoiesis
Authors: Xiuyun Wu, Hongdi Xu, Erxi Xia, Linru Gao, Yan Hou, Lei Sun, Hengchao Zhang, Ying Cheng
Date: 2025-04-11

Abstract:
The pathogenesis of anemia and other erythroid dysphasia are mains poorly understood, primarily due to limited knowledge about the differentiation processes and regulatory mechanisms governing erythropoiesis. Erythropoiesis is a highly complex and precise biological process, that can be categorized into three distinct stages: early erythropoiesis, terminal erythroid differentiation, and reticulocyte maturation, and this complex process is tightly controlled by multiple regulatory factors. Emerging evidence highlights the crucial role of epigenetic modifications, particularly histone modifications, in regulating erythropoiesis. Methylation and acetylation are two common modification forms that affect genome accessibility by altering the state of chromatin, thereby regulating gene expression during erythropoiesis. This review systematically examines the roles of histone methylation and acetylation, along with their respective regulatory enzymes, in regulating the development and differentiation of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) and erythroid progenitors. Furthermore, we discuss the involvement of these histone modifications in erythroid-specific developmental processes, including hemoglobin switching, chromatin condensation, and enucleation.  Conclusions  This review summarizes the current understanding of the role of histone modifications in erythropoiesis based on existing research, as a foundation for further research the mechanisms of epigenetic regulatory in erythropoiesis.

Title: Chromatin Structure and Dynamics: Focus on Neuronal Differentiation and Pathological Implication
Authors: Sophie A. Nothof, Frédérique Magdinier, Julien Van-Gils
Date: 2022-04-02

Abstract:
Chromatin structure is an essential regulator of gene expression. Its state of compaction contributes to the regulation of genetic programs, in particular during differentiation. Epigenetic processes, which include post-translational modifications of histones, DNA methylation and implication of non-coding RNA, are powerful regulators of gene expression. Neurogenesis and neuronal differentiation are spatio-temporally regulated events that allow the formation of the central nervous system components. Here, we review the chromatin structure and post-translational histone modifications associated with neuronal differentiation. Studying the impact of histone modifications on neuronal differentiation improves our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of chromatinopathies and opens up new therapeutic avenues. In addition, we will discuss techniques for the analysis of histone modifications on a genome-wide scale and the pathologies associated with the dysregulation of the epigenetic machinery.

Title: Histone supply: a precious commodity for cell identity
Authors: Sara Gonske, Thelma M. Escobar, Alejandra Loyola
Date: 2025-10-01

Abstract:
Histones are critical for eukaryotic cell survival, supporting and packaging DNA into chromatin domains that define gene expression and cellular identity. Fundamental to the establishment of these domains is the adequate histone supply that is tightly regulated from the moment histones are transcribed, synthesized, and recycled, to when they are degraded. In this review, we describe and emphasize each step of the histone supply chain and its impact on chromatin structure and cellular identity. Given the robust studies on histones H3 and H4 supply, we primarily discuss these nucleosome components and their variants while briefly touching on H2A and H2B dynamics. We also highlight central proteins that supervise these processes and relay key studies that explore the consequences and clinical impact of limiting or altering the histone supply chain. Together, these insights underscore the importance of histone homeostasis as a critical determinant of genome stability and cell fate.

Title: Epigenetic control of skeletal muscle atrophy
Authors: Wenpeng Liang, Feng Xu, Li Li, Chunlei Peng, Hualin Sun, Jiaying Qiu, Junjie Sun
Date: 2024-07-08

Abstract:
Skeletal muscular atrophy is a complex disease involving a large number of gene expression regulatory networks and various biological processes. Despite extensive research on this topic, its underlying mechanisms remain elusive, and effective therapeutic approaches are yet to be established. Recent studies have shown that epigenetics play an important role in regulating skeletal muscle atrophy, influencing the expression of numerous genes associated with this condition through the addition or removal of certain chemical modifications at the molecular level. This review article comprehensively summarizes the different types of modifications to DNA, histones, RNA, and their known regulators. We also discuss how epigenetic modifications change during the process of skeletal muscle atrophy, the molecular mechanisms by which epigenetic regulatory proteins control skeletal muscle atrophy, and assess their translational potential. The role of epigenetics on muscle stem cells is also highlighted. In addition, we propose that alternative splicing interacts with epigenetic mechanisms to regulate skeletal muscle mass, offering a novel perspective that enhances our understanding of epigenetic inheritance’s role and the regulatory network governing skeletal muscle atrophy. Collectively, advancements in the understanding of epigenetic mechanisms provide invaluable insights into the study of skeletal muscle atrophy. Moreover, this knowledge paves the way for identifying new avenues for the development of more effective therapeutic strategies and pharmaceutical interventions.

Title: Polycomb protein SCML2 mediates paternal epigenetic inheritance through sperm chromatin
Authors: Akihiko Sakashita, Masatoshi Ooga, Kai Otsuka, So Maezawa, Chikara Takeuchi, Sayaka Wakayama, Teruhiko Wakayama, Satoshi H Namekawa
Date: 2023-07-21

Abstract:
Sperm chromatin retains small amounts of histones, and chromatin states of sperm mirror gene expression programs of the next generation. However, it remains largely unknown how paternal epigenetic information is transmitted through sperm chromatin. Here, we present a novel mouse model of paternal epigenetic inheritance, in which deposition of Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) mediated-repressive H3K27me3 is attenuated in the paternal germline. By applying modified methods of assisted reproductive technology using testicular sperm, we rescued infertility of mice missing Polycomb protein SCML2, which regulates germline gene expression by establishing H3K27me3 on bivalent promoters with other active marks H3K4me2/3. We profiled epigenomic states (H3K27me3 and H3K4me3) of testicular sperm and epididymal sperm, demonstrating that the epididymal pattern of the sperm epigenome is already established in testicular sperm and that SCML2 is required for this process. In F1 males of X-linked Scml2 -knockout mice, which have a wild-type genotype, gene expression is dysregulated in the male germline during spermiogenesis. These dysregulated genes are targets of SCML2-mediated H3K27me3 in F0 sperm. Further, dysregulation of gene expression was observed in the mutant-derived wild-type F1 preimplantation embryos. Together, we present functional evidence that the classic epigenetic regulator Polycomb mediates paternal epigenetic inheritance through sperm chromatin.

Title: Beyond the tail: the consequence of context in histone post-translational modification and chromatin research
Authors: Ellen N. Weinzapfel, Karlie N. Fedder-Semmes, Zu-Wen Sun, Michael-Christopher Keogh
Date: 2024-02-21

Abstract:
The role of histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) in chromatin structure and genome function has been the subject of intense debate for more than 60 years. Though complex, the discourse can be summarized in two distinct — and deceptively simple — questions: What is the function of histone PTMs? And how should they be studied? Decades of research show these queries are intricately linked and far from straightforward. Here we provide a historical perspective, highlighting how the arrival of new technologies shaped discovery and insight. Despite their limitations, the tools available at each period had a profound impact on chromatin research, and provided essential clues that advanced our understanding of histone PTM function. Finally, we discuss recent advances in the application of defined nucleosome substrates, the study of multivalent chromatin interactions, and new technologies driving the next era of histone PTM research.

Title: Epigenetic Explorations of Neurological Disorders, the Identification Methods, and Therapeutic Avenues
Authors: Zeba Firdaus, Xiaogang Li
Date: 2024-10-30

Abstract:
Neurodegenerative disorders are major health concerns globally, especially in aging societies. The exploration of brain epigenomes, which consist of multiple forms of DNA methylation and covalent histone modifications, offers new and unanticipated perspective into the mechanisms of aging and neurodegenerative diseases. Initially, chromatin defects in the brain were thought to be static abnormalities from early development associated with rare genetic syndromes. However, it is now evident that mutations and the dysregulation of the epigenetic machinery extend across a broader spectrum, encompassing adult-onset neurodegenerative diseases. Hence, it is crucial to develop methodologies that can enhance epigenetic research. Several approaches have been created to investigate alterations in epigenetics on a spectrum of scales—ranging from low to high—with a particular focus on detecting DNA methylation and histone modifications. This article explores the burgeoning realm of neuroepigenetics, emphasizing its role in enhancing our mechanistic comprehension of neurodegenerative disorders and elucidating the predominant techniques employed for detecting modifications in the epigenome. Additionally, we ponder the potential influence of these advancements on shaping future therapeutic approaches.

Abstract:
The reference human genome sequence set the stage for studies of genetic variation and its association with human disease, but a similar reference has lacked for epigenomic studies. To address this need, the NIH Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium generated the largest collection to-date of human epigenomes for primary cells and tissues. Here, we describe the integrative analysis of 111 reference human epigenomes generated as part of the program, profiled for histone modification patterns, DNA accessibility, DNA methylation, and RNA expression. We establish global maps of regulatory elements, define regulatory modules of coordinated activity, and their likely activators and repressors. We show that disease and trait-associated genetic variants are enriched in tissue-specific epigenomic marks, revealing biologically-relevant cell types for diverse human traits, and providing a resource for interpreting the molecular basis of human disease. Our results demonstrate the central role of epigenomic information for understanding gene regulation, cellular differentiation, and human disease.

Title: Transcription-Independent Heritability of Induced Histone Modifications in the Mouse Preimplantation Embryo
Authors: Matthew D. VerMilyea, Laura P. O'Neill, Bryan M. Turner
Date: 2009

Abstract:
Enzyme-catalyzed, post-translational modifications of core histones have been implicated in the complex changes in gene expression that drive early mammalian development. However, until recently the small number of cells available from the preimplantation embryo itself has prevented quantitative analysis of histone modifications at key regulator genes. The possible involvement of histone modifications in the embryo's response to extracellular signals, or as determinants of cell fate or lineage progression, remains unclear. Here we describe the use of a recently-developed chromatin immunoprecipitation technique (CChIP) to assay histone modification levels at key regulator genes ( Pou5f1 , Nanog , Cdx2 , Hoxb1 , Hoxb9 ) as mouse embryos progress from 8-cell to blastocyst in culture. Only by the blastocyst stage, when the embryonic (Inner Cell Mass) and extra-embryonic (Trophoblast) lineages are compared, do we see the expected association between histone modifications previously linked to active and silent chromatin, and transcriptional state. To explore responses to an environmental signal, we exposed embryos to the histone deacetylase inhibitor, anti-epileptic and known teratogen valproic acid (VPA), during progression from 8-cell to morula stage. Such treatment increased H4 acetylation and H3 lysine 4 methylation at the promoters of Hoxb1 and Hoxb9 , but not the promoters of Pou5f1 , Nanog,Cdx2 or the housekeeping gene Gapdh . Despite the absence of detectable Hoxb transcription, these VPA-induced changes were heritable, following removal of the inhibitor, at least until the blastocyst stage. The selective hyperacetylation of Hoxb promoters in response to a histone deacetylase inhibitor, suggests that Hox genes have a higher turnover of histone acetates than other genes in the preimplantation embryo. To explain the heritability, through mitosis, of VPA-induced changes in histone modification at Hoxb promoters, we describe how an epigenetic feed-forward loop, based on cross-talk between H3 acetylation and H3K4 methylation, might generate a persistently increased steady-state level of histone acetylation in response to a transient signal.

Abstract:
Core regulatory transcription factors (CR TFs) orchestrate the placement of super-enhancers (SEs) to activate transcription of cell-identity specifying gene networks, and are critical in promoting cancer. Here, we define the core regulatory circuitry of rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) and identify critical CR TF dependencies. These CR TFs build SEs that have the largest levels of histone acetylation, yet paradoxically SEs also harbor the highest amounts of histone deacetylases (HDACs). We find that hyperacetylation selectively halts CR TF transcription. To investigate the architectural determinants of this phenotype, we developed A bsolute Qu antification of A rchitecture (AQuA) HiChIP, revealing erosion of native SE contacts, and aberrant spreading of contacts involving histone acetylation. Hyperacetylation removes RNA Pol2 from core regulatory genetic elements, and eliminates RNA-Pol2 but not BRD4 phase condensates. This study identifies a SE-specific requirement for balancing histone modification states to maintain SE architecture and CR TF transcription.

Date: 2023-05-24

Abstract:
Changes in gene expression levels during brain development are thought to have played an important role in the evolution of human cognition. With the advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies, changes in brain developmental expression patterns, as well as human-specific brain gene expression, have been characterized. However, interpreting the origin of evolutionarily advanced cognition in human brains requires a deeper understanding of the regulation of gene expression, including the epigenomic context, along the primate genome. Here, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) to measure the genome-wide profiles of histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) and histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac), both of which are associated with transcriptional activation in the prefrontal cortex of humans, chimpanzees, and rhesus macaques. We found a discrete functional association, in which H3K4me3 HP gain was significantly associated with myelination assembly and signaling transmission, while H3K4me3 HP loss played a vital role in synaptic activity. Moreover, H3K27ac HP gain was enriched in interneuron and oligodendrocyte markers, and H3K27ac HP loss was enriched in CA1 pyramidal neuron markers. Using strand-specific RNA sequencing (ssRNA-seq), we first demonstrated that approximately 7 and 2% of human-specific expressed genes were epigenetically marked by H3K4me3 HP and H3K27ac HP, respectively, providing robust support for causal involvement of histones in gene expression. We also revealed the co-activation role of epigenetic modification and transcription factors in human-specific transcriptome evolution. Mechanistically, histone-modifying enzymes at least partially contribute to an epigenetic disturbance among primates, especially for the H3K27ac epigenomic marker. In line with this, peaks enriched in the macaque lineage were found to be driven by upregulated acetyl enzymes. Our results comprehensively elucidated a causal species-specific gene-histone-enzyme landscape in the prefrontal cortex and highlighted the regulatory interaction that drove transcriptional activation.

Title: Histone modifications during the life cycle of the brown alga Ectocarpus
Authors: Simon Bourdareau, Leila Tirichine, Bérangère Lombard, Damarys Loew, Delphine Scornet, Yue Wu, Susana M. Coelho, J. Mark Cock
Date: 2021-01-04

Abstract:
Brown algae evolved complex multicellularity independently of the animal and land plant lineages and are the third most developmentally complex phylogenetic group on the planet. An understanding of developmental processes in this group is expected to provide important insights into the evolutionary events necessary for the emergence of complex multicellularity. Here, we focus on mechanisms of epigenetic regulation involving post-translational modifications of histone proteins. A total of 47 histone post-translational modifications are identified, including a novel mark H2AZR38me1, but Ectocarpus lacks both H3K27me3 and the major polycomb complexes. ChIP-seq identifies modifications associated with transcription start sites and gene bodies of active genes and with transposons. H3K79me2 exhibits an unusual pattern, often marking large genomic regions spanning several genes. Transcription start sites of closely spaced, divergently transcribed gene pairs share a common nucleosome-depleted region and exhibit shared histone modification peaks. Overall, patterns of histone modifications are stable through the life cycle. Analysis of histone modifications at generation-biased genes identifies a correlation between the presence of specific chromatin marks and the level of gene expression. The overview of histone post-translational modifications in the brown alga presented here will provide a foundation for future studies aimed at understanding the role of chromatin modifications in the regulation of brown algal genomes.

Title: Dynamic epigenomic landscape and gene regulatory networks during embryonic development in Pacific white shrimp ( Litopenaeus vannamei ) as revealed by histone modification profiling using CUT&Tag

Abstract:
The Pacific white shrimp ( Litopenaeus vannamei ) is the most widely farmed shrimp species globally, yet the epigenetic regulation underlying its embryonic development remains largely unexplored. Histone modifications are known to orchestrate gene expression during early development in model organisms, but their role in crustaceans is poorly understood. In this study, we present the first comprehensive histone modification landscape during L. vannamei embryogenesis using CUT&Tag (Cleavage Under Targets and Tagmentation). We profiled high-resolution landscapes of four histone marks (H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K27ac, H3K27me3) across seven developmental stages from blastula to nauplius, revealing dynamic chromatin state transitions associated with developmental progression. Integration with transcriptomic data uncovered a strong temporal correlation between chromatin states and gene expression, particularly during zygotic genome activation (ZGA). Furthermore, our analysis uncovered key developmental genes associated with critical biological processes such as molting, body segmentation, and neurogenesis, providing novel insights into the epigenetic regulation of these events. Functional annotation of cis-regulatory elements based on histone marks identified candidate enhancers and regulatory loci linked to these key genes. Our study provides the first epigenomic framework of shrimp embryogenesis, uncovering chromatin-based regulatory mechanisms during early development. The identification of stage-specific enhancers and active chromatin regions offers valuable resources for functional genomics in crustaceans and sheds light on conserved and divergent aspects of ZGA regulation beyond model systems.

Title: Ready, SET, Go: Post-translational regulation of the histone lysine methylation network in budding yeast
Authors: Ryan J. Separovich, Marc R. Wilkins
Date: 2021-08

Abstract:
Histone lysine methylation is a key epigenetic modification that regulates eukaryotic transcription. Here, we comprehensively review the function and regulation of the histone methylation network in the budding yeast and model eukaryote, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. First, we outline the lysine methylation sites that are found on histone proteins in yeast (H3K4me1/2/3, H3K36me1/2/3, H3K79me1/2/3, and H4K5/8/12me1) and discuss their biological and cellular roles. Next, we detail the reduced but evolutionarily conserved suite of methyltransferase (Set1p, Set2p, Dot1p, and Set5p) and demethylase (Jhd1p, Jhd2p, Rph1p, and Gis1p) enzymes that are known to control histone lysine methylation in budding yeast cells. Specifically, we illustrate the domain architecture of the methylation enzymes and highlight the structural features that are required for their respective functions and molecular interactions. Finally, we discuss the prevalence of post-translational modifications on yeast histone methylation enzymes and how phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination in particular are emerging as key regulators of enzyme function. We note that it will be possible to completely connect the histone methylation network to the cell’s signaling system, given that all methylation sites and cognate enzymes are known, most phosphosites on the enzymes are known, and the mapping of kinases to phosphosites is tractable owing to the modest set of protein kinases in yeast. Moving forward, we expect that the rich variety of post-translational modifications that decorates the histone methylation machinery will explain many of the unresolved questions surrounding the function and dynamics of this intricate epigenetic network.

Title: A Tox21 Approach to Altered Epigenetic Landscapes: Assessing Epigenetic Toxicity Pathways Leading to Altered Gene Expression and Oncogenic Transformation In Vitro
Authors: Craig L. Parfett, Daniel Desaulniers
Date: 2017-06-01

Abstract:
An emerging vision for toxicity testing in the 21st century foresees in vitro assays assuming the leading role in testing for chemical hazards, including testing for carcinogenicity. Toxicity will be determined by monitoring key steps in functionally validated molecular pathways, using tests designed to reveal chemically-induced perturbations that lead to adverse phenotypic endpoints in cultured human cells. Risk assessments would subsequently be derived from the causal in vitro endpoints and concentration vs. effect data extrapolated to human in vivo concentrations. Much direct experimental evidence now shows that disruption of epigenetic processes by chemicals is a carcinogenic mode of action that leads to altered gene functions playing causal roles in cancer initiation and progression. In assessing chemical safety, it would therefore be advantageous to consider an emerging class of carcinogens, the epigenotoxicants, with the ability to change chromatin and/or DNA marks by direct or indirect effects on the activities of enzymes (writers, erasers/editors, remodelers and readers) that convey the epigenetic information. Evidence is reviewed supporting a strategy for in vitro hazard identification of carcinogens that induce toxicity through disturbance of functional epigenetic pathways in human somatic cells, leading to inactivated tumour suppressor genes and carcinogenesis. In the context of human cell transformation models, these in vitro pathway measurements ensure high biological relevance to the apical endpoint of cancer. Four causal mechanisms participating in pathways to persistent epigenetic gene silencing were considered: covalent histone modification, nucleosome remodeling, non-coding RNA interaction and DNA methylation. Within these four interacting mechanisms, 25 epigenetic toxicity pathway components (SET1, MLL1, KDM5, G9A, SUV39H1, SETDB1, EZH2, JMJD3, CBX7, CBX8, BMI, SUZ12, HP1, MPP8, DNMT1, DNMT3A, DNMT3B, TET1, MeCP2, SETDB2, BAZ2A, UHRF1, CTCF, HOTAIR and ANRIL) were found to have experimental evidence showing that functional perturbations played “driver” roles in human cellular transformation. Measurement of epigenotoxicants presents challenges for short-term carcinogenicity testing, especially in the high-throughput modes emphasized in the Tox21 chemicals testing approach. There is need to develop and validate in vitro tests to detect both, locus-specific, and genome-wide, epigenetic alterations with causal links to oncogenic cellular phenotypes. Some recent examples of cell-based high throughput chemical screening assays are presented that have been applied or have shown potential for application to epigenetic endpoints.

Title: Crossing epigenetic frontiers: the intersection of novel histone modifications and diseases
Authors: Weiyi Yao, Xinting Hu, Xin Wang
Date: 2024-09-16

Abstract:
Histone post-translational modifications (HPTMs), as one of the core mechanisms of epigenetic regulation, are garnering increasing attention due to their close association with the onset and progression of diseases and their potential as targeted therapeutic agents. Advances in high-throughput molecular tools and the abundance of bioinformatics data have led to the discovery of novel HPTMs which similarly affect gene expression, metabolism, and chromatin structure. Furthermore, a growing body of research has demonstrated that novel histone modifications also play crucial roles in the development and progression of various diseases, including various cancers, cardiovascular diseases, infectious diseases, psychiatric disorders, and reproductive system diseases. This review defines nine novel histone modifications: lactylation, citrullination, crotonylation, succinylation, SUMOylation, propionylation, butyrylation, 2-hydroxyisobutyrylation, and 2-hydroxybutyrylation. It comprehensively introduces the modification processes of these nine novel HPTMs, their roles in transcription, replication, DNA repair and recombination, metabolism, and chromatin structure, as well as their involvement in promoting the occurrence and development of various diseases and their clinical applications as therapeutic targets and potential biomarkers. Moreover, this review provides a detailed overview of novel HPTM inhibitors targeting various targets and their emerging strategies in the treatment of multiple diseases while offering insights into their future development prospects and challenges. Additionally, we briefly introduce novel epigenetic research techniques and their applications in the field of novel HPTM research.

Abstract:
The neoplastic stromal cells of giant cell tumor of bone (GCTB) carry a mutation in H3F3A , leading to a mutant histone variant, H3.3-G34W, as a sole recurrent genetic alteration. We show that in patient-derived stromal cells H3.3-G34W is incorporated into the chromatin and associates with massive epigenetic alterations on the DNA methylation, chromatin accessibility and histone modification level, that can be partially recapitulated in an orthogonal cell line system by the introduction of H3.3-G34W. These epigenetic alterations affect mainly heterochromatic and bivalent regions and provide possible explanations for the genomic instability, as well as the osteolytic phenotype of GCTB. The mutation occurs in differentiating mesenchymal stem cells and associates with an impaired osteogenic differentiation. We propose that the observed epigenetic alterations reflect distinct differentiation stages of H3.3 WT and H3.3 MUT stromal cells and add to H3.3-G34W-associated changes.

Abstract:
Faithful transfer of parental histones to newly replicated daughter DNA strands is critical for inheritance of epigenetic states. Although replication proteins that facilitate parental histone transfer have been identified, how intact histone H3-H4 tetramers travel from the front to the back of the replication fork remains unknown. Here, we use AlphaFold-Multimer structural predictions combined with biochemical and genetic approaches to identify the Mrc1/CLASPIN subunit of the replisome as a histone chaperone. Mrc1 contains a conserved histone binding domain that forms a brace around the H3-H4 tetramer mimicking nucleosomal DNA and H2A-H2B histones, is required for heterochromatin inheritance, and promotes parental histone recycling during replication. We further identify binding sites for the FACT histone chaperone in Swi1/TIMELESS and DNA polymerase α that are required for heterochromatin inheritance. We propose that Mrc1, in concert with FACT acting as a mobile co-chaperone, coordinates the distribution of parental histones to newly replicated DNA.

Title: NUCLIZE for quantifying epigenome: generating histone modification data at single-nucleosome resolution using genuine nucleosome positions
Authors: Daoshan Zheng, Justyna Trynda, Zhifu Sun, Zhaoyu Li
Date: 2019-07-02

Abstract:
Defining histone modification at single-nucleosome resolution provides accurate epigenomic information in individual nucleosomes. However, most of histone modification data deposited in current databases, such as ENCODE and Roadmap, have low resolution with peaks of several kilo-base pairs (kb), which due to the technical defects of regular ChIP-Seq technology. To generate histone modification data at single-nucleosome resolution, we developed a novel approach, NUCLIZE, using synergistic analyses of histone modification data from ChIP-Seq and high-resolution nucleosome mapping data from native MNase-Seq. With this approach, we generated quantitative epigenomics data of single and multivalent histone modification marks in each nucleosome. We found that the dominant trivalent histone mark (H3K4me3/H3K9ac/H3K27ac) and others showed defined and specific patterns near each TSS, indicating potential epigenetic codes regulating gene transcription. Single-nucleosome histone modification data render epigenomic data become quantitative, which is essential for investigating dynamic changes of epigenetic regulation in the biological process or for functional epigenomics studies. Thus, NUCLIZE turns current epigenomic mapping studies into genuine functional epigenomics studies with quantitative epigenomic data. The online version of this article (10.1186/s12864-019-5932-6) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.

Abstract:
In chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ), a diverse set of genetic mutations is embedded in a deregulated epigenetic landscape that drives cancerogenesis. To elucidate the role of aberrant chromatin features, we mapped DNA methylation, seven histone modifications, nucleosome positions, chromatin accessibility, binding of EBF 1 and CTCF , as well as the transcriptome of B cells from CLL patients and healthy donors. A globally increased histone deacetylase activity was detected and half of the genome comprised transcriptionally downregulated partially DNA methylated domains demarcated by CTCF . CLL samples displayed a H3K4me3 redistribution and nucleosome gain at promoters as well as changes of enhancer activity and enhancer linkage to target genes. A DNA binding motif analysis identified transcription factors that gained or lost binding in CLL at sites with aberrant chromatin features. These findings were integrated into a gene regulatory enhancer containing network enriched for B‐cell receptor signaling pathway components. Our study predicts novel molecular links to targets of CLL therapies and provides a valuable resource for further studies on the epigenetic contribution to the disease.

Title: Methylation across the central dogma in health and diseases: new therapeutic strategies
Authors: Ruochen Liu, Erhu Zhao, Huijuan Yu, Chaoyu Yuan, Muhammad Nadeem Abbas, Hongjuan Cui
Date: 2023-08-25

Abstract:
The proper transfer of genetic information from DNA to RNA to protein is essential for cell-fate control, development, and health. Methylation of DNA, RNAs, histones, and non-histone proteins is a reversible post-synthesis modification that finetunes gene expression and function in diverse physiological processes. Aberrant methylation caused by genetic mutations or environmental stimuli promotes various diseases and accelerates aging, necessitating the development of therapies to correct the disease-driver methylation imbalance. In this Review, we summarize the operating system of methylation across the central dogma, which includes writers, erasers, readers, and reader-independent outputs. We then discuss how dysregulation of the system contributes to neurological disorders, cancer, and aging. Current small-molecule compounds that target the modifiers show modest success in certain cancers. The methylome-wide action and lack of specificity lead to undesirable biological effects and cytotoxicity, limiting their therapeutic application, especially for diseases with a monogenic cause or different directions of methylation changes. Emerging tools capable of site-specific methylation manipulation hold great promise to solve this dilemma. With the refinement of delivery vehicles, these new tools are well positioned to advance the basic research and clinical translation of the methylation field.

Abstract:
Profiling combinations of histone modifications identifies gene regulatory elements in different states and discovers features controlling transcriptional and epigenetic programs. However, efforts to map chromatin states in complex, heterogeneous samples are hindered by the lack of methods that can profile multiple histone modifications together with transcriptomes in individual cells. Here, we describe single-cell multitargets and mRNA sequencing (scMTR-seq), a high-throughput method that enables simultaneous profiling of six histone modifications and transcriptome in single cells. We apply scMTR-seq to uncover dynamic and coordinated changes in chromatin states and transcriptomes during human endoderm differentiation. We also use scMTR-seq to produce lineage-resolved chromatin maps and gene regulatory networks in mouse blastocysts, revealing epigenetic asymmetries at gene regulatory regions between the three embryo lineages and identifying Trps1 as a potential repressor in epiblast cells of trophectoderm-associated enhancer networks and their target genes. Together, scMTR-seq enables investigation of combinatorial chromatin landscapes in a broad range of heterogeneous samples, providing insights into epigenetic regulatory systems.

Abstract:
In this study, Anyetei-Anum et al. demonstrate the dual role of H3K4 in regulating Polycomb target gene expression during Drosophila development. H3K4 methylation not only antagonizes PRC2's catalytic function to methylate H3K27 but also promotes activation of Polycomb group target genes, highlighting its key position in both the Trithorax and Polycomb epigenetic developmental pathways.

Date: 2021-03-09

Abstract:
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 is a positive-sense RNA virus, a causal agent of ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. ACE2R methylation across three CpG sites (cg04013915, cg08559914, cg03536816) determines the host cell’s entry. It regulates ACE2 expression by controlling the SIRT1 and KDM5B activity. Further, it regulates Type I and III IFN response by modulating H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 histone mark. SARS-CoV-2 protein with bromodomain and protein E mimics bromodomain histones and evades from host immune response. The 2′-O MTases mimics the host’s cap1 structure and plays a vital role in immune evasion through Hsp90-mediated epigenetic process to hijack the infected cells. Although the current review highlighted the critical epigenetic events associated with SARS-CoV-2 immune evasion, the detailed mechanism is yet to be elucidated.

Title: The role of histone post-translational modifications in cancer and cancer immunity: functions, mechanisms and therapeutic implications
Authors: Xiaohong Duan, Zhiyao Xing, Lu Qiao, Shan Qin, Xuejing Zhao, Yanhua Gong, Xueren Li
Date: 2024-11-15

Abstract:
Histones play crucial roles in both promoting and repressing gene expression, primarily regulated through post-translational modifications (PTMs) at specific amino acid residues. Histone PTMs, including methylation, acetylation, ubiquitination, phosphorylation, lactylation, butyrylation, and propionylation, act as important epigenetic markers. These modifications influence not only chromatin compaction but also gene expression. Their importance extends to the treatment and prevention of various human diseases, particularly cancer, due to their involvement in key cellular processes. Abnormal histone modifications and the enzymes responsible for these alterations often serve as critical drivers in tumor cell proliferation, invasion, apoptosis, and stemness. This review introduces key histone PTMs and the enzymes responsible for these modifications, examining their impact on tumorigenesis and cancer progression. Furthermore, it explores therapeutic strategies targeting histone PTMs and offers recommendations for identifying new potential therapeutic targets.

Title: Hybrid protein assembly-histone modification mechanism for PRC2-based epigenetic switching and memory
Authors: Cecilia Lövkvist, Pawel Mikulski, Svenja Reeck, Matthew Hartley, Caroline Dean, Martin Howard
Date: 2021-09-02

Abstract:
The histone modification H3K27me3 plays a central role in Polycomb-mediated epigenetic silencing. H3K27me3 recruits and allosterically activates Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), which adds this modification to nearby histones, providing a read/write mechanism for inheritance through DNA replication. However, for some PRC2 targets, a purely histone-based system for epigenetic inheritance may be insufficient. We address this issue at the Polycomb target FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) in Arabidopsis thaliana , as a narrow nucleation region of only ~three nucleosomes within FLC mediates epigenetic state switching and subsequent memory over many cell cycles. To explain the memory’s unexpected persistence, we introduce a mathematical model incorporating extra protein memory storage elements with positive feedback that persist at the locus through DNA replication, in addition to histone modifications. Our hybrid model explains many features of epigenetic switching/memory at FLC and encapsulates generic mechanisms that may be widely applicable.

Abstract:
Histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) are one of the main mechanisms of epigenetic regulation. Dysregulation of histone PTMs leads to many human diseases, such as cancer. Because of its high throughput, accuracy, and flexibility, mass spectrometry (MS) has emerged as a powerful tool in the epigenetic histone modification field, allowing the comprehensive and unbiased analysis of histone PTMs and chromatin-associated factors. Coupled with various techniques from molecular biology, biochemistry, chemical biology, and biophysics, MS has been used to characterize distinct aspects of histone PTMs in the epigenetic regulation of chromatin functions. In this review, we will describe advancements in the field of MS that have facilitated the analysis of histone PTMs and chromatin biology.

Abstract:
β-hydroxybutyrate (β-OHB) is an essential metabolic energy source during fasting and functions as a chromatin regulator by lysine β-hydroxybutyrylation (Kbhb) modification of the core histones H3 and H4. We report that Kbhb on histone H3 (H3K9bhb) is enriched at proximal promoters of critical gene subsets associated with lipolytic and ketogenic metabolic pathways in small intestine (SI) crypts during fasting. Similar Kbhb enrichment is observed in Lgr5 + stem cell-enriched epithelial spheroids treated with β-OHB in vitro . Combinatorial chromatin state analysis reveals that H3K9bhb is associated with active chromatin states and that fasting enriches for an H3K9bhb-H3K27ac signature at active metabolic gene promoters and distal enhancer elements. Intestinal knockout of Hmgcs2 results in marked loss of H3K9bhb-associated loci, suggesting that local production of β-OHB is responsible for chromatin reprogramming within the SI crypt. We conclude that modulation of H3K9bhb in SI crypts is a key gene regulatory event in response to fasting.

Date: 2022-06-25

Abstract:
Epigenetics is closely related to cardiovascular diseases. Genome-wide linkage and association analyses and candidate gene approaches illustrate the multigenic complexity of cardiovascular disease. Several epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, histone modification, and noncoding RNA, which are of importance for cardiovascular disease development and regression. Targeting epigenetic key enzymes, especially the DNA methyltransferases, histone methyltransferases, histone acetylases, histone deacetylases and their regulated target genes, could represent an attractive new route for the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Herein, we summarize the knowledge on epigenetic history and essential regulatory mechanisms in cardiovascular diseases. Furthermore, we discuss the preclinical studies and drugs that are targeted these epigenetic key enzymes for cardiovascular diseases therapy. Finally, we conclude the clinical trials that are going to target some of these processes.

Abstract:
Super-enhancers (SEs), which activate genes involved in cell-type specificity, have mainly been defined as genomic regions with top-ranked enrichment(s) of histone H3 with acetylated K27 (H3K27ac) and/or transcription coactivator(s) including a bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) family protein, BRD4. However, BRD4 preferentially binds to multi-acetylated histone H4, typically with acetylated K5 and K8 (H4K5acK8ac), leading us to hypothesize that SEs should be defined by high H4K5acK8ac enrichment at least as well as by that of H3K27ac. Here, we conducted genome-wide profiling of H4K5acK8ac and H3K27ac, BRD4 binding, and the transcriptome by using a BET inhibitor, JQ1, in three human glial cell lines. When SEs were defined as having the top ranks for H4K5acK8ac or H3K27ac signal, 43% of H4K5acK8ac-ranked SEs were distinct from H3K27ac-ranked SEs in a glioblastoma stem-like cell (GSC) line. CRISPR-Cas9–mediated deletion of the H4K5acK8ac-preferred SEs associated with MYCN and NFIC decreased the stem-like properties in GSCs. Collectively, our data highlights H4K5acK8ac’s utility for identifying genes regulating cell-type specificity.

Title: Arabidopsis thaliana : a powerful model organism to explore histone modifications and their upstream regulations
Authors: Yang Yu, Sihan Wang, Ziqin Wang, Renwei Gao, Joohyun Lee
Date: 2023-05-17

Abstract:
Histones are subjected to extensive covalent modifications that affect inter-nucleosomal interactions as well as alter chromatin structure and DNA accessibility. Through switching the corresponding histone modifications, the level of transcription and diverse downstream biological processes can be regulated. Although animal systems are widely used in studying histone modifications, the signalling processes that occur outside the nucleus prior to histone modifications have not been well understood due to the limitations including non viable mutants, partial lethality, and infertility of survivors. Here, we review the benefits of using Arabidopsis thaliana as the model organism to study histone modifications and their upstream regulations. Similarities among histones and key histone modifiers such as the Polycomb group (PcG) and Trithorax group (TrxG) in Drosophila, Human, and Arabidopsis are examined. Furthermore, prolonged cold-induced vernalization system has been well-studied and revealed the relationship between the controllable environment input (duration of vernalization), its chromatin modifications of FLOWERING LOCUS C ( FLC ), following gene expression, and the corresponding phenotypes. Such evidence suggests that research on Arabidopsis can bring insights into incomplete signalling pathways outside of the histone box, which can be achieved through viable reverse genetic screenings based on the phenotypes instead of direct monitoring of histone modifications among individual mutants. The potential upstream regulators in Arabidopsis can provide cues or directions for animal research based on the similarities between them.

Authors: Daniel Desaulniers, Paule Vasseur, Abigail Jacobs, M. Cecilia Aguila, Norman Ertych, Miriam N. Jacobs
Date: 2021-10-11

Abstract:
Epigenetics involves a series of mechanisms that entail histone and DNA covalent modifications and non-coding RNAs, and that collectively contribute to programing cell functions and differentiation. Epigenetic anomalies and DNA mutations are co-drivers of cellular dysfunctions, including carcinogenesis. Alterations of the epigenetic system occur in cancers whether the initial carcinogenic events are from genotoxic (GTxC) or non-genotoxic (NGTxC) carcinogens. NGTxC are not inherently DNA reactive, they do not have a unifying mode of action and as yet there are no regulatory test guidelines addressing mechanisms of NGTxC. To fil this gap, the Test Guideline Programme of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development is developing a framework for an integrated approach for the testing and assessment (IATA) of NGTxC and is considering assays that address key events of cancer hallmarks. Here, with the intent of better understanding the applicability of epigenetic assays in chemical carcinogenicity assessment, we focus on DNA methylation and histone modifications and review: (1) epigenetic mechanisms contributing to carcinogenesis, (2) epigenetic mechanisms altered following exposure to arsenic, nickel, or phenobarbital in order to identify common carcinogen-specific mechanisms, (3) characteristics of a series of epigenetic assay types, and (4) epigenetic assay validation needs in the context of chemical hazard assessment. As a key component of numerous NGTxC mechanisms of action, epigenetic assays included in IATA assay combinations can contribute to improved chemical carcinogen identification for the better protection of public health.

Title: A Brief Overview of the Epigenetic Regulatory Mechanisms in Plants
Authors: Theodoros Tresas, Ioannis Isaioglou, Andreas Roussis, Kosmas Haralampidis
Date: 2025-05-14

Abstract:
Plants continuously adapt to their environments by responding to various intrinsic and extrinsic signals. They face numerous biotic and abiotic stresses such as extreme temperatures, drought, or pathogens, requiring complex regulatory mechanisms to control gene activity and adapt their proteome for survival. Epigenetic regulation plays a crucial role in these adaptations, potentially leading to both heritable and non-heritable changes across generations. This process enables plants to adjust their gene expression profiles and acclimate effectively. It is also vital for plant development and productivity, affecting growth, yield, and seed quality, and enabling plants to “remember” environmental stimuli and adapt accordingly. Key epigenetic mechanisms that play significant roles include DNA methylation, histone modification, and ubiquitin ligase complex activity. These processes, which have been extensively studied in the last two decades, have led to a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms and expanded the potential for improving agriculturally and economically important plant traits. DNA methylation is a fundamental process that regulates gene expression by altering chromatin structure. The addition of methyl groups to cytosines by DNA methylases leads to gene suppression, whereas DNA demethylases reverse this effect. Histone modifications, on the other hand, collectively referred to as the “histone code”, influence chromatin structure and gene activity by promoting either gene transcription or gene silencing. These modifications are either recognized, added, or removed by a variety of enzymes that act practically as an environmental memory, having a significant impact on plant development and the responses of plants to environmental stimuli. Finally, ubiquitin ligase complexes, which tag specific histones or regulatory proteins with ubiquitin, are also crucial in plant epigenetic regulation. These complexes are involved in protein degradation and play important roles in regulating various cellular activities. The intricate interplay between DNA methylation, histone modifications, and ubiquitin ligases adds complexity to our understanding of epigenetic regulation. These mechanisms collectively control gene expression, generating a complex and branching network of interdependent regulatory pathways. A deeper understanding of this complex network that helps plants adapt to environmental changes and stressful conditions will provide valuable insights into the regulatory mechanisms involved. This knowledge could pave the way for new biotechnological approaches and plant breeding strategies aimed at enhancing crop resilience, productivity, and sustainable agriculture.

Title: The dynamic broad epigenetic (H3K4me3, H3K27ac) domain as a mark of essential genes
Authors: Tasnim H. Beacon, Geneviève P. Delcuve, Camila López, Gino Nardocci, Igor Kovalchuk, Andre J. van Wijnen, James R. Davie
Date: 2021-07-08

Abstract:
Transcriptionally active chromatin is marked by tri-methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me3) located after first exons and around transcription start sites. This epigenetic mark is typically restricted to narrow regions at the 5`end of the gene body, though a small subset of genes have a broad H3K4me3 domain which extensively covers the coding region. Although most studies focus on the H3K4me3 mark, the broad H3K4me3 domain is associated with a plethora of histone modifications (e.g., H3 acetylated at K27) and is therein termed broad epigenetic domain. Genes marked with the broad epigenetic domain are involved in cell identity and essential cell functions and have clinical potential as biomarkers for patient stratification. Reducing expression of genes with the broad epigenetic domain may increase the metastatic potential of cancer cells. Enhancers and super-enhancers interact with the broad epigenetic domain marked genes forming a hub of interactions involving nucleosome-depleted regions. Together, the regulatory elements coalesce with transcription factors, chromatin modifying/remodeling enzymes, coactivators, and the Mediator and/or Integrator complex into a transcription factory which may be analogous to a liquid–liquid phase-separated condensate. The broad epigenetic domain has a dynamic chromatin structure which supports frequent transcription bursts. In this review, we present the current knowledge of broad epigenetic domains.

Abstract:
Epigenomic modifications are instrumental for transcriptional regulation, but comprehensive reference epigenomes remain unexplored in rice. Here, we develop an enhanced chromatin immunoprecipitation (eChIP) approach for plants, and generate genome-wide profiling of five histone modifications and RNA polymerase II occupancy with it. By integrating chromatin accessibility, DNA methylation, and transcriptome datasets, we construct comprehensive epigenome landscapes across various tissues in 20 representative rice varieties. Approximately 81.8% of rice genomes are annotated with different epigenomic properties. Refinement of promoter regions using open chromatin and H3K4me3-marked regions provides insight into transcriptional regulation. We identify extensive enhancer-like promoters with potential enhancer function on transcriptional regulation through chromatin interactions. Active and repressive histone modifications and the predicted enhancers vary largely across tissues, whereas inactive chromatin states are relatively stable. Together, these datasets constitute a valuable resource for functional element annotation in rice and indicate the central role of epigenomic information in understanding transcriptional regulation.

Title: Cross talk between acetylation and methylation regulators reveals histone modifier expression patterns posing prognostic and therapeutic implications on patients with colon cancer

Abstract:
Alterations in histone modifications have been reported to be related to tumorigenicity and tumor progression. However, whether histone modification can aid the classification of patients or influence clinical behavior in patients with colon cancer remains unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate histone modifier expression patterns using the unsupervised clustering of the transcriptomic expressions of 88 histone acetylation and methylation regulators. In this study, by consensus clustering analysis based on the transcriptome data of 88 histone modification regulators, we identified four distinct expression patterns of histone modifiers associated with different prognoses, intrinsic fluorouracil sensitivities, biological pathways, and tumor microenvironment characteristics among 1372 colon cancer samples. In these four clusters, the HMC4 cluster represented a stroma activation phenotype characterized by both the worst prognosis and lowest response rates to fluorouracil treatment. Then, we established a scoring scheme comprising 155 genes designated as “HM_score” by using the Boruta algorithm to distinguish colon cancer patients within the HMC4 cluster. Patients with a high HM_score were considered to have high stromal pathway activation, high stromal fraction, and an unfavorable prognosis. Further analyses indicated that a high HM_score also correlated with reduced therapeutic benefits from fluorouracil chemotherapy. Moreover, through CRISPR library screening, ZEB2 was found to be a critical driver gene that mediates fluorouracil resistance, which is associated with histone modifier expression patterns. This study highlights that characterizing histone modifier expression patterns may help better understand the epigenetic mechanisms underlying tumor heterogeneity in patients with colon cancer and provide more personalized therapeutic strategies.

Abstract:
Faithful inheritance of parental histones is essential to maintain epigenetic information and cellular identity during cell division. Parental histones are evenly deposited onto the replicating DNA of sister chromatids in a process dependent on the MCM2 subunit of DNA helicase. However, the impact of aberrant parental histone partition on human disease such as cancer is largely unknown. In this study, we construct a model of impaired histone inheritance by introducing MCM2-2A mutation (defective in parental histone binding) in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. The resulting impaired histone inheritance reprograms the histone modification landscapes of progeny cells, especially the repressive histone mark H3K27me3. Lower H3K27me3 levels derepress the expression of genes associated with development, cell proliferation, and epithelial to mesenchymal transition. These epigenetic changes confer fitness advantages to some newly emerged subclones and consequently promote tumor growth and metastasis after orthotopic implantation. In summary, our results indicate that impaired inheritance of parental histones can drive tumor progression.

Abstract:
Histones are conserved nuclear proteins that function as part of the nucleosome in the regulation of chromatin structure and gene expression. Interestingly, extracellular histones populate biofluids from healthy individuals, and when elevated, may contribute to various acute and chronic diseases. It is generally assumed that most extracellular histones exist as nucleosomes, as components of extracellular chromatin. We analysed cell culture models under normal and stressed conditions to identify pathways of histone secretion. We report that core and linker histones localize to extracellular vesicles (EVs) and are secreted via the multivesicular body/exosome pathway. Upregulation of EV histone secretion occurs in response to cellular stress, with enhanced vesicle secretion and a shift towards a population of smaller EVs. Most histones were membrane associated with the outer surface of EVs. Degradation of EV‐DNA did not impact significantly on EV‐histone association. Individual histones  and histone octamers bound strongly to liposomes and EVs, but nucleosomes did not, showing histones do not require DNA for EV binding. Histones colocalized to tetraspanin positive EVs but using genetic or pharmacological intervention, we found that all known pathways of exosome biogenesis acted positively on histone secretion. Inhibition of autophagy and lysosomal degradation had a strong positive effect on EV histone release. Unexpectedly, EV‐associated histones lacked the extensive post‐translational modification of their nuclear counterparts, suggesting loss of PTMs may be involved in their trafficking or secretion. Our data does not support a significant role for EV‐histones existing as nucleosomes. We show for the first time that histones are secreted from cells as membrane proteins via EVs/exosomes. This fundamental discovery provides support for further investigation of the biological activity of exosome associated histones and their role in disease.

Title: Two genomes, one cell: Mitochondrial-nuclear coordination via epigenetic pathways
Authors: Meike Wiese, Andrew J. Bannister
Date: 2020-08

Abstract:
Virtually all eukaryotic cells contain spatially distinct genomes, a single nuclear genome that harbours the vast majority of genes and much smaller genomes found in mitochondria present at thousands of copies per cell. To generate a coordinated gene response to various environmental cues, the genomes must communicate with each another. Much of this bi-directional crosstalk relies on epigenetic processes, including DNA, RNA, and histone modification pathways. Crucially, these pathways, in turn depend on many metabolites generated in specific pools throughout the cell, including the mitochondria. They also involve the transport of metabolites as well as the enzymes that catalyse these modifications between nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. This study examines some of the molecular mechanisms by which metabolites influence the activity of epigenetic enzymes, ultimately affecting gene regulation in response to metabolic cues. We particularly focus on the subcellular localisation of metabolite pools and the crosstalk between mitochondrial and nuclear proteins and RNAs. We consider aspects of mitochondrial-nuclear communication involving histone proteins, and potentially their epigenetic marks, and discuss how nuclear-encoded enzymes regulate mitochondrial function through epitranscriptomic pathways involving various classes of RNA molecules within mitochondria. Epigenetic communication between nuclear and mitochondrial genomes occurs at multiple levels, ultimately ensuring a coordinated gene expression response between different genetic environments. Metabolic changes stimulated, for example, by environmental factors, such as diet or physical activity, alter the relative abundances of various metabolites, thereby directly affecting the epigenetic machinery. These pathways, coupled to regulated protein and RNA transport mechanisms, underpin the coordinated gene expression response. Their overall importance to the fitness of a cell is highlighted by the identification of many mutations in the pathways we discuss that have been linked to human disease including cancer.

Authors: Yu’e Liu, Chao Chen, Xinye Wang, Yihong Sun, Jin Zhang, Juxiang Chen, Yufeng Shi
Date: 2022-08-13

Abstract:
Mitochondria are not only the main energy supplier but are also the cell metabolic center regulating multiple key metaborates that play pivotal roles in epigenetics regulation. These metabolites include acetyl-CoA, α-ketoglutarate (α-KG), S-adenosyl methionine (SAM), NAD + , and O-linked beta-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc), which are the main substrates for DNA methylation and histone post-translation modifications, essential for gene transcriptional regulation and cell fate determination. Tumorigenesis is attributed to many factors, including gene mutations and tumor microenvironment. Mitochondria and epigenetics play essential roles in tumor initiation, evolution, metastasis, and recurrence. Targeting mitochondrial metabolism and epigenetics are promising therapeutic strategies for tumor treatment. In this review, we summarize the roles of mitochondria in key metabolites required for epigenetics modification and in cell fate regulation and discuss the current strategy in cancer therapies via targeting epigenetic modifiers and related enzymes in metabolic regulation. This review is an important contribution to the understanding of the current metabolic-epigenetic-tumorigenesis concept.

Abstract:
Genome-wide maps of histone modifications have been obtained for several plant species. However, most studies focus on model systems and do not enforce FAIR data management principles. Here we study the H3K27me3 epigenome and associated transcriptome of Brassica rapa , an important vegetable cultivated worldwide. We performed H3K27me3 chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing and transcriptomic analysis by 3′-end RNA sequencing from B. rapa leaves and inflorescences. To analyze these data we developed a Reproducible Epigenomic Analysis pipeline using Galaxy and Jupyter, packaged into Docker images to facilitate transparency and reuse. We found that H3K27me3 covers roughly one-third of all B. rapa protein-coding genes and its presence correlates with low transcript levels. The comparative analysis between leaves and inflorescences suggested that the expression of various floral regulatory genes during development depends on H3K27me3. To demonstrate the importance of H3K27me3 for B. rapa development, we characterized a mutant line deficient in the H3K27 methyltransferase activity. We found that braA.clf mutant plants presented pleiotropic alterations, e.g., curly leaves due to increased expression and reduced H3K27me3 levels at AGAMOUS-like loci. We characterized the epigenetic mark H3K27me3 at genome-wide levels and provide genetic evidence for its relevance in B. rapa development. Our work reveals the epigenomic landscape of H3K27me3 in B. rapa and provides novel genomics datasets and bioinformatics analytical resources. We anticipate that this work will lead the way to further epigenomic studies in the complex genome of Brassica crops.

Abstract:
Epigenetic machinery is a cornerstone in normal cell development, orchestrating tissue-specific gene expression in mammalian cells. Aberrations in this intricate landscape drive substantial changes in gene function, emerging as a linchpin in cancer etiology and progression. While cancer was conventionally perceived as solely a genetic disorder, its contemporary definition encompasses genetic alterations intertwined with disruptive epigenetic abnormalities. This review explores the profound impact of DNA methylation, histone modifications, and noncoding RNAs on fundamental cellular processes. When these pivotal epigenetic mechanisms undergo disruption, they intricately guide the acquisition of the 6 hallmark characteristics of cancer within seemingly normal cells. Leveraging the latest advancements in decoding these epigenetic intricacies holds immense promise, heralding a new era in developing targeted and more efficacious treatment modalities against cancers driven by aberrant epigenetic modifications.

Title: Insights into the Epigenetic Basis of Plant Salt Tolerance
Authors: Dongyu Zhang, Duoqian Zhang, Yaobin Zhang, Guanlin Li, Dehao Sun, Bo Zhou, Jingrui Li
Date: 2024-10-31

Abstract:
The increasing salinity of agricultural lands highlights the urgent need to improve salt tolerance in crops, a critical factor for ensuring food security. Epigenetic mechanisms are pivotal in plant adaptation to salt stress. This review elucidates the complex roles of DNA methylation, histone modifications, histone variants, and non-coding RNAs in the fine-tuning of gene expression in response to salt stress. It emphasizes how heritable changes, which do not alter the DNA sequence but significantly impact plant phenotype, contribute to this adaptation. DNA methylation is notably prevalent under high-salinity conditions and is associated with changes in gene expression that enhance plant resilience to salt. Modifications in histones, including both methylation and acetylation, are directly linked to the regulation of salt-tolerance genes. The presence of histone variants, such as H2A.Z, is altered under salt stress, promoting plant adaptation to high-salinity environments. Additionally, non-coding RNAs, such as miRNAs and lncRNAs, contribute to the intricate gene regulatory network under salt stress. This review also underscores the importance of understanding these epigenetic changes in developing plant stress memory and enhancing stress tolerance.

Abstract:
The inheritance of parental histones across the replication fork is thought to mediate epigenetic memory. Here, we reveal that fission yeast Mrc1 (CLASPIN in humans) binds H3-H4 tetramers and operates as a central coordinator of symmetric parental histone inheritance. Mrc1 mutants in a key connector domain disrupted segregation of parental histones to the lagging strand comparable to Mcm2 histone-binding mutants. Both mutants showed clonal and asymmetric loss of H3K9me-mediated gene silencing. AlphaFold predicted co-chaperoning of H3-H4 tetramers by Mrc1 and Mcm2, with the Mrc1 connector domain bridging histone and Mcm2 binding. Biochemical and functional analysis validated this model and revealed a duality in Mrc1 function: disabling histone binding in the connector domain disrupted lagging-strand recycling while another histone-binding mutation impaired leading strand recycling. We propose that Mrc1 toggles histones between the lagging and leading strand recycling pathways, in part by intra-replisome co-chaperoning, to ensure epigenetic transmission to both daughter cells.

Abstract:
Jasmonates (JAs) mediate trade-off between responses to both biotic and abiotic stress and growth in plants. The Arabidopsis thaliana HISTONE DEACETYLASE 6 is part of the CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1 receptor complex, co-repressing the HDA6/COI1-dependent acetic acid-JA pathway that confers plant drought tolerance. The decrease in HDA6 binding to target DNA mirrors histone H4 acetylation (H4Ac) changes during JA-mediated drought response, and mutations in HDA6 also cause depletion in the constitutive repressive marker H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3). However, the genome-wide effect of HDA6 on H4Ac and much of the impact of JAs on histone modifications and chromatin remodelling remain elusive. We performed high-throughput ChIP-Seq on the HDA6 mutant, axe1- 5, and wild-type plants with or without methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment to assess changes in active H4ac and repressive H3K27me3 histone markers. Transcriptional regulation was investigated in parallel by microarray analysis in the same conditions. MeJA- and HDA6-dependent histone modifications on genes for specialized metabolism; linolenic acid and phenylpropanoid pathways; and abiotic and biotic stress responses were identified. H4ac and H3K27me3 enrichment also differentially affects JAs and HDA6-mediated genome integrity and gene regulatory networks, substantiating the role of HDA6 interacting with specific families of transposable elements in planta and highlighting further specificity of action as well as novel targets of HDA6 in the context of JA signalling for abiotic and biotic stress responses. The findings demonstrate functional overlap for MeJA and HDA6 in tuning plant developmental plasticity and response to stress at the histone modification level. MeJA and HDA6, nonetheless, maintain distinct activities on histone modifications to modulate genetic variability and to allow adaptation to environmental challenges.

Authors: Hejer Dhahri, Wesley N. Saintilnord, Darrell Chandler, Yvonne N. Fondufe-Mittendorf
Date: 2024-06-20

Abstract:
The incorporation of histone variants has structural ramifications on nucleosome dynamics and stability. Due to their unique sequences, histone variants can alter histone–histone or histone–DNA interactions, impacting the folding of DNA around the histone octamer and the overall higher-order structure of chromatin fibers. These structural modifications alter chromatin compaction and accessibility of DNA by transcription factors and other regulatory proteins to influence gene regulatory processes such as DNA damage and repair, as well as transcriptional activation or repression. Histone variants can also generate a unique interactome composed of histone chaperones and chromatin remodeling complexes. Any of these perturbations can contribute to cellular plasticity and the progression of human diseases. Here, we focus on a frequently overlooked group of histone variants lying within the four human histone gene clusters and their contribution to breast cancer.

Abstract:
Developmental leaf senescence (DLS) is an irreversible process followed by cell death. Dark-induced leaf senescence (DILS) is a reversible process that allows adaptations to changing environmental conditions. As a result of exposure to adverse environmental changes, plants have developed mechanisms that enable them to survive. One of these is the redirection of metabolism into the senescence pathway. The plant seeks to optimise resource allocation. Our research aims to demonstrate how epigenetic machinery regulates leaf senescence, including its irreversibility. In silico analyses allowed the complex identification and characterisation of 117 genes involved in epigenetic processes in barley. These genes include those responsible for DNA methylation, post-translational histone modifications, and ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling complexes. We then performed RNAseq analysis after DILS and DLS to evaluate their expression in senescence-dependent leaf metabolism. Principal component analysis revealed that evaluated gene expression in developmental senescence was similar to controls, while induced senescence displayed a distinct profile. Western blot experiments revealed that senescence engages senescence-specific histone modification. During DILS and DLS, the methylation of histone proteins H3K4me3 and H3K9me2 increased. H3K9ac acetylation levels significantly decreased during DILS and remained unchanged during DLS. The study identified different epigenetic regulations of senescence types in barley leaves. These findings are valuable for exploring epigenetic regulation of senescence-related molecular mechanisms, particularly in response to premature, induced leaf senescence. Based on the results, we suggest the presence of an epigenetically regulated molecular switch between cell survival and cell death in DILS, highlighting an epigenetically driven cell survival metabolic response.

Title: Histone Modification in NSCLC: Molecular Mechanisms and Therapeutic Targets
Authors: Khuloud Bajbouj, Abeer Al-Ali, Rakhee K. Ramakrishnan, Maha Saber-Ayad, Qutayba Hamid
Date: 2021-10-28

Abstract:
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality in both genders, with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounting for about 85% of all lung cancers. At the time of diagnosis, the tumour is usually locally advanced or metastatic, shaping a poor disease outcome. NSCLC includes adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell lung carcinoma. Searching for novel therapeutic targets is mandated due to the modest effect of platinum-based therapy as well as the targeted therapies developed in the last decade. The latter is mainly due to the lack of mutation detection in around half of all NSCLC cases. New therapeutic modalities are also required to enhance the effect of immunotherapy in NSCLC. Identifying the molecular signature of NSCLC subtypes, including genetics and epigenetic variation, is crucial for selecting the appropriate therapy or combination of therapies. Epigenetic dysregulation has a key role in the tumourigenicity, tumour heterogeneity, and tumour resistance to conventional anti-cancer therapy. Epigenomic modulation is a potential therapeutic strategy in NSCLC that was suggested a long time ago and recently starting to attract further attention. Histone acetylation and deacetylation are the most frequently studied patterns of epigenetic modification. Several histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors (HDIs), such as vorinostat and panobinostat, have shown promise in preclinical and clinical investigations on NSCLC. However, further research on HDIs in NSCLC is needed to assess their anti-tumour impact. Another modification, histone methylation, is one of the most well recognized patterns of histone modification. It can either promote or inhibit transcription at different gene loci, thus playing a rather complex role in lung cancer. Some histone methylation modifiers have demonstrated altered activities, suggesting their oncogenic or tumour-suppressive roles. In this review, patterns of histone modifications in NSCLC will be discussed, focusing on the molecular mechanisms of epigenetic modifications in tumour progression and metastasis, as well as in developing drug resistance. Then, we will explore the therapeutic targets emerging from studying the NSCLC epigenome, referring to the completed and ongoing clinical trials on those medications.

Abstract:
In the process of DNA replication, the first steps in restoring the chromatin landscape involve parental histone recycling and new histone deposition. Disrupting histone recycling to either the leading or lagging strand induces asymmetric histone inheritance, affecting epigenome maintenance and cellular identity. However, the order and kinetics of these effects remain elusive. Here, we use inducible mutants to dissect the early and late consequences of impaired histone recycling. Simultaneous disruption of both leading (POLE4) and lagging strand (MCM2-2A) recycling pathways impairs the transmission of parental histones to newly synthesized DNA, releasing some parental histones to the soluble pool. Subsequently, H3K27me3 accumulates aberrantly during chromatin restoration in a manner preceding gene expression changes. Loss of histone inheritance and the ensuing chromatin restoration defects alter gene expression in embryonic stem cells and challenge differentiation programs and cell viability. Our findings demonstrate the importance of efficient transmission of histone-based information during DNA replication for maintaining chromatin landscapes, differentiation potential, and cellular viability.

Date: 2023

Abstract:
The dysfunction of immune cell development often impairs immunological homeostasis, thus causing various human diseases. Accumulating evidence shows that the development of different immune cells from hematopoietic stem cells are highly fine-tuned by different epigenetic mechanisms including DNA methylation, histone modifications, chromatin remodeling and RNA-related regulations. Understanding how epigenetic regulators modulate normal development of immune cells contributes to the identification of new strategies for various diseases. Here, we review recent advances suggesting that epigenetic modulations can orchestrate immune cell development and functions through their impact on critical gene expression. We also discuss the aberrations of epigenetic modulations in immune cells that influence tumor progression, and the fact that underlying mechanisms affect how epigenetic drugs interfere with tumor progression in the clinic.

Abstract:
The accumulation of large epigenomics data consortiums provides us with the opportunity to extrapolate existing knowledge to new cell types and conditions. We propose Epitome, a deep neural network that learns similarities of chromatin accessibility between well characterized reference cell types and a query cellular context, and copies over signal of transcription factor binding and modification of histones from reference cell types when chromatin profiles are similar to the query. Epitome achieves state-of-the-art accuracy when predicting transcription factor binding sites on novel cellular contexts and can further improve predictions as more epigenetic signals are collected from both reference cell types and the query cellular context of interest.

Abstract:
Cancer is a complex disease resulting from the genetic and epigenetic disruption of normal cells. The mechanistic understanding of the pathways involved in tumor transformation has implicated a priori predominance of epigenetic perturbations and a posteriori genetic instability. In this work, we aimed to explain the mechanistic involvement of epigenetic pathways in the cancer process, as well as the abilities of natural bioactive compounds isolated from medicinal plants (flavonoids, phenolic acids, stilbenes, and ketones) to specifically target the epigenome of tumor cells. The molecular events leading to transformation, angiogenesis, and dissemination are often complex, stochastic, and take turns. On the other hand, the decisive advances in genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics have allowed, in recent years, for the mechanistic decryption of the molecular pathways of the cancerization process. This could explain the possibility of specifically targeting this or that mechanism leading to cancerization. With the plasticity and flexibility of epigenetic modifications, some studies have started the pharmacological screening of natural substances against different epigenetic pathways (DNA methylation, histone acetylation, histone methylation, and chromatin remodeling) to restore the cellular memory lost during tumor transformation. These substances can inhibit DNMTs, modify chromatin remodeling, and adjust histone modifications in favor of pre-established cell identity by the differentiation program. Epidrugs are molecules that target the epigenome program and can therefore restore cell memory in cancerous diseases. Natural products isolated from medicinal plants such as flavonoids and phenolic acids have shown their ability to exhibit several actions on epigenetic modifiers, such as the inhibition of DNMT, HMT, and HAT. The mechanisms of these substances are specific and pleiotropic and can sometimes be stochastic, and their use as anticancer epidrugs is currently a remarkable avenue in the fight against human cancers.

Authors: Sushil Kumar Dubey, Rashmi Dubey, Mark Ellsworth Kleinman
Date: 2024-02-09

Abstract:
As the global population experiences a notable surge in aging demographics, the need to understand the intricate molecular pathways exacerbated by age-related stresses, including epigenetic dysregulation, becomes a priority. Epigenetic mechanisms play a critical role in driving age-related diseases through altered gene expression, genomic instability, and irregular chromatin remodeling. In this review, we focus on histones, a central component of the epigenome, and consolidate the key findings of histone loss and genome-wide redistribution as fundamental processes contributing to aging and senescence. The review provides insights into novel histone expression profiles, nucleosome occupancy, disruptions in higher-order chromatin architecture, and the emergence of noncanonical histone variants in the aging cellular landscape. Furthermore, we explore the current state of our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of histone deficiency in aging cells. Specific emphasis is placed on highlighting histone degradation pathways in the cell and studies that have explored potential strategies to mitigate histone loss or restore histone levels in aging cells. Finally, in addressing future perspectives, the insights gained from this review hold profound implications for advancing strategies that actively intervene in modulating histone expression profiles in the context of cellular aging and identifying potential therapeutic targets for alleviating a multitude of age-related diseases.

Abstract:
Cell fate progression of pluripotent progenitors is strictly regulated, resulting in high human cell diversity. Epigenetic modifications also orchestrate cell fate restriction. Unveiling the epigenetic mechanisms underlying human cell diversity has been difficult. In this study, we use human brain and retina organoid models and present single-cell profiling of H3K27ac, H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 histone modifications from progenitor to differentiated neural fates to reconstruct the epigenomic trajectories regulating cell identity acquisition. We capture transitions from pluripotency through neuroepithelium to retinal and brain region and cell type specification. Switching of repressive and activating epigenetic modifications can precede and predict cell fate decisions at each stage, providing a temporal census of gene regulatory elements and transcription factors. Removing H3K27me3 at the neuroectoderm stage disrupts fate restriction, resulting in aberrant cell identity acquisition. Our single-cell epigenome-wide map of human neural organoid development serves as a blueprint to explore human cell fate determination.

In order to understand the coordinated proteome changes associated with differentiation of a cultured cell pluripotency model, protein expression changes induced by treatment of NT2 embryonal carcinoma cells with retinoic acid were monitored by mass spectrometry. The relative levels of over 5000 proteins were mapped across distinct cell fractions. Analysis of the chromatin fraction revealed major abundance changes among chromatin proteins and epigenetic pathways between the pluripotent and differentiated states. Protein complexes associated with epigenetic regulation of gene expression, chromatin remodelling (e.g., SWI/SNF, NuRD) and histone-modifying enzymes (e.g., Polycomb, MLL) were found to be extensively regulated. We therefore investigated histone modifications before and after differentiation, observing changes in the global levels of lysine acetylation and methylation across the four canonical histone protein families, as well as among variant histones. We identified the set of proteins with affinity to peptides housing the histone marks H3K4me3 and H3K27me3, and found increased levels of chromatin-associated histone H3 tail trimming following differentiation that correlated with increased expression levels of cathepsin proteases. We further found that inhibition of cathepsins B and D reduces histone H3 clipping. Overall, the work reveals a global reorganization of the cell proteome congruent with differentiation, highlighting the key role of multiple epigenetic pathways, and demonstrating a direct link between cathepsin B and D activity and histone modification.

Title: Changes in Hox Gene Chromatin Organization during Odontogenic Lineage Specification
Authors: Gokul Gopinathan, Xinmin Zhang, Xianghong Luan, Thomas G. H. Diekwisch
Date: 2023-01-12

Abstract:
Craniofacial tissues comprise highly evolved organs characterized by a relative lack of expression in the HOX family transcription factors. In the present study, we sought to define the epigenetic events that limit HOX gene expression from undifferentiated neural crest cells to semi-differentiated odontogenic progenitors and to explore the effects of elevated levels of HOX . The ChIP-chip data demonstrated high levels of repressive H3K27me3 marks on the HOX gene promoters in ES and cranial neural crest cells when compared to the H3K4me3 marks, while the K4/K27 ratio was less repressive in the odontogenic progenitors, dental follicle, dental pulp, periodontal ligament fibroblasts, alveolar bone osteoblasts, and cementoblasts. The gene expression of multiple HOX genes, especially those from the HOXA and HOXB clusters, was significantly elevated and many times higher in alveolar bone cells than in the dental follicle cells. In addition, the HOX levels in the skeletal osteoblasts were many times higher in the trunk osteoblasts compared to the alveolar bone osteoblasts, and the repressive mark H3K27me3 promoter occupancy was substantially and significantly elevated in the alveolar bone osteoblasts when compared to the trunk osteoblasts. To explore the effect of elevated HOX levels in craniofacial neural crest cells, HOX expression was induced by transfecting cells with the Cdx4 transcription factor, resulting in a significant decrease in the mineralization markers, RUNX2, OSX, and OCN upon HOX elevation. Promoting HOX gene expression in developing teeth using the small molecule EZH2 inhibitor GSK126 resulted in an increased number of patterning events, supernumerary cusp formation, and increased Hoxa4 and Hoxb6 gene expression when compared to the controls. Together, these studies illustrate the profound effects of epigenetic regulatory events at all stages of the differentiation of craniofacial peripheral tissues from the neural crest, including lineage specification, tissue differentiation, and patterning.

Abstract:
Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4A (HNF4A/NR2a1), a transcriptional regulator of hepatocyte identity, controls genes that are crucial for liver functions, primarily through binding to enhancers. In mammalian cells, active and primed enhancers are marked by monomethylation of histone 3 (H3) at lysine 4 (K4) (H3K4me1) in a cell type-specific manner. How this modification is established and maintained at enhancers in connection with transcription factors (TFs) remains unknown. Using analysis of genome-wide histone modifications, TF binding, chromatin accessibility and gene expression, we show that HNF4A is essential for an active chromatin state. Using HNF4A loss and gain of function experiments in vivo and in cell lines in vitro, we show that HNF4A affects H3K4me1, H3K27ac and chromatin accessibility, highlighting its contribution to the establishment and maintenance of a transcriptionally permissive epigenetic state. Mechanistically, HNF4A interacts with the mixed-lineage leukaemia 4 (MLL4) complex facilitating recruitment to HNF4A-bound regions. Our findings indicate that HNF4A enriches H3K4me1, H3K27ac and establishes chromatin opening at transcriptional regulatory regions.

Abstract:
Epigenetic regulation of gene expression is tightly controlled by the dynamic modification of histones by chemical groups, the diversity of which has largely expanded over the past decade with the discovery of lysine acylations, catalyzed from acyl-coenzymes A. We investigated the dynamics of lysine acetylation and crotonylation on histones H3 and H4 during mouse spermatogenesis. Lysine crotonylation appeared to be of significant abundance compared to acetylation, particularly on Lys27 of histone H3 (H3K27cr) that accumulates in sperm in a cleaved form of H3. We identified the genomic localization of H3K27cr and studied its effects on transcription compared to the classical active mark H3K27ac at promoters and distal enhancers. The presence of both marks was strongly associated with highest gene expression. Assessment of their co-localization with transcription regulators (SLY, SOX30) and chromatin-binding proteins (BRD4, BRDT, BORIS and CTCF) indicated systematic highest binding when both active marks were present and different selective binding when present alone at chromatin. H3K27cr and H3K27ac finally mark the building of some sperm super-enhancers. This integrated analysis of omics data provides an unprecedented level of understanding of gene expression regulation by H3K27cr in comparison to H3K27ac, and reveals both synergistic and specific actions of each histone modification.

Title: Epigenetic Modifications in the Retinal Pigment Epithelium of the Eye During RPE-Related Regeneration or Retinal Diseases in Vertebrates
Authors: Eleonora Grigoryan, Yuliya Markitantova
Date: 2025-06-25

Abstract:
The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is a cellular source of retinal regeneration in lower vertebrates and a cellular source of retinal diseases in mammals, including humans. Both processes are based on a genetic program for the conversion of RPE cells into cells of other phenotypes: neural in the first case and mesenchymal in the second. RPE reprogramming in the neural direction is realized in tailed amphibians and bird embryos in vivo, but in higher vertebrates and humans, this process is realized in vitro. Epigenetic regulation determines the phenotypic plasticity of RPE cells, i.e., their choice of the cell differentiation pathway in animals of different classes. It has been suggested that the implementation of the genetic program for RPE reprogramming into different types of retinal neurons in adult amphibians and birds at the early stages of embryogenesis is conditioned by the specificity of the epigenetic landscape. The retinal RPE-dependent pathologies in mammals are characterized by different epigenetic signatures, and have a shared characteristic: specifically, a deficient epigenetic landscape (dysregulations in DNA methylation and histone modifications). Knowledge of the patterns and features of the epigenetic regulation of RPE cell behavior will allow us to obtain RPE cells that are in demand in medicine, from direct reprogramming with the possibility of epigenetically maintaining the cellular identities to the creation of neuro-regenerative technologies for the replacement therapy of RPE-dependent retinal pathologies in humans.

Abstract:
A central component of the epigenome is the pattern of histone post-translational modifications that play a critical role in the formation of specific chromatin states. Following DNA replication, nascent chromatin is a 1:1 mixture of parental and newly synthesized histones and the transfer of modification patterns from parental histones to new histones is a fundamental step in epigenetic inheritance. Here we report that loss of HAT1, which acetylates lysines 5 and 12 of newly synthesized histone H4 during replication-coupled chromatin assembly, results in the loss of accessibility of large domains of heterochromatin, termed HAT1-dependent Accessibility Domains (HADs). HADs are mega base-scale domains that comprise ∼10% of the mouse genome. HAT1 globally represses H3 K9 me3 levels and HADs correspond to the regions of the genome that display HAT1-dependent increases in H3 K9me3 peak density. HADs display a high degree of overlap with a subset of Lamin-Associated Domains (LADs). HAT1 is required to maintain nuclear structure and integrity. These results indicate that HAT1 and the acetylation of newly synthesized histones may be critical regulators of the epigenetic inheritance of heterochromatin and suggest a new mechanism for the epigenetic regulation of nuclear lamina-heterochromatin interactions.

Abstract:
Epigenomics has become a significant research interest at a time when rapid environmental changes are occurring. Epigenetic mechanisms mainly result from systems like DNA methylation, histone modification, and RNA interference. Epigenetic mechanisms are gaining importance in classical genetics, developmental biology, molecular biology, cancer biology, epidemiology, and evolution. Epigenetic mechanisms play important role in the action and interaction of plant genes during development, and also have an impact on classical plant breeding programs, inclusive of novel variation, single plant heritability, hybrid vigor, plant-environment interactions, stress tolerance, and performance stability. The epigenetics and epigenomics may be significant for crop adaptability and pliability to ambient alterations, directing to the creation of stout climate-resilient elegant crop cultivars. In this review, we have summarized recent progress made in understanding the epigenetic mechanisms in plant responses to biotic and abiotic stresses and have also tried to provide the ways for the efficient utilization of epigenomic mechanisms in developing climate-resilient crop cultivars, especially in chickpea, and other legume crops.

Abstract:
Risk variants for schizophrenia affect more than 100 genomic loci, yet cell- and tissue-specific roles underlying disease liability remain poorly characterized. We have generated for two cortical areas implicated in psychosis, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex, 157 reference maps from neuronal, neuronal-depleted and bulk tissue chromatin for two histone marks associated with active promoters and enhancers, H3-trimethyl-lysine 4 (H3K4me3) and H3-acetyl-lysine 27 (H3K27ac). Differences between neuronal and neuronal-depleted chromatin states were the major axis of variation in histone modification profiles followed by substantial variability across subjects and cortical areas. Thousands of significant histone quantitative trait loci (hQTLs) were identified in neuronal and neuronal-depleted samples. Risk variants for schizophrenia, depressive symptoms and neuroticism were significantly overrepresented in neuronal H3K4me3 and H3K27ac landscapes. Our PsychENCODE and CommonMind sponsored resource highlights the critical role of cell-type specific signatures at regulatory and disease-associated non-coding sequences in the human frontal lobe.

Title: Histone Tail Cleavage as a Mechanism for Epigenetic Regulation
Authors: Yonghwan Shin
Date: 2024-10-08

Abstract:
Histones are essential for DNA packaging and undergo post-translational modifications that significantly influence gene regulation. Among these modifications, histone tail cleavage has recently garnered attention despite being less explored. Cleavage by various proteases impacts processes such as stem cell differentiation, aging, infection, and inflammation, though the mechanisms remain unclear. This review delves into recent insights on histone proteolytic cleavage and its epigenetic significance, highlighting how chromatin, which serves as a dynamic scaffold, responds to signals through histone modification, replacement, and ATP-dependent remodeling. Specifically, histone tail cleavage is linked to critical cellular processes such as granulocyte differentiation, viral infection, aging, yeast sporulation, and cancer development. Although the exact mechanisms connecting histone cleavage to gene expression are still emerging, it is clear that this process represents a novel epigenetic transcriptional mechanism intertwined with chromatin dynamics. This review explores known histone tail cleavage events, the proteolytic enzymes involved, their impact on gene expression, and future research directions in this evolving field.

Abstract:
Pervasive usage of alternative promoters leads to the deregulation of gene expression in carcinogenesis and may drive the emergence of new genes in spermatogenesis. However, little is known regarding the mechanisms underpinning the activation of alternative promoters. Here we describe how alternative cancer-testis-specific transcription is activated. We show that intergenic and intronic CTCF binding sites, which are transcriptionally inert in normal somatic cells, could be epigenetically reprogrammed into active de novo promoters in germ and cancer cells. BORIS/CTCFL, the testis-specific paralog of the ubiquitously expressed CTCF, triggers the epigenetic reprogramming of CTCF sites into units of active transcription. BORIS binding initiates the recruitment of the chromatin remodeling factor, SRCAP, followed by the replacement of H2A histone with H2A.Z, resulting in a more relaxed chromatin state in the nucleosomes flanking the CTCF binding sites. The relaxation of chromatin around CTCF binding sites facilitates the recruitment of multiple additional transcription factors, thereby activating transcription from a given binding site. We demonstrate that the epigenetically reprogrammed CTCF binding sites can drive the expression of cancer-testis genes, long noncoding RNAs, retro-pseudogenes, and dormant transposable elements. Thus, BORIS functions as a transcription factor that epigenetically reprograms clustered CTCF binding sites into transcriptional start sites, promoting transcription from alternative promoters in both germ cells and cancer cells.

Title: Roles of Histone H2A Variants in Cancer Development, Prognosis, and Treatment
Authors: Po Man Lai, Kui Ming Chan
Date: 2024-03-09

Abstract:
Histones are nuclear proteins essential for packaging genomic DNA and epigenetic gene regulation. Paralogs that can substitute core histones (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4), named histone variants, are constitutively expressed in a replication-independent manner throughout the cell cycle. With specific chaperones, they can be incorporated to chromatin to modify nucleosome stability by modulating interactions with nucleosomal DNA. This allows the regulation of essential fundamental cellular processes for instance, DNA damage repair, chromosomal segregation, and transcriptional regulation. Among all the histone families, histone H2A family has the largest number of histone variants reported to date. Each H2A variant has multiple functions apart from their primary role and some, even be further specialized to perform additional tasks in distinct lineages, such as testis specific shortH2A (sH2A). In the past decades, the discoveries of genetic alterations and mutations in genes encoding H2A variants in cancer had revealed variants’ potentiality in driving carcinogenesis. In addition, there is growing evidence that H2A variants may act as novel prognostic indicators or biomarkers for both early cancer detection and therapeutic treatments. Nevertheless, no studies have ever concluded all identified variants in a single report. Here, in this review, we summarize the respective functions for all the 19 mammalian H2A variants and their roles in cancer biology whilst potentiality being used in clinical setting.

Abstract:
The limited regenerative capacity of the human heart contributes to high morbidity and mortality worldwide. In contrast, zebrafish exhibit robust regenerative capacity, providing a powerful model for studying how to overcome intrinsic epigenetic barriers maintaining cardiac homeostasis and initiate regeneration. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of the histone modifications H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K27me3 and H3K27ac during various stages of zebrafish heart regeneration. We found a vast gain of repressive chromatin marks one day after myocardial injury, followed by the acquisition of active chromatin characteristics on day four and a transition to a repressive state on day 14, and identified distinct transcription factor ensembles associated with these events. The rapid transcriptional response involves the engagement of super-enhancers at genes implicated in extracellular matrix reorganization and TOR signaling, while H3K4me3 breadth highly correlates with transcriptional activity and dynamic changes at genes involved in proteolysis, cell cycle activity, and cell differentiation. Using loss- and gain-of-function approaches, we identified transcription factors in cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells influencing cardiomyocyte dedifferentiation or proliferation. Finally, we detected significant evolutionary conservation between regulatory regions that drive zebrafish and neonatal mouse heart regeneration, suggesting that reactivating transcriptional and epigenetic networks converging on these regulatory elements might unlock the regenerative potential of adult human hearts.

Title: Histone methyltransferase activity affects metabolism in human cells independently of transcriptional regulation
Authors: Marcos Francisco Perez, Peter Sarkies, Ines Alvarez-Garcia, Ines Alvarez-Garcia, Ines Alvarez-Garcia, Ines Alvarez-Garcia
Date: 2023-10-26

Abstract:
The N-terminal tails of eukaryotic histones are frequently posttranslationally modified. The role of these modifications in transcriptional regulation is well-documented. However, the extent to which the enzymatic processes of histone posttranslational modification might affect metabolic regulation is less clear. Here, we investigated how histone methylation might affect metabolism using metabolomics, proteomics, and RNA-seq data from cancer cell lines, primary tumour samples and healthy tissue samples. In cancer, the expression of histone methyltransferases (HMTs) was inversely correlated to the activity of NNMT, an enzyme previously characterised as a methyl sink that disposes of excess methyl groups carried by the universal methyl donor S-adenosyl methionine (SAM or AdoMet). In healthy tissues, histone methylation was inversely correlated to the levels of an alternative methyl sink, PEMT. These associations affected the levels of multiple histone marks on chromatin genome-wide but had no detectable impact on transcriptional regulation. We show that HMTs with a variety of different associations to transcription are co-regulated by the Retinoblastoma (Rb) tumour suppressor in human cells. Rb-mutant cancers show increased total HMT activity and down-regulation of NNMT . Together, our results suggest that the total activity of HMTs affects SAM metabolism, independent of transcriptional regulation.

Title: Prediction of gene expression using histone modification patterns extracted by Particle Swarm Optimization
Authors: Niels Benjamin Paul, Jonas Chanrithy Wolber, Malte Lennart Sahrhage, Tim Beißbarth, Martin Haubrock
Date: 2025-02

Abstract:
Histone modifications play an important role in transcription regulation. Although the general importance of some histone modifications for transcription regulation has been previously established, the relevance of others and their interaction is subject to ongoing research. By training Machine Learning models to predict a gene’s expression and explaining their decision making process, we can get hints on how histone modifications affect transcription. In previous studies, trained models were either hardly explainable or the models were trained solely on the abundance of histone modifications. Based on other studies, which used histone modification patterns, rather than their abundance, to identify potential regulatory elements, we hypothesize the histone modification pattern in a gene’s promoter to be more predictive for gene expression. We used an optimization algorithm to extract predictive histone modification profiles. Our algorithm called PatternChrome achieved an average area under curve (AUC) score of 0.9029 over 56 samples for binary classification, outperforming all previous algorithms for the same task. We explained the models decisions to deduce the effect of specific features, certain histone modifications or promoter positions on transcription regulation. Although the predictive histone modification patterns were extracted for each sample separately, they can be used to predict gene expression in other samples, implying that the created patterns are largely generalizable. Interestingly, the impact of histone modifications on gene regulation appears predominantly indifferent to cellular specificity. Through explanation of the classifier’s decisions, we substantiate established literature knowledge while concurrently revealing novel insights into the intricate landscape of transcriptional regulation via histone modification. The code for the PatternChrome algorithm, the scripts for the analyses and the required data can be found at ( https://gitlab.gwdg.de/MedBioinf/generegulation/patternchrome ).

Title: ICGEC: a comparative method for measuring epigenetic conservation of genes via the integrated signal from multiple histone modifications between cell types
Authors: Jing Tang, Zefeng Wu, Yuhan Tian, Ruolin Yang
Date: 2020-05-12

Abstract:
Histone post-translational modifications play crucial roles in epigenetic regulation of gene expression and are known to be associated with the phenotypic differences of different cell types. Therefore, it is of fundamental importance to dissect the genes and pathways involved in such a phenotypic variation at the level of epigenetics. However, the existing comparative approaches are largely based on the differences, especially the absolute difference in the levels of individual histone modifications of genes under contrasting conditions. Thus, a method for measuring the overall change in the epigenetic circumstance of each gene underpinned by multiple types of histone modifications between cell types is lacking. To address this challenge, we developed ICGEC, a new method for estimating the degree of epigenetic conservation of genes between two cell lines. Different from existing comparative methods, ICGEC provides a reliable score for measuring the relative change in the epigenetic context of corresponding gene between two conditions and simultaneously produces a score for each histone mark. The application of ICGEC to the human embryonic stem cell line H1 and four H1-derived cell lines with available epigenomic data for the same 16 types of histone modifications indicated high robustness and reliability of ICGEC. Furthermore, the analysis of the epigenetically dynamic and conserved genes which were defined based on the ICGEC output results demonstrated that ICGEC can deepen our understanding of the biological processes of cell differentiation to overcome the limitations of traditional expression analysis. Specifically, the ICGEC-derived differentiation-direction-specific genes were shown to have putative functions that are well-matched with cell identity. Additionally, H3K79me1 and H3K27ac were found to be the main histone marks accounting for whether an epigenetically dynamic gene was differentially expressed between two cell lines. The use of ICGEC creates a convenient and robust way to measure the overall epigenetic conservation of individual genes and marks between two conditions. Thus, it provides a basis for exploring the epigenotype-phenotype relationship. ICGEC can be deemed a state-of-the-art method tailored for comparative epigenomic analysis of changes in cell dynamics.

Abstract:
The dynamic addition and removal of posttranslational modifications on eukaryotic histones define regulatory regions that play a central role in genome and chromatin biology. However, our understanding of these regulatory mechanisms in animals is primarily based on a few model systems, preventing a general understanding of how histone-based regulation directs and promotes phenotypic variation during animal embryogenesis. Here, we apply a comprehensive multi-omics approach to dissect the histone-based regulatory complement in Annelida, one of the largest invertebrate clades. Annelids exhibit a conserved histone repertoire organized in clusters of dynamically regulated, hyperaccessible chromatin. However, unlike other animals with reduced genomes, the worm Dimorphilus gyrociliatus shows a dramatically streamlined histone repertoire, revealing that genome compaction has lineage-specific effects on histone-based regulation. Notably, the annelid Owenia fusiformis has two H2A.X variants that co-occur in other animals, sometimes associate with fast cell divisions, and represent a unique case of widespread parallel evolution of a histone variant in Eukarya. Histone-modifying enzyme complements are largely conserved among annelids. Yet, temporal differences in the expression of a reduced set of histone modifiers correlate with distinct ontogenetic traits and variation in the adult landscapes of histone posttranslational modifications, as revealed by quantitative mass spectrometry in O. fusiformis and Capitella teleta . Our analysis of histone-based epigenetics within a non-model phylum informs the evolution of histone-based regulation, presenting a framework to explore how this fundamental genome regulatory layer generally contributes to developmental and morphological diversification in annelids and animals.

Authors: Danilo Shevkoplyas, Yen My Vuu, James R. Davie, Mojgan Rastegar
Date: 2022-12-09

Abstract:
Methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) is an epigenetic reader that binds to methylated CpG dinucleotides and regulates gene transcription. Mecp2 / MECP2 gene has 4 exons, encoding for protein isoforms MeCP2E1 and MeCP2E2. MeCP2 plays key roles in neurodevelopment, therefore, its gain- and loss-of-function mutations lead to neurodevelopmental disorders including Rett Syndrome. Here, we describe the structure, functional domains, and evidence support for potential additional alternatively spliced MECP2 transcripts and protein isoforms. We conclude that NCBI MeCP2 isoforms 3 and 4 contain certain MeCP2 functional domains. Our in silico analysis led to identification of histone modification and accessibility profiles at the MECP2 gene and its cis -regulatory elements. We conclude that the human MECP2 gene associated histone post-translational modifications exhibit high similarity between males and females. Between brain regions, histone modifications were found to be less conserved and enriched within larger genomic segments named as “S1–S11”. We also identified highly conserved DNA accessibility regions in different tissues and brain regions, named as “A1–A9” and “B1–B9”. DNA methylation profile was similar between mid-frontal gyrus of donors 35 days–25 years of age. Based on ATAC-seq data, the identified hypomethylated regions “H1–H8” intersected with most regions of the accessible chromatin (A regions).

Abstract:
All the cells of an organism contain the same genome. However, each cell expresses only a minor fraction of its potential and, in particular, the genes encoding the proteins necessary for basal metabolism and the proteins responsible for its specific phenotype. The ability to use only the right and necessary genes involved in specific functions depends on the structural organization of the nuclear chromatin, which in turn depends on the epigenetic history of each cell, which is stored in the form of a collection of DNA and protein modifications. Among these modifications, DNA methylation and many kinds of post-translational modifications of histones play a key role in organizing the complex indexing of usable genes. In addition, non-canonical histone proteins (also known as histone variants), the synthesis of which is not directly linked with DNA replication, are used to mark specific regions of the genome. Here, we will discuss the role of the H3.3 histone variant, with particular attention to its loading into chromatin in the mammalian nervous system, both in physiological and pathological conditions. Indeed, chromatin modifications that mark cell memory seem to be of special importance for the cells involved in the complex processes of learning and memory.

Title: Epigenetic factor competition reshapes the EMT landscape
Authors: M. Ali Al-Radhawi, Shubham Tripathi, Yun Zhang, Eduardo D. Sontag, Herbert Levine
Date: 2022-10-10

Abstract:
Epigenetics refers to the role of structural modifications in the genome that encode the context governing gene-expression dynamics. Although there have been attempts at creating mathematical models of these structural changes, how these changes couple to the transcriptional circuitry has remained unclear. Here, we study the role of histone modifications—namely, the adding or removing of methyl groups from histone H3 tails—in interacting with regulatory factors governing the transitions between epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes. Our results show the critical importance of taking into account off-target global effects due to the competition between different DNA segments for the same histone-modifying enzymes.

Title: The molecular principles of gene regulation by Polycomb repressive complexes
Authors: Neil P. Blackledge, Robert J. Klose
Date: 2021-12-01

Abstract:
Precise control of gene expression is fundamental to cell function and development. Although ultimately gene expression relies on DNA-binding transcription factors to guide the activity of the transcription machinery to genes, it has also become clear that chromatin and histone post-translational modification have fundamental roles in gene regulation. Polycomb repressive complexes represent a paradigm of chromatin-based gene regulation in animals. The Polycomb repressive system comprises two central protein complexes, Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) and PRC2, which are essential for normal gene regulation and development. Our early understanding of Polycomb function relied on studies in simple model organisms, but more recently it has become apparent that this system has expanded and diverged in mammals. Detailed studies are now uncovering the molecular mechanisms that enable mammalian PRC1 and PRC2 to identify their target sites in the genome, communicate through feedback mechanisms to create Polycomb chromatin domains, and control transcription to regulate gene expression. In this Review, we discuss and contextualise the emerging principles that define how this fascinating chromatin-based system regulates gene expression in mammals.

Abstract:
Modified parental histones are segregated symmetrically to daughter DNA strands during replication and can be inherited through mitosis. How this may sustain the epigenome and cell identity remains unknown. Here we show that transmission of histone-based information during DNA replication maintains epigenome fidelity and embryonic stem cell plasticity. Asymmetric segregation of parental histones H3–H4 in MCM2-2A mutants compromised mitotic inheritance of histone modifications and globally altered the epigenome. This included widespread spurious deposition of repressive modifications, suggesting elevated epigenetic noise. Moreover, H3K9me3 loss at repeats caused derepression and H3K27me3 redistribution across bivalent promoters correlated with misexpression of developmental genes. MCM2-2A mutation challenged dynamic transitions in cellular states across the cell cycle, enhancing naïve pluripotency and reducing lineage priming in G1. Furthermore, developmental competence was diminished, correlating with impaired exit from pluripotency. Collectively, this argues that epigenetic inheritance of histone modifications maintains a correctly balanced and dynamic chromatin landscape able to support mammalian cell differentiation.

Title: Hypoxia-Driven Histone Modifications Govern Gene Regulation for Mature Eye Lens Formation
Authors: Lisa Brennan, Joshua Disatham, Marc Kantorow
Date: 2025-10-01

Abstract:
Evidence suggests that the hypoxic environment of the lens regulates the expression of genes required for lens formation and function. Here, we tested the hypothesis that hypoxia regulates these genes through the induction of specific histone modifications. Global levels of hypoxia-induced histone modifications were determined in cultured day 13 chick lenses exposed to 1% oxygen. The genome-wide localizations of H3K27ac and H3K4me3 were identified by cleavage under target and release using nuclease analysis and mapped to within 5 kb of the transcriptional start sites of genes activated or repressed by hypoxia identified by RNA sequencing. The requirement for these histone modifications for hypoxia-induced gene expression was determined using inhibitors of histone writers and erasers. The levels of activating modifications H3K4me3, H3K9ac, H3K14ac, and H3K27ac in hypoxia-treated lenses increased, whereas levels of repressive modifications H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 remained unchanged. Hypoxia-specific H3K4me3 and/or H3K27ac regions were detected within 5 kb of the transcriptional start sites of more than 900 fiber cell genes with increased expression upon hypoxia exposure and 350 genes with decreased expression. The inhibition of histone writers and erasers resulted in altered levels of key fiber cell genes upon hypoxia exposure. These results provide evidence that hypoxia-induced histone modifications regulate the genes required for mature lens formation and provide a framework for understanding the role of hypoxia-specific histone modifications in the regulation of genes in more complex tissues.

Title: Histone ChIP‐Seq identifies differential enhancer usage during chondrogenesis as critical for defining cell‐type specificity
Authors: Kathleen Cheung, Matthew J. Barter, Julia Falk, Carole J. Proctor, Louise N. Reynard, David A. Young
Date: 2020-02-14

Abstract:
Epigenetic mechanisms are known to regulate gene expression during chondrogenesis. In this study, we have characterized the epigenome during the in vitro differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) into chondrocytes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by next‐generation sequencing (ChIP‐seq) was used to assess a range of N‐terminal posttranscriptional modifications (marks) to histone H3 lysines (H3K4me3, H3K4me1, H3K27ac, H3K27me3, and H3K36me3) in both hMSCs and differentiated chondrocytes. Chromatin states were characterized using histone ChIP‐seq and cis ‐regulatory elements were identified in chondrocytes. Chondrocyte enhancers were associated with chondrogenesis‐related gene ontology (GO) terms. In silico analysis and integration of DNA methylation data with chondrogenesis chromatin states revealed that enhancers marked by histone marks H3K4me1 and H3K27ac were de‐methylated during in vitro chondrogenesis. Similarity analysis between hMSC and chondrocyte chromatin states defined in this study with epigenomes of cell‐types defined by the Roadmap Epigenomics project revealed that enhancers are more distinct between cell‐types compared to other chromatin states. Motif analysis revealed that the transcription factor SOX9 is enriched in chondrocyte enhancers. Luciferase reporter assays confirmed that chondrocyte enhancers characterized in this study exhibited enhancer activity which may be modulated by DNA methylation and SOX9 overexpression. Altogether, these integrated data illustrate the cross‐talk between different epigenetic mechanisms during chondrocyte differentiation.

Abstract:
Substantial epigenetic resetting during early embryo development from fertilization to blastocyst formation ensures zygotic genome activation and leads to progressive cellular heterogeneities 1 – 3 . Mapping single-cell epigenomic profiles of core histone modifications that cover each individual cell is a fundamental goal in developmental biology. Here we develop target chromatin indexing and tagmentation (TACIT), a method that enabled genome-coverage single-cell profiling of seven histone modifications across mouse early embryos. We integrated these single-cell histone modifications with single-cell RNA sequencing data to chart a single-cell resolution epigenetic landscape. Multimodal chromatin-state annotations showed that the onset of zygotic genome activation at the early two-cell stage already primes heterogeneities in totipotency. We used machine learning to identify totipotency gene regulatory networks, including stage-specific transposable elements and putative transcription factors. CRISPR activation of a combination of these identified transcription factors induced totipotency activation in mouse embryonic stem cells. Together with single-cell co-profiles of multiple histone modifications, we developed a model that predicts the earliest cell branching towards the inner cell mass and the trophectoderm in latent multimodal space and identifies regulatory elements and previously unknown lineage-specifying transcription factors. Our work provides insights into single-cell epigenetic reprogramming, multimodal regulation of cellular lineages and cell-fate priming during mouse pre-implantation development.

Abstract:
Histones and associated chromatin proteins have essential functions in eukaryotic genome organization and regulation. Despite this fundamental role in eukaryotic cell biology, we lack a phylogenetically-comprehensive understanding of chromatin evolution. Here, we combine comparative proteomics and genomics analysis of chromatin in eukaryotes and archaea. Proteomics uncovers the existence of histone post-translational modifications in Archaea. However, archaeal histone modifications are scarce, in contrast with the highly conserved and abundant marks we identify across eukaryotes. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that chromatin-associated catalytic functions (e.g., methyltransferases) have pre-eukaryotic origins, whereas histone mark readers and chaperones are eukaryotic innovations. We show that further chromatin evolution is characterized by expansion of readers, including capture by transposable elements and viruses. Overall, our study infers detailed evolutionary history of eukaryotic chromatin: from its archaeal roots, through the emergence of nucleosome-based regulation in the eukaryotic ancestor, to the diversification of chromatin regulators and their hijacking by genomic parasites.

Abstract:
Eviction of histones from nucleosomes and their exchange with newly synthesized or alternative variants is a central epigenetic determinant. Here, we define the genome-wide occupancy and exchange pattern of canonical and non-canonical histone variants in mouse embryonic stem cells by genetically encoded exchange sensors. While exchange of all measured variants scales with transcription, we describe variant-specific associations with transcription elongation and Polycomb binding. We found considerable exchange of H3.1 and H2B variants in heterochromatin and repeat elements, contrasting the occupancy and little exchange of H3.3 in these regions. This unexpected association between H3.3 occupancy and exchange of canonical variants is also evident in active promoters and enhancers, and further validated by reduced H3.1 dynamics following depletion of H3.3-specific chaperone, HIRA. Finally, analyzing transgenic mice harboring H3.1 or H3.3 sensors demonstrates the vast potential of this system for studying histone exchange and its impact on gene expression regulation in vivo.

Abstract:
Transcriptional dynamic in response to environmental and developmental cues are fundamental to biology, yet many mechanistic aspects are poorly understood. One such example is fungal plant pathogens, which use secreted proteins and small molecules, termed effectors, to suppress host immunity and promote colonization. Effectors are highly expressed in planta but remain transcriptionally repressed ex planta , but our mechanistic understanding of these transcriptional dynamics remains limited. We tested the hypothesis that repressive histone modification at H3-Lys27 underlies transcriptional silencing ex planta , and that exchange for an active chemical modification contributes to transcription of in planta induced genes. Using genetics, chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing and RNA-sequencing, we determined that H3K27me3 provides significant local transcriptional repression. We detail how regions that lose H3K27me3 gain H3K27ac, and these changes are associated with increased transcription. Importantly, we observed that many in planta induced genes were marked by H3K27me3 during axenic growth, and detail how altered H3K27 modification influences transcription. ChIP-qPCR during in planta growth suggests that H3K27 modifications are generally stable, but can undergo dynamics at specific genomic locations. Our results support the hypothesis that dynamic histone modifications at H3K27 contributes to fungal genome regulation and specifically contributes to regulation of genes important during host infection.

Title: Histone deacetylase 1 maintains lineage integrity through histone acetylome refinement during early embryogenesis
Authors: Jeff Jiajing Zhou, Jin Sun Cho, Han Han, Ira L Blitz, Wenqi Wang, Ken WY Cho, Matthew C Good
Date: 2023-03-27

Abstract:
Histone acetylation is a pivotal epigenetic modification that controls chromatin structure and regulates gene expression. It plays an essential role in modulating zygotic transcription and cell lineage specification of developing embryos. While the outcomes of many inductive signals have been described to require enzymatic activities of histone acetyltransferases and deacetylases (HDACs), the mechanisms by which HDACs confine the utilization of the zygotic genome remain to be elucidated. Here, we show that histone deacetylase 1 (Hdac1) progressively binds to the zygotic genome from mid-blastula and onward. The recruitment of Hdac1 to the genome at blastula is instructed maternally. Cis -regulatory modules (CRMs) bound by Hdac1 possess epigenetic signatures underlying distinct functions. We highlight a dual function model of Hdac1 where Hdac1 not only represses gene expression by sustaining a histone hypoacetylation state on inactive chromatin, but also maintains gene expression through participating in dynamic histone acetylation–deacetylation cycles on active chromatin. As a result, Hdac1 maintains differential histone acetylation states of bound CRMs between different germ layers and reinforces the transcriptional program underlying cell lineage identities, both in time and space. Taken together, our study reveals a comprehensive role for Hdac1 during early vertebrate embryogenesis.

Abstract:
Deciphering the impact of genetic variation on gene regulation is fundamental to understanding common, complex human diseases. Although histone modifications are important markers of gene regulatory elements of the genome, any specific histone modification has not been assayed in more than a few individuals in the human liver. As a result, the effects of genetic variation on histone modification states in the liver are poorly understood. Here, we generate the most comprehensive genome-wide dataset of two epigenetic marks, H3K4me3 and H3K27ac, and annotate thousands of putative regulatory elements in the human liver. We integrate these findings with genome-wide gene expression data collected from the same human liver tissues and high-resolution promoter-focused chromatin interaction maps collected from human liver-derived HepG2 cells. We demonstrate widespread functional consequences of natural genetic variation on putative regulatory element activity and gene expression levels. Leveraging these extensive datasets, we fine-map a total of 74 GWAS loci that have been associated with at least one complex phenotype. Our results reveal a repertoire of genes and regulatory mechanisms governing complex disease development and further the basic understanding of genetic and epigenetic regulation of gene expression in the human liver tissue.

Abstract:
Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are evolutionary conserved enzymes which operate by removing acetyl groups from histones and other protein regulatory factors, with functional consequences on chromatin remodeling and gene expression profiles. We provide here a review on the recent knowledge accrued on the zinc-dependent HDAC protein family across different species, tissues, and human pathologies, specifically focusing on the role of HDAC inhibitors as anti-cancer agents. We will investigate the chemical specificity of different HDACs and discuss their role in the human interactome as members of chromatin-binding and regulatory complexes.

Date: 2023-06-25

Abstract:
The functional annotation of genomes, including chromatin modifications, is essential to understand the intricate architecture of chromatin and the consequential gene regulation. However, such an annotation remains limited for cotton genomes. Here, we conducted chromatin profiling in a wild allotetraploid cotton Gossypium darwinii (AD genome) by integrating the data of histone modification, transcriptome, and chromatin accessibility. We revealed that the A subgenome showed a higher level of active histone marks and lower level of repressive histone marks than the D subgenome, which was consistent with the expression bias between the two subgenomes. We show that the bias in transcription and histone modification between the A and D subgenomes may be caused by genes unique to the subgenome but not by homoeologous genes. Moreover, we integrate histone marks and open chromatin to define six chromatin states (S1–S6) across the cotton genome, which index different genomic elements including genes, promoters, and transposons, implying distinct biological functions. In comparison to the domesticated cotton species, we observed that 23.2% of genes in the genome exhibit a transition from one chromatin state to another at their promoter. Strikingly, the S2 (devoid of epigenetic marks) to S3 (enriched for the mark of open chromatin) was the largest transition group. These transitions occurred simultaneously with changes in gene expression, which were significantly associated with several domesticated traits in cotton. Collectively, our study provides a useful epigenetic resource for research on allopolyploid plants. The domestication–induced chromatin dynamics and associated genes identified here will aid epigenetic engineering, improving polyploid crops.

Title: The molecular basis of cell memory in mammals: The epigenetic cycle
Authors: Mencía Espinosa-Martínez, María Alcázar-Fabra, David Landeira
Date: 2024-03-01

Abstract:
Cell memory refers to the capacity of cells to maintain their gene expression program once the initiating environmental signal has ceased. This exceptional feature is key during the formation of mammalian organisms, and it is believed to be in part mediated by epigenetic factors that can endorse cells with the landmarks required to maintain transcriptional programs upon cell duplication. Here, we review current literature analyzing the molecular basis of epigenetic memory in mammals, with a focus on the mechanisms by which transcriptionally repressive chromatin modifications such as methylation of DNA and histone H3 are propagated through mitotic cell divisions. The emerging picture suggests that cellular memory is supported by an epigenetic cycle in which reversible activities carried out by epigenetic regulators in coordination with cell cycle transition create a multiphasic system that can accommodate both maintenance of cell identity and cell differentiation in proliferating stem cell populations.

Abstract:
Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a microvascular complication arising as a secondary effect of diabetes, with both genetic and environmental factors playing a significant role in its onset and progression. Epigenetics serves as the crucial link between these genetic and environmental influences. Among the various epigenetic mechanisms, histone modification stands out as a key regulatory process associated with the development of many diseases. Histone modifications primarily regulate cellular function by influencing gene expression. Modulating histone modifications, particularly through the regulation of enzymes involved in these processes, holds a promising therapeutic approach for managing diseases like DR. In this review, we explore the regulatory mechanisms of histone modification and its contribution to the pathogenesis of DR.

Title: Understanding the interplay between CpG island-associated gene promoters and H3K4 methylation ☆
Authors: Amy L. Hughes, Jessica R. Kelley, Robert J. Klose
Date: 2020-08

Abstract:
The precise regulation of gene transcription is required to establish and maintain cell type-specific gene expression programs during multicellular development. In addition to transcription factors, chromatin, and its chemical modification, play a central role in regulating gene expression. In vertebrates, DNA is pervasively methylated at CG dinucleotides, a modification that is repressive to transcription. However, approximately 70% of vertebrate gene promoters are associated with DNA elements called CpG islands (CGIs) that are refractory to DNA methylation. CGIs integrate the activity of a range of chromatin-regulating factors that can post-translationally modify histones and modulate gene expression. This is exemplified by the trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me3), which is enriched at CGI-associated gene promoters and correlates with transcriptional activity. Through studying H3K4me3 at CGIs it has become clear that CGIs shape the distribution of H3K4me3 and, in turn, H3K4me3 influences the chromatin landscape at CGIs. Here we will discuss our understanding of the emerging relationship between CGIs, H3K4me3, and gene expression.

Title: Roles of Histone H2B, H3 and H4 Variants in Cancer Development and Prognosis
Authors: Po Man Lai, Xiaoxiang Gong, Kui Ming Chan
Date: 2024-09-07

Abstract:
Histone variants are the paralogs of core histones (H2A, H2B, H3 and H4). They are stably expressed throughout the cell cycle in a replication-independent fashion and are capable of replacing canonical counterparts under different fundamental biological processes. Variants have been shown to take part in multiple processes, including DNA damage repair, transcriptional regulation and X chromosome inactivation, with some of them even specializing in lineage-specific roles like spermatogenesis. Several reports have recently identified some unprecedented variants from different histone families and exploited their prognostic value in distinct types of cancer. Among the four classes of canonical histones, the H2A family has the greatest number of variants known to date, followed by H2B, H3 and H4. In our prior review, we focused on summarizing all 19 mammalian histone H2A variants. Here in this review, we aim to complete the full summary of the roles of mammalian histone variants from the remaining histone H2B, H3, and H4 families, along with an overview of their roles in cancer biology and their prognostic value in a clinical context.

Title: ReFeaFi: Genome-wide prediction of regulatory elements driving transcription initiation
Authors: Ramzan Umarov, Yu Li, Takahiro Arakawa, Satoshi Takizawa, Xin Gao, Erik Arner
Date: 2021-09-07

Abstract:
Regulatory elements control gene expression through transcription initiation (promoters) and by enhancing transcription at distant regions (enhancers). Accurate identification of regulatory elements is fundamental for annotating genomes and understanding gene expression patterns. While there are many attempts to develop computational promoter and enhancer identification methods, reliable tools to analyze long genomic sequences are still lacking. Prediction methods often perform poorly on the genome-wide scale because the number of negatives is much higher than that in the training sets. To address this issue, we propose a dynamic negative set updating scheme with a two-model approach, using one model for scanning the genome and the other one for testing candidate positions. The developed method achieves good genome-level performance and maintains robust performance when applied to other vertebrate species, without re-training. Moreover, the unannotated predicted regulatory regions made on the human genome are enriched for disease-associated variants, suggesting them to be potentially true regulatory elements rather than false positives. We validated high scoring “false positive” predictions using reporter assay and all tested candidates were successfully validated, demonstrating the ability of our method to discover novel human regulatory regions.

Date: 2019-08-22

Abstract:
Despite large experimental and computational efforts aiming to dissect the mechanisms underlying disease risk, mapping cis-regulatory elements to target genes remains a challenge. Here, we introduce a matrix factorization framework to integrate physical and functional interaction data of genomic segments. The framework was used to predict a regulatory network of chromatin interaction edges linking more than 20 000 promoters and 1.8 million enhancers across 127 human reference epigenomes, including edges that are present in any of the input datasets. Our network integrates functional evidence of correlated activity patterns from epigenomic data and physical evidence of chromatin interactions. An important contribution of this work is the representation of heterogeneous data with different qualities as networks. We show that the unbiased integration of independent data sources suggestive of regulatory interactions produces meaningful associations supported by existing functional and physical evidence, correlating with expected independent biological features.

Authors: Mary Lauren Benton, Sai Charan Talipineni, Dennis Kostka, John A. Capra
Date: 2019-06-20

Abstract:
Non-coding gene regulatory enhancers are essential to transcription in mammalian cells. As a result, a large variety of experimental and computational strategies have been developed to identify cis -regulatory enhancer sequences. Given the differences in the biological signals assayed, some variation in the enhancers identified by different methods is expected; however, the concordance of enhancers identified by different methods has not been comprehensively evaluated. This is critically needed, since in practice, most studies consider enhancers identified by only a single method. Here, we compare enhancer sets from eleven representative strategies in four biological contexts. All sets we evaluated overlap significantly more than expected by chance; however, there is significant dissimilarity in their genomic, evolutionary, and functional characteristics, both at the element and base-pair level, within each context. The disagreement is sufficient to influence interpretation of candidate SNPs from GWAS studies, and to lead to disparate conclusions about enhancer and disease mechanisms. Most regions identified as enhancers are supported by only one method, and we find limited evidence that regions identified by multiple methods are better candidates than those identified by a single method. As a result, we cannot recommend the use of any single enhancer identification strategy in all settings. Our results highlight the inherent complexity of enhancer biology and identify an important challenge to mapping the genetic architecture of complex disease. Greater appreciation of how the diverse enhancer identification strategies in use today relate to the dynamic activity of gene regulatory regions is needed to enable robust and reproducible results.

The largest sequence-based models of transcription control to date are obtained by predicting genome-wide gene regulatory assays across the human genome. This setting is fundamentally correlative, as those models are exposed during training solely to the sequence variation between human genes that arose through evolution, questioning the extent to which those models capture genuine causal signals. Here we confront predictions of state-of-the-art models of transcription regulation against data from two large-scale observational studies and five deep perturbation assays. The most advanced of these sequence-based models, Enformer, by and large, captures causal determinants of human promoters. However, models fail to capture the causal effects of enhancers on expression, notably in medium to long distances and particularly for highly expressed promoters. More generally, the predicted impact of distal elements on gene expression predictions is small and the ability to correctly integrate long-range information is significantly more limited than the receptive fields of the models suggest. This is likely caused by the escalating class imbalance between actual and candidate regulatory elements as distance increases. Our results suggest that sequence-based models have advanced to the point that in silico study of promoter regions and promoter variants can provide meaningful insights and we provide practical guidance on how to use them. Moreover, we foresee that it will require significantly more and particularly new kinds of data to train models accurately accounting for distal elements.

Authors: Ji Wang, Han Zhang, Nanzhu Chen, Tong Zeng, Xiaohua Ai, Keliang Wu
Date: 2023-09-15

Abstract:
This study develops a deep learning framework called PorcineAI-enhancer to predict enhancer sequences in pigs. Enhancers play a key role in regulating gene expression. However, identifying enhancers experimentally remains challenging. This study constructs a reliable pig enhancer dataset by integrating multiple data sources. The PorcineAI-enhancer model employs convolutional neural networks to extract features from DNA sequences and classify them into enhancers or non-enhancers. Evaluation on an independent test set shows the model has excellent performance. It also demonstrates strong predictive capability on tissue-specific enhancers from human and pig. This tool facilitates research on gene regulation mechanisms in pigs. It provides valuable resources to understand complex traits related to agriculture and biomedicine. Understanding the mechanisms of gene expression regulation is crucial in animal breeding. Cis-regulatory DNA sequences, such as enhancers, play a key role in regulating gene expression. Identifying enhancers is challenging, despite the use of experimental techniques and computational methods. Enhancer prediction in the pig genome is particularly significant due to the costliness of high-throughput experimental techniques. The study constructed a high-quality database of pig enhancers by integrating information from multiple sources. A deep learning prediction framework called PorcineAI-enhancer was developed for the prediction of pig enhancers. This framework employs convolutional neural networks for feature extraction and classification. PorcineAI-enhancer showed excellent performance in predicting pig enhancers, validated on an independent test dataset. The model demonstrated reliable prediction capability for unknown enhancer sequences and performed remarkably well on tissue-specific enhancer sequences.The study developed a deep learning prediction framework, PorcineAI-enhancer, for predicting pig enhancers. The model demonstrated significant predictive performance and potential for tissue-specific enhancers. This research provides valuable resources for future studies on gene expression regulation in pigs.

Abstract:
The aim of the HERITAGE Family Study was to investigate individual differences in response to a standardized endurance exercise program, the role of familial aggregation, and the genetics of response levels of cardiorespiratory fitness and cardiovascular disease and diabetes risk factors. Here we summarize the findings and their potential implications for cardiometabolic health and cardiorespiratory fitness. It begins with overviews of background and planning, recruitment, testing and exercise program protocol, quality control measures, and other relevant organizational issues. A summary of findings is then provided on cardiorespiratory fitness, exercise hemodynamics, insulin and glucose metabolism, lipid and lipoprotein profiles, adiposity and abdominal visceral fat, blood levels of steroids and other hormones, markers of oxidative stress, skeletal muscle morphology and metabolic indicators, and resting metabolic rate. These summaries document the extent of the individual differences in response to a standardized and fully monitored endurance exercise program and document the importance of familial aggregation and heritability level for exercise response traits. Findings from genomic markers, muscle gene expression studies, and proteomic and metabolomics explorations are reviewed, along with lessons learned from a bioinformatics-driven analysis pipeline. The new opportunities being pursued in integrative -omics and physiology have extended considerably the expected life of HERITAGE and are being discussed in relation to the original conceptual model of the study.

Abstract:
Gene enhancers often form long-range contacts with promoters, but it remains unclear if the activity of enhancers and their chromosomal contacts are mediated by the same DNA sequences and recruited factors. Here, we study the effects of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) on enhancer activity and promoter contacts in primary monocytes isolated from 34 male individuals. Using eQTL-Capture Hi-C and a Bayesian approach considering both intra- and inter-individual variation, we initially detect 19 eQTLs associated with enhancer-eGene promoter contacts, most of which also associate with enhancer accessibility and activity. Capitalising on these shared effects, we devise a multi-modality Bayesian strategy, identifying 629 “trimodal QTLs” jointly associated with enhancer accessibility, eGene promoter contact, and gene expression. Causal mediation analysis and CRISPR interference reveal causal relationships between these three modalities. Many detected QTLs overlap disease susceptibility loci and influence the predicted binding of myeloid transcription factors, including SPI1, GABPB and STAT3. Additionally, a variant associated with PCK2 promoter contact directly disrupts a CTCF binding motif and impacts promoter insulation from downstream enhancers. Jointly, our findings suggest an inherent genetic coupling of enhancer activity and connectivity in gene expression control relevant to human disease and highlight the regulatory role of genetically determined chromatin boundaries.

Title: Enhancer-MDLF: a novel deep learning framework for identifying cell-specific enhancers
Authors: Yao Zhang, Pengyu Zhang, Hao Wu
Date: 2024-03

Abstract:
Enhancers, noncoding DNA fragments, play a pivotal role in gene regulation, facilitating gene transcription. Identifying enhancers is crucial for understanding genomic regulatory mechanisms, pinpointing key elements and investigating networks governing gene expression and disease-related mechanisms. Existing enhancer identification methods exhibit limitations, prompting the development of our novel multi-input deep learning framework, termed Enhancer-MDLF. Experimental results illustrate that Enhancer-MDLF outperforms the previous method, Enhancer-IF, across eight distinct human cell lines and exhibits superior performance on generic enhancer datasets and enhancer–promoter datasets, affirming the robustness of Enhancer-MDLF. Additionally, we introduce transfer learning to provide an effective and potential solution to address the prediction challenges posed by enhancer specificity. Furthermore, we utilize model interpretation to identify transcription factor binding site motifs that may be associated with enhancer regions, with important implications for facilitating the study of enhancer regulatory mechanisms.

Abstract:
Three-dimensional (3D) epigenome remodeling is an important mechanism of gene deregulation in cancer. However, its potential as a target to counteract therapy resistance remains largely unaddressed. Here, we show that epigenetic therapy with decitabine (5-Aza-mC) suppresses tumor growth in xenograft models of pre-clinical metastatic estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast tumor. Decitabine-induced genome-wide DNA hypomethylation results in large-scale 3D epigenome deregulation, including de-compaction of higher-order chromatin structure and loss of boundary insulation of topologically associated domains. Significant DNA hypomethylation associates with ectopic activation of ER-enhancers, gain in ER binding, creation of new 3D enhancer–promoter interactions and concordant up-regulation of ER-mediated transcription pathways. Importantly, long-term withdrawal of epigenetic therapy partially restores methylation at ER-enhancer elements, resulting in a loss of ectopic 3D enhancer–promoter interactions and associated gene repression. Our study illustrates the potential of epigenetic therapy to target ER+ endocrine-resistant breast cancer by DNA methylation-dependent rewiring of 3D chromatin interactions, which are associated with the suppression of tumor growth.

Title: The adapted Activity-By-Contact model for enhancer–gene assignment and its application to single-cell data
Authors: Dennis Hecker, Fatemeh Behjati Ardakani, Alexander Karollus, Julien Gagneur, Marcel H Schulz
Date: 2023-02

Abstract:
Identifying regulatory regions in the genome is of great interest for understanding the epigenomic landscape in cells. One fundamental challenge in this context is to find the target genes whose expression is affected by the regulatory regions. A recent successful method is the Activity-By-Contact (ABC) model which scores enhancer – gene interactions based on enhancer activity and the contact frequency of an enhancer to its target gene. However, it describes regulatory interactions entirely from a gene’s perspective, and does not account for all the candidate target genes of an enhancer. In addition, the ABC model requires two types of assays to measure enhancer activity, which limits the applicability. Moreover, there is neither implementation available that could allow for an integration with transcription factor (TF) binding information nor an efficient analysis of single-cell data. We demonstrate that the ABC score can yield a higher accuracy by adapting the enhancer activity according to the number of contacts the enhancer has to its candidate target genes and also by considering all annotated transcription start sites of a gene. Further, we show that the model is comparably accurate with only one assay to measure enhancer activity. We combined our generalized ABC model with TF binding information and illustrated an analysis of a single-cell ATAC-seq dataset of the human heart, where we were able to characterize cell type-specific regulatory interactions and predict gene expression based on TF affinities. All executed processing steps are incorporated into our new computational pipeline STARE.

Title: Transcriptional Enhancers in Drosophila
Authors: Stephen Small, David N. Arnosti
Date: 2020-09

Abstract:
Key discoveries in Drosophila have shaped our understanding of cellular “enhancers.” With a special focus on the fly, this chapter surveys properties of these adaptable cis -regulatory elements, whose actions are critical for the complex spatial/temporal transcriptional regulation of gene expression in metazoa. The powerful combination of genetics, molecular biology, and genomics available in Drosophila has provided an arena in which the developmental role of enhancers can be explored. Enhancers are characterized by diverse low- or high-throughput assays, which are challenging to interpret, as not all of these methods of identifying enhancers produce concordant results. As a model metazoan, the fly offers important advantages to comprehensive analysis of the central functions that enhancers play in gene expression, and their critical role in mediating the production of phenotypes from genotype and environmental inputs. A major challenge moving forward will be obtaining a quantitative understanding of how these cis -regulatory elements operate in development and disease.

Title: Improved Prediction of Regulatory Element Using Hybrid Abelian Complexity Features with DNA Sequences
Authors: Chengchao Wu, Jin Chen, Yunxia Liu, Xuehai Hu
Date: 2019-04-05

Abstract:
Deciphering the code of cis -regulatory element (CRE) is one of the core issues of current biology. As an important category of CRE, enhancers play crucial roles in gene transcriptional regulations in a distant manner. Further, the disruption of an enhancer can cause abnormal transcription and, thus, trigger human diseases, which means that its accurate identification is currently of broad interest. Here, we introduce an innovative concept, i.e., abelian complexity function (ACF), which is a more complex extension of the classic subword complexity function, for a new coding of DNA sequences. After feature selection by an upper bound estimation and integration with DNA composition features, we developed an enhancer prediction model with hybrid abelian complexity features (HACF). Compared with existing methods, HACF shows consistently superior performance on three sources of enhancer datasets. We tested the generalization ability of HACF by scanning human chromosome 22 to validate previously reported super-enhancers. Meanwhile, we identified novel candidate enhancers which have supports from enhancer-related ENCODE ChIP-seq signals. In summary, HACF improves current enhancer prediction and may be beneficial for further prioritization of functional noncoding variants.

Abstract:
Enhancers play a critical role in dynamically regulating spatial-temporal gene expression and establishing cell identity, underscoring the significance of designing them with specific properties for applications in biosynthetic engineering and gene therapy. Despite numerous high-throughput methods facilitating genome-wide enhancer identification, deciphering the sequence determinants of their activity remains challenging. Here, we present the DREAM (DNA cis- Regulatory Elements with controllable Activity design platforM) framework, a novel deep learning-based approach for synthetic enhancer design. Proficient in uncovering subtle and intricate patterns within extensive enhancer screening data, DREAM achieves cutting-edge sequence-based enhancer activity prediction and highlights critical sequence features implicating strong enhancer activity. Leveraging DREAM, we have engineered enhancers that surpass the potency of the strongest enhancer within the Drosophila genome by approximately 3.6-fold. Remarkably, these synthetic enhancers exhibited conserved functionality across species that have diverged more than billion years, indicating that DREAM was able to learn highly conserved enhancer regulatory grammar. Additionally, we designed silencers and cell line-specific enhancers using DREAM, demonstrating its versatility. Overall, our study not only introduces an interpretable approach for enhancer design but also lays out a general framework applicable to the design of other types of cis- regulatory elements.

Title: Enhancer prediction in the human genome by probabilistic modelling of the chromatin feature patterns
Authors: Maria Osmala, Harri Lähdesmäki
Date: 2020-07-20

Abstract:
The binding sites of transcription factors (TFs) and the localisation of histone modifications in the human genome can be quantified by the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay coupled with next-generation sequencing (ChIP-seq). The resulting chromatin feature data has been successfully adopted for genome-wide enhancer identification by several unsupervised and supervised machine learning methods. However, the current methods predict different numbers and different sets of enhancers for the same cell type and do not utilise the pattern of the ChIP-seq coverage profiles efficiently. In this work, we propose a PRobabilistic Enhancer PRedictIoN Tool (PREPRINT) that assumes characteristic coverage patterns of chromatin features at enhancers and employs a statistical model to account for their variability. PREPRINT defines probabilistic distance measures to quantify the similarity of the genomic query regions and the characteristic coverage patterns. The probabilistic scores of the enhancer and non-enhancer samples are utilised to train a kernel-based classifier. The performance of the method is demonstrated on ENCODE data for two cell lines. The predicted enhancers are computationally validated based on the transcriptional regulatory protein binding sites and compared to the predictions obtained by state-of-the-art methods. PREPRINT performs favorably to the state-of-the-art methods, especially when requiring the methods to predict a larger set of enhancers. PREPRINT generalises successfully to data from cell type not utilised for training, and often the PREPRINT performs better than the previous methods. The PREPRINT enhancers are less sensitive to the choice of prediction threshold. PREPRINT identifies biologically validated enhancers not predicted by the competing methods. The enhancers predicted by PREPRINT can aid the genome interpretation in functional genomics and clinical studies.

Title: Plant enhancers exhibit both cooperative and additive interactions among their functional elements
Authors: Tobias Jores, Jackson Tonnies, Nicholas A Mueth, Andrés Romanowski, Stanley Fields, Josh T Cuperus, Christine Queitsch
Date: 2024-07

Abstract:
Enhancers are cis -regulatory elements that shape gene expression in response to numerous developmental and environmental cues. In animals, several models have been proposed to explain how enhancers integrate the activity of multiple transcription factors. However, it remains largely unclear how plant enhancers integrate transcription factor activity. Here, we use Plant STARR-seq to characterize 3 light-responsive plant enhancers— AB80 , Cab-1 , and rbcS-E9 —derived from genes associated with photosynthesis. Saturation mutagenesis revealed mutations, many of which clustered in short regions, that strongly reduced enhancer activity in the light, in the dark, or in both conditions. When tested in the light, these mutation-sensitive regions did not function on their own; rather, cooperative interactions with other such regions were required for full activity. Epistatic interactions occurred between mutations in adjacent mutation-sensitive regions, and the spacing and order of mutation-sensitive regions in synthetic enhancers affected enhancer activity. In contrast, when tested in the dark, mutation-sensitive regions acted independently and additively in conferring enhancer activity. Taken together, this work demonstrates that plant enhancers show evidence for both cooperative and additive interactions among their functional elements. This knowledge can be harnessed to design strong, condition-specific synthetic enhancers.

Title: Computational prediction of CTCF/cohesin-based intra-TAD loops that insulate chromatin contacts and gene expression in mouse liver
Authors: Bryan J Matthews, David J Waxman
Date: 2018-05-14

Abstract:
CTCF and cohesin are key drivers of 3D-nuclear organization, anchoring the megabase-scale Topologically Associating Domains (TADs) that segment the genome. Here, we present and validate a computational method to predict cohesin-and-CTCF binding sites that form intra-TAD DNA loops. The intra-TAD loop anchors identified are structurally indistinguishable from TAD anchors regarding binding partners, sequence conservation, and resistance to cohesin knockdown; further, the intra-TAD loops retain key functional features of TADs, including chromatin contact insulation, blockage of repressive histone mark spread, and ubiquity across tissues. We propose that intra-TAD loops form by the same loop extrusion mechanism as the larger TAD loops, and that their shorter length enables finer regulatory control in restricting enhancer-promoter interactions, which enables selective, high-level expression of gene targets of super-enhancers and genes located within repressive nuclear compartments. These findings elucidate the role of intra-TAD cohesin-and-CTCF binding in nuclear organization associated with widespread insulation of distal enhancer activity.

Abstract:
Genetic and epigenetic variations in regulatory enhancer elements increase susceptibility to a range of pathologies. Despite recent advances, linking enhancer elements to target genes and predicting transcriptional outcomes of enhancer dysfunction remain significant challenges. Using 3D chromatin conformation assays, we generated an extensive enhancer interaction dataset for the human pancreas, encompassing more than 20 donors and five major cell types, including both exocrine and endocrine compartments. We employed a network approach to parse chromatin interactions into enhancer-promoter tree models, facilitating a quantitative, genome-wide analysis of enhancer connectivity. With these tree models, we developed a machine learning algorithm to estimate the impact of enhancer perturbations on cell type-specific gene expression in the human pancreas. Orthogonal to our computational approach, we perturbed enhancer function in primary human pancreas cells using CRISPR interference and quantified the effects at the single-cell level through RNA FISH coupled with high-throughput imaging. Our enhancer tree models enabled the annotation of common germline risk variants associated with pancreas diseases, linking them to putative target genes in specific cell types. For pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, we found a stronger enrichment of disease susceptibility variants within acinar cell regulatory elements, despite ductal cells historically being assumed as the primary cell-of-origin. Our integrative approach—combining cell type-specific enhancer-promoter interaction mapping, computational models, and single-cell enhancer perturbation assays—produced a robust resource for studying the genetic basis of pancreas disorders.

Abstract:
Enhancers are distal cis -regulatory elements required for cell-specific gene expression and cell fate determination. In cancer, enhancer variation has been proposed as a major cause of inter-patient heterogeneity—however, most predicted enhancer regions remain to be functionally tested. We analyzed 132 epigenomic histone modification profiles of 18 primary gastric cancer (GC) samples, 18 normal gastric tissues, and 28 GC cell lines using Nano-ChIP-seq technology. We applied Capture-based Self-Transcribing Active Regulatory Region sequencing (CapSTARR-seq) to assess functional enhancer activity. An Activity-by-contact (ABC) model was employed to explore the effects of histone acetylation and CapSTARR-seq levels on enhancer-promoter interactions. We report a comprehensive catalog of 75,730 recurrent predicted enhancers, the majority of which are GC-associated in vivo (> 50,000) and associated with lower somatic mutation rates inferred by whole-genome sequencing. Applying CapSTARR-seq to the enhancer catalog, we observed significant correlations between CapSTARR-seq functional activity and H3K27ac/H3K4me1 levels. Super-enhancer regions exhibited increased CapSTARR-seq signals compared to regular enhancers, even when decoupled from native chromatin contexture. We show that combining histone modification and CapSTARR-seq functional enhancer data improves the prediction of enhancer-promoter interactions and pinpointing of germline single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs), and trans -acting TFs involved in GC expression. We identified cancer-relevant genes ( ING1 , ARL4C ) whose expression between patients is influenced by enhancer differences in genomic copy number and germline SNPs, and HNF4α as a master trans -acting factor associated with GC enhancer heterogeneity. Our results indicate that combining histone modification and functional assay data may provide a more accurate metric to assess enhancer activity than either platform individually, providing insights into the relative contribution of genetic ( cis ) and regulatory ( trans ) mechanisms to GC enhancer functional heterogeneity.

Title: Shadow enhancers can suppress input transcription factor noise through distinct regulatory logic
Authors: Rachel Waymack, Alvaro Fletcher, German Enciso, Zeba Wunderlich
Date: 2020-08-17

Abstract:
Shadow enhancers, groups of seemingly redundant enhancers, are found in a wide range of organisms and are critical for robust developmental patterning. However, their mechanism of action is unknown. We hypothesized that shadow enhancers drive consistent expression levels by buffering upstream noise through a separation of transcription factor (TF) inputs at the individual enhancers. By measuring the transcriptional dynamics of several Kruppel shadow enhancer configurations in live Drosophila embryos, we showed that individual member enhancers act largely independently. We found that TF fluctuations are an appreciable source of noise that the shadow enhancer pair can better buffer than duplicated enhancers. The shadow enhancer pair is also uniquely able to maintain low levels of expression noise across a wide range of temperatures. A stochastic model demonstrated the separation of TF inputs is sufficient to explain these findings. Our results suggest the widespread use of shadow enhancers is partially due to their noise suppressing ability.

Title: Prioritizing genes associated with brain disorders by leveraging enhancer-promoter interactions in diverse neural cells and tissues
Authors: Xingzhong Zhao, Liting Song, Anyi Yang, Zichao Zhang, Jinglong Zhang, Yucheng T. Yang, Xing-Ming Zhao
Date: 2023-07-24

Abstract:
Prioritizing genes that underlie complex brain disorders poses a considerable challenge. Despite previous studies have found that they shared symptoms and heterogeneity, it remained difficult to systematically identify the risk genes associated with them. By using the CAGE (Cap Analysis of Gene Expression) read alignment files for 439 human cell and tissue types (including primary cells, tissues and cell lines) from FANTOM5 project, we predicted enhancer-promoter interactions (EPIs) of 439 cell and tissue types in human, and examined their reliability. Then we evaluated the genetic heritability of 17 diverse brain disorders and behavioral-cognitive phenotypes in each neural cell type, brain region, and developmental stage. Furthermore, we prioritized genes associated with brain disorders and phenotypes by leveraging the EPIs in each neural cell and tissue type, and analyzed their pleiotropy and functionality for different categories of disorders and phenotypes. Finally, we characterized the spatiotemporal expression dynamics of these associated genes in cells and tissues. We found that identified EPIs showed activity specificity and network aggregation in cell and tissue types, and enriched TF binding in neural cells played key roles in synaptic plasticity and nerve cell development, i.e., EGR1 and SOX family. We also discovered that most neurological disorders exhibit heritability enrichment in neural stem cells and astrocytes, while psychiatric disorders and behavioral-cognitive phenotypes exhibit enrichment in neurons. Furthermore, our identified genes recapitulated well-known risk genes, which exhibited widespread pleiotropy between psychiatric disorders and behavioral-cognitive phenotypes (i.e., FOXP2), and indicated expression specificity in neural cell types, brain regions, and developmental stages associated with disorders and phenotypes. Importantly, we showed the potential associations of brain disorders with brain regions and developmental stages that have not been well studied. Overall, our study characterized the gene-enhancer regulatory networks and genetic mechanisms in the human neural cells and tissues, and illustrated the value of reanalysis of publicly available genomic datasets.

Abstract:
Identifying cell type-specific enhancers in the brain is critical to building genetic tools for investigating the mammalian brain. Computational methods for functional enhancer prediction have been proposed and validated in the fruit fly and not yet the mammalian brain. We organized the ‘Brain Initiative Cell Census Network (BICCN) Challenge: Predicting Functional Cell Type-Specific Enhancers from Cross-Species Multi-Omics’ to assess machine learning and feature-based methods designed to nominate enhancer DNA sequences to target cell types in the mouse cortex. Methods were evaluated based on in vivo validation data from hundreds of cortical cell type-specific enhancers that were previously packaged into individual AAV vectors and retro-orbitally injected into mice. We find that open chromatin was a key predictor of functional enhancers, and sequence models improved prediction of non-functional enhancers that can be deprioritized as opposed to pursued for in vivo testing. Sequence models also identified cell type-specific transcription factor codes that can guide designs of in silico enhancers. This community challenge establishes a benchmark for enhancer prioritization algorithms and reveals computational approaches and molecular information that are crucial for identifying functional enhancers in mammalian cortical cell types. The results of this challenge bring us closer to understanding the complex gene regulatory landscape of the mammalian cortex and to designing more efficient genetic tools to target cortical cell types.

Abstract:
To understand how the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex regulates enhancers and enhancer–promoter interactions, we have developed an approach to segment and extract key biophysical parameters from live-cell three-dimensional single-molecule trajectories. Unexpectedly, this has revealed that NuRD binds to chromatin for minutes, decompacts chromatin structure and increases enhancer dynamics. We also uncovered a rare fast-diffusing state of enhancers and found that NuRD restricts the time spent in this state. Hi-C and Cut&Run experiments revealed that NuRD modulates enhancer–promoter interactions in active chromatin, allowing them to contact each other over longer distances. Furthermore, NuRD leads to a marked redistribution of CTCF and, in particular, cohesin. We propose that NuRD promotes a decondensed chromatin environment, where enhancers and promoters can contact each other over longer distances, and where the resetting of enhancer–promoter interactions brought about by the fast decondensed chromatin motions is reduced, leading to more stable, long-lived enhancer–promoter relationships.

Title: DeepEPI: CNN-transformer-based model for extracting TF interactions through predicting enhancer-promoter interactions
Authors: Seyedeh Fatemeh Tabatabaei, Saeedeh Akbari Roknabadi, Somayyeh Koohi
Date: 2025

Abstract:
We introduce DeepEPI, a deep learning framework for studying enhancer–promoter interactions (EPIs) directly from genomic sequences. By integrating convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with Transformer blocks, DeepEPI captures the complex regulatory interplay between enhancers and promoters, a key factor in gene expression and disease mechanisms. The model emphasizes interpretability and efficiency by employing embedding layers for OneHot encoding and multihead attention for detecting and analyzing transcription factor (TF) interactions. A DNA2Vec-based version of DeepEPI is also evaluated. DeepEPI is assessed in two dimensions: comparison with existing models and analysis of encoding methods. Across six cell lines, DeepEPI consistently outperforms prior approaches. Compared to EPIVAN, it achieves a 2.4% gain in area under the precision-recall curve (AUPR) and maintains AUROC with DNA2Vec encoding, while with OneHot encoding it shows a 4% increase in AUPR and 1.9% in AUROC. Regarding encoding, DNA2Vec provides higher accuracy, but our OneHot-based embedding balances competitive performance with interpretability and reduced storage requirements. Beyond prediction, DeepEPI enhances biological insight by extracting meaningful TF–TF interactions from attention heads, effectively narrowing the search space for experimental validation. Validation analyses further support the biological relevance of these findings, underscoring DeepEPI’s value for advancing EPI research. The source code of DeepEPI is available at: https://github.com/nazanintbtb/DeepEPI.git .

Abstract:
The vast majority of disease-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) identified from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are localized in non-coding regions. A significant fraction of these variants impact transcription factors binding to enhancer elements and alter gene expression. To functionally interrogate the activity of such variants we developed snpSTARRseq, a high-throughput experimental method that can interrogate the functional impact of hundreds to thousands of non-coding variants on enhancer activity. snpSTARRseq dramatically improves signal-to-noise by utilizing a novel sequencing and bioinformatic approach that increases both insert size and the number of variants tested per loci. Using this strategy, we interrogated known prostate cancer (PCa) risk-associated loci and demonstrated that 35% of them harbor SNPs that significantly altered enhancer activity. Combining these results with chromosomal looping data we could identify interacting genes and provide a mechanism of action for 20 PCa GWAS risk regions. When benchmarked to orthogonal methods, snpSTARRseq showed a strong correlation with in vivo experimental allelic-imbalance studies whereas there was no correlation with predictive in silico approaches. Overall, snpSTARRseq provides an integrated experimental and computational framework to functionally test non-coding genetic variants.

Abstract:
Significant progress has been made in the field of plant genomics, as demonstrated by the increased use of high-throughput methodologies that enable the characterization of multiple genome-wide molecular phenotypes. These findings have provided valuable insights into plant traits and their underlying genetic mechanisms, particularly in model plant species. Nonetheless, effectively leveraging them to make accurate predictions represents a critical step in crop genomic improvement. We present AgroNT, a foundational large language model trained on genomes from 48 plant species with a predominant focus on crop species. We show that AgroNT can obtain state-of-the-art predictions for regulatory annotations, promoter/terminator strength, tissue-specific gene expression, and prioritize functional variants. We conduct a large-scale in silico saturation mutagenesis analysis on cassava to evaluate the regulatory impact of over 10 million mutations and provide their predicted effects as a resource for variant characterization. Finally, we propose the use of the diverse datasets compiled here as the Plants Genomic Benchmark (PGB), providing a comprehensive benchmark for deep learning-based methods in plant genomic research. The pre-trained AgroNT model is publicly available on HuggingFace at https://huggingface.co/InstaDeepAI/agro-nucleotide-transformer-1b for future research purposes.

Title: Power-law behavior of transcriptional bursting regulated by enhancer–promoter communication
Authors: Zihao Wang, Zhenquan Zhang, Songhao Luo, Tianshou Zhou, Jiajun Zhang
Date: 2024-01

Abstract:
Revealing how transcriptional bursting kinetics are genomically encoded is challenging because genome structures are stochastic at the organization level and are suggestively linked to gene transcription. To address this challenge, we develop a generic theoretical framework that integrates chromatin dynamics, enhancer–promoter (E-P) communication, and gene-state switching to study transcriptional bursting. The theory predicts that power law can be a general rule to quantitatively describe bursting modulations by E-P spatial communication. Specifically, burst frequency and burst size are up-regulated by E-P communication strength, following power laws with positive exponents. Analysis of the scaling exponents further reveals that burst frequency is preferentially regulated. Bursting kinetics are down-regulated by E-P genomic distance with negative power-law exponents, and this negative modulation desensitizes at large distances. The mutual information between burst frequency (or burst size) and E-P spatial distance further reveals essential characteristics of the information transfer from E-P communication to transcriptional bursting kinetics. These findings, which are in agreement with experimental observations, not only reveal fundamental principles of E-P communication in transcriptional bursting but also are essential for understanding cellular decision-making.

Title: Machine and deep learning methods for predicting 3D genome organization
Authors: Brydon P. G. Wall, My Nguyen, J. Chuck Harrell, Mikhail G. Dozmorov
Date: 2024-03-04

Abstract:
Three-Dimensional (3D) chromatin interactions, such as enhancer-promoter interactions (EPIs), loops, Topologically Associating Domains (TADs), and A/B compartments play critical roles in a wide range of cellular processes by regulating gene expression. Recent development of chromatin conformation capture technologies has enabled genome-wide profiling of various 3D structures, even with single cells. However, current catalogs of 3D structures remain incomplete and unreliable due to differences in technology, tools, and low data resolution. Machine learning methods have emerged as an alternative to obtain missing 3D interactions and/or improve resolution. Such methods frequently use genome annotation data (ChIP-seq, DNAse-seq, etc.), DNA sequencing information (k-mers, Transcription Factor Binding Site (TFBS) motifs), and other genomic properties to learn the associations between genomic features and chromatin interactions. In this review, we discuss computational tools for predicting three types of 3D interactions (EPIs, chromatin interactions, TAD boundaries) and analyze their pros and cons. We also point out obstacles of computational prediction of 3D interactions and suggest future research directions.

Abstract:
Insulators are cis -regulatory elements that separate transcriptional units, whereas silencers are elements that repress transcription regardless of their position. In plants, these elements remain largely uncharacterized. Here, we use the massively parallel reporter assay Plant STARR-seq with short fragments of eight large insulators to identify more than 100 fragments that block enhancer activity. The short fragments can be combined to generate more powerful insulators that abolish the capacity of the strong viral 35S enhancer to activate the 35S minimal promoter. Unexpectedly, when tested upstream of weak enhancers, these fragments act as silencers and repress transcription. Thus, these elements are capable of both insulating or repressing transcription dependent upon regulatory context. We validate our findings in stable transgenic Arabidopsis , maize, and rice plants. The short elements identified here should be useful building blocks for plant biotechnology efforts.

Abstract:
Understanding how enhancers drive cell-type specificity and efficiently identifying them is essential for the development of innovative therapeutic strategies. In melanoma, the melanocytic (MEL) and the mesenchymal-like (MES) states present themselves with different responses to therapy, making the identification of specific enhancers highly relevant. Using massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) in a panel of patient-derived melanoma lines (MM lines), we set to identify and decipher melanoma enhancers by first focusing on regions with state-specific H3K27 acetylation close to differentially expressed genes. An in-depth evaluation of those regions was then pursued by investigating the activity of overlapping ATAC-seq peaks along with a full tiling of the acetylated regions with 190 bp sequences. Activity was observed in more than 60% of the selected regions, and we were able to precisely locate the active enhancers within ATAC-seq peaks. Comparison of sequence content with activity, using the deep learning model DeepMEL2, revealed that AP-1 alone is responsible for the MES enhancer activity. In contrast, SOX10 and MITF both influence MEL enhancer function with SOX10 being required to achieve high levels of activity. Overall, our MPRAs shed light on the relationship between long and short sequences in terms of their sequence content, enhancer activity, and specificity across melanoma cell states.

Abstract:
Genome conformation underlies transcriptional regulation by distal enhancers, and genomic rearrangements in cancer can alter critical regulatory interactions. Here we profiled the three-dimensional genome architecture and enhancer connectome of 69 tumor samples spanning 15 primary human cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas. We discovered the following three archetypes of enhancer usage for over 100 oncogenes across human cancers: static, selective gain or dynamic rewiring. Integrative analyses revealed the enhancer landscape of noncancer cells in the tumor microenvironment for genes related to immune escape. Deep whole-genome sequencing and enhancer connectome mapping provided accurate detection and validation of diverse structural variants across cancer genomes and revealed distinct enhancer rewiring consequences from noncoding point mutations, genomic inversions, translocations and focal amplifications. Extrachromosomal DNA promoted more extensive enhancer rewiring among several types of focal amplification mechanisms. These results suggest a systematic approach to understanding genome topology in cancer etiology and therapy.

Title: ADH-Enhancer: an attention-based deep hybrid framework for enhancer identification and strength prediction
Authors: Faiza Mehmood, Shazia Arshad, Muhammad Shoaib
Date: 2024-03

Abstract:
Enhancers play an important role in the process of gene expression regulation. In DNA sequence abundance or absence of enhancers and irregularities in the strength of enhancers affects gene expression process that leads to the initiation and propagation of diverse types of genetic diseases such as hemophilia, bladder cancer, diabetes and congenital disorders. Enhancer identification and strength prediction through experimental approaches is expensive, time-consuming and error-prone. To accelerate and expedite the research related to enhancers identification and strength prediction, around 19 computational frameworks have been proposed. These frameworks used machine and deep learning methods that take raw DNA sequences and predict enhancer’s presence and strength. However, these frameworks still lack in performance and are not useful in real time analysis. This paper presents a novel deep learning framework that uses language modeling strategies for transforming DNA sequences into statistical feature space. It applies transfer learning by training a language model in an unsupervised fashion by predicting a group of nucleotides also known as k-mers based on the context of existing k-mers in a sequence. At the classification stage, it presents a novel classifier that reaps the benefits of two different architectures: convolutional neural network and attention mechanism. The proposed framework is evaluated over the enhancer identification benchmark dataset where it outperforms the existing best-performing framework by 5%, and 9% in terms of accuracy and MCC. Similarly, when evaluated over the enhancer strength prediction benchmark dataset, it outperforms the existing best-performing framework by 4%, and 7% in terms of accuracy and MCC.

Abstract:
Proper cell fate determination is largely orchestrated by complex gene regulatory networks centered around transcription factors. However, experimental elucidation of key transcription factors that drive cellular identity is currently often intractable. Here, we present ANANSE ( AN alysis A lgorithm for N etworks S pecified by E nhancers), a network-based method that exploits enhancer-encoded regulatory information to identify the key transcription factors in cell fate determination. As cell type-specific transcription factors predominantly bind to enhancers, we use regulatory networks based on enhancer properties to prioritize transcription factors. First, we predict genome-wide binding profiles of transcription factors in various cell types using enhancer activity and transcription factor binding motifs. Subsequently, applying these inferred binding profiles, we construct cell type-specific gene regulatory networks, and then predict key transcription factors controlling cell fate transitions using differential networks between cell types. This method outperforms existing approaches in correctly predicting major transcription factors previously identified to be sufficient for trans -differentiation. Finally, we apply ANANSE to define an atlas of key transcription factors in 18 normal human tissues. In conclusion, we present a ready-to-implement computational tool for efficient prediction of transcription factors in cell fate determination and to study transcription factor-mediated regulatory mechanisms.

Abstract:
Single-cell sequencing could help to solve the fundamental challenge of linking millions of cell-type-specific enhancers with their target genes. However, this task is confounded by patterns of gene co-expression in much the same way that genetic correlation due to linkage disequilibrium confounds fine-mapping in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We developed a non-parametric permutation-based procedure to establish stringent statistical criteria to control the risk of false-positive associations in enhancer-gene association studies (EGAS). We applied our procedure to large-scale transcriptome and epigenome data from multiple tissues and species, including the mouse and human brain, to predict enhancer-gene associations genome wide. We tested the functional validity of our predictions by comparing them with chromatin conformation data and causal enhancer perturbation experiments. Our study shows how controlling for gene co-expression enables robust enhancer-gene linkage using single-cell sequencing data.

Title: Deep learning guided programmable design of Escherichia coli core promoters from sequence architecture to strength control
Authors: Xuan Zhou, Renxu Feng, Nana Ding, Wenyan Cao, Yang Liu, Shenghu Zhou, Yu Deng
Date: 2025-09-09

Abstract:
Core promoters are essential regulatory elements that control transcription initiation, but accurately predicting and designing their strength remains challenging due to complex sequence-function relationships and the limited generalizability of existing AI-based approaches. To address this, we developed a modular platform integrating rational library design, predictive modelling, and generative optimization into a closed-loop workflow for end-to-end core promoter engineering. Conserved and spacer region of core promoters exert distinct effects on transcriptional strength, with the former driving large-scale variation and the latter enabling finer gradation. Based on this insight, Mutation-Barcoding-Reverse Sequencing approach was used and constructed a synthetic promoter library comprising 112 955 variants with minimal redundancy and a 16 226-fold expression range. A Transformer-based model trained on this dataset achieved a Pearson correlation of 0.87 with experimentally measured promoter strengths. When combined with a conditional diffusion model, the system enabled de novo generation of promoter sequences with defined strengths, achieving a design-to-measurement correlation of 0.95 and maintaining high accuracy ( R = 0.93) across varied sequence contexts. The designed promoters consistently preserved their intended strength gradients, demonstrating robust plug-and-play functionality. This work establishes a scalable and extensible platform ( www.yudenglab.com ) for deep learning-guided programmable design of Escherichia coli core promoters, enabling precise transcriptional control.

Date: 2023-07-11

Abstract:
A key problem in development is to understand how genes turn on or off at the right place and right time during embryogenesis. Such decisions are made by non-coding sequences called ‘enhancers.’ Much of our models of how enhancers work rely on the assumption that genes are activated de novo as stable domains across embryonic tissues. Such a view has been strengthened by the intensive landmark studies of the early patterning of the anterior-posterior (AP) axis of the Drosophila embryo, where indeed gene expression domains seem to arise more or less stably. However, careful analysis of gene expression patterns in other model systems (including the AP patterning in vertebrates and short-germ insects like the beetle Tribolium castaneum ) painted a different, very dynamic view of gene regulation, where genes are oftentimes expressed in a wavelike fashion. How such gene expression waves are mediated at the enhancer level is so far unclear. Here, we establish the AP patterning of the short-germ beetle Tribolium as a model system to study dynamic and temporal pattern formation at the enhancer level. To that end, we established an enhancer prediction system in Tribolium based on time- and tissue-specific ATAC-seq and an enhancer live reporter system based on MS2 tagging. Using this experimental framework, we discovered several Tribolium enhancers, and assessed the spatiotemporal activities of some of them in live embryos. We found our data consistent with a model in which the timing of gene expression during embryonic pattern formation is mediated by a balancing act between enhancers that induce rapid changes in gene expression patterns (that we call ‘dynamic enhancers’) and enhancers that stabilize gene expression patterns (that we call ‘static enhancers’). However, more data is needed for a strong support for this or any other alternative models.

Title: Impact of 3D genome organization, guided by cohesin and CTCF looping, on sex-biased chromatin interactions and gene expression in mouse liver
Authors: Bryan J. Matthews, David J. Waxman
Date: 2020-07-17

Abstract:
Several thousand sex-differential distal enhancers have been identified in mouse liver; however, their links to sex-biased genes and the impact of any sex-differences in nuclear organization and chromatin interactions are unknown. To address these issues, we first characterized 1847 mouse liver genomic regions showing significant sex differential occupancy by cohesin and CTCF, two key 3D nuclear organizing factors. These sex-differential binding sites were primarily distal to sex-biased genes but rarely generated sex-differential TAD (topologically associating domain) or intra-TAD loop anchors, and were sometimes found in TADs without sex-biased genes. A substantial subset of sex-biased cohesin-non-CTCF binding sites, but not sex-biased cohesin-and-CTCF binding sites, overlapped sex-biased enhancers. Cohesin depletion reduced the expression of male-biased genes with distal, but not proximal, sex-biased enhancers by >10-fold, implicating cohesin in long-range enhancer interactions regulating sex-biased genes. Using circularized chromosome conformation capture-based sequencing (4C-seq), we showed that sex differences in distal sex-biased enhancer–promoter interactions are common. Intra-TAD loops with sex-independent cohesin-and-CTCF anchors conferred sex specificity to chromatin interactions indirectly, by insulating sex-biased enhancer–promoter contacts and by bringing sex-biased genes into closer proximity to sex-biased enhancers. Furthermore, sex-differential chromatin interactions involving sex-biased gene promoters, enhancers, and lncRNAs were associated with sex-biased binding of cohesin and/or CTCF. These studies elucidate how 3D genome organization impacts sex-biased gene expression in a non-reproductive tissue through both direct and indirect effects of cohesin and CTCF looping on distal enhancer interactions with sex-differentially expressed genes.

Title: ETNet: an interpretable transformer framework for enhancer–enhancer interaction prediction with cross-context transferability
Authors: Shuaibin Wang, Tong Chen, Zhongxin Yang, Zhen Liang, Yin Shen
Date: 2025-11

Abstract:
Enhancer–enhancer interactions (EEIs) are critical regulatory components in transcriptional networks but remain computationally challenging to predict. While enhancer–promoter interactions have been extensively studied, EEIs remain comparatively underexplored. We developed ETNet (Enhancer–enhancer Interaction Explainable Transformer Network), a deep learning architecture integrating convolutional neural networks with Transformer modules to predict EEIs from DNA sequences. Evaluation across three cell lines (GM12878, K562, MCF-7) demonstrated superior performance compared to existing methods including EnContact, with statistical significance confirmed through DeLong tests across six cell lines. Rigorous validation through cross-validation and enhancer-level data partitioning confirmed robust generalization. ETNet exhibited effective cross-cell type transfer learning and showed transferability to enhancer–promoter interaction tasks, providing exploratory evidence for shared chromatin interaction principles. Feature attribution analysis recovered cell-type-specific regulatory motifs consistent with known transcription factors and revealed computational evidence for super-additive cooperative mechanisms, with cooperativity negatively correlating with sequence similarity—patterns representing hypothesis-generating observations requiring experimental validation. Proof-of-concept analysis demonstrated how single-nucleotide polymorphisms in JAK–STAT pathway genes may influence predicted interactions through motif alterations. ETNet advances computational approaches for studying enhancer interactions and provides a framework combining predictive capability with exploratory interpretability.

Title: Functional impacts of non-coding RNA processing on enhancer activity and target gene expression
Authors: Evgenia Ntini, Annalisa Marsico
Date: 2019-10

Abstract:
Tight regulation of gene expression is orchestrated by enhancers. Through recent research advancements, it is becoming clear that enhancers are not solely distal regulatory elements harboring transcription factor binding sites and decorated with specific histone marks, but they rather display signatures of active transcription, showing distinct degrees of transcription unit organization. Thereby, a substantial fraction of enhancers give rise to different species of non-coding RNA transcripts with an unprecedented range of potential functions. In this review, we bring together data from recent studies indicating that non-coding RNA transcription from active enhancers, as well as enhancer-produced long non-coding RNA transcripts, may modulate or define the functional regulatory potential of the cognate enhancer. In addition, we summarize supporting evidence that RNA processing of the enhancer-associated long non-coding RNA transcripts may constitute an additional layer of regulation of enhancer activity, which contributes to the control and final outcome of enhancer-targeted gene expression.

Title: Leveraging three-dimensional chromatin architecture for effective reconstruction of enhancer–target gene regulatory interactions
Authors: Elisa Salviato, Vera Djordjilović, Judith Mary Hariprakash, Ilario Tagliaferri, Koustav Pal, Francesco Ferrari
Date: 2021-09-27

Abstract:
A growing amount of evidence in literature suggests that germline sequence variants and somatic mutations in non-coding distal regulatory elements may be crucial for defining disease risk and prognostic stratification of patients, in genetic disorders as well as in cancer. Their functional interpretation is challenging because genome-wide enhancer–target gene (ETG) pairing is an open problem in genomics. The solutions proposed so far do not account for the hierarchy of structural domains which define chromatin three-dimensional (3D) architecture. Here we introduce a change of perspective based on the definition of multi-scale structural chromatin domains, integrated in a statistical framework to define ETG pairs. In this work (i) we develop a computational and statistical framework to reconstruct a comprehensive map of ETG pairs leveraging functional genomics data; (ii) we demonstrate that the incorporation of chromatin 3D architecture information improves ETG pairing accuracy and (iii) we use multiple experimental datasets to extensively benchmark our method against previous solutions for the genome-wide reconstruction of ETG pairs. This solution will facilitate the annotation and interpretation of sequence variants in distal non-coding regulatory elements. We expect this to be especially helpful in clinically oriented applications of whole genome sequencing in cancer and undiagnosed genetic diseases research.

Title: Combining diffusion and transformer models for enhanced promoter synthesis and strength prediction in deep learning

Abstract:
In the field of synthetic biology, the engineering of synthetic promoters that outperform their natural counterparts is of paramount importance, which can optimize the expression of exogenous genes, enhance the efficiency of metabolic pathways, and possess substantial commercial value. Research indicates that some synthetic promoters have higher transcriptional activity compared to strong natural promoters. However, with the exponential increase in complexity due to the 4 n potential combinations in a promoter sequence of length n , identifying effective synthetic promoters remains a formidable challenge. Deep learning models, by adaptively learning from extensive data sets, have become instrumental in analyzing biological data. This study introduces a diffusion model-based approach for designing promoters viable in model bacteria such as Escherichia coli and cyanobacteria. This model proficiently assimilates and utilizes inherent biological features from natural promoter sequences to engineer synthetic variants. Additionally, we employed a transformer model to evaluate the efficacy of these synthetic promoters, aiming at screening those with high performance. The experimental findings suggest that the synthetic promoters by the diffusion model not only share key biological features with their natural counterparts but also demonstrate greater similarity to natural promoters than those generated by a variational autoencoder. In predicting promoter strength, the transformer model demonstrated improved performance over the convolutional neural network. Finally, we developed an integrated platform for generating promoters and predicting their strength. We demonstrated that diffusion models are superior in accomplishing the promoter synthesis task compared to other state-of-the-art deep learning models. The effectiveness of our method was validated using data sets of Escherichia coli and cyanobacteria promoters, showing more stable and prompt convergence and more natural-like promoters than the variational autoencoder model. We extracted sequence information, dimer information, and position information from promoters and combined them with a transformer model to predict promoter strength. Our prediction results were more accurate than those obtained with a convolutional neural network model. Our in silico experiments systematically introduced mutations in promoter sequences and explored their contribution to promoter strength, highlighting the depth of learning in our model.

Abstract:
DNA can determine where and when genes are expressed, but the full set of sequence determinants that control gene expression is unknown. Here, we measured the transcriptional activity of DNA sequences that represent an ~100 times larger sequence space than the human genome using massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs). Machine learning models revealed that transcription factors (TFs) generally act in an additive manner with weak grammar and that most enhancers increase expression from a promoter by a mechanism that does not appear to involve specific TF–TF interactions. The enhancers themselves can be classified into three types: classical, closed chromatin and chromatin dependent. We also show that few TFs are strongly active in a cell, with most activities being similar between cell types. Individual TFs can have multiple gene regulatory activities, including chromatin opening and enhancing, promoting and determining transcription start site (TSS) activity, consistent with the view that the TF binding motif is the key atomic unit of gene expression.

Abstract:
Noncoding genetic variants underlie many complex diseases, yet identifying and interpreting their functional impacts remains challenging. Late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD), a polygenic neurodegenerative disorder, exemplifies this challenge. The disease is strongly associated with noncoding variation, including common variants enriched in microglial enhancers and rare variants that are hypothesized to influence neurodevelopment and synaptic plasticity. These variants often perturb regulatory sequences by disrupting transcription factor (TF) motifs or altering local TF interactions, thereby reshaping gene expression and chromatin accessibility. However, assessing their impact is complicated by the context-dependent functions of regulatory sequences, underscoring the need to systematically examine variant effects across diverse tissues, cell types, and cellular states. Here, we combined in vitro and in vivo massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) with interpretable machine-learning models to systematically characterize common and rare variants across myeloid and neural contexts. Parallel profiling of variants in four immune states in vitro and three mouse brain regions in vivo revealed that individual variants can differentially and even oppositely modulate regulatory function depending on cell-type and cell-state contexts. Common variants associated with LOAD tended to exert stronger effects in immune contexts, whereas rare variants showed more pronounced impacts in brain contexts. Interpretable sequence-to-function deep-learning models elucidated how genetic variation leads to cell-type-specific differences in regulatory activity, pinpointing both direct transcription-factor motif disruptions and subtler tuning of motif context. To probe the broader functional consequences of a locus prioritized by our reporter assays and models, we used CRISPR interference to silence an enhancer within the SEC63-OSTM1 locus that harbors four functional rare variants, revealing its gatekeeper role in inflammation and amyloidogenesis. These findings underscore the context-dependent nature of noncoding variant effects in LOAD and provide a generalizable framework for the mechanistic interpretation of risk alleles in complex diseases.

Title: Nascent RNA sequencing analysis provides insights into enhancer-mediated gene regulation
Authors: Jing Wang, Yue Zhao, Xiaofan Zhou, Scott W. Hiebert, Qi Liu, Yu Shyr
Date: 2018-08-23

Abstract:
Enhancers are distal cis-regulatory elements that control gene expression. Despite an increasing appreciation of the importance of enhancers in cellular function and disease, our knowledge of enhancer-regulated transcription is very limited. Nascent RNA sequencing technologies, such as global nuclear run-on sequencing (GRO-seq) and precision run-on sequencing (PRO-seq), not only provide a direct and reliable measurement of enhancer activity, but also allow for quantifying transcription of enhancers and target genes simultaneously, making these technologies extremely useful for exploring enhancer-mediated regulation. Nascent RNA sequencing analysis (NRSA) provides a comprehensive view of enhancer-mediated gene regulation. NRSA not only outperforms existing methods for enhancer identification, but also enables annotation and quantification of active enhancers, and prediction of their target genes. Furthermore, NRSA identifies functionally important enhancers by integrating 1) nascent transcriptional changes in enhancers and their target genes and 2) binding profiles from regulator(s) of interest. Applied to wildtype and histone deacetylase 3 ( Hdac3) knockout mouse livers, NRSA showed that HDAC3 regulates RNA polymerase recruitment through both proximal (promoter) and distal (enhancer) regulatory elements. Integrating ChIP-seq with PRO-seq data, NRSA prioritized enhancers based on their potential contribution to mediating HDAC3 regulation. NRSA will greatly facilitate the usage of nascent RNA sequencing techniques and accelerate the study of enhancer-mediated regulation.

Title: AttnW2V-Enhancer: Leveraging attention and Word2Vec for enhanced enhancer prediction
Authors: Mobeen Ur Rehman, Zeeshan Abbas, Farman Ullah, Irfan Hussain
Date: 2025

Abstract:
Accurate identification of enhancer regions in DNA sequences is essential for understanding gene regulation and its role in diverse biological processes. Enhancers are regulatory elements that influence gene expression, but their detection remains challenging due to the complexity and variability of genomic sequences. In this study, we propose AttnW2V-Enhancer, a novel model that combines Word2Vec-based sequence encoding, convolutional neural networks (CNN), and attention mechanisms to address this challenge. By leveraging Word2Vec embeddings, our model captures biologically meaningful patterns and offers a more efficient and interpretable representation than traditional methods such as one-hot encoding and physicochemical descriptors. We evaluate AttnW2V-Enhancer on an independent test set, where it achieves superior performance with an accuracy of 81.75%, sensitivity of 83.50%, specificity of 80.00%, and a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.635, outperforming existing models. Additionally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the attention mechanism in enhancing feature learning by dynamically focusing on the most relevant sequence regions. These results confirm that integrating Word2Vec encoding with CNNs and attention mechanisms provides a powerful and interpretable framework for enhancer prediction, offering valuable insights into the identification of regulatory sequences.

Title: Enhancer occlusion transcripts regulate the activity of human enhancer domains via transcriptional interference: a computational perspective
Authors: Amit Pande, Wojciech Makalowski, Jürgen Brosius, Carsten A Raabe
Date: 2020-04-17

Abstract:
Analysis of ENCODE long RNA-Seq and ChIP-seq (Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Sequencing) datasets for HepG2 and HeLa cell lines uncovered 1647 and 1958 transcripts that interfere with transcription factor binding to human enhancer domains. TFBSs (Transcription Factor Binding Sites) intersected by these ‘Enhancer Occlusion Transcripts’ (EOTrs) displayed significantly lower relative transcription factor (TF) binding affinities compared to TFBSs for the same TF devoid of EOTrs. Expression of most EOTrs was regulated in a cell line specific manner; analysis for the same TFBSs across cell lines, i.e. in the absence or presence of EOTrs, yielded consistently higher relative TF/DNA-binding affinities for TFBSs devoid of EOTrs. Lower activities of EOTr-associated enhancer domains coincided with reduced occupancy levels for histone tail modifications H3K27ac and H3K9ac. Similarly, the analysis of EOTrs with allele-specific expression identified lower activities for alleles associated with EOTrs. ChIA-PET (Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag Sequencing) and 5C (Carbon Copy Chromosome Conformation Capture) uncovered that enhancer domains associated with EOTrs preferentially interacted with poised gene promoters. Analysis of EOTr regions with GRO-seq (Global run-on) data established the correlation of RNA polymerase pausing and occlusion of TF-binding. Our results implied that EOTr expression regulates human enhancer domains via transcriptional interference.

Abstract:
Identifying transcriptional enhancers and their target genes is essential for understanding gene regulation and the impact of human genetic variation on disease 1 – 6 . Here we create and evaluate a resource of >13 million enhancer-gene regulatory interactions across 352 cell types and tissues, by integrating predictive models, measurements of chromatin state and 3D contacts, and largescale genetic perturbations generated by the ENCODE Consortium 7 . We first create a systematic benchmarking pipeline to compare predictive models, assembling a dataset of 10,411 elementgene pairs measured in CRISPR perturbation experiments, >30,000 fine-mapped eQTLs, and 569 fine-mapped GWAS variants linked to a likely causal gene. Using this framework, we develop a new predictive model, ENCODE-rE2G, that achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple prediction tasks, demonstrating a strategy involving iterative perturbations and supervised machine learning to build increasingly accurate predictive models of enhancer regulation. Using the ENCODE-rE2G model, we build an encyclopedia of enhancer-gene regulatory interactions in the human genome, which reveals global properties of enhancer networks, identifies differences in the functions of genes that have more or less complex regulatory landscapes, and improves analyses to link noncoding variants to target genes and cell types for common, complex diseases. By interpreting the model, we find evidence that, beyond enhancer activity and 3D enhancer-promoter contacts, additional features guide enhancerpromoter communication including promoter class and enhancer-enhancer synergy. Altogether, these genome-wide maps of enhancer-gene regulatory interactions, benchmarking software, predictive models, and insights about enhancer function provide a valuable resource for future studies of gene regulation and human genetics.

Abstract:
Transcriptional enhancers act as docking stations for combinations of transcription factors and thereby regulate spatiotemporal activation of their target genes 1 . It has been a long-standing goal in the field to decode the regulatory logic of an enhancer and to understand the details of how spatiotemporal gene expression is encoded in an enhancer sequence. Here we show that deep learning models 2 – 6 , can be used to efficiently design synthetic, cell-type-specific enhancers, starting from random sequences, and that this optimization process allows detailed tracing of enhancer features at single-nucleotide resolution. We evaluate the function of fully synthetic enhancers to specifically target Kenyon cells or glial cells in the fruit fly brain using transgenic animals. We further exploit enhancer design to create ‘dual-code’ enhancers that target two cell types and minimal enhancers smaller than 50 base pairs that are fully functional. By examining the state space searches towards local optima, we characterize enhancer codes through the strength, combination and arrangement of transcription factor activator and transcription factor repressor motifs. Finally, we apply the same strategies to successfully design human enhancers, which adhere to enhancer rules similar to those of Drosophila enhancers. Enhancer design guided by deep learning leads to better understanding of how enhancers work and shows that their code can be exploited to manipulate cell states.

Abstract:
Enhlink is a computational tool for scATAC-seq data analysis, facilitating precise interrogation of enhancer function at the single-cell level. It employs an ensemble approach incorporating technical and biological covariates to infer condition-specific regulatory DNA linkages. Enhlink can integrate multi-omic data for enhanced specificity, when available. Evaluation with simulated and real data, including multi-omic datasets from the mouse striatum and novel promoter capture Hi-C data, demonstrate that Enhlink outperfoms alternative methods. Coupled with eQTL analysis, it identified a putative super-enhancer in striatal neurons. Overall, Enhlink offers accuracy, power, and potential for revealing novel biological insights in gene regulation.

Abstract:
Identifying cell-type-specific enhancers is critical for developing genetic tools to study the mammalian brain. We organized the “Brain Initiative Cell Census Network (BICCN) Challenge: Predicting Functional Cell Type-Specific Enhancers from Cross-Species Multi-Omics” to evaluate machine learning and feature-based methods for nominating enhancer sequences targeting mouse cortical cell types. Methods were assessed using in vivo data from hundreds of adeno-associated virus (AAV)-packaged, retro-orbitally delivered enhancers. Open chromatin was the strongest predictor of functional enhancers, while sequence models improved prediction of non-functional enhancers and identified cell-type-specific transcription factor codes to inform in silico enhancer design. This challenge establishes a benchmark for enhancer prioritization and highlights computational and molecular features critical for identifying functional cortical enhancers, advancing efforts to map and manipulate gene regulation in the mammalian cortex.

Title: Network Analysis of Enhancer–Promoter Interactions Highlights Cell-Type-Specific Mechanisms of Transcriptional Regulation Variation
Authors: Justin Koesterich, Jiayi Liu, Sarah E. Williams, Nan Yang, Anat Kreimer
Date: 2024-09-11

Abstract:
Gene expression is orchestrated by a complex array of gene regulatory elements that govern transcription in a cell-type-specific manner. Though previously studied, the ability to utilize regulatory elements to identify disrupting variants remains largely elusive. To identify important factors within these regions, we generated enhancer–promoter interaction (EPI) networks and investigated the presence of disease-associated variants that fall within these regions. Our study analyzed six neuronal cell types across neural differentiation, allowing us to examine closely related cell types and across differentiation stages. Our results expand upon previous findings of cell-type specificity of enhancer, promoter, and transcription factor binding sites. Notably, we find that regulatory regions within EPI networks can identify the enrichment of variants associated with neuropsychiatric disorders within specific cell types and network sub-structures. This enrichment within sub-structures can allow for a better understanding of potential mechanisms by which variants may disrupt transcription. Together, our findings suggest that EPIs can be leveraged to better understand cell-type-specific regulatory architecture and used as a selection method for disease-associated variants to be tested in future functional assays. Combined with these future functional characterization assays, EPIs can be used to better identify and characterize regulatory variants’ effects on such networks and model their mechanisms of gene regulation disruption across different disorders. Such findings can be applied in practical settings, such as diagnostic tools and drug development.

Title: IVEA: an integrative variational Bayesian inference method for predicting enhancer–gene regulatory interactions
Authors: Yasumasa Kimura, Yoshimasa Ono, Kotoe Katayama, Seiya Imoto
Date: 2024

Abstract:
Enhancers play critical roles in cell-type-specific transcriptional control. Despite the identification of thousands of candidate enhancers, unravelling their regulatory relationships with their target genes remains challenging. Therefore, computational approaches are needed to accurately infer enhancer–gene regulatory relationships. In this study, we propose a new method, IVEA, that predicts enhancer–gene regulatory interactions by estimating promoter and enhancer activities. Its statistical model is based on the gene regulatory mechanism of transcriptional bursting, which is characterized by burst size and frequency controlled by promoters and enhancers, respectively. Using transcriptional readouts, chromatin accessibility, and chromatin contact data as inputs, promoter and enhancer activities were estimated using variational Bayesian inference, and the contribution of each enhancer–promoter pair to target gene transcription was calculated. Our analysis demonstrates that the proposed method can achieve high prediction accuracy and provide biologically relevant enhancer–gene regulatory interactions. The IVEA code is available on GitHub at https://github.com/yasumasak/ivea . The publicly available datasets used in this study are described in Supplementary Table S4 .

Abstract:
Mammalian embryogenesis commences with two pivotal and binary cell fate decisions that give rise to three essential lineages, the trophectoderm (TE), the epiblast (EPI) and the primitive endoderm (PrE). Although key signaling pathways and transcription factors that control these early embryonic decisions have been identified, the non-coding regulatory elements via which transcriptional regulators enact these fates remain understudied. To address this gap, we have characterized, at a genome-wide scale, enhancer activity and 3D connectivity in embryo-derived stem cell lines that represent each of the early developmental fates. We observed extensive enhancer remodeling and fine-scale 3D chromatin rewiring among the three lineages, which strongly associate with transcriptional changes, although there are distinct groups of genes that are irresponsive to topological changes. In each lineage, a high degree of connectivity or “hubness” positively correlates with levels of gene expression and enriches for cell-type specific and essential genes. Genes within 3D hubs also show a significantly stronger probability of coregulation across lineages, compared to genes in linear proximity or within the same contact domains. By incorporating 3D chromatin features, we build a novel predictive model for transcriptional regulation (3D-HiChAT), which outperformed models that use only 1D promoter or proximal variables in predicting levels and cell-type specificity of gene expression. Using 3D-HiChAT, we performed genome-wide in silico perturbations to nominate candidate functional enhancers and hubs in each cell lineage, and with CRISPRi experiments we validated several novel enhancers that control expression of one or more genes in their respective lineages. Our study comprehensively identifies 3D regulatory hubs associated with the earliest mammalian lineages and describes their relationship to gene expression and cell identity, providing a framework to understand lineage-specific transcriptional behaviors.

Abstract:
Estrogen Receptor α (ERα) is a major lineage determining transcription factor (TF) in mammary gland development. Dysregulation of ERα-mediated transcriptional program results in cancer. Transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling of breast cancer cell lines has revealed large numbers of enhancers involved in this regulatory program, but how these enhancers encode function in their sequence remains poorly understood. A subset of ERα-bound enhancers are transcribed into short bidirectional RNA (enhancer RNA or eRNA), and this property is believed to be a reliable marker of active enhancers. We therefore analyze thousands of ERα-bound enhancers and build quantitative, mechanism-aware models to discriminate eRNAs from non-transcribing enhancers based on their sequence. Our thermodynamics-based models provide insights into the roles of specific TFs in ERα-mediated transcriptional program, many of which are supported by the literature. We use in silico perturbations to predict TF-enhancer regulatory relationships and integrate these findings with experimentally determined enhancer-promoter interactions to construct a gene regulatory network. We also demonstrate that the model can prioritize breast cancer-related sequence variants while providing mechanistic explanations for their function. Finally, we experimentally validate the model-proposed mechanisms underlying three such variants.

Title: Tandem CTCF sites function as insulators to balance spatial chromatin contacts and topological enhancer-promoter selection
Authors: Zhilian Jia, Jingwei Li, Xiao Ge, Yonghu Wu, Ya Guo, Qiang Wu
Date: 2020-03-23

Abstract:
CTCF is a key insulator-binding protein, and mammalian genomes contain numerous CTCF sites, many of which are organized in tandem. Using CRISPR DNA-fragment editing, in conjunction with chromosome conformation capture, we find that CTCF sites, if located between enhancers and promoters in the protocadherin ( Pcdh ) and β-globin clusters, function as an enhancer-blocking insulator by forming distinct directional chromatin loops, regardless whether enhancers contain CTCF sites or not. Moreover, computational simulation in silico and genetic deletions in vivo as well as dCas9 blocking in vitro revealed balanced promoter usage in cell populations and stochastic monoallelic expression in single cells by large arrays of tandem CTCF sites in the Pcdh and immunoglobulin heavy chain ( Igh ) clusters. Furthermore, CTCF insulators promote, counter-intuitively, long-range chromatin interactions with distal directional CTCF sites, consistent with the cohesin “loop extrusion” model. Finally, gene expression levels are negatively correlated with CTCF insulators located between enhancers and promoters on a genome-wide scale. Thus, single CTCF insulators ensure proper enhancer insulation and promoter activation while tandem CTCF topological insulators determine balanced spatial contacts and promoter choice. These findings have interesting implications on the role of topological chromatin insulators in 3D genome folding and developmental gene regulation.

Title: Enhancers display constrained sequence flexibility and context-specific modulation of motif function
Authors: Franziska Reiter, Bernardo P. de Almeida, Alexander Stark
Date: 2023-03

Abstract:
The information about when and where each gene is to be expressed is mainly encoded in the DNA sequence of enhancers, sequence elements that comprise binding sites (motifs) for different transcription factors (TFs). Most of the research on enhancer sequences has been focused on TF motif presence, whereas the enhancer syntax, that is, the flexibility of important motif positions and how the sequence context modulates the activity of TF motifs, remains poorly understood. Here, we explore the rules of enhancer syntax by a two-pronged approach in Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells: we (1) replace important TF motifs by all possible 65,536 eight-nucleotide-long sequences and (2) paste eight important TF motif types into 763 positions within 496 enhancers. These complementary strategies reveal that enhancers display constrained sequence flexibility and the context-specific modulation of motif function. Important motifs can be functionally replaced by hundreds of sequences constituting several distinct motif types, but these are only a fraction of all possible sequences and motif types. Moreover, TF motifs contribute with different intrinsic strengths that are strongly modulated by the enhancer sequence context (the flanking sequence, the presence and diversity of other motif types, and the distance between motifs), such that not all motif types can work in all positions. The context-specific modulation of motif function is also a hallmark of human enhancers, as we demonstrate experimentally. Overall, these two general principles of enhancer sequences are important to understand and predict enhancer function during development, evolution, and in disease.

Abstract:
Enhancers play a crucial role in regulating gene expression and their functional status can be queried with cell type precision using using single-cell (sc)ATAC-seq. To facilitate analysis of such data, we developed Enhlink, a novel computational approach that leverages single-cell signals to infer linkages between regulatory DNA sequences, such as enhancers and promoters. Enhlink uses an ensemble strategy that integrates cell-level technical covariates to control for batch effects and biological covariates to infer robust condition-specific links and their associated p -values. It can integrate simultaneous gene expression and chromatin accessibility measurements of individual cells profiled by multi-omic experiments for increased specificity. We evaluated Enhlink using simulated and real scATAC-seq data, including those paired with physical enhancer-promoter links enumerated by promoter capture Hi-C and with multi-omic scATAC-/RNA-seq data we generated from the mouse striatum. These examples demonstrated that our method outperforms popular alternative strategies. In conjunction with eQTL analysis, Enhlink revealed a putative super-enhancer regulating key cell type-specific markers of striatal neurons. Taken together, our analyses demonstrate that Enhlink is accurate, powerful, and provides features that can lead to novel biological insights.

Title: EPI-DynFusion: enhancer-promoter interaction prediction model based on sequence features and dynamic fusion mechanisms
Authors: Ao Zhang, Jianhua Jia, Mingwei Sun, Xin Wei
Date: 2025-07-23

Abstract:
Enhancer–promoter interactions (EPIs) play a vital role in the regulation of gene expression. Although traditional wet-lab methods provide valuable insights into EPIs, they are often constrained by high costs and limited scalability. As a result, the development of efficient computational models has become essential. However, many current deep learning and machine learning approaches utilize simplistic feature fusion strategies, such as direct averaging or concatenation, which fail to effectively model complex relationships and dynamic importance across features. This often results in suboptimal performance in challenging biological contexts. To address these limitations, we propose a deep learning model named EPI-DynFusion. This model begins by encoding DNA sequences using pre-trained DNA embeddings and extracting local features through convolutional neural networks (CNNs). It then integrates a Transformer and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) architecture with a Dynamic Feature Fusion mechanism to adaptively learn deep dependencies among features. Furthermore, we incorporate the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) to enhance the model’s ability to focus on informative regions. Based on this core architecture, we develop two variants: EPI-DynFusion-gen, a general model, and EPI-DynFusion-best, a fine-tuned version for cell line–specific data. We evaluated the performance of our models across six benchmark cell lines. The average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) scores achieved by the specific, generic, and best models were 94.8%, 95.0%, and 96.2%, respectively. The average area under the precision-recall curve (AUPR) scores were 81.2%, 71.1%, and 83.3%, respectively, demonstrating the superior performance of the fine-tuned model in the precision-recall space. These results confirm that the proposed fusion strategies and attention mechanisms contribute to significant improvements in performance. In conclusion, EPI-DynFusion presents a robust and scalable framework for predicting enhancer–promoter interactions solely based on DNA sequence information. By addressing the limitations of conventional fusion techniques and incorporating attention mechanisms alongside sequence modeling, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while enhancing the interpretability and generalizability of enhancer–promoter interaction prediction tasks.

Title: Decoding Epigenetic Enhancer–Promoter Interactions in Periodontitis via Transformer-GAN: A Deep Learning Framework for Inflammatory Gene Regulation and Biomarker Discovery
Authors: Prabhu Manickam Natarajan, Pradeep Kumar Yadalam
Date: 2025-12

Abstract:
Widespread tissue destruction and dysregulated immune responses are hallmarks of periodontitis, a chronic inflammatory disease. Although enhancer–promoter (E–P) interactions play a crucial role in gene regulation, little is known about how they affect the epigenetic regulation of periodontal inflammation. By combining DNA methylation and gene expression data using a novel deep learning framework, this study sought to decode the E–P regulatory landscape in periodontitis. We examined matched genome-wide DNA methylation ( GSE173081 ) and RNA-seq ( GSE173078 ) datasets with integrated features such as methylation differences, gene expression changes, correlation metrics and genomic distances. A Transformer-GAN forecasted functional E–P interactions by training as a binary classifier to differentiate positive and negative enhancer–promoter pairs. AUC-ROC and AUC-PRC scores were used to benchmark the model’s performance, while functional enrichment and network topology analyses were employed to validate its biological relevance. The Transformer-GAN model outperformed traditional methods, exhibiting strong predictive performance (AUC-ROC = 0.725, AUC-PRC = 0.723). With a mean correlation of 0.62 and a median genomic distance of 45.2 kb, we found 262 significant E–P interactions involving 134 enhancers and 186 target genes. Multiple enhancers controlled central inflammatory genes, such as IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF, creating network hubs enriched in immune pathways, including TNF, NF-κB and IL-17 signalling. Strong correlations were found between enhancer hypomethylation, active histone marks and gene upregulation through integrative multi-omics analysis. Interestingly, E–P interaction scores outperformed clinical indices or gene expression in terms of predicting treatment response (F1-score: 0.82). The diagnostic accuracy of the five CpG biomarkers ranged from 85% to 90%. Our integrative Transformer-GAN approach reveals a complex enhancer–promoter regulatory network underlying inflammatory gene expression in periodontitis. These results reveal new biomarkers and potential treatment targets while highlighting the significance of epigenetic regulation in disease pathogenesis.

Title: Omics Sciences in Regular Physical Activity
Authors: Rosamaria Militello, Simone Luti, Alessandra Modesti
Date: 2025-06-10

Abstract:
The multiple health benefits of regular physical activity are well known and are the results of exercise adaptations. The study of physical training biology is not straightforward since it involves organ crosstalk and depends on numerous variables, such as type of exercise or individual physiology. A multiomic approach allows us to analyze proteins, metabolites, lipids, and epigenetic modifications on a wide scale, so it is a valid tool to identify numerous patterns and clarify how exercise exerts its beneficial effects. Stimuli given by physical activity lead the body to re-establish a new dynamic balance at the level of redox homeostasis and metabolic state. Evaluating the effect of specific training is important for maximizing the beneficial effects of physical activity. In this review we provide a brief overview of different omics technologies used in this field. For each “omics” we analyzed studies published in the last 10 years and highlighted the main molecules identified with that approach. We then described future challenges in their application from the perspective of using new bioinformatics and artificial intelligence tools.

Title: DeepEnhancerPPO: An Interpretable Deep Learning Approach for Enhancer Classification
Authors: Xuechen Mu, Zhenyu Huang, Qiufen Chen, Bocheng Shi, Long Xu, Ying Xu, Kai Zhang
Date: 2024-12-02

Abstract:
Enhancers are short genomic segments located in non-coding regions of the genome that play a critical role in regulating the expression of target genes. Despite their importance in transcriptional regulation, effective methods for classifying enhancer categories and regulatory strengths remain limited. To address this challenge, we propose a novel end-to-end deep learning architecture named DeepEnhancerPPO. The model integrates ResNet and Transformer modules to extract local, hierarchical, and long-range contextual features. Following feature fusion, we employ Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), a reinforcement learning technique, to reduce the dimensionality of the fused features, retaining the most relevant features for downstream classification tasks. We evaluate the performance of DeepEnhancerPPO from multiple perspectives, including ablation analysis, independent tests, assessment of PPO’s contribution to performance enhancement, and interpretability of the classification results. Each module positively contributes to the overall performance, with ResNet and PPO being the most significant contributors. Overall, DeepEnhancerPPO demonstrates superior performance on independent datasets compared to other models, outperforming the second-best model by 6.7% in accuracy for enhancer category classification. The model consistently ranks among the top five classifiers out of 25 for enhancer strength classification without requiring re-optimization of the hyperparameters and ranks as the second-best when the hyperparameters are refined. This indicates that the DeepEnhancerPPO framework is highly robust for enhancer classification. Additionally, the incorporation of PPO enhances the interpretability of the classification results.

Title: iEnhancer-DCSV: Predicting enhancers and their strength based on DenseNet and improved convolutional block attention module
Authors: Jianhua Jia, Rufeng Lei, Lulu Qin, Genqiang Wu, Xin Wei
Date: 2023-03-01

Abstract:
Enhancers play a crucial role in controlling gene transcription and expression. Therefore, bioinformatics puts many emphases on predicting enhancers and their strength. It is vital to create quick and accurate calculating techniques because conventional biomedical tests take too long time and are too expensive. This paper proposed a new predictor called iEnhancer-DCSV built on a modified densely connected convolutional network (DenseNet) and an improved convolutional block attention module (CBAM). Coding was performed using one-hot and nucleotide chemical property (NCP). DenseNet was used to extract advanced features from raw coding. The channel attention and spatial attention modules were used to evaluate the significance of the advanced features and then input into a fully connected neural network to yield the prediction probabilities. Finally, ensemble learning was employed on the final categorization findings via voting. According to the experimental results on the test set, the first layer of enhancer recognition achieved an accuracy of 78.95%, and the Matthews correlation coefficient value was 0.5809. The second layer of enhancer strength prediction achieved an accuracy of 80.70%, and the Matthews correlation coefficient value was 0.6609. The iEnhancer-DCSV method can be found at https://github.com/leirufeng/iEnhancer-DCSV . It is easy to obtain the desired results without using the complex mathematical formulas involved.

Abstract:
Efforts to elucidate the function of enhancers in vivo are underway but their vast numbers alongside differing enhancer architectures make it difficult to determine their impact on gene activity. By systematically annotating multiple mouse tissues with super- and typical-enhancers, we have explored their relationship with gene function and phenotype. Though super-enhancers drive high total- and tissue-specific expression of their associated genes, we find that typical-enhancers also contribute heavily to the tissue-specific expression landscape on account of their large numbers in the genome. Unexpectedly, we demonstrate that both enhancer types are preferentially associated with relevant ‘tissue-type’ phenotypes and exhibit no difference in phenotype effect size or pleiotropy. Modelling regulatory data alongside molecular data, we built a predictive model to infer gene-phenotype associations and use this model to predict potentially novel disease-associated genes. Overall our findings reveal that differing enhancer architectures have a similar impact on mammalian phenotypes whilst harbouring differing cellular and expression effects. Together, our results systematically characterise enhancers with predicted phenotypic traits endorsing the role for both types of enhancers in human disease and disorders.

Title: Utilizing a deep learning model based on BERT for identifying enhancers and their strength
Authors: Tong Wang, Mengqi Gao
Date: 2025-04-09

Abstract:
An enhancer is a specific DNA sequence typically located within a gene at upstream or downstream position and serves as a pivotal element in the regulation of eukaryotic gene transcription. Therefore, the recognition of enhancers is highly significant for comprehending gene expression regulatory systems. While some useful predictive models have been proposed, there are still deficiencies in these models. To address current limitations, we propose a model, DNABERT2-Enhancer, based on transformer architecture and deep learning, designed for the recognition of enhancers (classified as either enhancer or non-enhancer) and the identification of their activity (strong or weak enhancers). More specifically, DNABERT2-Enhancer is composed of a BERT model for extracting features and a CNN model for enhancers classification. Parameters of the BERT model are initialized by a pre-training DNABERT-2 language model. The enhancer recognition task is then fine-tuned through transfer learning to convert the original sequence into feature vectors. Subsequently, the CNN network is employed to learn the feature vector generated by BERT and produce the prediction results. In comparison with existing predictors utilizing the identical dataset, our approach demonstrates superior performance. This suggests that the model will be a useful instrument for academic research on the enhancer recognition.

Title: Enhancer–silencer transitions in the human genome
Authors: Di Huang, Ivan Ovcharenko
Date: 2022-03

Abstract:
Dual-function regulatory elements (REs), acting as enhancers in some cellular contexts and as silencers in others, have been reported to facilitate the precise gene regulatory response to developmental signals in Drosophila melanogaster . However, with few isolated examples detected, dual-function REs in mammals have yet to be systematically studied. We herein investigated this class of REs in the human genome and profiled their activity across multiple cell types. Focusing on enhancer–silencer transitions specific to the development of T cells, we built an accurate deep learning classifier of REs and identified about 12,000 silencers active in primary peripheral blood T cells that act as enhancers in embryonic stem cells. Compared with regular silencers, these dual-function REs are evolving under stronger purifying selection and are enriched for mutations associated with disease phenotypes and altered gene expression. In addition, they are enriched in the loci of transcriptional regulators, such as transcription factors (TFs) and chromatin remodeling genes. Dual-function REs consist of two intertwined but largely distinct sets of binding sites bound by either activating or repressing TFs, depending on the type of RE function in a given cell line. This indicates the recruitment of different TFs for different regulatory modes and a complex DNA sequence composition of these REs with dual activating and repressive encoding. With an estimated >6% of cell type–specific human silencers acting as dual-function REs, this overlooked class of REs requires a specific investigation on how their inherent functional plasticity might be a contributing factor to human diseases.

Title: Sequence based prediction of enhancer regions from DNA random walk
Authors: Anand Pratap Singh, Sarthak Mishra, Suraiya Jabin
Date: 2018-10-29

Abstract:
Regulatory elements play a critical role in development process of eukaryotic organisms by controlling the spatio-temporal pattern of gene expression. Enhancer is one of these elements which contributes to the regulation of gene expression through chromatin loop or eRNA expression. Experimental identification of a novel enhancer is a costly exercise, due to which there is an interest in computational approaches to predict enhancer regions in a genome. Existing computational approaches to achieve this goal have primarily been based on training of high-throughput data such as transcription factor binding sites (TFBS), DNA methylation, and histone modification marks etc. On the other hand, purely sequence based approaches to predict enhancer regions are promising as they are not biased by the complexity or context specificity of such datasets. In sequence based approaches, machine learning models are either directly trained on sequences or sequence features, to classify sequences as enhancers or non-enhancers. In this paper, we derived statistical and nonlinear dynamic features along with k-mer features from experimentally validated sequences taken from Vista Enhancer Browser through random walk model and applied different machine learning based methods to predict whether an input test sequence is enhancer or not. Experimental results demonstrate the success of proposed model based on Ensemble method with area under curve (AUC) 0.86, 0.89, and 0.87 in B cells, T cells, and Natural killer cells for histone marks dataset.

Abstract:
Recent advancements in genomics, propelled by artificial intelligence, have unlocked unprecedented capabilities in interpreting genomic sequences, mitigating the need for exhaustive experimental analysis of complex, intertwined molecular processes inherent in DNA function. A significant challenge, however, resides in accurately decoding genomic sequences, which inherently involves comprehending rich contextual information dispersed across thousands of nucleotides. To address this need, we introduce GENA language model (GENA-LM), a suite of transformer-based foundational DNA language models capable of handling input lengths up to 36 000 base pairs. Notably, integrating the newly developed recurrent memory mechanism allows these models to process even larger DNA segments. We provide pre-trained versions of GENA-LM, including multispecies and taxon-specific models, demonstrating their capability for fine-tuning and addressing a spectrum of complex biological tasks with modest computational demands. While language models have already achieved significant breakthroughs in protein biology, GENA-LM showcases a similarly promising potential for reshaping the landscape of genomics and multi-omics data analysis. All models are publicly available on GitHub ( https://github.com/AIRI-Institute/GENA_LM ) and on HuggingFace ( https://huggingface.co/AIRI-Institute ). In addition, we provide a web service ( https://dnalm.airi.net/ ) allowing user-friendly DNA annotation with GENA-LM models.

Date: 2025-06-24

Abstract:
Transcription factor (TF) cooperativity plays a critical role in gene regulation. However, the underlying genomic rules remain unclear, calling for scalable methods to characterize the TF binding site (motif) syntax of regulatory elements. Here, we introduce DeepCompARE, a lightweight model paired with an in silico ablation (ISA) framework for genome-wide analysis of regulatory sequences. Our framework enables precise interpretation of the motif syntax governing chromatin accessibility, enhancer activity, and promoter function. We find that most TF motifs are pairwise independent, indicating a default additive behavior of TFs, and define a cooperativity score to quantify deviations from this baseline. This reveals synergy and redundancy as opposite effects along the same cooperative spectrum. TF redundancy is linked to promoter activity and broad expression, whereas TF synergy is associated with enhancer activity, physical interactions, and cell-type specificity. Our framework provides a quantitative model for TF cooperativity, offering new insights into gene regulatory logic.

Title: Design and deep learning of synthetic B-cell-specific promoters
Authors: Zong-Heng Fu, Si-Zhe He, Yi Wu, Guang-Rong Zhao
Date: 2023-11-27

Abstract:
Synthetic biology and deep learning synergistically revolutionize our ability for decoding and recoding DNA regulatory grammar. The B-cell-specific transcriptional regulation is intricate, and unlock the potential of B-cell-specific promoters as synthetic elements is important for B-cell engineering. Here, we designed and pooled synthesized 23 640 B-cell-specific promoters that exhibit larger sequence space, B-cell-specific expression, and enable diverse transcriptional patterns in B-cells. By MPRA (Massively parallel reporter assays), we deciphered the sequence features that regulate promoter transcriptional, including motifs and motif syntax (their combination and distance). Finally, we built and trained a deep learning model capable of predicting the transcriptional strength of the immunoglobulin V gene promoter directly from sequence. Prediction of thousands of promoter variants identified in the global human population shows that polymorphisms in promoters influence the transcription of immunoglobulin V genes, which may contribute to individual differences in adaptive humoral immune responses. Our work helps to decipher the transcription mechanism in immunoglobulin genes and offers thousands of non-similar promoters for B-cell engineering.

Abstract:
The study of transcriptomic and epigenomic variations in neurodegenerative diseases, particularly tauopathies like Pick’s disease (PiD) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD), offers insights into their underlying regulatory mechanisms. Here, we identified critical regulatory changes driving disease progression, revealing potential therapeutic targets. Our comparative analyses uncovered disease-enriched noncoding regions and genome-wide transcription factor (TF) binding differences, linking them to target genes. Notably, we identified a distal human-gained enhancer (HGE) associated with E3 ubiquitin ligase (UBE3A), highlighting disease-specific regulatory alterations. Additionally, fine mapping of AD risk genes uncovered loci enriched in microglial enhancers and accessible in other cell types. Shared and distinct TF binding patterns were observed in neurons and glial cells across PiD and AD. We validated our findings using CRISPR to excise a predicted enhancer region in UBE3A and developed an interactive database, scROAD, to visualize predicted single-cell TF occupancy and regulatory networks.

Abstract:
Regulatory DNA sequences within enhancers and promoters bind transcription factors to encode cell type-specific patterns of gene expression. However, the regulatory effects and programmability of such DNA sequences remain difficult to map or predict because we have lacked scalable methods to precisely edit regulatory DNA and quantify the effects in an endogenous genomic context. Here we present an approach to measure the quantitative effects of hundreds of designed DNA sequence variants on gene expression, by combining pooled CRISPR prime editing with RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization and cell sorting (Variant-FlowFISH). We apply this method to mutagenize and rewrite regulatory DNA sequences in an enhancer and the promoter of PPIF in two immune cell lines. Of 672 variant-cell type pairs, we identify 497 that affect PPIF expression. These variants appear to act through a variety of mechanisms including disruption or optimization of existing transcription factor binding sites, as well as creation of de novo sites. Disrupting a single endogenous transcription factor binding site often led to large changes in expression (up to −40% in the enhancer, and −50% in the promoter). The same variant often had different effects across cell types and states, demonstrating a highly tunable regulatory landscape. We use these data to benchmark performance of sequence-based predictive models of gene regulation, and find that certain types of variants are not accurately predicted by existing models. Finally, we computationally design 185 small sequence variants (≤10 bp) and optimize them for specific effects on expression in silico . 84% of these rationally designed edits showed the intended direction of effect, and some had dramatic effects on expression (−100% to +202%). Variant-FlowFISH thus provides a powerful tool to map the effects of variants and transcription factor binding sites on gene expression, test and improve computational models of gene regulation, and reprogram regulatory DNA.

Abstract:
Spatial transcriptomics and epigenomics have enabled mapping gene regulation in the tissue context. However, it remains poorly understood how spatial gene expression patterns are orchestrated by enhancers. Here we build eSpatial, a computational framework that deciphers spatially resolved enhancer regulation of gene expression by integrating spatial profiles of gene expression and chromatin accessibility. Applying eSpatial to diverse spatial datasets, including mouse embryo and brain, as well as human melanoma and breast cancer, we reveal a “spatial enhancer code”, in which divergent combinations of enhancers regulate the same gene in spatially segregated domains. We validate the spatial enhancer code using public spatial datasets such as VISTA, Allen in situ hybridization (ISH), and H3K27ac MERFISH. Moreover, we conduct transgenic reporter assays and in vivo CRISPR/Cas9-mediated perturbation experiments to confirm the Atoh1 spatial enhancer code in determining Atoh1 spatial expression in mouse embryonic spinal cord and brain. Our study establishes the spatial enhancer code concept, revealing how combinations of enhancers dynamically shape gene expression across diverse biological contexts, providing insights into tissue-specific regulatory mechanisms and tumor heterogeneity.

Abstract:
Large-scale sequencing efforts of thousands of tumor samples have been undertaken to understand the mutational landscape of the coding genome. However, the vast majority of germline and somatic variants occur within non-coding portions of the genome. These genomic regions do not directly encode for specific proteins, but can play key roles in cancer progression, for example by driving aberrant gene expression control. Here, we designed an integrative computational and experimental framework to identify recurrently mutated non-coding regulatory regions that drive tumor progression. Application of this approach to whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data from a large cohort of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) revealed a large set of recurrently mutated regions. We used (i) in silico prioritization of functional non-coding mutations, (ii) massively parallel reporter assays, and (iii) in vivo CRISPR-interference (CRISPRi) screens in xenografted mice to systematically identify and validate driver regulatory regions that drive mCRPC. We discovered that one of these enhancer regions, GH22I030351, acts on a bidirectional promoter to simultaneously modulate expression of U2-associated splicing factor SF3A1 and chromosomal protein CCDC157. We found that both SF3A1 and CCDC157 are promoters of tumor growth in xenograft models of prostate cancer. We nominated a number of transcription factors, including SOX6, to be responsible for higher expression of SF3A1 and CCDC157. Collectively, we have established and confirmed an integrative computational and experimental approach that enables the systematic detection of non-coding regulatory regions that drive the progression of human cancers.

Abstract:
The core promoter plays a central role in setting metazoan gene expression levels, but how exactly it “computes” expression remains poorly understood. To dissect its function, we carried out a comprehensive structure–function analysis in Drosophila . First, we performed a genome‐wide bioinformatic analysis, providing an improved picture of the sequence motifs architecture. We then measured synthetic promoters’ activities of ~3,000 mutational variants with and without an external stimulus (hormonal activation), at large scale and with high accuracy using robotics and a dual luciferase reporter assay. We observed a strong impact on activity of the different types of mutations, including knockout of individual sequence motifs and motif combinations, variations of motif strength, nucleosome positioning, and flanking sequences. A linear combination of the individual motif features largely accounts for the combinatorial effects on core promoter activity. These findings shed new light on the quantitative assessment of gene expression in metazoans.

Date: 2024-01

Abstract:
With the development of sequencing technology and the dramatic drop in sequencing cost, the functions of noncoding genes are being characterized in a wide variety of fields (e.g. biomedicine). Enhancers are noncoding DNA elements with vital transcription regulation functions. Tens of thousands of enhancers have been identified in the human genome; however, the location, function, target genes and regulatory mechanisms of most enhancers have not been elucidated thus far. As high-throughput sequencing techniques have leapt forwards, omics approaches have been extensively employed in enhancer research. Multidimensional genomic data integration enables the full exploration of the data and provides novel perspectives for screening, identification and characterization of the function and regulatory mechanisms of unknown enhancers. However, multidimensional genomic data are still difficult to integrate genome wide due to complex varieties, massive amounts, high rarity, etc. To facilitate the appropriate methods for studying enhancers with high efficacy, we delineate the principles, data processing modes and progress of various omics approaches to study enhancers and summarize the applications of traditional machine learning and deep learning in multi-omics integration in the enhancer field. In addition, the challenges encountered during the integration of multiple omics data are addressed. Overall, this review provides a comprehensive foundation for enhancer analysis.

Abstract:
Divergent transcription from promoters and enhancers is pervasive in many species, but it remains unclear if it is a general feature of all eukaryotic cis regulatory elements. To address this, here we define cis regulatory elements in C. elegans , D. melanogaster and H. sapiens and investigate the determinants of their transcription directionality. In all three species, we find that divergent transcription is initiated from two separate core promoter sequences and promoter regions display competition between histone modifications on the + 1 and −1 nucleosomes. In contrast, promoter directionality, sequence composition surrounding promoters, and positional enrichment of chromatin states, are different across species. Integrative models of H3K4me3 levels and core promoter sequence are highly predictive of promoter and enhancer directionality and support two directional classes, skewed and balanced. The relative importance of features to these models are clearly distinct for promoters and enhancers. Differences in regulatory architecture within and between metazoans are therefore abundant, arguing against a unified eukaryotic model.

Abstract:
Almost all regulation of gene expression in eukaryotic genomes is mediated by the action of distant non-coding transcriptional enhancers upon proximal gene promoters. Enhancer locations cannot be accurately predicted bioinformatically because of the absence of a defined sequence code, and thus functional assays are required for their direct detection. Here we used a massively parallel reporter assay, Self-Transcribing Active Regulatory Region sequencing (STARR-seq), to generate the first comprehensive genome-wide map of enhancers in Anopheles coluzzii , a major African malaria vector in the Gambiae species complex. The screen was carried out by transfecting reporter libraries created from the genomic DNA of 60 wild A. coluzzii from Burkina Faso into A. coluzzii 4a3A cells, in order to functionally query enhancer activity of the natural population within the homologous cellular context. We report a catalog of 3,288 active genomic enhancers that were significant across three biological replicates, 74% of them located in intergenic and intronic regions. The STARR-seq enhancer screen is chromatin-free and thus detects inherent activity of a comprehensive catalog of enhancers that may be restricted in vivo to specific cell types or developmental stages. Testing of a validation panel of enhancer candidates using manual luciferase assays confirmed enhancer function in 26 of 28 (93%) of the candidates over a wide dynamic range of activity from two to at least 16-fold activity above baseline. The enhancers occupy only 0.7% of the genome, and display distinct composition features. The enhancer compartment is significantly enriched for 15 transcription factor binding site signatures, and displays divergence for specific dinucleotide repeats, as compared to matched non-enhancer genomic controls. The genome-wide catalog of A. coluzzii enhancers is publicly available in a simple searchable graphic format. This enhancer catalogue will be valuable in linking genetic and phenotypic variation, in identifying regulatory elements that could be employed in vector manipulation, and in better targeting of chromosome editing to minimize extraneous regulation influences on the introduced sequences.  Importance: Understanding the role of the non-coding regulatory genome in complex disease phenotypes is essential, but even in well-characterized model organisms, identification of regulatory regions within the vast non-coding genome remains a challenge. We used a large-scale assay to generate a genome wide map of transcriptional enhancers. Such a catalogue for the important malaria vector, Anopheles coluzzii , will be an important research tool as the role of non-coding regulatory variation in differential susceptibility to malaria infection is explored and as a public resource for research on this important insect vector of disease.

Abstract:
The switch/sucrose non-fermentable (SWI/SNF) complex has a crucial role in chromatin remodelling 1 and is altered in over 20% of cancers 2 , 3 . Here we developed a proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) degrader of the SWI/SNF ATPase subunits, SMARCA2 and SMARCA4, called AU-15330. Androgen receptor (AR) + forkhead box A1 (FOXA1) + prostate cancer cells are exquisitely sensitive to dual SMARCA2 and SMARCA4 degradation relative to normal and other cancer cell lines. SWI/SNF ATPase degradation rapidly compacts cis -regulatory elements bound by transcription factors that drive prostate cancer cell proliferation, namely AR, FOXA1, ERG and MYC, which dislodges them from chromatin, disables their core enhancer circuitry, and abolishes the downstream oncogenic gene programs. SWI/SNF ATPase degradation also disrupts super-enhancer and promoter looping interactions that wire supra-physiologic expression of the AR , FOXA1 and MYC oncogenes themselves. AU-15330 induces potent inhibition of tumour growth in xenograft models of prostate cancer and synergizes with the AR antagonist enzalutamide, even inducing disease remission in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) models without toxicity. Thus, impeding SWI/SNF-mediated enhancer accessibility represents a promising therapeutic approach for enhancer-addicted cancers.

Title: GEEES: inferring cell-specific gene–enhancer interactions from multi-modal single-cell data
Authors: Shuyang Chen, Sündüz Keleş
Date: 2024-11

Abstract:
Gene–enhancer interactions are central to transcriptional regulation. Current multi-modal single-cell datasets that profile transcriptome and chromatin accessibility simultaneously in a single cell are yielding opportunities to infer gene–enhancer associations in a cell type specific manner. Computational efforts for such multi-modal single-cell datasets thus far focused on methods for identification and refinement of cell types and trajectory construction. While initial attempts for inferring gene–enhancer interactions have emerged, these have not been evaluated against benchmark datasets that materialized from bulk genomic experiments. Furthermore, existing approaches are limited to inferring gene–enhancer associations at the level of grouped cells as opposed to individual cells, thereby ignoring regulatory heterogeneity among the cells. We present a new approach, GEEES for “ G ene E nhanc E r Int E ractions from Multi-modal S ingle Cell Data,” for inferring gene–enhancer associations at the single-cell level using multi-modal single-cell transcriptome and chromatin accessibility data. We evaluated GEEES alongside several multivariate regression-based alternatives we devised and state-of-the-art methods using a large number of benchmark datasets, providing a comprehensive assessment of current approaches. This analysis revealed significant discrepancies between gold-standard interactions and gene–enhancer associations derived from multi-modal single-cell data. Notably, incorporating gene–enhancer distance into the analysis markedly improved performance across all methods, positioning GEEES as a leading approach in this domain. While the overall improvement in performance metrics by GEEES is modest, it provides enhanced cell representation learning which can be leveraged for more effective downstream analysis. Furthermore, our review of existing experimentally driven benchmark datasets uncovers their limited concordance, underscoring the necessity for new high-throughput experiments to validate gene–enhancer interactions inferred from single-cell data.  https://github.com/keleslab/GEEES .

Abstract:
Epigenomic dysregulation has been linked to solid tumour malignancies, including ovarian cancers. Profiling of re-programmed enhancer locations associated with disease has the potential to improve stratification and thus therapeutic choices. Ovarian cancers are subdivided into histological subtypes that have significant molecular and clinical differences, with high-grade serous carcinoma representing the most common and aggressive subtype. We interrogated the enhancer landscape(s) of normal ovary and subtype-specific ovarian cancer states using publicly available data. With an initial focus on H3K27ac histone mark, we developed a computational pipeline to predict drug compound activity based on epigenomic stratification. Lastly, we substantiated our predictions in vitro using patient-derived clinical samples and cell lines. Using our in silico approach, we highlighted recurrent and privative enhancer landscapes and identified the differential enrichment of a total of 164 transcription factors involved in 201 protein complexes across the subtypes. We pinpointed SNS-032 and EHMT2 inhibitors BIX-01294 and UNC0646 as therapeutic candidates in high-grade serous carcinoma, as well as probed the efficacy of specific inhibitors in vitro. Here, we report the first attempt to exploit ovarian cancer epigenomic landscapes for drug discovery. This computational pipeline holds enormous potential for translating epigenomic profiling into therapeutic leads.

Abstract:
We demonstrate a high-accuracy method for predicting enhancers genome-wide with >85% precision as validated by transgenic reporter assays in Drosophila embryos. This accuracy in a metazoan system enables us to predict with high confidence 1,640 enhancers genome-wide that participate in body segmentation during early development. The predicted enhancers are demarcated by heterogeneous collections of epigenetic marks; many strong enhancers are free from classic indicators of activity, including H3K27ac, but are bound by key transcription factors.

Title: DNA sequence analysis landscape: a comprehensive review of DNA sequence analysis task types, databases, datasets, word embedding methods, and language models
Authors: Muhammad Nabeel Asim, Muhammad Ali Ibrahim, Arooj Zaib, Andreas Dengel
Date: 2025-04-08

Abstract:
Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) serves as fundamental genetic blueprint that governs development, functioning, growth, and reproduction of all living organisms. DNA can be altered through germline and somatic mutations. Germline mutations underlie hereditary conditions, while somatic mutations can be induced by various factors including environmental influences, chemicals, lifestyle choices, and errors in DNA replication and repair mechanisms which can lead to cancer. DNA sequence analysis plays a pivotal role in uncovering the intricate information embedded within an organism's genetic blueprint and understanding the factors that can modify it. This analysis helps in early detection of genetic diseases and the design of targeted therapies. Traditional wet-lab experimental DNA sequence analysis through traditional wet-lab experimental methods is costly, time-consuming, and prone to errors. To accelerate large-scale DNA sequence analysis, researchers are developing AI applications that complement wet-lab experimental methods. These AI approaches can help generate hypotheses, prioritize experiments, and interpret results by identifying patterns in large genomic datasets. Effective integration of AI methods with experimental validation requires scientists to understand both fields. Considering the need of a comprehensive literature that bridges the gap between both fields, contributions of this paper are manifold: It presents diverse range of DNA sequence analysis tasks and AI methodologies. It equips AI researchers with essential biological knowledge of 44 distinct DNA sequence analysis tasks and aligns these tasks with 3 distinct AI-paradigms, namely, classification, regression, and clustering. It streamlines the integration of AI into DNA sequence analysis tasks by consolidating information of 36 diverse biological databases that can be used to develop benchmark datasets for 44 different DNA sequence analysis tasks. To ensure performance comparisons between new and existing AI predictors, it provides insights into 140 benchmark datasets related to 44 distinct DNA sequence analysis tasks. It presents word embeddings and language models applications across 44 distinct DNA sequence analysis tasks. It streamlines the development of new predictors by providing a comprehensive survey of 39 word embeddings and 67 language models based predictive pipeline performance values as well as top performing traditional sequence encoding-based predictors and their performances across 44 DNA sequence analysis tasks.

Abstract:
The dynamic three-dimensional (3D) organization of the human genome (the “4D Nucleome”) is closely linked to genome function. Here, we integrate a wide variety of genomic data generated by the 4D Nucleome Project to provide a detailed view of human 3D genome organization in widely used embryonic stem cells (H1-hESCs) and immortalized fibroblasts (HFFc6). We provide extensive benchmarking of 3D genome mapping assays and integrate these diverse datasets to annotate spatial genomic features across scales. The data reveal a rich complexity of chromatin domains and their sub-nuclear positions, and over one hundred thousand structural loops and promoter-enhancer interactions. We developed 3D models of population-based and individual cell-to-cell variation in genome structure, establishing connections between chromosome folding, nuclear organization, chromatin looping, gene transcription, and DNA replication. We demonstrate the use of computational methods to predict genome folding from DNA sequence, uncovering potential effects of genetic variants on genome structure and function. Together, this comprehensive analysis contributes insights into human genome organization and enhances our understanding of connections between the regulation of genome function and 3D genome organization in general.

Title: Function and Constraint in Enhancer Sequences with Multiple Evolutionary Origins
Authors: Sarah L Fong, John A Capra
Date: 2022-11

Abstract:
Thousands of human gene regulatory enhancers are composed of sequences with multiple evolutionary origins. These evolutionarily “complex” enhancers consist of older “core” sequences and younger “derived” sequences. However, the functional relationship between the sequences of different evolutionary origins within complex enhancers is poorly understood. We evaluated the function, selective pressures, and sequence variation across core and derived components of human complex enhancers. We find that both components are older than expected from the genomic background, and complex enhancers are enriched for core and derived sequences of similar evolutionary ages. Both components show strong evidence of biochemical activity in massively parallel report assays. However, core and derived sequences have distinct transcription factor (TF)-binding preferences that are largely similar across evolutionary origins. As expected, given these signatures of function, both core and derived sequences have substantial evidence of purifying selection. Nonetheless, derived sequences exhibit weaker purifying selection than adjacent cores. Derived sequences also tolerate more common genetic variation and are enriched compared with cores for expression quantitative trait loci associated with gene expression variability in human populations. In conclusion, both core and derived sequences have strong evidence of gene regulatory function, but derived sequences have distinct constraint profiles, TF-binding preferences, and tolerance to variation compared with cores. We propose that the step-wise integration of younger derived with older core sequences has generated regulatory substrates with robust activity and the potential for functional variation. Our analyses demonstrate that synthesizing study of enhancer evolution and function can aid interpretation of regulatory sequence activity and functional variation across human populations.

Abstract:
The genetic basis of human facial variation and craniofacial birth defects remains poorly understood. Distant-acting transcriptional enhancers control the fine-tuned spatiotemporal expression of genes during critical stages of craniofacial development. However, a lack of accurate maps of the genomic locations and cell type-resolved activities of craniofacial enhancers prevents their systematic exploration in human genetics studies. Here, we combine histone modification, chromatin accessibility, and gene expression profiling of human craniofacial development with single-cell analyses of the developing mouse face to define the regulatory landscape of facial development at tissue- and single cell-resolution. We provide temporal activity profiles for 14,000 human developmental craniofacial enhancers. We find that 56% of human craniofacial enhancers share chromatin accessibility in the mouse and we provide cell population- and embryonic stage-resolved predictions of their in vivo activity. Taken together, our data provide an expansive resource for genetic and developmental studies of human craniofacial development.

Title: From Genotype to Phenotype: How Enhancers Control Gene Expression and Cell Identity in Hematopoiesis
Authors: Roger Mulet-Lazaro, Ruud Delwel
Date: 2023-11

Abstract:
Blood comprises a wide array of specialized cells, all of which share the same genetic information and ultimately derive from the same precursor, the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC). This diversity of phenotypes is underpinned by unique transcriptional programs gradually acquired in the process known as hematopoiesis. Spatiotemporal regulation of gene expression depends on many factors, but critical among them are enhancers—sequences of DNA that bind transcription factors and increase transcription of genes under their control. Thus, hematopoiesis involves the activation of specific enhancer repertoires in HSCs and their progeny, driving the expression of sets of genes that collectively determine morphology and function. Disruption of this tightly regulated process can have catastrophic consequences: in hematopoietic malignancies, dysregulation of transcriptional control by enhancers leads to misexpression of oncogenes that ultimately drive transformation. This review attempts to provide a basic understanding of enhancers and their role in transcriptional regulation, with a focus on normal and malignant hematopoiesis. We present examples of enhancers controlling master regulators of hematopoiesis and discuss the main mechanisms leading to enhancer dysregulation in leukemia and lymphoma.

Title: Gapped-kmer sequence modeling robustly identifies regulatory vocabularies and distal enhancers conserved between evolutionarily distant mammals
Authors: Jin Woo Oh, Michael A. Beer
Date: 2024-07-31

Abstract:
Gene regulatory elements drive complex biological phenomena and their mutations are associated with common human diseases. The impacts of human regulatory variants are often tested using model organisms such as mice. However, mapping human enhancers to conserved elements in mice remains a challenge, due to both rapid enhancer evolution and limitations of current computational methods. We analyze distal enhancers across 45 matched human/mouse cell/tissue pairs from a comprehensive dataset of DNase-seq experiments, and show that while cell-specific regulatory vocabulary is conserved, enhancers evolve more rapidly than promoters and CTCF binding sites. Enhancer conservation rates vary across cell types, in part explainable by tissue specific transposable element activity. We present an improved genome alignment algorithm using gapped-kmer features, called gkm-align , and make genome wide predictions for 1,401,803 orthologous regulatory elements. We show that gkm-align discovers 23,660 novel human/mouse conserved enhancers missed by previous algorithms, with strong evidence of conserved functional activity.

Authors: Florian Noack, Silvia Vangelisti, Gerald Raffl, Madalena Carido, Jeisimhan Diwakar, Faye Chong, Boyan Bonev
Date: 2022-02-07

Abstract:
How multiple epigenetic layers and transcription factors (TFs) interact to facilitate brain development is largely unknown. Here, to systematically map the regulatory landscape of neural differentiation in the mouse neocortex, we profiled gene expression and chromatin accessibility in single cells and integrated these data with measurements of enhancer activity, DNA methylation and three-dimensional genome architecture in purified cell populations. This allowed us to identify thousands of new enhancers, their predicted target genes and the temporal relationships between enhancer activation, epigenome remodeling and gene expression. We characterize specific neuronal transcription factors associated with extensive and frequently coordinated changes across multiple epigenetic modalities. In addition, we functionally demonstrate a new role for Neurog2 in directly mediating enhancer activity, DNA demethylation, increasing chromatin accessibility and facilitating chromatin looping in vivo. Our work provides a global view of the gene regulatory logic of lineage specification in the cerebral cortex.

Abstract:
Gene therapy is a promising approach to the treatment of various inherited diseases, but its development is complicated by a number of limitations of the natural promoters used. The currently used strong ubiquitous natural promoters do not allow for the specificity of expression, while natural tissue-specific promoters have lowactivity. These limitations of natural promoters can be addressed by creating new synthetic promoters that achieve high levels of tissue-specific target gene expression. This review discusses recent advances in the development of synthetic promoters that provide a more precise regulation of gene expression. Approaches to the design of synthetic promoters are reviewed, including manual design and bioinformatic methods using machine learning. Examples of successful applications of synthetic promoters in the therapy of hereditary diseases and cancer are presented, as well as prospects for their clinical use.

Abstract:
Enhancers are a class
of noncoding DNA, serving as crucial regulatory
elements in governing gene expression by binding to transcription
factors. The identification of enhancers holds paramount importance
in the field of biology. However, traditional experimental methods
for enhancer identification demand substantial human and material
resources. Consequently, there is a growing interest in employing
computational methods for enhancer prediction. In this study, we propose
a two-stage framework based on deep learning, termed CapsEnhancer,
for the identification of enhancers and their strengths. CapsEnhancer
utilizes chaos game representation to encode DNA sequences into unique
images and employs a capsule network to extract local and global features
from sequence “images”. Experimental results demonstrate
that CapsEnhancer achieves state-of-the-art performance in both stages.
In the first and second stages, the accuracy surpasses the previous
best methods by 8 and 3.5%, reaching accuracies of 94.5 and 95%, respectively.
Notably, this study represents the pioneering application of computer
vision methods to enhancer identification tasks. Our work not only
contributes novel insights to enhancer identification but also provides
a fresh perspective for other biological sequence analysis tasks.

Title: Comparative Analysis of Deep Learning Models for Predicting Causative Regulatory Variants
Authors: Gaetano Manzo, Kathryn Borkowski, Ivan Ovcharenko
Date: 2025-10-15

Abstract:
Background/Objective: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have linked many noncoding variants to complex traits and diseases, but distinguishing as-sociation from causation remains difficult. Deep learning models—particularly CNN- and Transformer-based architectures—are widely used for this task, yet comparisons are hindered by inconsistent benchmarks and evaluation practices. We aimed to establish a standardized assessment of leading models for predicting variant effects in enhancers and for prioritizing putative causal SNPs. Methods: We evaluated state-of-the-art deep learning models under consistent training and evaluation conditions on nine datasets derived from MPRA, raQTL, and eQTL ex-periments. These datasets profile the regulatory impact of 54,859 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across four human cell lines. Performance was compared for two related tasks: predicting the direction and magnitude of regulatory impact in enhancers and identifying likely causal SNPs within linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocks. We addi-tionally assessed the effect of fine-tuning on Transformer-based models and the impact of certainty in experimental results. Results: CNN models such as TREDNet and SEI performed best for predicting the reg-ulatory impact of SNPs in enhancers. Hybrid CNN–Transformer models (e.g., Borzoi) performed best for causal variant prioritization within LD blocks. Fine-tuning benefits Transformers but remains insufficient to close the performance gap. Conclusions: Under a unified benchmark, CNN architectures are most reliable for esti-mating enhancer regulatory effects of SNPs, while hybrid CNN–Transformer models are superior for causal SNP identification within LD. These comparisons help guide model selection for variant-effect prediction in noncoding regions.

Abstract:
Sequence-to-function models can predict gene expression from sequence data and be used to link genetic information with transcriptomics data to understand regulatory processes and their effects on complex phenotypes. The genomic language models are pre-trained with large-scale DNA sequences and can generate robust representations of these sequences by learning the genomic context. However, few studies can estimate the predictability of gene expression levels and bridge these two classes of models together to explore individualized gene expression prediction. In this manuscript, we propose UKBioBERT as a DNA language model pre-trained with genetic variants from UK BioBank. We demonstrate that UKBioBERT generates informative embeddings capable of identifying gene functions, and improving gene expression prediction in cell lines, thereby enhancing our understanding of gene expression predictability. Building upon these embeddings, we combine UKBioBERT with state-of-the-art sequence-to-function architectures, Enformer and Borzoi, to create UKBioFormer and UKBioZoi. These models exhibit better performance in predicting highly predictable gene expression levels and can be generalized across different cohorts. Furthermore, UKBioFormer effectively captures the relationship between genetic variants and expression variations, enabling in-silico mutation analyses and eQTL identification. Collectively, our findings underscore the value of integrating genomic language models and sequence-to-function approaches for advancing functional genomics research.

Title: Advances and Mechanisms of RNA–Ligand Interaction Predictions
Authors: Chen Zhuo, Chengwei Zeng, Haoquan Liu, Huiwen Wang, Yunhui Peng, Yunjie Zhao
Date: 2025-01-15

Abstract:
The diversity and complexity of RNA include sequence, secondary structure, and tertiary structure characteristics. These elements are crucial for RNA’s specific recognition of other molecules. With advancements in biotechnology, RNA–ligand structures allow researchers to utilize experimental data to uncover the mechanisms of complex interactions. However, determining the structures of these complexes experimentally can be technically challenging and often results in low-resolution data. Many machine learning computational approaches have recently emerged to learn multiscale-level RNA features to predict the interactions. Predicting interactions remains an unexplored area. Therefore, studying RNA–ligand interactions is essential for understanding biological processes. In this review, we analyze the interaction characteristics of RNA–ligand complexes by examining RNA’s sequence, secondary structure, and tertiary structure. Our goal is to clarify how RNA specifically recognizes ligands. Additionally, we systematically discuss advancements in computational methods for predicting interactions and to guide future research directions. We aim to inspire the creation of more reliable RNA–ligand interaction prediction tools.

Title: Automatic discovery of cross-family sequence features associated with protein function
Authors: Markus Brameier, Josien Haan, Andrea Krings , Robert M MacCallum
Date: 2006

Abstract:
Methods for predicting protein function directly from amino acid sequences are useful tools in the study of uncharacterised protein families and in comparative genomics. Until now, this problem has been approached using machine learning techniques that attempt to predict membership, or otherwise, to predefined functional categories or subcellular locations. A potential drawback of this approach is that the human-designated functional classes may not accurately reflect the underlying biology, and consequently important sequence-to-function relationships may be missed. We show that a self-supervised data mining approach is able to find relationships between sequence features and functional annotations. No preconceived ideas about functional categories are required, and the training data is simply a set of protein sequences and their UniProt/Swiss-Prot annotations. The main technical aspect of the approach is the co-evolution of amino acid-based regular expressions and keyword-based logical expressions with genetic programming. Our experiments on a strictly non-redundant set of eukaryotic proteins reveal that the strongest and most easily detected sequence-to-function relationships are concerned with targeting to various cellular compartments, which is an area already well studied both experimentally and computationally. Of more interest are a number of broad functional roles which can also be correlated with sequence features. These include inhibition, biosynthesis, transcription and defence against bacteria. Despite substantial overlaps between these functions and their corresponding cellular compartments, we find clear differences in the sequence motifs used to predict some of these functions. For example, the presence of polyglutamine repeats appears to be linked more strongly to the "transcription" function than to the general "nuclear" function/location. We have developed a novel and useful approach for knowledge discovery in annotated sequence data. The technique is able to identify functionally important sequence features and does not require expert knowledge. By viewing protein function from a sequence perspective, the approach is also suitable for discovering unexpected links between biological processes, such as the recently discovered role of ubiquitination in transcription.

Title: Generative and predictive neural networks for the design of functional RNA molecules
Authors: Aidan T. Riley, James M. Robson, Alexander A. Green
Date: 2023-07-14

Abstract:
RNA is a remarkably versatile molecule that has been engineered for applications in therapeutics, diagnostics, and in vivo information-processing systems. However, the complex relationship between the sequence and structural properties of an RNA molecule and its ability to perform specific functions often necessitates extensive experimental screening of candidate sequences. Here we present a generalized neural network architecture that utilizes the s equence and s tructure o f R NA m olecules (SANDSTORM) to inform functional predictions. We demonstrate that this approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across several distinct RNA prediction tasks, while learning interpretable abstractions of RNA secondary structure. We paired these predictive models with g enerative a dversarial R NA d esign n etworks (GARDN), allowing the generative modelling of novel mRNA 5’ untranslated regions and toehold switch riboregulators exhibiting a predetermined fitness. This approach enabled the design of novel toehold switches with a 43-fold increase in experimentally characterized dynamic range compared to those designed using classic thermodynamic algorithms. SANDSTORM and GARDN thus represent powerful new predictive and generative tools for the development of diagnostic and therapeutic RNA molecules with improved function.

Title: Is Genetic Engineering a Route to Enhance Microalgae-Mediated Bioremediation of Heavy Metal-Containing Effluents?
Authors: Saeed Ranjbar, Francisco Xavier Malcata
Date: 2022-02-22

Abstract:
Contamination of the biosphere by heavy metals has been rising, due to accelerated anthropogenic activities, and is nowadays, a matter of serious global concern. Removal of such inorganic pollutants from aquatic environments via biological processes has earned great popularity, for its cost-effectiveness and high efficiency, compared to conventional physicochemical methods. Among candidate organisms, microalgae offer several competitive advantages; phycoremediation has even been claimed as the next generation of wastewater treatment technologies. Furthermore, integration of microalgae-mediated wastewater treatment and bioenergy production adds favorably to the economic feasibility of the former process—with energy security coming along with environmental sustainability. However, poor biomass productivity under abiotic stress conditions has hindered the large-scale deployment of microalgae. Recent advances encompassing molecular tools for genome editing, together with the advent of multiomics technologies and computational approaches, have permitted the design of tailor-made microalgal cell factories, which encompass multiple beneficial traits, while circumventing those associated with the bioaccumulation of unfavorable chemicals. Previous studies unfolded several routes through which genetic engineering-mediated improvements appear feasible (encompassing sequestration/uptake capacity and specificity for heavy metals); they can be categorized as metal transportation, chelation, or biotransformation, with regulation of metal- and oxidative stress response, as well as cell surface engineering playing a crucial role therein. This review covers the state-of-the-art metal stress mitigation mechanisms prevalent in microalgae, and discusses putative and tested metabolic engineering approaches, aimed at further improvement of those biological processes. Finally, current research gaps and future prospects arising from use of transgenic microalgae for heavy metal phycoremediation are reviewed.

Date: 2021-05-07

Abstract:
Synthetic biology offers new tools and capabilities of engineering cells with desired functions for example as new biosensing platforms leveraging engineered microbes. In the last two decades, bacterial cells have been programmed to sense and respond to various input cues for versatile purposes including environmental monitoring, disease diagnosis and adaptive biomanufacturing. Despite demonstrated proof‐of‐concept success in the laboratory, the real‐world applications of microbial sensors have been restricted due to certain technical and societal limitations. Yet, most limitations can be addressed by new technological developments in synthetic biology such as circuit design, biocontainment and machine learning. Here, we summarize the latest advances in synthetic biology and discuss how they could accelerate the development, enhance the performance and address the present limitations of microbial sensors to facilitate their use in the field. We view that programmable living sensors are promising sensing platforms to achieve sustainable, affordable and easy‐to‐use on‐site detection in diverse settings.

Title: An intrinsically interpretable neural network architecture for sequence-to-function learning
Authors: Ali Tuğrul Balcı, Mark Maher Ebeid, Panayiotis V Benos, Dennis Kostka, Maria Chikina
Date: 2023-06

Abstract:
Sequence-based deep learning approaches have been shown to predict a multitude of functional genomic readouts, including regions of open chromatin and RNA expression of genes. However, a major limitation of current methods is that model interpretation relies on computationally demanding post hoc analyses, and even then, one can often not explain the internal mechanics of highly parameterized models. Here, we introduce a deep learning architecture called totally interpretable sequence-to-function model (tiSFM). tiSFM improves upon the performance of standard multilayer convolutional models while using fewer parameters. Additionally, while tiSFM is itself technically a multilayer neural network, internal model parameters are intrinsically interpretable in terms of relevant sequence motifs. We analyze published open chromatin measurements across hematopoietic lineage cell-types and demonstrate that tiSFM outperforms a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network model custom-tailored to this dataset. We also show that it correctly identifies context-specific activities of transcription factors with known roles in hematopoietic differentiation, including Pax5 and Ebf1 for B-cells, and Rorc for innate lymphoid cells. tiSFM’s model parameters have biologically meaningful interpretations, and we show the utility of our approach on a complex task of predicting the change in epigenetic state as a function of developmental transition. The source code, including scripts for the analysis of key findings, can be found at https://github.com/boooooogey/ATAConv , implemented in Python.

Abstract:
In the era of the COVID-19 pandemic, the significance
of point-of-care
(POC) diagnostic tools has become increasingly vital, driven by the
need for quick and precise virus identification. RNA-based sensors,
particularly toehold sensors, have emerged as promising candidates
for POC detection systems due to their selectivity and sensitivity.
Toehold sensors operate by employing an RNA switch that changes the
conformation when it binds to a target RNA molecule, resulting in
a detectable signal. This review focuses on the development and deployment
of RNA-based sensors for POC viral RNA detection with a particular
emphasis on toehold sensors. The benefits and limits of toehold sensors
are explored, and obstacles and future directions for improving their
performance within POC detection systems are presented. The use of
RNA-based sensors as a technology for rapid and sensitive detection
of viral RNA holds great potential for effectively managing (dealing/coping)
with present and future pandemics in resource-constrained settings.

Authors: Aidan T. Riley, McKayla Vlasity, Joey Zhuoying Huang, Wyatt M. Becicka, Wilson W. Wong, Mark W. Grinstaff, Alexander A. Green
Date: 2025-06-17

Abstract:
End-to-end, machine-learning based design of mRNA molecules offers a powerful means to tailor their properties for specific tasks. mRNA expression level, immunogenicity, tissue specificity, stability, and localization, among others strongly depend on sequence, thus providing a rich set of properties amenable to optimization. Despite this potential, the various components of mRNA are governed by distinct grammatical and functional rules that hinder the development of a unified algorithmic approach for complete mRNA design. While machine learning and generative AI techniques demonstrate substantial benefits for individual sequence design tasks, adapting these tools to new domains or out-of-distribution tasks remains challenging. In this work, we describe a simple and powerful alteration to integrated gradients ( D esign by I ntegrated G radients- DIGs ) that serves as the foundation for several mRNA design tasks. Using this technique, we demonstrate complete model-informed mRNA design and reveal the underexplored rules governing the assembly of mRNA components into complete, high-performance transcripts. This framework closes the loop on mRNA design by unifying the strengths of predictive neural networks with the vast quantities of diverse RNA data that has been accumulating for decades across transcriptomic profiling, CLIP-seq, and individual experimental findings. By linking the benefits of neural network-based design with diverse alternative datasets, we demonstrate the design of complete mRNA sequences in out-of-distribution settings that exhibit dramatically improved translational capacity, enhanced cell-type-specific expression, and improved stability.

Title: Uncovering the Mechanistic Landscape of Regulatory DNA with Deep Learning
Authors: Evan E. Seitz, David M. McCandlish, Justin B. Kinney, Peter K Koo
Date: 2025-10-08

Abstract:
The regulatory genome encodes the logic that governs gene expression, enabling cells to respond to developmental, environmental, and evolutionary cues. This logic arises from complex cis -regulatory mechanisms that integrate transcription factor motifs, their syntactical arrangement, and surrounding sequence context, features that remain challenging to decode. Here, we present SEAM (Systematic Explanation of Attribution-based Mechanisms), a computational framework that combines deep learning with explainable AI to map the mechanistic impact of genetic mutations. Applied to human and Drosophila regulatory loci, SEAM uncovers functional binding sites at sequences of interest and identifies which mutations preserve, disrupt, or create novel binding sites. SEAM also reveals that two qualitatively distinct classes of regulatory signal are operative at many loci: signals that are robust to mutation and signals that are readily reprogrammable. These results clarify the inherent ability of regulatory DNA to evolve. They also position SEAM as a versatile framework for interpreting non-coding variants and for informing the mechanism-aware design of synthetic sequences.

Title: Toehold-VISTA: A machine learning approach to decipher programmable RNA sensor-target interactions
Authors: James M. Robson, Alexander A. Green
Date: 2025-08-13

Abstract:
RNA-based biosensors have emerged as essential tools in synthetic biology and diagnostics, enabling precise and programmable responses to diverse RNA inputs. However, the time to design, produce, and screen high-performance RNA sensors remains a critical challenge. The fundamental rules governing RNA-RNA interactions—specifically the structure-function relationships that determine sensor performance—remain poorly understood. Here, we present a method enabling versatile in-silico RNA-targeting analysis (VISTA), a machine learning-guided framework for the rapid design of RNA sensors. VISTA integrates biophysical modeling of both sensor and target RNAs with a partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) machine learning framework. Using high-throughput experimental measurements with sequence-structure feature extraction to train predictive models, we capture the key determinants of RNA sensor performance. We find that by using toehold switches as a model RNA sensor, Toehold-VISTA successfully designs RNA sensors with improved function against SARS-CoV-2 RNA. These findings establish a broadly applicable, target-aware design strategy for accelerating RNA sensor engineering across biotechnology and diagnostic applications.

Title: Fine-tuning sequence to function deep learning models on large-scale proteomic data improves the accuracy of variant effect prediction
Authors: Eduarda Vaz, Lena Wang, Jake Galvin, Rebecca Keener, Alexis Battle
Date: 2025-09-27

Abstract:
Fine-tuning sequence to function models has shown promise for variant effect prediction, but accuracy and generalization to unseen genes and unseen individuals remains a standing challenge. We fine-tuned Borzoi on 54,219 individuals and 2,923 circulating plasma proteins from the UK Biobank Plasma Proteomic Project. Across 150 single-gene models where the genes had a range of cis-heritability we observed that the fine-tuned Borzoi model improved variant effect prediction for 86% of the genes compared to an Elastic Net baseline model. We demonstrated that the improved prediction stems from increased sample size which provides tremendous amounts of rare genetic variants (MAF < 0.01) to the training data. Masking rare and uncommon variants nullified improved performance of fine-tuned Borzoi and we showed that fine-tuned Borzoi highly weights rare variants (MAF < 0.01) while the Elastic Net model highly weights common variants (MAF > 0.05) that are enriched for regulatory regions. We evaluated the generalizability of our model on a fine-tuned Borzoi model trained jointly on varying numbers of genes and observed that these models consistently outperform the pre-trained Borzoi model, the single-gene models yield more accurate results. Together this work demonstrates the importance of including larger sample sizes and rare variants in sequence to function models for variant effect prediction and demonstrates feasibility that these models are capable of highly accurate variant effect prediction.

Abstract:
Design of de novo synthetic regulatory DNA is a promising avenue to control gene expression in biotechnology and medicine. Using mutagenesis typically requires screening sizable random DNA libraries, which limits the designs to span merely a short section of the promoter and restricts their control of gene expression. Here, we prototype a deep learning strategy based on generative adversarial networks (GAN) by learning directly from genomic and transcriptomic data. Our ExpressionGAN can traverse the entire regulatory sequence-expression landscape in a gene-specific manner, generating regulatory DNA with prespecified target mRNA levels spanning the whole gene regulatory structure including coding and adjacent non-coding regions. Despite high sequence divergence from natural DNA, in vivo measurements show that 57% of the highly-expressed synthetic sequences surpass the expression levels of highly-expressed natural controls. This demonstrates the applicability and relevance of deep generative design to expand our knowledge and control of gene expression regulation in any desired organism, condition or tissue.

Abstract:
Synthetic biology has a natural synergy with deep learning. It can be used to generate large data sets to train models, for example by using DNA synthesis, and deep learning models can be used to inform design, such as by generating novel parts or suggesting optimal experiments to conduct. Recently, research at the interface of engineering biology and deep learning has highlighted this potential through successes including the design of novel biological parts, protein structure prediction, automated analysis of microscopy data, optimal experimental design, and biomolecular implementations of artificial neural networks. In this review, we present an overview of synthetic biology-relevant classes of data and deep learning architectures. We also highlight emerging studies in synthetic biology that capitalize on deep learning to enable novel understanding and design, and discuss challenges and future opportunities in this space.

Abstract:
Large language models (LLMs) are having transformative impacts across a wide range of scientific fields, particularly in the biomedical sciences. Just as the goal of Natural Language Processing is to understand sequences of words, a major objective in biology is to understand biological sequences. Genomic Language Models (gLMs), which are LLMs trained on DNA sequences, have the potential to significantly advance our understanding of genomes and how DNA elements at various scales interact to give rise to complex functions. To showcase this potential, we highlight key applications of gLMs, including functional constraint prediction, sequence design, and transfer learning. Despite notable recent progress, however, developing effective and efficient gLMs presents numerous challenges, especially for species with large, complex genomes. Here, we discuss major considerations for developing and evaluating gLMs.

Abstract:
 Summary : Predicting how genetic variation affects phenotypic outcomes at the organismal, cellular, and molecular levels requires deciphering the cis-regulatory code, the sequence rules by which non-coding regions regulate genes. In this perspective, we discuss recent computational progress and challenges toward solving this fundamental problem. We describe how cis-regulatory elements are mapped with various genomics assays and how studies of the 3D chromatin organization could help identifying long-range regulatory effects. We discuss how the cis-regulatory sequence rules can be learned and interpreted with sequence-to-function neural networks, with the goal of identifying genetic variants in human disease. We also describe current methods for mapping gene regulatory networks to describe biological processes. We point out current gaps in knowledge along with technical limitations and benchmarking challenges of computational methods. Finally, we discuss newly emerging technologies, such as spatial transcriptomics, and outline strategies for creating a more general model of the cis-regulatory code that is more broadly applicable across cell types and individuals.

Abstract:
Materials in nature have fascinating properties that serve as a continuous source of inspiration for materials scientists. Accordingly, bio-mimetic and bio-inspired approaches have yielded remarkable structural and functional materials for a plethora of applications. Despite these advances, many properties of natural materials remain challenging or yet impossible to incorporate into synthetic materials. Natural materials are produced by living cells, which sense and process environmental cues and conditions by means of signaling and genetic programs, thereby controlling the biosynthesis, remodeling, functionalization, or degradation of the natural material. In this context, synthetic biology offers unique opportunities in materials sciences by providing direct access to the rational engineering of how a cell senses and processes environmental information and translates them into the properties and functions of materials. Here, we identify and review two main directions by which synthetic biology can be harnessed to provide new impulses for the biologization of the materials sciences: first, the engineering of cells to produce precursors for the subsequent synthesis of materials. This includes materials that are otherwise produced from petrochemical resources, but also materials where the bio-produced substances contribute unique properties and functions not existing in traditional materials. Second, engineered living materials that are formed or assembled by cells or in which cells contribute specific functions while remaining an integral part of the living composite material. We finally provide a perspective of future scientific directions of this promising area of research and discuss science policy that would be required to support research and development in this field.

Title: GUANinE v1.0: Benchmark Datasets for Genomic AI Sequence-to-Function Models
Authors: eyes s. robson, Nilah M. Ioannidis
Date: 2024-03-07

Abstract:
Computational genomics increasingly relies on machine learning methods for genome interpretation, and the recent adoption of neural sequence-to-function models highlights the need for rigorous model specification and controlled evaluation, problems familiar to other fields of AI. Research strategies that have greatly benefited other fields — including benchmarking, auditing, and algorithmic fairness — are also needed to advance the field of genomic AI and to facilitate model development. Here we propose a genomic AI benchmark, GUANinE , for evaluating model generalization across a number of distinct genomic tasks. Compared to existing task formulations in computational genomics, GUANinE is large-scale, de-noised, and suitable for evaluating pretrained models. GUANinE v1.0 primarily focuses on functional genomics tasks such as functional element annotation and gene expression prediction, and it also draws upon connections to evolutionary biology through sequence conservation tasks. The current GUANinE tasks provide insight into the performance of existing genomic AI models and non-neural baselines, with opportunities to be refined, revisited, and broadened as the field matures. Finally, the GUANinE benchmark allows us to evaluate new self-supervised T5 models and explore the tradeoffs between tokenization and model performance, while showcasing the potential for self-supervision to complement existing pretraining procedures.

Title: CFSP: a collaborative frequent sequence pattern discovery algorithm for nucleic acid sequence classification
Authors: He Peng
Date: 2020-04-20

Abstract:
Conserved nucleic acid sequences play an essential role in transcriptional regulation. The motifs/templates derived from nucleic acid sequence datasets are usually used as biomarkers to predict biochemical properties such as protein binding sites or to identify specific non-coding RNAs. In many cases, template-based nucleic acid sequence classification performs better than some feature extraction methods, such as N-gram and k-spaced pairs classification. The availability of large-scale experimental data provides an unprecedented opportunity to improve motif extraction methods. The process for pattern extraction from large-scale data is crucial for the creation of predictive models. In this article, a Teiresias-like feature extraction algorithm to discover frequent sub-sequences (CFSP) is proposed. Although gaps are allowed in some motif discovery algorithms, the distance and number of gaps are limited. The proposed algorithm can find frequent sequence pairs with a larger gap. The combinations of frequent sub-sequences in given protracted sequences capture the long-distance correlation, which implies a specific molecular biological property. Hence, the proposed algorithm intends to discover the combinations. A set of frequent sub-sequences derived from nucleic acid sequences with order is used as a base frequent sub-sequence array. The mutation information is attached to each sub-sequence array to implement fuzzy matching. Thus, a mutate records a single nucleotide variant or nucleotides insertion/deletion (indel) to encode a slight difference between frequent sequences and a matched subsequence of a sequence under investigation. The proposed algorithm has been validated with several nucleic acid sequence prediction case studies. These data demonstrate better results than the recently available feature descriptors based methods based on experimental data sets such as miRNA, piRNA, and Sigma 54 promoters. CFSP is implemented in C++ and shell script; the source code and related data are available at https://github.com/HePeng2016/CFSP .

Title: Characterization of sequence determinants of enhancer function using natural genetic variation
Authors: Marty G Yang, Emi Ling, Christopher J Cowley, Michael E Greenberg, Thomas Vierbuchen, Stephen CJ Parker
Date: 2022-08-31

Abstract:
Sequence variation in enhancers that control cell-type-specific gene transcription contributes significantly to phenotypic variation within human populations. However, it remains difficult to predict precisely the effect of any given sequence variant on enhancer function due to the complexity of DNA sequence motifs that determine transcription factor (TF) binding to enhancers in their native genomic context. Using F 1 -hybrid cells derived from crosses between distantly related inbred strains of mice, we identified thousands of enhancers with allele-specific TF binding and/or activity. We find that genetic variants located within the central region of enhancers are most likely to alter TF binding and enhancer activity. We observe that the AP-1 family of TFs (Fos/Jun) are frequently required for binding of TEAD TFs and for enhancer function. However, many sequence variants outside of core motifs for AP-1 and TEAD also impact enhancer function, including sequences flanking core TF motifs and AP-1 half sites. Taken together, these data represent one of the most comprehensive assessments of allele-specific TF binding and enhancer function to date and reveal how sequence changes at enhancers alter their function across evolutionary timescales.

We pair these predictive models with g enerative a dversarial R NA d esign n etworks (GARDN), allowing the generative modelling of a diverse range of functional RNA molecules with targeted experimental attributes. This approach enables the design of novel sequence candidates that outperform those encountered during training or returned by classical thermodynamic algorithms, and can be deployed using as few as 384 example sequences. SANDSTORM and GARDN thus represent powerful new predictive and generative tools for the development of RNA molecules with improved function.

Title: DNALONGBENCH: a benchmark suite for long-range DNA prediction tasks
Authors: Wenduo Cheng, Zhenqiao Song, Yang Zhang, Shike Wang, Danqing Wang, Muyu Yang, Lei Li, Jian Ma
Date: 2025-11-18

Abstract:
Modeling long-range DNA dependencies is crucial for understanding genome structure and function across diverse biological contexts. However, effectively capturing these dependencies, which may span millions of base pairs in tasks such as three-dimensional (3D) chromatin folding prediction, remains a major challenge. A comprehensive benchmark suite for evaluating tasks that rely on long-range dependencies is notably absent. To address this gap, we introduce DNALONGBENCH, a benchmark dataset covering five key genomics tasks with long-range dependencies up to 1 million base pairs: enhancer-target gene interaction, expression quantitative trait loci, 3D genome organization, regulatory sequence activity, and transcription initiation signals. We assess DNALONGBENCH using five methods: a task-specific expert model, a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based model, and three fine-tuned DNA foundation models – HyenaDNA, Caduceus-Ph, and Caduceus-PS. We envision DNALONGBENCH as a standardized resource to enable comprehensive comparisons and rigorous evaluations of emerging DNA sequence-based deep learning models that account for long-range dependencies.

Title: Dissection of core promoter syntax through single nucleotide resolution modeling of transcription initiation
Authors: Adam Y. He, Charles G. Danko
Date: 2024-09-17

Abstract:
How the DNA sequence of cis -regulatory elements encode transcription initiation patterns remains poorly understood. Here we introduce CLIPNET, a deep learning model trained on population-scale PRO-cap data that predicts the position and quantity of transcription initiation with single nucleotide resolution from DNA sequence more accurately than existing approaches. Interpretation of CLIPNET revealed a complex regulatory syntax consisting of DNA-protein interactions in five major positions between −200 and +50 bp relative to the transcription start site, as well as more subtle positional preferences among transcriptional activators. Transcriptional activator and core promoter motifs work non-additively to encode distinct aspects of initiation, with the former driving initiation quantity and the latter initiation position. We identified core promoter motifs that explain initiation patterns in the majority of promoters and enhancers, including DPR motifs and AT-rich TBP binding sequences in TATA-less promoters. Our results provide insights into the sequence architecture governing transcription initiation.

Title: In silico prediction of variant effects: promises and limitations for precision plant breeding
Authors: Janek Sendrowski, Thomas Bataillon, Guillaume P. Ramstein
Date: 2025-07-28

Abstract:
Sequence-based AI models show great potential for prediction of variant effects at high resolution, but their practical value in plant breeding remains to be confirmed through rigorous validation studies. Plant breeding has traditionally relied on phenotyping to select individuals with desirable traits—a process that is both costly and time-consuming. Increasingly, breeding strategies are shifting toward precision breeding, where causal variants are directly targeted based on their effects. To predict the effects of causal variants, in silico methods are emerging as efficient alternatives or complements to mutagenesis screens. Here, we review state-of-the-art machine learning methods for predicting variant effects in plants across both coding and noncoding regions, contrasting supervised approaches in functional genomics with unsupervised methods in comparative genomics. We discuss challenges in validating predictions, and compare these methods with traditional association and comparative genomics techniques. We argue that modern sequence models extend traditional methods by generalizing across genomic contexts, fitting a unified model across loci rather than a separate model for each locus. In doing so, they address inherent limitations of traditional quantitative and evolutionary comparative genetics techniques. However, the accuracy and generalizability of sequence models heavily depend on the training data, highlighting the need for validation experiments. We point to successful applications of sequence models, especially with protein sequences, and identify areas for further improvement, especially in modeling regulatory sequences. While not yet mature for in silico-driven precision breeding, sequence models show strong potential to become an integral part of the breeder’s toolbox.

Title: Deciphering the impact of genetic variation on human polyadenylation using APARENT2
Authors: Johannes Linder, Samantha E. Koplik, Anshul Kundaje, Georg Seelig
Date: 2022-11-05

Abstract:
3′-end processing by cleavage and polyadenylation is an important and finely tuned regulatory process during mRNA maturation. Numerous genetic variants are known to cause or contribute to human disorders by disrupting the cis-regulatory code of polyadenylation signals. Yet, due to the complexity of this code, variant interpretation remains challenging. We introduce a residual neural network model, APARENT2 , that can infer 3′-cleavage and polyadenylation from DNA sequence more accurately than any previous model. This model generalizes to the case of alternative polyadenylation (APA) for a variable number of polyadenylation signals. We demonstrate APARENT2’s performance on several variant datasets, including functional reporter data and human 3′ aQTLs from GTEx. We apply neural network interpretation methods to gain insights into disrupted or protective higher-order features of polyadenylation. We fine-tune APARENT2 on human tissue-resolved transcriptomic data to elucidate tissue-specific variant effects. By combining APARENT2 with models of mRNA stability, we extend aQTL effect size predictions to the entire 3′ untranslated region. Finally, we perform in silico saturation mutagenesis of all human polyadenylation signals and compare the predicted effects of \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

While loss-of-function variants were generally selected against, we also find specific clinical conditions linked to gain-of-function mutations. For example, we detect an association between gain-of-function mutations in the 3′-end and autism spectrum disorder. To experimentally validate APARENT2’s predictions, we assayed clinically relevant variants in multiple cell lines, including microglia-derived cells. A sequence-to-function model based on deep residual learning enables accurate functional interpretation of genetic variants in polyadenylation signals and, when coupled with large human variation databases, elucidates the link between functional 3′-end mutations and human health.

Title: Use of AI-methods over MD simulations in the sampling of conformational ensembles in IDPs
Authors: Souradeep Sil, Ishita Datta, Sankar Basu
Date: 2025-04-08

Abstract:
Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs) challenge traditional structure-function paradigms by existing as dynamic ensembles rather than stable tertiary structures. Capturing these ensembles is critical to understanding their biological roles, yet Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, though accurate and widely used, are computationally expensive and struggle to sample rare, transient states. Artificial intelligence (AI) offers a transformative alternative, with deep learning (DL) enabling efficient and scalable conformational sampling. They leverage large-scale datasets to learn complex, non-linear, sequence-to-structure relationships, allowing for the modeling of conformational ensembles in IDPs without the constraints of traditional physics-based approaches. Such DL approaches have been shown to outperform MD in generating diverse ensembles with comparable accuracy. Most models rely primarily on simulated data for training and experimental data serves a critical role in validation, aligning the generated conformational ensembles with observable physical and biochemical properties. However, challenges remain, including dependence on data quality, limited interpretability, and scalability for larger proteins. Hybrid approaches combining AI and MD can bridge the gaps by integrating statistical learning with thermodynamic feasibility. Future directions include incorporating physics-based constraints and learning experimental observables into DL frameworks to refine predictions and enhance applicability. AI-driven methods hold significant promise in IDP research, offering novel insights into protein dynamics and therapeutic targeting while overcoming the limitations of traditional MD simulations.

Title: Landscape of small nucleic acid therapeutics: moving from the bench to the clinic as next-generation medicines
Authors: Mohan Liu, Yusi Wang, Yibing Zhang, Die Hu, Lin Tang, Bailing Zhou, Li Yang
Date: 2025-03-10

Abstract:
The ability of small nucleic acids to modulate gene expression via a range of processes has been widely explored. Compared with conventional treatments, small nucleic acid therapeutics have the potential to achieve long-lasting or even curative effects via gene editing. As a result of recent technological advances, efficient small nucleic acid delivery for therapeutic and biomedical applications has been achieved, accelerating their clinical translation. Here, we review the increasing number of small nucleic acid therapeutic classes and the most common chemical modifications and delivery platforms. We also discuss the key advances in the design, development and therapeutic application of each delivery platform. Furthermore, this review presents comprehensive profiles of currently approved small nucleic acid drugs, including 11 antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), 2 aptamers and 6 siRNA drugs, summarizing their modifications, disease-specific mechanisms of action and delivery strategies. Other candidates whose clinical trial status has been recorded and updated are also discussed. We also consider strategic issues such as important safety considerations, novel vectors and hurdles for translating academic breakthroughs to the clinic. Small nucleic acid therapeutics have produced favorable results in clinical trials and have the potential to address previously “undruggable” targets, suggesting that they could be useful for guiding the development of additional clinical candidates.

Title: “Frustratingly easy” domain adaptation for cross-species transcription factor binding prediction
Authors: Mark Maher Ebeid, Ali Tuğrul Balcı, Maria Chikina, Panayiotis V Benos, Dennis Kostka
Date: 2025-08-05

Abstract:
Understanding how DNA sequence encodes gene regulation remains a central challenge in genomics. While deep learning models can predict regulatory activity from sequence with high accuracy, their generalizability across species—and thus their ability to capture fundamental biological principles—remains limited. Cross-species prediction provides a powerful test of model robustness and offers a window into conserved regulatory logic, but effectively bridging species-specific genomic differences remains a major barrier. We present MORALE, a novel and scalable domain adaptation framework that significantly advances cross-species prediction of transcription factor (TF) binding. By aligning statistical moments of sequence embeddings across species, MORALE enables deep learning models to learn species-invariant regulatory features without requiring adversarial training or complex architectures. Applied to multi-species TF ChIP-seq datasets, MORALE achieves state-of-the-art performance—outperforming both baseline and adversarial approaches across all TFs—while preserving model interpretability and recovering canonical motifs with greater precision. In the five-species transfer setting, MORALE not only improves human prediction accuracy beyond human-only training but also reveals regulatory features conserved across mammals. These results highlight the potential of simple yet powerful domain adaptation techniques to drive generalization and discovery in regulatory genomics. Crucially, MORALE is architecture-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into any embedding-based sequence model. Code is available at https://github.com/loudrxiv/frustrating .

Date: 2026-03

Abstract:
The rising global demand for sustainable protein sources poses critical challenges across food, pharmaceutical, and industrial biotechnology sectors. Microbial expression systems provide scalable and versatile platforms for producing recombinant proteins, including enzymes, therapeutic molecules, and functional food ingredients. These platforms enable efficient biosynthesis of high-value proteins from renewable substrates often via precision fermentation, surpassing conventional methods in yield, cost-efficiency, and environmental sustainability. This review summarizes the genetic regulatory elements that govern gene expression in microbial hosts, with comparative coverage of prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems at transcriptional and translational levels. Key regulatory components, such as promoters, ribosome binding sites (RBS), untranslated regions (UTRs), signal peptides, and terminators, are discussed in the context of host-specific engineering strategies. We highlight advanced engineering approaches, including artificial intelligence (AI) assisted sequence design, CRISPR-Cas-based genome editing, and modular combinatorial optimization of genetic elements. Particular attention is given to the integration of high-throughput screening and predictive modeling tools that accelerate the rational design and optimization of microbial production systems. The review also discusses practical applications in food, pharmaceutical, and industrial enzyme production, emphasizing how genetic element engineering bridges fundamental research and biomanufacturing. Finally, key challenges and future prospects are analyzed to guide the development of next-generation microbial cell factories for sustainable protein production and industrial innovation.

Abstract:
A promising strategy for the precise control of neural circuits is to use cis -regulatory enhancers to drive transgene expression in specific cells. However, enhancer discovery faces key challenges: low in vivo success rates, species-specific differences in activity, challenges with multiplexing adeno-associated viruses (AAVs), and the lack of spatial detail from single-cell sequencing. In order to accelerate enhancer discovery for the dorsal spinal cord—a region critical for pain and itch processing—we developed an end-to-end platform, ESCargoT ( Engineered Specificity of Cargo Transcription ), combining machine learning (ML)–guided enhancer prioritization, modular AAV assembly, and multiplexed, in situ screening. Using cross-species chromatin accessibility data, we trained ML models to predict enhancer activity in oligodendrocytes and in 15 dorsal horn neuronal subtypes. We first demonstrated that an initial enhancer, Excit-1, targeted excitatory dorsal horn neurons and drove reversal of mechanical allodynia in an inflammatory pain model. To enable parallel profiling of a 27-enhancer-AAV library delivered intraspinally in mice, we developed a Spatial Parallel Reporter Assay (SPRA) by integrating a novel Golden-Gate assembly pipeline with multiplexed, in situ screening. Regression adjustment for spatial confounding enabled specificity comparisons between enhancers, demonstrating the ability to screen enhancers targeting diverse cell types (oligodendrocytes, motoneurons, dorsal neuron subtypes) in one experiment. We then validated two candidates, targeting Exc-LMO3 and Exc-SKOR2 neurons, respectively. In a companion paper by Noh et al , our colleagues show that the functional specificity of the Exc-SKOR2-targeting enhancer, unlike Excit-1, is capable of blocking the sensation of chemical itch in mice. These enhancers were derived from the macaque genome but displayed functional sensitivity in mice. This platform enables spatially resolved, multiplexed in vivo enhancer profiling to accelerate discovery of cell-targeting tools and gene therapy development.

Title: An intrinsically interpretable neural network architecture for sequence to function learning
Authors: Ali Tuğrul Balcı, Mark Maher Ebeid, Panayiotis V Benos, Dennis Kostka, Maria Chikina
Date: 2023-03-28

Abstract:
Sequence-based deep learning approaches have been shown to predict a multitude of functional genomic readouts, including regions of open chromatin and RNA expression of genes. However, a major limitation of current methods is that model interpretation relies on computationally demanding post hoc analyses, and even then, one can often not explain the internal mechanics of highly parameterized models. Here, we introduce a deep learning architecture called tiSFM (totally interpretable sequence to function model). tiSFM improves upon the performance of standard multi-layer convolutional models while using fewer parameters. Additionally, while tiSFM is itself technically a multi-layer neural network, internal model parameters are intrinsically interpretable in terms of relevant sequence motifs. We analyze published open chromatin measurements across hematopoietic lineage cell-types and demonstrate that tiSFM outperforms a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network model custom-tailored to this dataset. We also show that it correctly identifies context specific activities of transcription factors with known roles in hematopoietic differentiation, including Pax5 and Ebf1 for B-cells, and Rorc for innate lymphoid cells. tiSFM’s model parameters have biologically meaningful interpretations, and we show the utility of our approach on a complex task of predicting the change in epigenetic state as a function of developmental transition.

Abstract:
Cervical cancer is a global public health subject as it affects women in the reproductive ages, and accounts for the second largest burden among cancer patients worldwide with an unforgiving 50% mortality rate. Relatively scant awareness and limited access to effective diagnosis have led to this enormous disease burden, calling for point-of-care, minimally invasive diagnosis methods. Here, an end-to-end quantitative unified pipeline for diagnosis has been developed, beginning with identification of optimal biomarkers, concurrent design of toehold switch sensors, and finally simulation of the designed diagnostic circuits to assess performance. Using miRNA expression data in the public domain, we identified miR-21–5p and miR-20a-5p as blood-based miRNA biomarkers specific to early-stage cervical cancer employing a multi-tier algorithmic screening. Synthetic riboregulators called toehold switches specific to the biomarker panel were then designed. To predict the dynamic range of toehold switches for use in genetic circuits as biosensors, we used a generic grammar of these switches, and built a neural network model of dynamic range using thermodynamic features derived from mRNA secondary structure and interaction. Second-generation toehold switches were used to overcome the design challenges associated with miRNA biomarkers. The resultant model yielded an adj. R 2 ∼0.71, outperforming earlier models of toehold-switch dynamic range. Reaction kinetics modelling was performed to predict the sensitivity of the second-generation toehold switches to the miRNA biomarkers. Simulations showed a linear response between 10 nM and 100 nM before saturation. Our study demonstrates an end-to-end computational workflow for the efficient design of genetic circuits geared towards the effective detection of unique genomic/nucleic-acid signatures. The approach has the potential to replace iterative experimental trial and error, and focus time, money, and efforts. All software including the toehold grammar parser, neural network model and reaction kinetics simulation are available as open-source software ( https://github.com/SASTRA-iGEM2019 ) under GNU GPLv3 licence.

Title: Importance of the 5′ regulatory region to bacterial synthetic biology applications
Authors: Lisa Tietze, Rahmi Lale
Date: 2021-06-25

Abstract:
The field of synthetic biology is evolving at a fast pace. It is advancing beyond single‐gene alterations in single hosts to the logical design of complex circuits and the development of integrated synthetic genomes. Recent breakthroughs in deep learning, which is increasingly used in de novo assembly of DNA components with predictable effects, are also aiding the discipline. Despite advances in computing, the field is still reliant on the availability of pre‐characterized DNA parts, whether natural or synthetic, to regulate gene expression in bacteria and make valuable compounds. In this review, we discuss the different bacterial synthetic biology methodologies employed in the creation of 5′ regulatory regions – promoters, untranslated regions and 5′‐end of coding sequences. We summarize methodologies and discuss their significance for each of the functional DNA components, and highlight the key advances made in bacterial engineering by concentrating on their flaws and strengths. We end the review by outlining the issues that the discipline may face in the near future.

Title: Investigating the predictability of essential genes across distantly related organisms using an integrative approach
Authors: Jingyuan Deng, Lei Deng, Shengchang Su, Minlu Zhang, Xiaodong Lin, Lan Wei, Ali A. Minai, Daniel J. Hassett, Long J. Lu
Date: 2011-02

Abstract:
Rapid and accurate identification of new essential genes in under-studied microorganisms will significantly improve our understanding of how a cell works and the ability to re-engineer microorganisms. However, predicting essential genes across distantly related organisms remains a challenge. Here, we present a machine learning-based integrative approach that reliably transfers essential gene annotations between distantly related bacteria. We focused on four bacterial species that have well-characterized essential genes, and tested the transferability between three pairs among them. For each pair, we trained our classifier to learn traits associated with essential genes in one organism, and applied it to make predictions in the other. The predictions were then evaluated by examining the agreements with the known essential genes in the target organism. Ten-fold cross-validation in the same organism yielded AUC scores between 0.86 and 0.93. Cross-organism predictions yielded AUC scores between 0.69 and 0.89. The transferability is likely affected by growth conditions, quality of the training data set and the evolutionary distance. We are thus the first to report that gene essentiality can be reliably predicted using features trained and tested in a distantly related organism. Our approach proves more robust and portable than existing approaches, significantly extending our ability to predict essential genes beyond orthologs.

Abstract:
Proteins are some of the most fascinating and challenging molecules in the universe, and they pose a big challenge for artificial intelligence. The implementation of machine learning/AI in protein science gives rise to a world of knowledge adventures in the workhorse of the cell and proteome homeostasis, which are essential for making life possible. This opens up epistemic horizons thanks to a coupling of human tacit–explicit knowledge with machine learning power, the benefits of which are already tangible, such as important advances in protein structure prediction. Moreover, the driving force behind the protein processes of self-organization, adjustment, and fitness requires a space corresponding to gigabytes of life data in its order of magnitude. There are many tasks such as novel protein design, protein folding pathways, and synthetic metabolic routes, as well as protein-aggregation mechanisms, pathogenesis of protein misfolding and disease, and proteostasis networks that are currently unexplored or unrevealed. In this systematic review and biochemical meta-analysis, we aim to contribute to bridging the gap between what we call binomial artificial intelligence (AI) and protein science (PS), a growing research enterprise with exciting and promising biotechnological and biomedical applications. We undertake our task by exploring “the state of the art” in AI and machine learning (ML) applications to protein science in the scientific literature to address some critical research questions in this domain, including What kind of tasks are already explored by ML approaches to protein sciences? What are the most common ML algorithms and databases used? What is the situational diagnostic of the AI–PS inter-field? What do ML processing steps have in common? We also formulate novel questions such as Is it possible to discover what the rules of protein evolution are with the binomial AI–PS? How do protein folding pathways evolve? What are the rules that dictate the folds? What are the minimal nuclear protein structures? How do protein aggregates form and why do they exhibit different toxicities? What are the structural properties of amyloid proteins? How can we design an effective proteostasis network to deal with misfolded proteins? We are a cross-functional group of scientists from several academic disciplines, and we have conducted the systematic review using a variant of the PICO and PRISMA approaches. The search was carried out in four databases (PubMed, Bireme, OVID, and EBSCO Web of Science), resulting in 144 research articles. After three rounds of quality screening, 93 articles were finally selected for further analysis. A summary of our findings is as follows: regarding AI applications, there are mainly four types: 1 ) genomics, 2 ) protein structure and function, 3 ) protein design and evolution, and 4 ) drug design. In terms of the ML algorithms and databases used, supervised learning was the most common approach (85%). As for the databases used for the ML models, PDB and UniprotKB/Swissprot were the most common ones (21 and 8%, respectively). Moreover, we identified that approximately 63% of the articles organized their results into three steps, which we labeled pre-process , process , and post-process . A few studies combined data from several databases or created their own databases after the pre-process. Our main finding is that, as of today, there are no research road maps serving as guides to address gaps in our knowledge of the AI–PS binomial. All research efforts to collect, integrate multidimensional data features, and then analyze and validate them are, so far, uncoordinated and scattered throughout the scientific literature without a clear epistemic goal or connection between the studies. Therefore, our main contribution to the scientific literature is to offer a road map to help solve problems in drug design, protein structures, design, and function prediction while also presenting the “state of the art” on research in the AI–PS binomial until February 2021. Thus, we pave the way toward future advances in the synthetic redesign of novel proteins and protein networks and artificial metabolic pathways, learning lessons from nature for the welfare of humankind. Many of the novel proteins and metabolic pathways are currently non-existent in nature, nor are they used in the chemical industry or biomedical field.

Date: 2023

Abstract:
Optimizing the metabolic pathways of microbial cell factories is essential for establishing viable biotechnological production processes. However, due to the limited understanding of the complex setup of cellular machinery, building efficient microbial cell factories remains tedious and time-consuming. Machine learning (ML), a powerful tool capable of identifying patterns within large datasets, has been used to analyze biological datasets generated using various high-throughput technologies to build data-driven models for complex bioprocesses. In addition, ML can also be integrated with Design–Build–Test–Learn to accelerate development. This review focuses on recent ML applications in genome-scale metabolic model construction, multistep pathway optimization, rate-limiting enzyme engineering, and gene regulatory element designing. In addition, we have discussed some limitations of these methods as well as potential solutions.

Abstract:
The design of regulatory elements is pivotal in gene and cell therapy, where DNA sequences are engineered to drive elevated and cell-type specific expression. However, the systematic assessment of synthetic DNA sequences without robust metrics and easy-to-use software remains challenging. Here, we introduce Polygraph, a Python framework that evaluates synthetic DNA elements, based on features like diversity, motif and k -mer composition, similarity to endogenous sequences, and screening with predictive and foundational models. Polygraph is the first instrument for assessing synthetic regulatory sequences, enabling faster progress in therapeutic interventions and improving our understanding of gene regulatory mechanisms.

Title: RNA sequence to structure analysis from comprehensive pairwise mutagenesis of multiple self-cleaving ribozymes
Authors: Jessica M Roberts, James D Beck, Tanner B Pollock, Devin P Bendixsen, Eric J Hayden, Timothy W Nilsen
Date: 2023-01-19

Abstract:
Self-cleaving ribozymes are RNA molecules that catalyze the cleavage of their own phosphodiester backbones. These ribozymes are found in all domains of life and are also a tool for biotechnical and synthetic biology applications. Self-cleaving ribozymes are also an important model of sequence-to-function relationships for RNA because their small size simplifies synthesis of genetic variants and self-cleaving activity is an accessible readout of the functional consequence of the mutation. Here, we used a high-throughput experimental approach to determine the relative activity for every possible single and double mutant of five self-cleaving ribozymes. From this data, we comprehensively identified non-additive effects between pairs of mutations (epistasis) for all five ribozymes. We analyzed how changes in activity and trends in epistasis map to the ribozyme structures. The variety of structures studied provided opportunities to observe several examples of common structural elements, and the data was collected under identical experimental conditions to enable direct comparison. Heatmap-based visualization of the data revealed patterns indicating structural features of the ribozymes including paired regions, unpaired loops, non-canonical structures, and tertiary structural contacts. The data also revealed signatures of functionally critical nucleotides involved in catalysis. The results demonstrate that the data sets provide structural information similar to chemical or enzymatic probing experiments, but with additional quantitative functional information. The large-scale data sets can be used for models predicting structure and function and for efforts to engineer self-cleaving ribozymes.

Title: Artificial Intelligence‐Based Approaches for AAV Vector Engineering
Authors: Fangzhi Tan, Yue Dong, Jieyu Qi, Wenwu Yu, Renjie Chai
Date: 2025-02-11

Abstract:
Adeno‐associated virus (AAV) has emerged as a leading vector for gene therapy due to its broad host range, low pathogenicity, and ability to facilitate long‐term gene expression. However, AAV vectors face limitations, including immunogenicity and insufficient targeting specificity. To enhance the efficacy of gene therapy, researchers have been modifying the AAV vector using various methods. Traditional experimental approaches for optimizing AAV vector are often time‐consuming, resource‐intensive, and difficult to replicate. The advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning, offers significant potential to accelerate capsid optimization while reducing development time and manufacturing costs. This review compares traditional and AI‐based methods of AAV vector engineering and highlights recent research in AAV engineering using AI algorithms.

Title: Nucleic acid strand displacement – from DNA nanotechnology to translational regulation
Authors: Friedrich C. Simmel
Date: 2023-04-24

Abstract:
Nucleic acid strand displacement reactions involve the competition of two or more DNA or RNA strands of similar sequence for binding to a complementary strand, and facilitate the isothermal replacement of an incumbent strand by an invader. The process can be biased by augmenting the duplex comprising the incumbent with a single-stranded extension, which can act as a toehold for a complementary invader. The toehold gives the invader a thermodynamic advantage over the incumbent, and can be programmed as a unique label to activate a specific strand displacement process. Toehold-mediated strand displacement processes have been extensively utilized for the operation of DNA-based molecular machines and devices as well as for the design of DNA-based chemical reaction networks. More recently, principles developed initially in the context of DNA nanotechnology have been applied for the de novo design of gene regulatory switches that can operate inside living cells. The article specifically focuses on the design of RNA-based translational regulators termed toehold switches. Toehold switches utilize toehold-mediated strand invasion to either activate or repress translation of an mRNA in response to the binding of a trigger RNA molecule. The basic operation principles of toehold switches will be discussed as well as their applications in sensing and biocomputing. Finally, strategies for their optimization will be described as well as challenges for their operation in vivo.

Authors: Hitoshi Iuchi, Taro Matsutani, Keisuke Yamada, Natsuki Iwano, Shunsuke Sumi, Shion Hosoda, Shitao Zhao, Tsukasa Fukunaga, Michiaki Hamada
Date: 2021

Abstract:
Although remarkable advances have been reported in high-throughput sequencing, the ability to aptly analyze a substantial amount of rapidly generated biological (DNA/RNA/protein) sequencing data remains a critical hurdle. To tackle this issue, the application of natural language processing (NLP) to biological sequence analysis has received increased attention. In this method, biological sequences are regarded as sentences while the single nucleic acids/amino acids or k-mers in these sequences represent the words. Embedding is an essential step in NLP, which performs the conversion of these words into vectors. Specifically, representation learning is an approach used for this transformation process, which can be applied to biological sequences. Vectorized biological sequences can then be applied for function and structure estimation, or as input for other probabilistic models. Considering the importance and growing trend for the application of representation learning to biological research, in the present study, we have reviewed the existing knowledge in representation learning for biological sequence analysis.

Title: Direct testing of natural twister ribozymes from over a thousand organisms reveals a broad tolerance for structural imperfections
Authors: Lauren N McKinley, McCauley O Meyer, Aswathy Sebastian, Benjamin K Chang, Kyle J Messina, Istvan Albert, Philip C Bevilacqua
Date: 2024-12-11

Abstract:
Twister ribozymes are an extensively studied class of nucleolytic RNAs. Thousands of natural twisters have been proposed using sequence homology and structural descriptors. Yet, most of these candidates have not been validated experimentally. To address this gap, we developed Cleavage High-Throughput Assay (CHiTA), a high-throughput pipeline utilizing massively parallel oligonucleotide synthesis and next-generation sequencing to test putative ribozymes en masse in a scarless fashion. As proof of principle, we applied CHiTA to a small set of known active and mutant ribozymes. We then used CHiTA to test two large sets of naturally occurring twister ribozymes: over 1600 previously reported putative twisters and ∼1000 new candidate twisters. The new candidates were identified computationally in ∼1000 organisms, representing a massive increase in the number of ribozyme-harboring organisms. Approximately 94% of the twisters we tested were active and cleaved site-specifically. Analysis of their structural features revealed that many substitutions and helical imperfections can be tolerated. We repeated our computational search with structural descriptors updated from this analysis, whereupon we identified and confirmed the first intrinsically active twister ribozyme in mammals. CHiTA broadly expands the number of active twister ribozymes found in nature and provides a powerful method for functional analyses of other RNAs.

Title: Promoter Sequences Prediction Using Relational Association Rule Mining
Authors: Gabriela Czibula, Maria-Iuliana Bocicor, Istvan Gergely Czibula
Date: 2012

Abstract:
In this paper we are approaching, from a computational perspective, the problem of promoter sequences prediction, an important problem within the field of bioinformatics. As the conditions for a DNA sequence to function as a promoter are not known, machine learning based classification models are still developed to approach the problem of promoter identification in the DNA. We are proposing a classification model based on relational association rules mining. Relational association rules are a particular type of association rules and describe numerical orderings between attributes that commonly occur over a data set. Our classifier is based on the discovery of relational association rules for predicting if a DNA sequence contains or not a promoter region. An experimental evaluation of the proposed model and comparison with similar existing approaches is provided. The obtained results show that our classifier overperforms the existing techniques for identifying promoter sequences, confirming the potential of our proposal.

Title: Designing realistic regulatory DNA with autoregressive language models
Authors: Avantika Lal, David Garfield, Tommaso Biancalani, Gokcen Eraslan
Date: 2024-09

Abstract:
Cis -regulatory elements (CREs), such as promoters and enhancers, are DNA sequences that regulate the expression of genes. The activity of a CRE is influenced by the order, composition, and spacing of sequence motifs that are bound by proteins called transcription factors (TFs). Synthetic CREs with specific properties are needed for biomanufacturing as well as for many therapeutic applications including cell and gene therapy. Here, we present regLM, a framework to design synthetic CREs with desired properties, such as high, low, or cell type–specific activity, using autoregressive language models in conjunction with supervised sequence-to-function models. We used our framework to design synthetic yeast promoters and cell type–specific human enhancers. We demonstrate that the synthetic CREs generated by our approach are not only predicted to have the desired functionality but also contain biological features similar to experimentally validated CREs. regLM thus facilitates the design of realistic regulatory DNA elements while providing insights into the cis -regulatory code.

Title: Ultra-fast variant effect prediction using biophysical transcription factor binding models
Authors: Rezwan Hosseini, Ali Tugrul Balci, Dennis Kostka, Nathan Clark, Maria Chikina
Date: 2025-10-14

Abstract:
Sequence variation within transcription factor (TF)-binding sites can significantly affect TF–DNA interactions, influencing gene expression and contributing to disease susceptibility or phenotypic traits. Despite recent progress in deep sequence-to-function models that predict functional output from sequence data, these methods perform inadequately on some variant effect prediction tasks, especially with common genetic variants. This limitation underscores the importance of leveraging biophysical models of TF binding to enhance interpretability of variant effect scores and facilitate mechanistic insights. We introduce motifDiff , a novel computational tool designed to quantify variant effects using mono- and dinucleotide position weight matrices. motifDiff offers several key advantages, including scalability to score millions of variants within minutes, implementation of statistically rigorous normalization strategy critical for optimal performance, and support for both dinucleotide and mononucleotide models. We demonstrate motifDiff ’s efficacy by evaluating it across diverse ground truth datasets that quantify the effects of common variants in vivo , thereby establishing robust benchmarks for the predictive value of variant effect calculations. Finally, we show that our tool provides unique insights when interpreting human accelerated regions. motifDiff is available as a standalone Python application at https://github.com/rezwanhosseini/MotifDiff .

Title: Myofilament-associated proteins with intrinsic disorder (MAPIDs) and their resolution by computational modeling
Authors: Bin Sun, Peter M. Kekenes-Huskey
Date: 2023-01-11

Abstract:
The cardiac sarcomere is a cellular structure in the heart that enables muscle cells to contract. Dozens of proteins belong to the cardiac sarcomere, which work in tandem to generate force and adapt to demands on cardiac output. Intriguingly, the majority of these proteins have significant intrinsic disorder that contributes to their functions, yet the biophysics of these intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) have been characterized in limited detail. In this review, we first enumerate these myofilament-associated proteins with intrinsic disorder (MAPIDs) and recent biophysical studies to characterize their IDRs. We secondly summarize the biophysics governing IDR properties and the state-of-the-art in computational tools toward MAPID identification and characterization of their conformation ensembles. We conclude with an overview of future computational approaches toward broadening the understanding of intrinsic disorder in the cardiac sarcomere.

Authors: Chengzhong Ye, Gonzalo Benegas, Carlos Albors, Jianan Canal Li, Sebastian Prillo, Peter D. Fields, Brian Clarke, Yun S. Song
Date: 2025-09-21

Abstract:
Genomic language models (gLMs) have emerged as a powerful approach for learning genome-wide functional constraints directly from DNA sequences. However, standard gLMs adapted from natural language processing often require extremely large model sizes and computational resources, yet still fall short of classical evolutionary models in predictive tasks. Here, we introduce GPN-Star (Genomic Pretrained Network with Species Tree and Alignment Representation), a biologically grounded gLM featuring a phylogeny-aware architecture that leverages whole-genome alignments and species trees to model evolutionary relationships explicitly. Trained on alignments spanning vertebrate, mammalian, and primate evolutionary timescales, GPN-Star achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of variant effect prediction tasks in both coding and non-coding regions of the human genome. Analyses across timescales reveal task-dependent advantages of modeling more recent versus deeper evolution. To demonstrate its potential to advance human genetics, we show that GPN-Star substantially outperforms prior methods in prioritizing pathogenic and fine-mapped GWAS variants; yields unprecedented enrichments of complex trait heritability; and improves power in rare variant association testing. Extending beyond humans, we train GPN-Star for five model organisms – Mus musculus, Gallus gallus, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans , and Arabidopsis thaliana – demonstrating the robustness and generalizability of the framework. Taken together, these results position GPN-Star as a scalable, powerful, and flexible new tool for genome interpretation, well suited to leverage the growing abundance of comparative genomics data.

Title: Machine Learning and Deep Learning in Synthetic Biology:
Key Architectures, Applications, and Challenges
Authors: Manoj Kumar Goshisht
Date: 2024-02-19

Abstract:
Machine learning
(ML), particularly deep learning (DL), has made
rapid and substantial progress in synthetic biology in recent years.
Biotechnological applications of biosystems, including pathways, enzymes,
and whole cells, are being probed frequently with time. The intricacy
and interconnectedness of biosystems make it challenging to design
them with the desired properties. ML and DL have a synergy with synthetic
biology. Synthetic biology can be employed to produce large data sets
for training models (for instance, by utilizing DNA synthesis), and
ML/DL models can be employed to inform design (for example, by generating
new parts or advising unrivaled experiments to perform). This potential
has recently been brought to light by research at the intersection
of engineering biology and ML/DL through achievements like the design
of novel biological components, best experimental design, automated
analysis of microscopy data, protein structure prediction, and biomolecular
implementations of ANNs (Artificial Neural Networks). I have divided
this review into three sections. In the first section, I describe
predictive potential and basics of ML along with myriad applications
in synthetic biology, especially in engineering cells, activity of
proteins, and metabolic pathways. In the second section, I describe
fundamental DL architectures and their applications in synthetic biology.
Finally, I describe different challenges causing hurdles in the progress
of ML/DL and synthetic biology along with their solutions.

Abstract:
Transcriptional regulation is mediated by enhancers, yet how genetic perturbations alter enhancer activity and gene expression remains poorly understood. We developed UDI-UMI-STARR-seq, which integrates dual indexes and unique molecular identifiers, and combined it with RNA-seq to profile the effects of perturbations on enhancer activity and target gene expression. We applied this approach to a library of 253,632 fragments representing 46,142 cell type–specific candidate enhancers and assessed the impact of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of six transcription factors (or TFs; ATF2, CTCF, FOXA1, LEF1, TCF7L2, and SCRT1) with diverse regulatory roles. Across knockout lines, we identified responsive enhancers that were either repressed or induced, often through motifs such as the p53 family of TFs. Enhancer–gene mapping revealed TF-specific programs, including repression of Wnt/p53 targets with ATF2 or LEF1 loss, downregulation of the FIRRE locus with CTCF loss, and compensatory upregulation of RNA polymerase II regulators following FOXA1 depletion. A deep learning model trained on enhancer sequences recapitulated core principles of enhancer grammar, including cooperative motif syntax and the influence of flanking sequence context. Applying this framework to the neurodevelopmental disorder-associated 16p12.1 deletion identified responsive enhancers linked to genes involved in axon guidance, synaptic plasticity, and translational control, providing a scalable readout of enhancer dynamics generalizable to genetic mutations.

Title: Annotating functional effects of non-coding variants in neuropsychiatric cell types by deep transfer learning
Authors: Boqiao Lai, Sheng Qian, Hanwei Zhang, Siwei Zhang, Alena Kozlova, Jubao Duan, Jinbo Xu, Xin He
Date: 2022-05

Abstract:
Genomewide association studies (GWAS) have identified a large number of loci associated with neuropsychiatric traits, however, understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying these loci remains difficult. To help prioritize causal variants and interpret their functions, computational methods have been developed to predict regulatory effects of non-coding variants. An emerging approach to variant annotation is deep learning models that predict regulatory functions from DNA sequences alone. While such models have been trained on large publicly available dataset such as ENCODE, neuropsychiatric trait-related cell types are under-represented in these datasets, thus there is an urgent need of better tools and resources to annotate variant functions in such cellular contexts. To fill this gap, we collected a large collection of neurodevelopment-related cell/tissue types, and trained deep Convolutional Neural Networks (ResNet) using such data. Furthermore, our model, called MetaChrom, borrows information from public epigenomic consortium to improve the accuracy via transfer learning. We show that MetaChrom is substantially better in predicting experimentally determined chromatin accessibility variants than popular variant annotation tools such as CADD and delta-SVM. By combining GWAS data with MetaChrom predictions, we prioritized 31 SNPs for Schizophrenia, suggesting potential risk genes and the biological contexts where they act. In summary, MetaChrom provides functional annotations of any DNA variants in the neuro-development context and the general method of MetaChrom can also be extended to other disease-related cell or tissue types.

Title: Automated model-predictive design of synthetic promoters to control transcriptional profiles in bacteria
Authors: Travis L. LaFleur, Ayaan Hossain, Howard M. Salis
Date: 2022-09-02

Abstract:
Transcription rates are regulated by the interactions between RNA polymerase, sigma factor, and promoter DNA sequences in bacteria. However, it remains unclear how non-canonical sequence motifs collectively control transcription rates. Here, we combine massively parallel assays, biophysics, and machine learning to develop a 346-parameter model that predicts site-specific transcription initiation rates for any σ 70 promoter sequence, validated across 22132 bacterial promoters with diverse sequences. We apply the model to predict genetic context effects, design σ 70 promoters with desired transcription rates, and identify undesired promoters inside engineered genetic systems. The model provides a biophysical basis for understanding gene regulation in natural genetic systems and precise transcriptional control for engineering synthetic genetic systems.

Authors: Ling Yin, Hongliang He, Hongliang Zhang, Yuhua Shang, Chengbo Fu, Songquan Wu, Tengchuan Jin
Date: 2025-06-19

Abstract:
Adeno‐associated virus (AAV) is a non‐enveloped DNA virus infecting a wide variety of species, tissues, and cell types, which is recognized as a safe and effective method for delivering therapeutic transgenes. AAV vector is the most popular viral gene delivery system in clinical delivery systems with unique and multiple advantages, such as tissue tropism, transduction specificity, long‐lasting gene expression, low immune responses, and without host chromosome incorporation. Till now, four AAV‐based gene therapy drugs have already been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or European Medicines Agency (EMA). Despite the success of AAV vectors, there are still some remaining challenges that limit further usage, such as poor packaging capacity, low organ specificity, pre‐existing humoral immunity, and vector dose‐dependent toxicity. In the present review, we address the different approaches to optimize AAV vector delivery system with a focus on capsid engineering, packaging capacity, and immune response at the clinical level. The review further investigates the potential of manipulating AAV vectors in preclinical applications and clinical translation, which emphasizes the challenges and prospects in viral vector selection, drug delivery strategies, immune reactions in cancer, neurodegenerative disease, retinal disease, SARS‐CoV‐2, and monkeypox. Finally, it forecasts future directions and potential challenges of artificial intelligence (AI), vaccines, and nanobodies, which emphasizes the need for ethical and secure approaches in AAV application.

Title: Fantastic AAV Gene Therapy Vectors and How to Find Them—Random Diversification, Rational Design and Machine Learning
Authors: Jonas Becker, Julia Fakhiri, Dirk Grimm
Date: 2022-07-03

Abstract:
Parvoviruses are a diverse family of small, non-enveloped DNA viruses that infect a wide variety of species, tissues and cell types. For over half a century, their intriguing biology and pathophysiology has fueled intensive research aimed at dissecting the underlying viral and cellular mechanisms. Concurrently, their broad host specificity (tropism) has motivated efforts to develop parvoviruses as gene delivery vectors for human cancer or gene therapy applications. While the sum of preclinical and clinical data consistently demonstrates the great potential of these vectors, these findings also illustrate the importance of enhancing and restricting in vivo transgene expression in desired cell types. To this end, major progress has been made especially with vectors based on Adeno-associated virus (AAV), whose capsid is highly amenable to bioengineering, repurposing and expansion of its natural tropism. Here, we provide an overview of the state-of-the-art approaches to create new AAV variants with higher specificity and efficiency of gene transfer in on-target cells. We first review traditional and novel directed evolution approaches, including high-throughput screening of AAV capsid libraries. Next, we discuss programmable receptor-mediated targeting with a focus on two recent technologies that utilize high-affinity binders. Finally, we highlight one of the latest stratagems for rational AAV vector characterization and optimization, namely, machine learning, which promises to facilitate and accelerate the identification of next-generation, safe and precise gene delivery vehicles.

Abstract:
Cis -regulatory elements (CREs) control gene expression, orchestrating tissue identity, developmental timing and stimulus responses, which collectively define the thousands of unique cell types in the body 1 – 3 . While there is great potential for strategically incorporating CREs in therapeutic or biotechnology applications that require tissue specificity, there is no guarantee that an optimal CRE for these intended purposes has arisen naturally. Here we present a platform to engineer and validate synthetic CREs capable of driving gene expression with programmed cell-type specificity. We take advantage of innovations in deep neural network modelling of CRE activity across three cell types, efficient in silico optimization and massively parallel reporter assays to design and empirically test thousands of CREs 4 – 8 . Through large-scale in vitro validation, we show that synthetic sequences are more effective at driving cell-type-specific expression in three cell lines compared with natural sequences from the human genome and achieve specificity in analogous tissues when tested in vivo. Synthetic sequences exhibit distinct motif vocabulary associated with activity in the on-target cell type and a simultaneous reduction in the activity of off-target cells. Together, we provide a generalizable framework to prospectively engineer CREs from massively parallel reporter assay models and demonstrate the required literacy to write fit-for-purpose regulatory code.

Authors: Juannan Zhou, Mandy S. Wong, Wei-Chia Chen, Adrian R. Krainer, Justin B. Kinney, David M. McCandlish
Date: 2022-09-21

Abstract:
One core goal of genetics is to systematically understand the mapping between the DNA sequence of an organism (genotype) and its measurable characteristics (phenotype). Understanding this mapping is often challenging because of interactions between mutations, where the result of combining several different mutations can be very different than the sum of their individual effects. Here we provide a statistical framework for modeling complex genetic interactions of this type. The key idea is to ask how fast the effects of mutations change when introducing the same mutation in increasingly distant genetic backgrounds. We then propose a model for phenotypic prediction that takes into account this tendency for the effects of mutations to be more similar in nearby genetic backgrounds.

Title: CPI-Pred: A deep learning framework for predicting functional parameters of compound-protein interactions
Authors: Zhiqing Xu, Rana Ahmed Barghout, Jinghao Wu, Dhruv Garg, Yun S. Song, Radhakrishnan Mahadevan
Date: 2025-01-21

Abstract:
Recent advancements in deep learning have enabled functional annotation of genome sequences, facilitating the discovery of new enzymes and metabolites. However, accurately predicting compound-protein interactions (CPI) from sequences remains challenging due to the complexity of these interactions and the sparsity and heterogeneity of available data, which constrain the generalization of patterns across their solution space. In this work, we introduce CPI-Pred, a versatile deep learning model designed to predict compound-protein interaction function. CPI-Pred integrates compound representations derived from a novel message-passing neural network and enzyme representations generated by state-of-the-art protein language models, leveraging innovative sequence pooling and cross-attention mechanisms. To train and evaluate CPI-Pred, we compiled the largest dataset of enzyme kinetic parameters to date, encompassing four key metrics: the Michaelis-Menten constant ( K M ), enzyme turnover number ( k cat ), catalytic efficiency ( k cat /K M ), and inhibition constant ( K I ). These kinetic parameters are critical for elucidating enzyme function in metabolic contexts and understanding their regulation by compounds within biological networks. We demonstrate that CPI-Pred can predict diverse types of CPI using only the amino acid sequence of enzymes and structural representations of compounds, outperforming state-of-the-art models on unseen compounds and structurally dissimilar enzymes. Over workflow provides a valuable tool for tackling a range of metabolic engineering challenges, including the designing of novel enzyme sequences and compounds, such as enzyme inhibitors. Additionally, the datasets curated in this study offer a valuable resource for the scientific community, serving as a benchmark for machine learning models focused on enzyme activity and promiscuity prediction.

Abstract:
Cis -regulatory elements (CREs) direct gene expression in health and disease, and models that can accurately predict their activities from DNA sequences are crucial for biomedicine. Deep learning represents one emerging strategy to model the regulatory grammar that relates CRE sequence to function. However, these models require training data on a scale that exceeds the number of CREs in the genome. We address this problem using active machine learning to iteratively train models on multiple rounds of synthetic DNA sequences assayed in live mammalian retinas. During each round of training the model actively selects sequence perturbations to assay, thereby efficiently generating informative training data. We iteratively trained a model that predicts the activities of sequences containing binding motifs for the photoreceptor transcription factor Cone-rod homeobox (CRX) using an order of magnitude less training data than current approaches. The model’s internal confidence estimates of its predictions are reliable guides for designing sequences with high activity. The model correctly identified critical sequence differences between active and inactive sequences with nearly identical transcription factor binding sites, and revealed order and spacing preferences for combinations of motifs. Our results establish active learning as an effective method to train accurate deep learning models of cis -regulatory function after exhausting naturally occurring training examples in the genome.

Title: Evaluating the representational power of pre-trained DNA language models for regulatory genomics
Authors: Ziqi Tang, Nirali Somia, Yiyang Yu, Peter K Koo
Date: 2024-09-25

Abstract:
The emergence of genomic language models (gLMs) offers an unsupervised approach to learning a wide diversity of cis -regulatory patterns in the non-coding genome without requiring labels of functional activity generated by wet-lab experiments. Previous evaluations have shown that pre-trained gLMs can be leveraged to improve predictive performance across a broad range of regulatory genomics tasks, albeit using relatively simple benchmark datasets and baseline models. Since the gLMs in these studies were tested upon fine-tuning their weights for each downstream task, determining whether gLM representations embody a foundational understanding of cis -regulatory biology remains an open question. Here we evaluate the representational power of pre-trained gLMs to predict and interpret cell-type-specific functional genomics data that span DNA and RNA regulation. Our findings suggest that probing the representations of pre-trained gLMs do not offer substantial advantages over conventional machine learning approaches that use one-hot encoded sequences. This work highlights a major gap with current gLMs, raising potential issues in conventional pre-training strategies for the non-coding genome.

Abstract:
While synthetic biology has revolutionized our approaches to medicine, agriculture, and energy, the design of completely novel biological circuit components beyond naturally-derived templates remains challenging due to poorly understood design rules. Toehold switches, which are programmable nucleic acid sensors, face an analogous design bottleneck; our limited understanding of how sequence impacts functionality often necessitates expensive, time-consuming screens to identify effective switches. Here, we introduce Sequence-based Toehold Optimization and Redesign Model (STORM) and Nucleic-Acid Speech (NuSpeak), two orthogonal and synergistic deep learning architectures to characterize and optimize toeholds. Applying techniques from computer vision and natural language processing, we ‘un-box’ our models using convolutional filters, attention maps, and in silico mutagenesis. Through transfer-learning, we redesign sub-optimal toehold sensors, even with sparse training data, experimentally validating their improved performance. This work provides sequence-to-function deep learning frameworks for toehold selection and design, augmenting our ability to construct potent biological circuit components and precision diagnostics.

Recent breakthroughs in protein structure prediction demarcate the start of a new era in structural bioinformatics. Combined with various advances in experimental structure determination and the uninterrupted pace at which new structures are published, this promises an age in which protein structure information is as prevalent and ubiquitous as sequence. Machine learning in protein bioinformatics has been dominated by sequence-based methods, but this is now changing to make use of the deluge of rich structural information as input. Machine learning methods making use of structures are scattered across literature and cover a number of different applications and scopes; while some try to address questions and tasks within a single protein family, others aim to capture characteristics across all available proteins. In this review, we look at the variety of structure-based machine learning approaches, how structures can be used as input, and typical applications of these approaches in protein biology. We also discuss current challenges and opportunities in this all-important and increasingly popular field.

Abstract:
Splice-disrupting variants (SDVs) underlie many human diseases, yet systematic functional maps of their effects across cell types remain limited. We developed Cell-type Oriented Massively Parallel reporter Assay of Splicing Signatures (COMPASS) to measure splicing outcomes for 87,546 single and double variants across more than 1,700 genes in five human cell lines of diverse tissue origin. COMPASS targets disease relevant gene sets, including ACMG actionable genes and SFARI autism-associated genes, enabling systematic dissection of splicing impacts in health and disease. Our measurements reveal numerous SDVs, including ClinVar variants currently classified as variants of uncertain significance. Using prime editing, we validate variant effects in the genome for ClinVar variants in BIN1 , a gene implicated in Alzheimer’s disease, cancer, and cardiac pathology. Benchmarking our MPRA against state-of-the-art predictive models shows that while these approaches capture broad variant effects, important gaps remain. Our data reveal putative RNA-binding protein motifs whose disruption drives splicing changes, providing mechanistic insight into variant impact. Finally, cross-cell line comparisons reveal a distinct subset of variants that drive cell type–specific splicing programs. This study delivers the largest cell type-resolved, base-resolution atlas of splicing variant effects to date, providing a resource to support variant reclassification in clinical genomics and aid in the selection of therapeutic targets.

Abstract:
Protein function is canonically believed to be more conserved than amino acid sequence, but this idea is only well supported in folded domains, where highly diverged sequences can fold into equivalent 3D structures with identical function. Intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDRs) often experience rapid amino acid sequence divergence, but because they do not fold into stable 3D structures, it remains unknown when and how function is conserved. As a model system for studying the evolution of IDRs, we examined transcriptional activation domains, the regions of transcription factors that bind to coactivator complexes. We systematically identified activation domains on 502 homologs of the transcriptional activator Gcn4 spanning 600 MY of fungal evolution in the Ascomycota. We find that the central activation domain shows strong conservation of function without conservation of sequence. We identify the molecular mechanism for this conservation of function without conservation of sequence: evolutionary turnover (gain and loss) of acidic and aromatic residues that are important for function. We further see turnover of complete N-terminal activation domains. This turnover at two length scales confounds multiple sequence alignments, explaining why traditional comparative genomics cannot detect functional conservation of activation domains. Evolutionary turnover of key residues is likely a general mechanism for conservation of function without conservation of sequence in IDRs.

Title: Detection of pks Island mRNAs Using Toehold Sensors in Escherichia coli
Authors: Taeyang Heo, Hansol Kang, Seungdo Choi, Jongmin Kim
Date: 2021-11-22

Abstract:
Synthetic biologists have applied biomolecular engineering approaches toward the goal of novel biological devices and have shown progress in diverse areas of medicine and biotechnology. Especially promising is the application of synthetic biological devices towards a novel class of molecular diagnostics. As an example, a de-novo-designed riboregulator called toehold switch, with its programmability and compatibility with field-deployable devices showed promising in vitro applications for viral RNA detection such as Zika and Corona viruses. However, the in vivo application of high-performance RNA sensors remains challenging due to the secondary structure of long mRNA species. Here, we introduced ‘Helper RNAs’ that can enhance the functionality of toehold switch sensors by mitigating the effect of secondary structures around a target site. By employing the helper RNAs, previously reported mCherry mRNA sensor showed improved fold-changes in vivo. To further generalize the Helper RNA approaches, we employed automatic design pipeline for toehold sensors that target the essential genes within the pks island, an important target of biomedical research in connection with colorectal cancer. The toehold switch sensors showed fold-changes upon the expression of full-length mRNAs that apparently depended sensitively on the identity of the gene as well as the predicted local structure within the target region of the mRNA. Still, the helper RNAs could improve the performance of toehold switch sensors in many instances, with up to 10-fold improvement over no helper cases. These results suggest that the helper RNA approaches can further assist the design of functional RNA devices in vivo with the aid of the streamlined automatic design software developed here. Further, our solutions for screening and stabilizing single-stranded region of mRNA may find use in other in vivo mRNA-sensing applications such as cas13 crRNA design, transcriptome engineering, and trans-cleaving ribozymes.

Abstract:
Genetic circuits that control transgene expression in response to pre-defined transcriptional cues would enable the development of smart therapeutics. To this end, here we engineer programmable single-transcript RNA sensors in which adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) autocatalytically convert target hybridization into a translational output. Dubbed DART VADAR (Detection and Amplification of RNA Triggers via ADAR), our system amplifies the signal from editing by endogenous ADAR through a positive feedback loop. Amplification is mediated by the expression of a hyperactive, minimal ADAR variant and its recruitment to the edit site via an orthogonal RNA targeting mechanism. This topology confers high dynamic range, low background, minimal off-target effects, and a small genetic footprint. We leverage DART VADAR to detect single nucleotide polymorphisms and modulate translation in response to endogenous transcript levels in mammalian cells.

Title: The need for adaptability in detection, characterization, and attribution of biosecurity threats
Authors: William Mo, Christopher A. Vaiana, Chris J. Myers
Date: 2024-12-19

Abstract:
Modern biotechnology necessitates robust biosecurity protocols to address the risk of engineered biological threats. Current efforts focus on screening DNA and rejecting the synthesis of dangerous elements but face technical and logistical barriers. Screening should integrate into a broader strategy that addresses threats at multiple stages of development and deployment. The success of this approach hinges upon reliable detection, characterization, and attribution of engineered DNA. Recent advances notably aid the potential to both develop threats and analyze them. However, further work is needed to translate developments into biosecurity applications. This work reviews cutting-edge methods for DNA analysis and recommends avenues to improve biosecurity in an adaptable manner.

Abstract:
The three-dimensional (3D) architecture of the genome plays a crucial role in gene regulation and various human diseases. Short-read sequencing methods for measuring 3D genome organization are powerful, but they lack the ability to resolve individual human haplotypes or structurally complex regions. To address this, we present FiberFold, a deep learning model that combines convolutional neural networks and transformer architectures to accurately predict cell-type-specific and haplotype-specific 3D genome organization using multi-omic data from a single, long-read sequencing assay, Fiber-seq. By applying FiberFold to a cell line with allelic X-inactivation, we show that Topologically Associated Domains (TADs) are attenuated on the inactive chrX. Furthermore, FiberFold predicts significant changes to TADs surrounding a 13;X balanced translocation in a patient with a rare Mendelian disease. FiberFold showcases the power of integrating long-read epigenomic sequencing with deep learning tools to investigate fundamental chromatin biology as well as the molecular basis of human disease.

Title: Synthetic promoter design for new microbial chassis
Authors: James Gilman, John Love
Date: 2016-06-09

Abstract:
The judicious choice of promoter to drive gene expression remains one of the most important considerations for synthetic biology applications. Constitutive promoter sequences isolated from nature are often used in laboratory settings or small-scale commercial production streams, but unconventional microbial chassis for new synthetic biology applications require well-characterized, robust and orthogonal promoters. This review provides an overview of the opportunities and challenges for synthetic promoter discovery and design, including molecular methodologies, such as saturation mutagenesis of flanking regions and mutagenesis by error-prone PCR, as well as the less familiar use of computational and statistical analyses for de novo promoter design.

Title: Towards parsimonious generative modeling of RNA families
Authors: Francesco Calvanese, Camille N Lambert, Philippe Nghe, Francesco Zamponi, Martin Weigt
Date: 2024-06-10

Abstract:
Generative probabilistic models emerge as a new paradigm in data-driven, evolution-informed design of biomolecular sequences. This paper introduces a novel approach, called Edge Activation Direct Coupling Analysis (eaDCA), tailored to the characteristics of RNA sequences, with a strong emphasis on simplicity, efficiency, and interpretability. eaDCA explicitly constructs sparse coevolutionary models for RNA families, achieving performance levels comparable to more complex methods while utilizing a significantly lower number of parameters. Our approach demonstrates efficiency in generating artificial RNA sequences that closely resemble their natural counterparts in both statistical analyses and SHAPE-MaP experiments, and in predicting the effect of mutations. Notably, eaDCA provides a unique feature: estimating the number of potential functional sequences within a given RNA family. For example, in the case of cyclic di-AMP riboswitches (RF00379), our analysis suggests the existence of approximately 10 39 functional nucleotide sequences. While huge compared to the known <4000 natural sequences, this number represents only a tiny fraction of the vast pool of nearly 10 82 possible nucleotide sequences of the same length (136 nucleotides). These results underscore the promise of sparse and interpretable generative models, such as eaDCA, in enhancing our understanding of the expansive RNA sequence space.

Abstract:
RNA structures are dynamic. As a consequence, mutational effects can be hard to rationalize with reference to a single static native structure. We reasoned that deep mutational scanning experiments, which couple molecular function to fitness, should capture mutational effects across multiple conformational states simultaneously. Here, we provide a proof-of-principle that this is indeed the case, using the self-splicing group I intron from Tetrahymena thermophila as a model system. We comprehensively mutagenized two 4-bp segments of the intron. These segments first come together to form the P1 extension (P1ex) helix at the 5’ splice site. Following cleavage at the 5’ splice site, the two halves of the helix dissociate to allow formation of an alternative helix (P10) at the 3’ splice site. Using an in vivo reporter system that couples splicing activity to fitness in E . coli , we demonstrate that fitness is driven jointly by constraints on P1ex and P10 formation. We further show that patterns of epistasis can be used to infer the presence of intramolecular pleiotropy. Using a machine learning approach that allows quantification of mutational effects in a genotype-specific manner, we demonstrate that the fitness landscape can be deconvoluted to implicate P1ex or P10 as the effective genetic background in which molecular fitness is compromised or enhanced. Our results highlight deep mutational scanning as a tool to study alternative conformational states, with the capacity to provide critical insights into the structure, evolution and evolvability of RNAs as dynamic ensembles. Our findings also suggest that, in the future, deep mutational scanning approaches might help reverse-engineer multiple alternative or successive conformations from a single fitness landscape.

Abstract:
Proteins are fundamental biomolecules composed of one or more chains of amino acids. They are essential for all living organisms, contributing to various biological functions and regulatory processes. Alterations in protein structures and functions are closely linked to diseases, emphasizing the need for in-depth study. A thorough understanding of these associations is crucial for developing targeted and more effective therapeutic strategies.Computational analyses of biomedical data facilitate the identification of specific patterns in proteins associated with diseases, providing novel insights into their biological roles. This study introduces a computational approach designed to detect relevant sequence patterns within proteins. These patterns, characterized by specific amino acid arrangements, can be critical for protein functionality. The proposed methodology was applied to proteins targeted by drugs used in lung cancer treatment, a disease that remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Given that non-small cell lung cancer represents 85–90% of all lung cancer cases, it was selected as the primary focus of this study.Significant sequence patterns were identified, establishing connections between drug-target proteins and proteins associated with lung cancer. Based on these findings, a novel computational framework was developed to extend this pattern-based analysis to proteins linked to other diseases. By employing this approach, relationships between lung cancer drug-target proteins and proteins associated with four additional cancer types were uncovered. These associations, characterized by shared amino acid sequence features, suggest potential opportunities for drug repurposing. Furthermore, validation through an extensive literature review confirmed biological links between lung cancer drug-target proteins and proteins related to other malignancies, reinforcing the potential of this methodology for identifying new therapeutic applications.

Title: Self-driving laboratories to autonomously navigate the protein fitness landscape
Authors: Jacob T. Rapp, Bennett J. Bremer, Philip A. Romero
Date: 2024-01

Abstract:
Protein engineering has nearly limitless applications across chemistry, energy and medicine, but creating new proteins with improved or novel functions remains slow, labor-intensive and inefficient. Here we present the Self-driving Autonomous Machines for Protein Landscape Exploration (SAMPLE) platform for fully autonomous protein engineering. SAMPLE is driven by an intelligent agent that learns protein sequence–function relationships, designs new proteins and sends designs to a fully automated robotic system that experimentally tests the designed proteins and provides feedback to improve the agent’s understanding of the system. We deploy four SAMPLE agents with the goal of engineering glycoside hydrolase enzymes with enhanced thermal tolerance. Despite showing individual differences in their search behavior, all four agents quickly converge on thermostable enzymes. Self-driving laboratories automate and accelerate the scientific discovery process and hold great potential for the fields of protein engineering and synthetic biology.

Date: 2022-01-26

Abstract:
Predicting function from sequence is a central problem of biology. Currently, this is possible only locally in a narrow mutational neighborhood around a wildtype sequence rather than globally from any sequence. Using random mutant libraries, we developed a biophysical model that accounts for multiple features of σ 70 binding bacterial promoters to predict constitutive gene expression levels from any sequence. We experimentally and theoretically estimated that 10–20% of random sequences lead to expression and ~80% of non-expressing sequences are one mutation away from a functional promoter. The potential for generating expression from random sequences is so pervasive that selection acts against σ 70 -RNA polymerase binding sites even within inter-genic, promoter-containing regions. This pervasiveness of σ 70 -binding sites implies that emergence of promoters is not the limiting step in gene regulatory evolution. Ultimately, the inclusion of novel features of promoter function into a mechanistic model enabled not only more accurate predictions of gene expression levels, but also identified that promoters evolve more rapidly than previously thought.

Abstract:
Traditionally, studies in microbial genomics have focused on single-genomes from cultured species, thereby limiting their focus to the small percentage of species that can be cultured outside their natural environment. Fortunately, recent advances in high-throughput sequencing and computational analyses have ushered in the new field of metagenomics, which aims to decode the genomes of microbes from natural communities without the need for cultivation. Although metagenomic studies have shed a great deal of insight into bacterial diversity and coding capacity, several computational challenges remain due to the massive size and complexity of metagenomic sequence data. Current tools and techniques are reviewed in this paper which address challenges in 1) genomic fragment annotation, 2) phylogenetic reconstruction, 3) functional classification of samples, and 4) interpreting complementary metaproteomics and metametabolomics data. Also surveyed are important applications of metagenomic studies, including microbial forensics and the roles of microbial communities in shaping human health and soil ecology.

Abstract:
Engineered programmable RNA sensors have been applied in low-cost diagnostics, endogenous RNA detection, and multi-input genetic circuits. However, designing, producing, and screening high-performance RNA sensors remains time consuming and labor intensive. Here, we present an automated plasmid assembly pipeline using liquid handling robotics to enable high-throughput construction of plasmids with arbitrary sequences. We compare automated and manual assembly methods using the NGS Hamilton Microlab STAR across two plasmid backbones to evaluate efficiency and reliability. As a proof of concept, we use this modular platform to construct 144 total plasmids encoding riboregulators targeting diverse viral targets along with their cognate trigger sequences. We further demonstrate that the assembled plasmids are functional in both bacterial and cell-free expression systems.

Abstract:
Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) are segments of proteins without stable three-dimensional structures. As this flexibility allows them to interact with diverse binding partners, IDRs play key roles in cell signaling and gene expression. Despite the prevalence and importance of IDRs in eukaryotic proteomes and various biological processes, associating them with specific molecular functions remains a significant challenge due to their high rates of sequence evolution. However, by comparing the observed values of various IDR-associated properties against those generated under a simulated model of evolution, a recent study found most IDRs across the entire yeast proteome contain conserved features. Furthermore, it showed clusters of IDRs with common “evolutionary signatures,” i . e . patterns of conserved features, were associated with specific biological functions. To determine if similar patterns of conservation are found in the IDRs of other systems, in this work we applied a series of phylogenetic models to over 7,500 orthologous IDRs identified in the Drosophila genome to dissect the forces driving their evolution. By comparing models of constrained and unconstrained continuous trait evolution using the Brownian motion and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models, respectively, we identified signals of widespread constraint, indicating conservation of distributed features is mechanism of IDR evolution common to multiple biological systems. In contrast to the previous study in yeast, however, we observed limited evidence of IDR clusters with specific biological functions, which suggests a more complex relationship between evolutionary constraints and function in the IDRs of multicellular organisms.

Abstract:
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a heritable and incurable disease defined by the degeneration of motor neurons (MNs), yet the genetics of ALS remain partially understood. Using a genomic deep learning-powered whole-genome analysis of 6,715 ALS patients, we identify four rare noncoding variants associated with patient survival, including chr7:76,009,472:C>T which is linked to a 70.6% reduction in survival. Genetic editing of this variant into iPSC-derived MNs increases CCDC146 expression and exacerbates ALS-specific phenotypes including TDP-43 mislocalization. We reveal that CCDC146 was located within the basal body of primary cilia in human MNs, and that cilia structure and function is impaired by CCDC146 overexpression but is restored by its depletion. Suppressing CCDC146 using an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) completely rescues ALS-specific survival defects in neurons derived from both sporadic and familial patients, and it extends survival and reverses TDP-43 pathology in an aggressive ALS mouse model. Taken together, CCDC146 is a new modifier of ALS survival that acts via the primary cilia of MNs. ASO targeting of CCDC146 is a potential therapeutic approach for both sporadic and genetic forms of ALS, particularly because congenital absence of CCDC146 is well tolerated.

Abstract:
As synthetic biology permeates society, the signal processing circuits in engineered living systems must be customized to meet practical demands. Towards this mission, novel regulatory mechanisms and genetic circuits with unprecedented complexity have been implemented over the past decade. These regulatory mechanisms, such as transcription and translation control, could be integrated into hybrid circuits termed “multi-level circuits”. The multi-level circuit design will tremendously benefit the current genetic circuit design paradigm, from modifying basic circuit dynamics to facilitating real-world applications, unleashing our capabilities to customize cellular signal processing and address global challenges through synthetic biology.

Title: Unveil cis -acting combinatorial mRNA motifs by interpreting deep neural network
Authors: Xiaocheng Zeng, Zheng Wei, Qixiu Du, Jiaqi Li, Zhen Xie, Xiaowo Wang
Date: 2024-07

Abstract:
 Cis -acting mRNA elements play a key role in the regulation of mRNA stability and translation efficiency. Revealing the interactions of these elements and their impact plays a crucial role in understanding the regulation of the mRNA translation process, which supports the development of mRNA-based medicine or vaccines. Deep neural networks (DNN) can learn complex cis -regulatory codes from RNA sequences. However, extracting these cis -regulatory codes efficiently from DNN remains a significant challenge. Here, we propose a method based on our toolkit NeuronMotif and motif mutagenesis, which not only enables the discovery of diverse and high-quality motifs but also efficiently reveals motif interactions. By interpreting deep-learning models, we have discovered several crucial motifs that impact mRNA translation efficiency and stability, as well as some unknown motifs or motif syntax, offering novel insights for biologists. Furthermore, we note that it is challenging to enrich motif syntax in datasets composed of randomly generated sequences, and they may not contain sufficient biological signals. The source code and data used to produce the results and analyses presented in this manuscript are available from GitHub ( https://github.com/WangLabTHU/combmotif )

Title: Bacteria as computers making computers
Authors: Antoine Danchin
Date: 2009-01

Abstract:
Various efforts to integrate biological knowledge into networks of interactions have produced a lively microbial systems biology. Putting molecular biology and computer sciences in perspective, we review another trend in systems biology, in which recursivity and information replace the usual concepts of differential equations, feedback and feedforward loops and the like. Noting that the processes of gene expression separate the genome from the cell machinery, we analyse the role of the separation between machine and program in computers. However, computers do not make computers. For cells to make cells requires a specific organization of the genetic program, which we investigate using available knowledge. Microbial genomes are organized into a paleome (the name emphasizes the role of the corresponding functions from the time of the origin of life), comprising a constructor and a replicator, and a cenome (emphasizing community-relevant genes), made up of genes that permit life in a particular context. The cell duplication process supposes rejuvenation of the machine and replication of the program. The paleome also possesses genes that enable information to accumulate in a ratchet-like process down the generations. The systems biology must include the dynamics of information creation in its future developments.

Title: Big data and deep learning for RNA biology
Authors: Hyeonseo Hwang, Hyeonseong Jeon, Nagyeong Yeo, Daehyun Baek
Date: 2024-06-14

Abstract:
The exponential growth of big data in RNA biology (RB) has led to the development of deep learning (DL) models that have driven crucial discoveries. As constantly evidenced by DL studies in other fields, the successful implementation of DL in RB depends heavily on the effective utilization of large-scale datasets from public databases. In achieving this goal, data encoding methods, learning algorithms, and techniques that align well with biological domain knowledge have played pivotal roles. In this review, we provide guiding principles for applying these DL concepts to various problems in RB by demonstrating successful examples and associated methodologies. We also discuss the remaining challenges in developing DL models for RB and suggest strategies to overcome these challenges.

Title: An Attention‐Based Deep Neural Network Model to Detect Cis‐Regulatory Elements at the Single‐Cell Level From Multi‐Omics Data
Authors: Ken Murakami, Keita Iida, Mariko Okada
Date: 2025-02-04

Abstract:
Cis‐regulatory elements (cREs) play a crucial role in regulating gene expression and determining cell differentiation and state transitions. To capture the heterogeneous transitions of cell states associated with these processes, detecting cRE activity at the single‐cell level is essential. However, current analytical methods can only capture the average behavior of cREs in cell populations, thereby obscuring cell‐specific variations. To address this limitation, we proposed an attention‐based deep neural network framework that integrates DNA sequences, genomic distances, and single‐cell multi‐omics data to detect cREs and their activities in individual cells. Our model shows higher accuracy in identifying cREs within single‐cell multi‐omics data from healthy human peripheral blood mononuclear cells than other existing methods. Furthermore, it clusters cells more precisely based on predicted cRE activities, enabling a finer differentiation of cell states. When applied to publicly available single‐cell data from patients with glioma, the model successfully identified tumor‐specific SOX2 activity. Additionally, it revealed the heterogeneous activation of the ZEB1 transcription factor, a regulator of epithelial‐to‐mesenchymal transition‐related genes, which conventional methods struggle to detect. Overall, our model is a powerful tool for detecting cRE regulation at the single‐cell level, which may contribute to revealing drug resistance mechanisms in cell sub‐populations.

Authors: Ana R Baião, Zhaoxiang Cai, Rebecca C Poulos, Phillip J Robinson, Roger R Reddel, Qing Zhong, Susana Vinga, Emanuel Gonçalves
Date: 2025-07

Abstract:
The rapid advancement of high-throughput sequencing and other assay technologies has resulted in the generation of large and complex multi-omics datasets, offering unprecedented opportunities for advancing precision medicine. However, multi-omics data integration remains challenging due to the high-dimensionality, heterogeneity, and frequency of missing values across data types. Computational methods leveraging statistical and machine learning approaches have been developed to address these issues and uncover complex biological patterns, improving our understanding of disease mechanisms. Here, we comprehensively review state-of-the-art multi-omics integration methods with a focus on deep generative models, particularly variational autoencoders (VAEs) that have been widely used for data imputation, augmentation, and batch effect correction. We explore the technical aspects of VAE loss functions and regularisation techniques, including adversarial training, disentanglement, and contrastive learning. Moreover, we highlight recent advancements in foundation models and multimodal data integration, outlining future directions in precision medicine research.

Title: Comparative Analysis of Deep Learning Models for Predicting Causative Regulatory Variants
Authors: Gaetano Manzo, Kathryn Borkowski, Ivan Ovcharenko
Date: 2025-06-11

Abstract:
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous noncoding variants associated with complex human diseases, disorders, and traits. However, resolving the uncertainty between GWAS association and causality remains a significant challenge. The small subset of noncoding GWAS variants with causative effects on gene regulatory elements can only be detected through accurate methods that assess the impact of DNA sequence variation on gene regulatory activity. Deep learning models, such as those based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transformers, have gained prominence in predicting the regulatory effects of genetic variants, particularly in enhancers, by learning patterns from genomic and epigenomic data. Despite their potential, selecting the most suitable model is hindered by the lack of standardized benchmarks, consistent training conditions, and performance evaluation criteria in existing reviews. This study evaluates state-of-the-art deep learning models for predicting the effects of genetic variants on enhancer activity using nine datasets stemming from MPRA, raQTL, and eQTL experiments, profiling the regulatory impact of 54,859 SNPs across four human cell lines. The results reveal that CNN models, such as TREDNet and SEI, consistently outperform other architectures in predicting the regulatory impact of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). However, hybrid CNN-transformer models, such as Borzoi, display superior performance in identifying causal SNPs within a linkage disequilibrium block. While fine-tuning enhances the performance of transformer-based models, it remains insufficient to surpass CNN and hybrid models when evaluated under optimized conditions.

Authors: Jiajia Liu, Mengyuan Yang, Yankai Yu, Haixia Xu, Tiangang Wang, Kang Li, Xiaobo Zhou
Date: 2025-01-31

Abstract:
Large language models (LLMs) are a class of artificial intelligence models based on deep learning, which have great performance in various tasks, especially in natural language processing (NLP). Large language models typically consist of artificial neural networks with numerous parameters, trained on large amounts of unlabeled input using self-supervised or semi-supervised learning. However, their potential for solving bioinformatics problems may even exceed their proficiency in modeling human language. In this review, we will provide a comprehensive overview of the essential components of large language models (LLMs) in bioinformatics, spanning genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, drug discovery, and single-cell analysis. Key aspects covered include tokenization methods for diverse data types, the architecture of transformer models, the core attention mechanism, and the pre-training processes underlying these models. Additionally, we will introduce currently available foundation models and highlight their downstream applications across various bioinformatics domains. Finally, drawing from our experience, we will offer practical guidance for both LLM users and developers, emphasizing strategies to optimize their use and foster further innovation in the field.

Title: EpiGePT: a Pretrained Transformer model for epigenomics
Authors: Zijing Gao, Qiao Liu, Wanwen Zeng, Rui Jiang, Wing Hung Wong
Date: 2024-02-03

Abstract:
The inherent similarities between natural language and biological sequences have given rise to great interest in adapting the transformer-based large language models (LLMs) underlying recent breakthroughs in natural language processing (references), for applications in genomics. However, current LLMs for genomics suffer from several limitations such as the inability to include chromatin interactions in the training data, and the inability to make prediction in new cellular contexts not represented in the training data. To mitigate these problems, we propose EpiGePT, a transformer-based pretrained language model for predicting context-specific epigenomic signals and chromatin contacts. By taking the context-specific activities of transcription factors (TFs) and 3D genome interactions into consideration, EpiGePT offers wider applicability and deeper biological insights than models trained on DNA sequence only. In a series of experiments, EpiGePT demonstrates superior performance in a diverse set of epigenomic signals prediction tasks when compared to existing methods. In particular, our model enables cross-cell-type prediction of long-range interactions and offers insight on the functional impact of genetic variants under different cellular contexts. These new capabilities will enhance the usefulness of LLM in the study of gene regulatory mechanisms. We provide free online prediction service of EpiGePT through http://health.tsinghua.edu.cn/epigept/ .

Title: Interpretable deep learning in single-cell omics
Authors: Manoj M Wagle, Siqu Long, Carissa Chen, Chunlei Liu, Pengyi Yang
Date: 2024-06

Abstract:
Single-cell omics technologies have enabled the quantification of molecular profiles in individual cells at an unparalleled resolution. Deep learning, a rapidly evolving sub-field of machine learning, has instilled a significant interest in single-cell omics research due to its remarkable success in analysing heterogeneous high-dimensional single-cell omics data. Nevertheless, the inherent multi-layer nonlinear architecture of deep learning models often makes them ‘black boxes’ as the reasoning behind predictions is often unknown and not transparent to the user. This has stimulated an increasing body of research for addressing the lack of interpretability in deep learning models, especially in single-cell omics data analyses, where the identification and understanding of molecular regulators are crucial for interpreting model predictions and directing downstream experimental validations. In this work, we introduce the basics of single-cell omics technologies and the concept of interpretable deep learning. This is followed by a review of the recent interpretable deep learning models applied to various single-cell omics research. Lastly, we highlight the current limitations and discuss potential future directions.

Title: Deep Learning Methods for Omics Data Imputation
Authors: Lei Huang, Meng Song, Hui Shen, Huixiao Hong, Ping Gong, Hong-Wen Deng, Chaoyang Zhang
Date: 2023-10-07

Abstract:
Missing values are common in omics data and can arise from various causes. Imputation approaches offer a different means of handling missing data instead of utilizing only subsets of the dataset. However, the imputation of missing omics data is a challenging task. Advanced imputation methods such as deep learning-based approaches can model complex patterns and relationships in large and high-dimensional omics datasets, making them an increasingly popular choice for imputation. This review provides an overview of deep learning-based methods for omics data imputation, focusing on model architectures and multi-omics data imputation. This review also examines the challenges and opportunities that are associated with deep learning methods in this field. One common problem in omics data analysis is missing values, which can arise due to various reasons, such as poor tissue quality and insufficient sample volumes. Instead of discarding missing values and related data, imputation approaches offer an alternative means of handling missing data. However, the imputation of missing omics data is a non-trivial task. Difficulties mainly come from high dimensionality, non-linear or non-monotonic relationships within features, technical variations introduced by sampling methods, sample heterogeneity, and the non-random missingness mechanism. Several advanced imputation methods, including deep learning-based methods, have been proposed to address these challenges. Due to its capability of modeling complex patterns and relationships in large and high-dimensional datasets, many researchers have adopted deep learning models to impute missing omics data. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the currently available deep learning-based methods for omics imputation from the perspective of deep generative model architectures such as autoencoder, variational autoencoder, generative adversarial networks, and Transformer, with an emphasis on multi-omics data imputation. In addition, this review also discusses the opportunities that deep learning brings and the challenges that it might face in this field.

Title: EPInformer: a scalable deep learning framework for gene expression prediction by integrating promoter-enhancer sequences with multimodal epigenomic data
Authors: Jiecong Lin, Ruibang Luo, Luca Pinello
Date: 2024-08-01

Abstract:
Transcriptional regulation, critical for cellular differentiation and adaptation to environmental changes, involves coordinated interactions among DNA sequences, regulatory proteins, and chromatin architecture. Despite extensive data from consortia like ENCODE, understanding the dynamics of cis-regulatory elements (CREs) in gene expression remains challenging. Deep learning is a powerful tool for learning gene expression and epigenomic signals from DNA sequences, exhibiting superior performance compared to conventional machine learning approaches. However, even the most advanced deep learning-based methods may fall short in capturing the regulatory effects of distal elements such as enhancers, limiting their predictive accuracy. In addition, these methods may require significant resources to train or to adapt to newly generated data. To address these challenges, we present EPInformer, a scalable deep-learning framework for predicting gene expression by integrating promoter-enhancer interactions with their sequences, epigenomic signals, and chromatin contacts. Our model outperforms existing gene expression prediction models in rigorous cross-chromosome validation, accurately recapitulates enhancer-gene interactions validated by CRISPR perturbation experiments, and identifies crucial transcription factor motifs within regulatory sequences. EPInformer is available as open-source software at https://github.com/pinellolab/EPInformer .

Title: Evaluating the representational power of pre-trained DNA language models for regulatory genomics
Authors: Ziqi Tang, Nirali Somia, Yiyang Yu, Peter K. Koo
Date: 2025-07-14

Abstract:
The emergence of genomic language models (gLMs) offers an unsupervised approach to learning a wide diversity of cis-regulatory patterns in the non-coding genome without requiring labels of functional activity generated by wet-lab experiments. Previous evaluations have shown that pre-trained gLMs can be leveraged to improve predictive performance across a broad range of regulatory genomics tasks, albeit using relatively simple benchmark datasets and baseline models. Since the gLMs in these studies were tested upon fine-tuning their weights for each downstream task, determining whether gLM representations embody a foundational understanding of cis-regulatory biology remains an open question. Here, we evaluate the representational power of pre-trained gLMs to predict and interpret cell-type-specific functional genomics data that span DNA and RNA regulation for six major functional genomics prediction tasks. Our findings suggest that probing the representations of current pre-trained gLMs do not offer substantial advantages over conventional machine learning approaches that use one-hot encoded sequences. Nevertheless, highly tuned supervised models trained from scratch using one-hot encoded sequences can achieve performance competitive with or better than pre-trained models across the datasets explored in this study. This work highlights a major gap with current gLMs, raising potential issues in conventional pre-training strategies for the non-coding genome.

Simultaneously, the exponential growth of computational power and big data now promote the application of machine learning for biological research. In this regard, machine learning shows great potential in the refinement of genome editing systems and crop improvement.

Title: deepTFBS: Improving within‐ and Cross‐Species Prediction of Transcription Factor Binding Using Deep Multi‐Task and Transfer Learning
Authors: Jingjing Zhai, Yuzhou Zhang, Chujun Zhang, Xiaotong Yin, Minggui Song, Chenglong Tang, Pengjun Ding, Zenglin Li, Chuang Ma
Date: 2025-05-24

Abstract:
The precise prediction of transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) is crucial in understanding gene regulation. In this study, deepTFBS, a comprehensive deep learning (DL) framework that builds a robust DNA language model of TF binding grammar for accurately predicting TFBSs within and across plant species is presented. Taking advantages of multi‐task DL and transfer learning, deepTFBS is capable of leveraging the knowledge learned from large‐scale TF binding profiles to enhance the prediction of TFBSs under small‐sample training and cross‐species prediction tasks. When tested using available information on 359 Arabidopsis TFs, deepTFBS outperformed previously described prediction strategies, including position weight matrix, deepSEA and DanQ, with a 244.49%, 49.15%, and 23.32% improvement of the area under the precision‐recall curve (PRAUC), respectively. Further cross‐species prediction of TFBS in wheat showed that deepTFBS yielded a significant PRAUC improvement of 30.6% over these three baseline models. deepTFBS can also utilize information from gene conservation and binding motifs, enabling efficient TFBS prediction in species where experimental data availability is limited. A case study, focusing on the WUSCHEL ( WUS ) transcription factor, illustrated the potential use of deepTFBS in cross‐species applications, in our example between Arabidopsis and wheat. deepTFBS is publically available at https://github.com/cma2015/deepTFBS .

Title: Uncovering the Relationship between Tissue-Specific TF-DNA Binding and Chromatin Features through a Transformer-Based Model
Authors: Yongqing Zhang, Yuhang Liu, Zixuan Wang, Maocheng Wang, Shuwen Xiong, Guo Huang, Meiqin Gong
Date: 2022-10-26

Abstract:
Chromatin features can reveal tissue-specific TF-DNA binding, which leads to a better understanding of many critical physiological processes. Accurately identifying TF-DNA bindings and constructing their relationships with chromatin features is a long-standing goal in the bioinformatic field. However, this has remained elusive due to the complex binding mechanisms and heterogeneity among inputs. Here, we have developed the GHTNet (General Hybrid Transformer Network), a transformer-based model to predict TF-DNA binding specificity. The GHTNet decodes the relationship between tissue-specific TF-DNA binding and chromatin features via a specific input scheme of alternative inputs and reveals important gene regions and tissue-specific motifs. Our experiments show that the GHTNet has excellent performance, achieving about a 5% absolute improvement over existing methods. The TF-DNA binding mechanism analysis shows that the importance of TF-DNA binding features varies across tissues. The best predictor is based on the DNA sequence, followed by epigenomics and shape. In addition, cross-species studies address the limited data, thus providing new ideas in this case. Moreover, the GHTNet is applied to interpret the relationship among TFs, chromatin features, and diseases associated with AD46 tissue. This paper demonstrates that the GHTNet is an accurate and robust framework for deciphering tissue-specific TF-DNA binding and interpreting non-coding regions.

Title: Learning the Regulatory Code of Gene Expression
Authors: Jan Zrimec, Filip Buric, Mariia Kokina, Victor Garcia, Aleksej Zelezniak
Date: 2021-06-10

Abstract:
Data-driven machine learning is the method of choice for predicting molecular phenotypes from nucleotide sequence, modeling gene expression events including protein-DNA binding, chromatin states as well as mRNA and protein levels. Deep neural networks automatically learn informative sequence representations and interpreting them enables us to improve our understanding of the regulatory code governing gene expression. Here, we review the latest developments that apply shallow or deep learning to quantify molecular phenotypes and decode the cis -regulatory grammar from prokaryotic and eukaryotic sequencing data. Our approach is to build from the ground up, first focusing on the initiating protein-DNA interactions, then specific coding and non-coding regions, and finally on advances that combine multiple parts of the gene and mRNA regulatory structures, achieving unprecedented performance. We thus provide a quantitative view of gene expression regulation from nucleotide sequence, concluding with an information-centric overview of the central dogma of molecular biology.

Abstract:
Recent advancements in high-throughput sequencing technologies have significantly enhanced our ability to unravel the intricacies of gene regulatory processes. A critical challenge in this endeavor is the identification of variant effects, a key factor in comprehending the mechanisms underlying gene regulation. Non-coding variants, constituting over 90% of all variants, have garnered increasing attention in recent years. The exploration of gene variant impacts and regulatory mechanisms has spurred the development of various deep learning approaches, providing new insights into the global regulatory landscape through the analysis of extensive genetic data. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of the development of the non-coding variants models based on bulk and single-cell sequencing data and their model-based interpretation and downstream tasks. This review delineates the popular sequencing technologies for epigenetic profiling and deep learning approaches for discerning the effects of non-coding variants. Additionally, we summarize the limitations of current approaches in variant effect prediction research and outline opportunities for improvement. We anticipate that our study will offer a practical and useful guide for the bioinformatic community to further advance the unraveling of genetic variant effects.

Date: 2025-09-02

Abstract:
Interpreting the effects of variants within the human genome and proteome is essential for analysing disease risk, predicting medication response, and developing personalised health interventions. Due to the intrinsic similarities between the structure of natural languages and genetic sequences, natural language processing techniques have demonstrated great applicability in computational variant effect prediction. In particular, the advent of the Transformer has led to significant advancements in the field. However, transformer-based models are not without their limitations, and a number of extensions and alternatives have been developed to improve results and enhance computational efficiency. This systematic review investigates over 50 different language modelling approaches to computational variant effect prediction over the past decade, analysing the main architectures, and identifying key trends and future directions. Benchmarking of the reviewed models remains unachievable at present, primarily due to the lack of shared evaluation frameworks and data sets.

Abstract:
Adenine base editors (ABEs) and cytosine base editors (CBEs) enable the single nucleotide editing of targeted DNA sites avoiding generation of double strand breaks, however, the genomic features that influence the outcomes of base editing in vivo still remain to be characterized. High-throughput datasets from lentiviral integrated libraries were used to investigate the sequence features affecting base editing outcomes, but the effects of endogenous factors beyond the DNA sequences are still largely unknown. Here the base editing outcomes of ABE and CBE were evaluated in mammalian cells for 5012 endogenous genomic sites and 11,868 genome-integrated target sequences, with 4654 genomic sites sharing the same target sequences. The comparative analyses revealed that the editing outcomes of ABE and CBE at endogenous sites were substantially different from those obtained using genome-integrated sequences. We found that the base editing efficiency at endogenous target sites of both ABE and CBE was influenced by endogenous factors, including epigenetic modifications and transcriptional activity. A deep-learning algorithm referred as BE_Endo, was developed based on the endogenous factors and sequence information from our genomic datasets, and it yielded unprecedented accuracy in predicting the base editing outcomes. These findings along with the developed computational algorithms may facilitate future application of BEs for scientific research and clinical gene therapy.

Date: 2021-09-25

Abstract:
Accurate identification of Transcriptional Regulator binding locations is essential for analysis of genomic regions, including Cis Regulatory Elements. The customary NGS approaches, predominantly ChIP-Seq, can be obscured by data anomalies and biases which are difficult to detect without supervision. Here, we develop a method to leverage the usual combinations between many experimental series to mark such atypical peaks. We use deep learning to perform a lossy compression of the genomic regions’ representations with multiview convolutions. Using artificial data, we show that our method correctly identifies groups of correlating series and evaluates CRE according to group completeness. It is then applied to the ReMap database’s large volume of curated ChIP-seq data. We show that peaks lacking known biological correlators are singled out and less confirmed in real data. We propose normalization approaches useful in interpreting black-box models. Our approach detects peaks that are less corroborated than average. It can be extended to other similar problems, and can be interpreted to identify correlation groups. It is implemented in an open-source tool called atyPeak.

Date: 2025-04

Abstract:
With the adoption of foundation models (FMs), artificial intelligence (AI) has become increasingly significant in bioinformatics and has successfully addressed many historical challenges, such as pre-training frameworks, model evaluation and interpretability. FMs demonstrate notable proficiency in managing large-scale, unlabeled datasets, because experimental procedures are costly and labor intensive. In various downstream tasks, FMs have consistently achieved noteworthy results, demonstrating high levels of accuracy in representing biological entities. A new era in computational biology has been ushered in by the application of FMs, focusing on both general and specific biological issues. In this review, we introduce recent advancements in bioinformatics FMs employed in a variety of downstream tasks, including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, drug discovery and single-cell analysis. Our aim is to assist scientists in selecting appropriate FMs in bioinformatics, according to four model types: language FMs, vision FMs, graph FMs and multimodal FMs. In addition to understanding molecular landscapes, AI technology can establish the theoretical and practical foundation for continued innovation in molecular biology.

Title: Machine learning tools for deciphering the regulatory logic of enhancers in health and disease
Authors: Spyros Foutadakis, Vasiliki Bourika, Ioanna Styliara, Panagiotis Koufargyris, Asimina Safarika, Eleni Karakike
Date: 2025-08-13

Abstract:
Transcriptional enhancers are DNA regulatory elements that control the levels and spatiotemporal patterns of gene expression during development, homeostasis, and pathophysiological processes. Enhancer identification and characterization at the genome-wide scale rely on their structural characteristics, such as chromatin accessibility, binding of transcription factors and cofactors, activating histone modifications, 3D interactions with other regulatory elements, as well as functional characteristics measured by massively parallel reporter assays and sequence conservation approaches. Recently, machine learning approaches and particularly deep learning models (Enformer, BPNet, DeepSTARR, etc.) allow the prediction of enhancers, the impact of variants on their activity and the inference of transcription factor binding sites, leading, among others, to the construction of the first completely synthetic enhancers. We present the above computational tools and discuss their diverse applications towards cracking the enhancer regulatory code, which could have far-reaching ramifications for uncovering essential regulatory mechanisms and diagnosing and treating diseases. With an emphasis on sepsis, a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients, we discuss computational approaches to identify sepsis-associated endotypes, circuits, and immune cell states and signatures characteristic of this condition, which could aid in developing novel therapies.

Title: Designing interpretable deep learning applications for functional genomics: a quantitative analysis
Authors: Arno van Hilten, Sonja Katz, Edoardo Saccenti, Wiro J Niessen, Gennady V Roshchupkin
Date: 2024-09

Abstract:
Deep learning applications have had a profound impact on many scientific fields, including functional genomics. Deep learning models can learn complex interactions between and within omics data; however, interpreting and explaining these models can be challenging. Interpretability is essential not only to help progress our understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying traits and diseases but also for establishing trust in these model’s efficacy for healthcare applications. Recognizing this importance, recent years have seen the development of numerous diverse interpretability strategies, making it increasingly difficult to navigate the field. In this review, we present a quantitative analysis of the challenges arising when designing interpretable deep learning solutions in functional genomics.

Title: Genome-wide identification and characterization of DNA enhancers with a stacked multivariate fusion framework
Authors: Yansong Wang, Zilong Hou, Yuning Yang, Ka-chun Wong, Xiangtao Li
Date: 2022-12

Abstract:
Enhancers are short non-coding DNA sequences outside of the target promoter regions that can be bound by specific proteins to increase a gene’s transcriptional activity, which has a crucial role in the spatiotemporal and quantitative regulation of gene expression. However, enhancers do not have a specific sequence motifs or structures, and their scattered distribution in the genome makes the identification of enhancers from human cell lines particularly challenging. Here we present a novel, stacked multivariate fusion framework called SMFM, which enables a comprehensive identification and analysis of enhancers from regulatory DNA sequences as well as their interpretation. Specifically, to characterize the hierarchical relationships of enhancer sequences, multi-source biological information and dynamic semantic information are fused to represent regulatory DNA enhancer sequences. Then, we implement a deep learning–based sequence network to learn the feature representation of the enhancer sequences comprehensively and to extract the implicit relationships in the dynamic semantic information. Ultimately, an ensemble machine learning classifier is trained based on the refined multi-source features and dynamic implicit relations obtained from the deep learning-based sequence network. Benchmarking experiments demonstrated that SMFM significantly outperforms other existing methods using several evaluation metrics. In addition, an independent test set was used to validate the generalization performance of SMFM by comparing it to other state-of-the-art enhancer identification methods. Moreover, we performed motif analysis based on the contribution scores of different bases of enhancer sequences to the final identification results. Besides, we conducted interpretability analysis of the identified enhancer sequences based on attention weights of EnhancerBERT, a fine-tuned BERT model that provides new insights into exploring the gene semantic information likely to underlie the discovered enhancers in an interpretable manner. Finally, in a human placenta study with 4,562 active distal gene regulatory enhancers, SMFM successfully exposed tissue-related placental development and the differential mechanism, demonstrating the generalizability and stability of our proposed framework.

Title: CRMnet: A deep learning model for predicting gene expression from large regulatory sequence datasets
Authors: Ke Ding, Gunjan Dixit, Brian J. Parker, Jiayu Wen
Date: 2023-03-14

Abstract:
Recent large datasets measuring the gene expression of millions of possible gene promoter sequences provide a resource to design and train optimized deep neural network architectures to predict expression from sequences. High predictive performance due to the modeling of dependencies within and between regulatory sequences is an enabler for biological discoveries in gene regulation through model interpretation techniques. To understand the regulatory code that delineates gene expression, we have designed a novel deep-learning model (CRMnet) to predict gene expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae . Our model outperforms the current benchmark models and achieves a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.971 and a mean squared error of 3.200. Interpretation of informative genomic regions determined from model saliency maps, and overlapping the saliency maps with known yeast motifs, supports that our model can successfully locate the binding sites of transcription factors that actively modulate gene expression. We compare our model's training times on a large compute cluster with GPUs and Google TPUs to indicate practical training times on similar datasets.

Title: Genome-wide cis-decoding for expression design in tomato using cistrome data and explainable deep learning
Authors: Takashi Akagi, Kanae Masuda, Eriko Kuwada, Kouki Takeshita, Taiji Kawakatsu, Tohru Ariizumi, Yasutaka Kubo, Koichiro Ushijima, Seiichi Uchida
Date: 2022-06

Abstract:
In the evolutionary history of plants, variation in cis -regulatory elements (CREs) resulting in diversification of gene expression has played a central role in driving the evolution of lineage-specific traits. However, it is difficult to predict expression behaviors from CRE patterns to properly harness them, mainly because the biological processes are complex. In this study, we used cistrome datasets and explainable convolutional neural network (CNN) frameworks to predict genome-wide expression patterns in tomato ( Solanum lycopersicum ) fruit from the DNA sequences in gene regulatory regions. By fixing the effects of trans-acting factors using single cell-type spatiotemporal transcriptome data for the response variables, we developed a prediction model for crucial expression patterns in the initiation of tomato fruit ripening. Feature visualization of the CNNs identified nucleotide residues critical to the objective expression pattern in each gene, and their effects were validated experimentally in ripening tomato fruit. This cis -decoding framework will not only contribute to the understanding of the regulatory networks derived from CREs and transcription factor interactions, but also provides a flexible means of designing alleles for optimized expression.

Title: KansformerEPI: a deep learning framework integrating KAN and transformer for predicting enhancer–promoter interactions
Authors: Tianjiao Zhang, Saihong Shao, Hongfei Zhang, Zhongqian Zhao, Xingjie Zhao, Xiang Zhang, Zhenxing Wang, Guohua Wang
Date: 2025-05

Abstract:
Enhancer–promoter interaction (EPI) is a critical component of gene regulation. Accurately predicting EPIs across diverse cell types can advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind transcriptional regulation and provide valuable insights into the onset and progression of related diseases. At present, large-scale genome-wide EPI predictions typically rely on computational approaches. However, most of these methods focus on predicting EPIs within a single cell line and lack a global perspective encompassing multiple cell lines. Furthermore, they often fail to fully account for the nonlinear relationships between features, leading to suboptimal prediction accuracy. In this study, we propose KansformerEPI, a global EPI prediction model designed for multiple cell lines. The model is built on Kansformer, an encoder that integrates KAN and Transformer, effectively capturing the nonlinear relationships among various epigenetic and sequence features. We utilized KansformerEPI to achieve cross-tissue prediction of EPIs across different cell types. This approach enhances the model’s scalability, eliminating the complexity of designing separate prediction models for individual tissues. As a result, our model is applicable to various tissues, thereby reducing dependency on extensive datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that KansformerEPI surpasses existing methods such as TransEPI, TargetFinder, and SPEID in both accuracy and stability of EPI predictions across datasets including HMEC, IMR90, K562, and NHEK.

Abstract:
The human genome contains millions of candidate cis -regulatory elements (cCREs) with cell-type-specific activities that shape both health and many disease states 1 . However, we lack a functional understanding of the sequence features that control the activity and cell-type-specific features of these cCREs. Here we used lentivirus-based massively parallel reporter assays (lentiMPRAs) to test the regulatory activity of more than 680,000 sequences, representing an extensive set of annotated cCREs among three cell types (HepG2, K562 and WTC11), and found that 41.7% of these sequences were active. By testing sequences in both orientations, we find promoters to have strand-orientation biases and their 200-nucleotide cores to function as non-cell-type-specific ‘on switches’ that provide similar expression levels to their associated gene. By contrast, enhancers have weaker orientation biases, but increased tissue-specific characteristics. Utilizing our lentiMPRA data, we develop sequence-based models to predict cCRE function and variant effects with high accuracy, delineate regulatory motifs and model their combinatorial effects. Testing a lentiMPRA library encompassing 60,000 cCREs in all three cell types further identified factors that determine cell-type specificity. Collectively, our work provides an extensive catalogue of functional CREs in three widely used cell lines and showcases how large-scale functional measurements can be used to dissect regulatory grammar.

Title: Recent trends in RNA informatics: a review of machine learning and deep learning for RNA secondary structure prediction and RNA drug discovery
Authors: Kengo Sato, Michiaki Hamada
Date: 2023-07

Abstract:
Computational analysis of RNA sequences constitutes a crucial step in the field of RNA biology. As in other domains of the life sciences, the incorporation of artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques into RNA sequence analysis has gained significant traction in recent years. Historically, thermodynamics-based methods were widely employed for the prediction of RNA secondary structures; however, machine learning-based approaches have demonstrated remarkable advancements in recent years, enabling more accurate predictions. Consequently, the precision of sequence analysis pertaining to RNA secondary structures, such as RNA–protein interactions, has also been enhanced, making a substantial contribution to the field of RNA biology. Additionally, artificial intelligence and machine learning are also introducing technical innovations in the analysis of RNA–small molecule interactions for RNA-targeted drug discovery and in the design of RNA aptamers, where RNA serves as its own ligand. This review will highlight recent trends in the prediction of RNA secondary structure, RNA aptamers and RNA drug discovery using machine learning, deep learning and related technologies, and will also discuss potential future avenues in the field of RNA informatics.

Title: UNADON: Transformer-based model to predict genome-wide chromosome spatial position
Authors: Muyu Yang, Jian Ma
Date: 2023-07-01

Abstract:
The spatial positioning of chromosomes relative to functional nuclear bodies is intertwined with genome functions such as transcription. However, the sequence patterns and epigenomic features that collectively influence chromatin spatial positioning in a genome-wide manner are not well understood. Here, we develop a new transformer-based deep learning model called UNADON, which predicts the genome-wide cytological distance to a specific type of nuclear body, as measured by TSA-seq, using both sequence features and epigenomic signals. Evaluations of UNADON in four cell lines (K562, H1, HFFc6, HCT116) show high accuracy in predicting chromatin spatial positioning to nuclear bodies when trained on a single cell line. UNADON also performed well in an unseen cell type. Importantly, we reveal potential sequence and epigenomic factors that affect large-scale chromatin compartmentalization to nuclear bodies. Together, UNADON provides new insights into the principles between sequence features and large-scale chromatin spatial localization, which has important implications for understanding nuclear structure and function.

Abstract:
Neural networks have emerged as immensely powerful tools in predicting functional genomic regions, notably evidenced by recent successes in deciphering gene regulatory logic. However, a systematic evaluation of how model architectures and training strategies impact genomics model performance is lacking. To address this gap, we held a DREAM Challenge where competitors trained models on a dataset of millions of random promoter DNA sequences and corresponding expression levels, experimentally determined in yeast, to best capture the relationship between regulatory DNA and gene expression. For a robust evaluation of the models, we designed a comprehensive suite of benchmarks encompassing various sequence types. While some benchmarks produced similar results across the top-performing models, others differed substantially. All top-performing models used neural networks, but diverged in architectures and novel training strategies, tailored to genomics sequence data. To dissect how architectural and training choices impact performance, we developed the Prix Fixe framework to divide any given model into logically equivalent building blocks. We tested all possible combinations for the top three models and observed performance improvements for each. The DREAM Challenge models not only achieved state-of-the-art results on our comprehensive yeast dataset but also consistently surpassed existing benchmarks on Drosophila and human genomic datasets. Overall, we demonstrate that high-quality gold-standard genomics datasets can drive significant progress in model development.

Title: A review of AI-based radiogenomics in neurodegenerative disease
Authors: Huanjing Liu, Xiao Zhang, Qian Liu
Date: 2025-02-20

Abstract:
Neurodegenerative diseases are chronic, progressive conditions that cause irreversible damage to the nervous system, particularly in aging populations. Early diagnosis is a critical challenge, as these diseases often develop slowly and without clear symptoms until significant damage has occurred. Recent advances in radiomics and genomics have provided valuable insights into the mechanisms of these diseases by identifying specific imaging features and genomic patterns. Radiogenomics enhances diagnostic capabilities by linking genomics with imaging phenotypes, offering a more comprehensive understanding of disease progression. The growing field of artificial intelligence (AI), including machine learning and deep learning, opens new opportunities for improving the accuracy and timeliness of these diagnoses. This review examines the application of AI-based radiogenomics in neurodegenerative diseases, summarizing key model designs, performance metrics, publicly available data resources, significant findings, and future research directions. It provides a starting point and guidance for those seeking to explore this emerging area of study.

Title: DeepDualEnhancer: A Dual-Feature Input DNABert Based Deep Learning Method for Enhancer Recognition
Authors: Tao Song, Haonan Song, Zhiyi Pan, Yuan Gao, Huanhuan Dai, Xun Wang
Date: 2024-11-01

Abstract:
Enhancers are cis-regulatory DNA sequences that are widely distributed throughout the genome. They can precisely regulate the expression of target genes. Since the features of enhancer segments are difficult to detect, we propose DeepDualEnhancer, a DNABert-based method using a multi-scale convolutional neural network, BiLSTM, for enhancer identification. We first designed the DeepDualEnhancer method based only on the DNA sequence input. It mainly consists of a multi-scale Convolutional Neural Network, and BiLSTM to extract features by DNABert and embedding, respectively. Meanwhile, we collected new datasets from the enhancer–promoter interaction field and designed the method DeepDualEnhancer-genomic for inputting DNA sequences and genomic signals, which consists of the transformer sequence attention. Extensive comparisons of our method with 20 other excellent methods through 5-fold cross validation, ablation experiments, and an independent test demonstrated that DeepDualEnhancer achieves the best performance. It is also found that the inclusion of genomic signals helps the enhancer recognition task to be performed better.

Abstract:
Identifying transcriptional cis -regulatory elements (CREs) and understanding their role in gene expression are essential for the precise manipulation of gene expression and associated phenotypes. This knowledge is fundamental for advancing genetic engineering and improving crop traits. We here demonstrate that CREs can be accurately predicted and utilized to precisely regulate gene expression beyond the range of natural variation. We firstly build two sequence-to-expression deep learning models to respectively identify distal and proximal CREs by combining them with interpretability methods in multiple crops. A large number of distal CREs are verified for enhancer activity in vitro using UMI-STARR-seq on 12,000 synthesized sequences. These comprehensively characterized CREs and their precisely predicted effects further contribute to the design of in silico editing schemes for precise engineering of gene expression. We introduce a novel concept of “editingplasticity” to evaluate the potential of promoter editing to alter expression of each gene. As a proof of concept, both exhaustive prediction and random knockout mutants are analyzed within the promoter region of ZmVTE4 , a key gene affecting α-tocopherol content in maize. A high degree of agreement between predicted and observed expression is observed, extending the range of natural variation and thereby allowing the creation of an optimal phenotype. Our study provides a robust computational framework that advances knowledge-guided gene editing for precise regulation of gene expression and crop improvement. By reliably predicting and validating CREs, we offer a tool for targeted genetic modifications, enhancing desirable traits in crops.

Title: Deciphering 3'UTR Mediated Gene Regulation Using Interpretable Deep Representation Learning
Authors: Yuning Yang, Gen Li, Kuan Pang, Wuxinhao Cao, Zhaolei Zhang, Xiangtao Li
Date: 2024-08-19

Abstract:
The 3' untranslated regions (3'UTRs) of messenger RNAs contain many important cis‐regulatory elements that are under functional and evolutionary constraints. It is hypothesized that these constraints are similar to grammars and syntaxes in human languages and can be modeled by advanced natural language techniques such as Transformers, which has been very effective in modeling complex protein sequence and structures. Here 3UTRBERT is described, which implements an attention‐based language model, i.e., Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). 3UTRBERT is pre‐trained on aggregated 3'UTR sequences of human mRNAs in a task‐agnostic manner; the pre‐trained model is then fine‐tuned for specific downstream tasks such as identifying RBP binding sites, m6A RNA modification sites, and predicting RNA sub‐cellular localizations. Benchmark results show that 3UTRBERT generally outperformed other contemporary methods in each of these tasks. More importantly, the self‐attention mechanism within 3UTRBERT allows direct visualization of the semantic relationship between sequence elements and effectively identifies regions with important regulatory potential. It is expected that 3UTRBERT model can serve as the foundational tool to analyze various sequence labeling tasks within the 3'UTR fields, thus enhancing the decipherability of post‐transcriptional regulatory mechanisms.

Abstract:
Chromatin interactions create spatial proximity between distal regulatory elements and target genes in the genome, which has an important impact on gene expression, transcriptional regulation, and phenotypic traits. To date, several methods have been developed for predicting gene expression. However, existing methods do not take into consideration the effect of chromatin interactions on target gene expression, thus potentially reducing the accuracy of gene expression prediction and mining of important regulatory elements. In this study, we developed a highly accurate deep learning-based gene expression prediction model (DeepCBA) based on maize chromatin interaction data. Compared with existing models, DeepCBA exhibits higher accuracy in expression classification and expression value prediction. The average Pearson correlation coefficients (PCCs) for predicting gene expression using gene promoter proximal interactions, proximal-distal interactions, and both proximal and distal interactions were 0.818, 0.625, and 0.929, respectively, representing an increase of 0.357, 0.16, and 0.469 over the PCCs obtained with traditional methods that use only gene proximal sequences. Some important motifs were identified through DeepCBA; they were enriched in open chromatin regions and expression quantitative trait loci and showed clear tissue specificity. Importantly, experimental results for the maize flowering-related gene ZmRap2.7 and the tillering-related gene ZmTb1 demonstrated the feasibility of DeepCBA for exploration of regulatory elements that affect gene expression. Moreover, promoter editing and verification of two reported genes ( ZmCLE7 and ZmVTE4 ) demonstrated the utility of DeepCBA for the precise design of gene expression and even for future intelligent breeding. DeepCBA is available at http://www.deepcba.com/ or http://124.220.197.196/ .

Abstract:
Recombinant biopharmaceuticals including antigens, antibodies, hormones, cytokines, single-chain variable fragments, and peptides have been used as vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics. Plant molecular pharming is a robust platform that uses plants as an expression system to produce simple and complex recombinant biopharmaceuticals on a large scale. Plant system has several advantages over other host systems such as humanized expression, glycosylation, scalability, reduced risk of human or animal pathogenic contaminants, rapid and cost-effective production. Despite many advantages, the expression of recombinant proteins in plant system is hindered by some factors such as non-human post-translational modifications, protein misfolding, conformation changes and instability. Artificial intelligence (AI) plays a vital role in various fields of biotechnology and in the aspect of plant molecular pharming, a significant increase in yield and stability can be achieved with the intervention of AI-based multi-approach to overcome the hindrance factors. Current limitations of plant-based recombinant biopharmaceutical production can be circumvented with the aid of synthetic biology tools and AI algorithms in plant-based glycan engineering for protein folding, stability, viability, catalytic activity and organelle targeting. The AI models, including but not limited to, neural network, support vector machines, linear regression, Gaussian process and regressor ensemble, work by predicting the training and experimental data sets to design and validate the protein structures thereby optimizing properties such as thermostability, catalytic activity, antibody affinity, and protein folding. This review focuses on, integrating systems engineering approaches and AI-based machine learning and deep learning algorithms in protein engineering and host engineering to augment protein production in plant systems to meet the ever-expanding therapeutics market.

Abstract:
The data explosion driven by advancements in genomic research, such as high-throughput sequencing techniques, is constantly challenging conventional methods used in genomics. In parallel with the urgent demand for robust algorithms, deep learning has succeeded in various fields such as vision, speech, and text processing. Yet genomics entails unique challenges to deep learning, since we expect a superhuman intelligence that explores beyond our knowledge to interpret the genome from deep learning. A powerful deep learning model should rely on the insightful utilization of task-specific knowledge. In this paper, we briefly discuss the strengths of different deep learning models from a genomic perspective so as to fit each particular task with proper deep learning-based architecture, and we remark on practical considerations of developing deep learning architectures for genomics. We also provide a concise review of deep learning applications in various aspects of genomic research and point out current challenges and potential research directions for future genomics applications. We believe the collaborative use of ever-growing diverse data and the fast iteration of deep learning models will continue to contribute to the future of genomics.

Title: PTFSpot: deep co-learning on transcription factors and their binding regions attains impeccable universality in plants
Authors: Sagar Gupta, Veerbhan Kesarwani, Umesh Bhati, Jyoti, Ravi Shankar
Date: 2024-07

Abstract:
Unlike animals, variability in transcription factors (TFs) and their binding regions (TFBRs) across the plants species is a major problem that most of the existing TFBR finding software fail to tackle, rendering them hardly of any use. This limitation has resulted into underdevelopment of plant regulatory research and rampant use of Arabidopsis -like model species, generating misleading results. Here, we report a revolutionary transformers-based deep-learning approach, PTFSpot, which learns from TF structures and their binding regions’ co-variability to bring a universal TF-DNA interaction model to detect TFBR with complete freedom from TF and species-specific models’ limitations. During a series of extensive benchmarking studies over multiple experimentally validated data, it not only outperformed the existing software by >30% lead but also delivered consistently >90% accuracy even for those species and TF families that were never encountered during the model-building process. PTFSpot makes it possible now to accurately annotate TFBRs across any plant genome even in the total lack of any TF information, completely free from the bottlenecks of species and TF-specific models.

Date: 2023-01-23

Abstract:
Gene regulation is a central topic in cell biology. Advances in omics technologies and the accumulation of omics data have provided better opportunities for gene regulation studies than ever before. For this reason deep learning, as a data-driven predictive modeling approach, has been successfully applied to this field during the past decade. In this article, we aim to give a brief yet comprehensive overview of representative deep-learning methods for gene regulation. Specifically, we discuss and compare the design principles and datasets used by each method, creating a reference for researchers who wish to replicate or improve existing methods. We also discuss the common problems of existing approaches and prospectively introduce the emerging deep-learning paradigms that will potentially alleviate them. We hope that this article will provide a rich and up-to-date resource and shed light on future research directions in this area.

Title: Deep Learning for Elucidating Modifications to RNA—Status and Challenges Ahead
Authors: Sarah Rennie
Date: 2024-05-15

Abstract:
RNA-binding proteins and chemical modifications to RNA play vital roles in the co- and post-transcriptional regulation of genes. In order to fully decipher their biological roles, it is an essential task to catalogue their precise target locations along with their preferred contexts and sequence-based determinants. Recently, deep learning approaches have significantly advanced in this field. These methods can predict the presence or absence of modification at specific genomic regions based on diverse features, particularly sequence and secondary structure, allowing us to decipher the highly non-linear sequence patterns and structures that underlie site preferences. This article provides an overview of how deep learning is being applied to this area, with a particular focus on the problem of mRNA-RBP binding, while also considering other types of chemical modification to RNA. It discusses how different types of model can handle sequence-based and/or secondary-structure-based inputs, the process of model training, including choice of negative regions and separating sets for testing and training, and offers recommendations for developing biologically relevant models. Finally, it highlights four key areas that are crucial for advancing the field.

Title: LOGOWheat: deep learning–based prediction of regulatory effects for noncoding variants in wheats
Authors: Lingpeng Kong, Hong Cheng, Kun Zhu, Bo Song
Date: 2025-01

Abstract:
Identifying the regulatory effects of noncoding variants presents a significant challenge. Recently, the accumulation of epigenomic profiling data in wheat has provided an opportunity to model the functional impacts of these variants. In this study, we introduce Language of Genome for Wheat (LOGOWheat), a deep learning–based tool designed to predict the regulatory effects of noncoding variants in wheat. LOGOWheat initially employs a self-attention-based, contextualized pretrained language model to acquire bidirectional representations of the unlabeled wheat reference genome. Epigenomic profiling data are also collected and utilized to fine-tune the model, enabling it to discern the regulatory code inherent in genomic sequences. The test results suggest that LOGOWheat is highly effective in predicting multiple chromatin features, achieving an average area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of 0.8531 and an average area under the precision–recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.7633. Two case studies illustrate and demonstrate the main functions provided by LOGOWheat: assigning scores and prioritizing causal variants within a given variant set and constructing a saturated mutagenesis map in silico to discover high-impact sites or functional motifs in a given sequence. Finally, we propose the concept of extracting potential functional variations from the wheat population by integrating evolutionary conservation information. LOGOWheat is available at http://logowheat.cn/ .

Title: From tradition to innovation: conventional and deep learning frameworks in genome annotation
Authors: Zhaojia Chen, Noor ul Ain, Qian Zhao, Xingtan Zhang
Date: 2024-05

Abstract:
Following the milestone success of the Human Genome Project, the ‘Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE)’ initiative was launched in 2003 to unearth information about the numerous functional elements within the genome. This endeavor coincided with the emergence of numerous novel technologies, accompanied by the provision of vast amounts of whole-genome sequences, high-throughput data such as ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq. Extracting biologically meaningful information from this massive dataset has become a critical aspect of many recent studies, particularly in annotating and predicting the functions of unknown genes. The core idea behind genome annotation is to identify genes and various functional elements within the genome sequence and infer their biological functions. Traditional wet-lab experimental methods still rely on extensive efforts for functional verification. However, early bioinformatics algorithms and software primarily employed shallow learning techniques; thus, the ability to characterize data and features learning was limited. With the widespread adoption of RNA-Seq technology, scientists from the biological community began to harness the potential of machine learning and deep learning approaches for gene structure prediction and functional annotation. In this context, we reviewed both conventional methods and contemporary deep learning frameworks, and highlighted novel perspectives on the challenges arising during annotation underscoring the dynamic nature of this evolving scientific landscape.

Title: A phenotypic drug discovery approach by latent interaction in deep learning
Authors: Tat Wai Billy Yu
Date: 2024-10

Abstract:
Contemporary drug discovery paradigms rely heavily on binding assays about the bio-physicochemical processes. However, this dominant approach suffers from overlooked higher-order interactions arising from the intricacies of molecular mechanisms, such as those involving cis -regulatory elements. It introduces potential impairments and restrains the potential development of computational methods. To address this limitation, I developed a deep learning model that leverages an end-to-end approach, relying exclusively on therapeutic information about drugs. By transforming textual representations of drug and virus genetic information into high-dimensional latent representations, this method evades the challenges arising from insufficient information about binding specificities. Its strengths lie in its ability to implicitly consider complexities such as epistasis and chemical–genetic interactions, and to handle the pervasive challenge of data scarcity. Through various modeling skills and data augmentation techniques, the proposed model demonstrates outstanding performance in out-of-sample validations, even in scenarios with unknown complex interactions. Furthermore, the study highlights the importance of chemical diversity for model training. While the method showcases the feasibility of deep learning in data-scarce scenarios, it reveals a promising alternative for drug discovery in situations where knowledge of underlying mechanisms is limited.

Title: Proformer: a hybrid macaron transformer model predicts expression values from promoter sequences
Authors: Il-Youp Kwak, Byeong-Chan Kim, Juhyun Lee, Taein Kang, Daniel J. Garry, Jianyi Zhang, Wuming Gong
Date: 2024-02-20

Abstract:
The breakthrough high-throughput measurement of the cis-regulatory activity of millions of randomly generated promoters provides an unprecedented opportunity to systematically decode the cis-regulatory logic that determines the expression values. We developed an end-to-end transformer encoder architecture named Proformer to predict the expression values from DNA sequences. Proformer used a Macaron-like Transformer encoder architecture, where two half-step feed forward (FFN) layers were placed at the beginning and the end of each encoder block, and a separable 1D convolution layer was inserted after the first FFN layer and in front of the multi-head attention layer. The sliding k -mers from one-hot encoded sequences were mapped onto a continuous embedding, combined with the learned positional embedding and strand embedding (forward strand vs. reverse complemented strand) as the sequence input. Moreover, Proformer introduced multiple expression heads with mask filling to prevent the transformer models from collapsing when training on relatively small amount of data. We empirically determined that this design had significantly better performance than the conventional design such as using the global pooling layer as the output layer for the regression task. These analyses support the notion that Proformer provides a novel method of learning and enhances our understanding of how cis-regulatory sequences determine the expression values.

Authors: Tianyi Li, Hui Xu, Shouzhen Teng, Mingrui Suo, Revocatus Bahitwa, Mingchi Xu, Yiheng Qian, Guillaume P. Ramstein, Baoxing Song, Edward S. Buckler, Hai Wang

Abstract:
The enormous variation space and obscure syntax rules of eukaryotic transcriptional regulatory DNA sequences hamper their rational design. Here, we developed PhytoExpr, a deep learning framework that reads regulatory DNA sequences to predict their messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) abundance and also the plant species they are from. PhytoExpr was trained over major clades of the plant kingdom to make predictions on unseen gene families from unseen species. The sequence features learned by PhytoExpr were enriched with conserved noncoding sequences, transcription factor binding sites, and eQTLs. We also fit PhytoExpr into two algorithms for the rational design of functional cis -regulatory variants for genome editing, as well as the de novo design of species-specific cis -regulatory DNA sequences for synthetic biology.

Title: Neur-Ally: a deep learning model for regulatory variant prediction based on genomic and epigenomic features in brain and its validation in certain neurological disorders
Authors: Anil Prakash, Moinak Banerjee
Date: 2025-06

Abstract:
Large-scale quantitative studies have identified significant genetic associations for various neurological disorders. Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) studies have shown the effect of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on the differential expression of genes in brain tissues. However, a large majority of the associations are contributed by SNPs in the noncoding regions that can have significant regulatory function but are often ignored. Besides, mutations that are in high linkage disequilibrium with actual regulatory SNPs will also show significant associations. Therefore, it is important to differentiate a regulatory noncoding SNP with a nonregulatory one. To resolve this, we developed a deep learning model named Neur-Ally, which was trained on epigenomic datasets from nervous tissue and cell line samples. The model predicts differential occurrence of regulatory features like chromatin accessibility, histone modifications, and transcription factor binding on genomic regions using DNA sequence as input. The model was used to predict the regulatory effect of neurological condition-specific noncoding SNPs using in silico mutagenesis. The effect of associated SNPs reported in genome-wide association studies of neurological condition, brain eQTLs, autism spectrum disorder, and reported probable regulatory SNPs in neurological conditions were predicted by Neur-Ally.

Title: Deep learning approaches for noncoding variant prioritization in neurodegenerative diseases
Authors: Alexander Y. Lan, M. Ryan Corces
Date: 2022-11-18

Abstract:
Determining how noncoding genetic variants contribute to neurodegenerative dementias is fundamental to understanding disease pathogenesis, improving patient prognostication, and developing new clinical treatments. Next generation sequencing technologies have produced vast amounts of genomic data on cell type-specific transcription factor binding, gene expression, and three-dimensional chromatin interactions, with the promise of providing key insights into the biological mechanisms underlying disease. However, this data is highly complex, making it challenging for researchers to interpret, assimilate, and dissect. To this end, deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool for genome analysis that can capture the intricate patterns and dependencies within these large datasets. In this review, we organize and discuss the many unique model architectures, development philosophies, and interpretation methods that have emerged in the last few years with a focus on using deep learning to predict the impact of genetic variants on disease pathogenesis. We highlight both broadly-applicable genomic deep learning methods that can be fine-tuned to disease-specific contexts as well as existing neurodegenerative disease research, with an emphasis on Alzheimer’s-specific literature. We conclude with an overview of the future of the field at the intersection of neurodegeneration, genomics, and deep learning.

Date: 2025-08-24

Abstract:
RNA‐targeting small molecules represent a transformative frontier in drug discovery, offering novel therapeutic avenues for diseases traditionally deemed undruggable. This review explores the latest advancements in the development of RNA‐binding small molecules, focusing on the current obstacles and promising avenues for future research. We highlight innovations in RNA structure determination, including X‐ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and cryo‐electron microscopy, which provide the foundation for rational drug design. The role of computational approaches, such as deep learning and molecular docking, is emphasized for enhancing RNA structure prediction and ligand screening efficiency. Additionally, we discuss the utility of focused libraries, DNA‐encoded libraries, and small‐molecule microarrays in identifying bioactive ligands, alongside the potential of fragment‐based drug discovery for exploring chemical space. Emerging strategies, such as RNA degraders and modulators of RNA–protein interactions, are reviewed for their therapeutic promise. Specifically, we underscore the pivotal role of artificial intelligence and machine learning in accelerating discovery and optimizing RNA‐targeted therapeutics. By synthesizing these advancements, this review aims to inspire further research and collaboration, unlocking the full potential of RNA‐targeting small molecules to revolutionize treatment paradigms for a wide range of diseases.

Title: TF-EPI: an interpretable enhancer-promoter interaction detection method based on Transformer
Authors: Bowen Liu, Weihang Zhang, Xin Zeng, Martin Loza, Sung-Joon Park, Kenta Nakai
Date: 2024-08-09

Abstract:
The detection of enhancer-promoter interactions (EPIs) is crucial for understanding gene expression regulation, disease mechanisms, and more. In this study, we developed TF-EPI, a deep learning model based on Transformer designed to detect these interactions solely from DNA sequences. The performance of TF-EPI surpassed that of other state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmark datasets. Importantly, by utilizing the attention mechanism of the Transformer, we identified distinct cell type-specific motifs and sequences in enhancers and promoters, which were validated against databases such as JASPAR and UniBind, highlighting the potential of our method in discovering new biological insights. Moreover, our analysis of the transcription factors (TFs) corresponding to these motifs and short sequence pairs revealed the heterogeneity and commonality of gene regulatory mechanisms and demonstrated the ability to identify TFs relevant to the source information of the cell line. Finally, the introduction of transfer learning can mitigate the challenges posed by cell type-specific gene regulation, yielding enhanced accuracy in cross-cell line EPI detection. Overall, our work unveils important sequence information for the investigation of enhancer-promoter pairs based on the attention mechanism of the Transformer, providing an important milestone in the investigation of cis-regulatory grammar.

Date: 2025-09

Abstract:
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline and memory loss, with few effective treatments currently available. The multifactorial nature of AD, shaped by genetic, environmental, and biological factors, complicates both research and clinical management. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and multi-omics technologies provide new opportunities to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of AD and identify early biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis. AI-driven approaches such as machine learning, deep learning, and network-based models have enabled the integration of large-scale genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and microbiomic datasets. These efforts have facilitated the discovery of novel molecular signatures and therapeutic targets. Methods including deep belief networks and joint deep semi-non-negative matrix factorization have contributed to improvements in disease classification and patient stratification. However, ongoing challenges remain. These include data heterogeneity, limited interpretability of complex models, a lack of large and diverse datasets, and insufficient clinical validation. The absence of standardized multi-omics data processing methods further restricts progress. This review systematically summarizes recent advances in AI-driven multi-omics research in AD, highlighting achievements in early diagnosis and biomarker discovery while discussing limitations and future directions needed to advance these approaches toward clinical application.

Title: Predicting gene expression using millions of yeast promoters reveals cis -regulatory logic
Authors: Tirtharaj Dash, Susanne Bornelöv
Date: 2025

Abstract:
Gene regulation involves complex interactions between transcription factors. While early attempts to predict gene expression were trained using naturally occurring promoters, gigantic parallel reporter assays have vastly expanded potential training data. Despite this, it is still unclear how to best use deep learning to study gene regulation. Here, we investigate the association between promoters and expression using Camformer, a residual convolutional neural network that ranked fourth in the Random Promoter DREAM Challenge 2022. We present the original model trained on 6.7 million sequences and investigate 270 alternative models to find determinants of model performance. Finally, we use explainable AI to uncover regulatory signals. Camformer accurately decodes the association between promoters and gene expression ( r 2 = 0.914 ± 0.003 , ρ = 0.962 ± 0.002 ) and provides a substantial improvement over previous state of the art. Using Grad-CAM and in silico mutagenesis, we demonstrate that our model learns both individual motifs and their hierarchy. For example, while an IME1 motif on its own increases gene expression, a co-occurring UME6 motif instead strongly reduces gene expression. Thus, deep learning models such as Camformer can provide detailed insights into cis -regulatory logic. Data and code are available at: https://github.com/Bornelov-lab/Camformer .

Title: DMLS: an automated pipeline to extract the Drosophila modular transcription regulators and targets from massive literature articles
Authors: Tzu-Hsien Yang, Yu-Huai Yu, Sheng-Hang Wu, Fang-Yuan Chang, Hsiu-Chun Tsai, Ya-Chiao Yang
Date: 2024

Abstract:
Transcription regulation in multicellular species is mediated by modular transcription factor (TF) binding site combinations termed cis -regulatory modules (CRMs). Such CRM-mediated transcription regulation determines the gene expression patterns during development. Biologists frequently investigate CRM transcription regulation on gene expressions. However, the knowledge of the target genes and regulatory TFs participating in the CRMs under study is mostly fragmentary throughout the literature. Researchers need to afford tremendous human resources to fully surf through the articles deposited in biomedical literature databases in order to obtain the information. Although several novel text-mining systems are now available for literature triaging, these tools do not specifically focus on CRM-related literature prescreening, failing to correctly extract the information of the CRM target genes and regulatory TFs from the literature. For this reason, we constructed a supportive auto-literature prescreener called Drosophila Modular transcription-regulation Literature Screener (DMLS) that achieves the following: (i) prescreens articles describing experiments on modular transcription regulation, (ii) identifies the described target genes and TFs of the CRMs under study for each modular transcription-regulation-describing article and (iii) features an automated and extendable pipeline to perform the task. We demonstrated that the final performance of DMLS in extracting the described target gene and regulatory TF lists of CRMs under study for given articles achieved test macro area under the ROC curve (auROC) = 89.7% and area under the precision-recall curve (auPRC) = 77.6%, outperforming the intuitive gene name-occurrence-counting method by at least 19.9% in auROC and 30.5% in auPRC. The web service and the command line versions of DMLS are available at https://cobis.bme.ncku.edu.tw/DMLS/  and  https://github.com/cobisLab/DMLS/ , respectively.

Title: UNADON: transformer-based model to predict genome-wide chromosome spatial position
Authors: Muyu Yang, Jian Ma
Date: 2023-06

Abstract:
The spatial positioning of chromosomes relative to functional nuclear bodies is intertwined with genome functions such as transcription. However, the sequence patterns and epigenomic features that collectively influence chromatin spatial positioning in a genome-wide manner are not well understood. Here, we develop a new transformer-based deep learning model called UNADON, which predicts the genome-wide cytological distance to a specific type of nuclear body, as measured by TSA-seq, using both sequence features and epigenomic signals. Evaluations of UNADON in four cell lines (K562, H1, HFFc6, HCT116) show high accuracy in predicting chromatin spatial positioning to nuclear bodies when trained on a single cell line. UNADON also performed well in an unseen cell type. Importantly, we reveal potential sequence and epigenomic factors that affect large-scale chromatin compartmentalization in nuclear bodies. Together, UNADON provides new insights into the principles between sequence features and large-scale chromatin spatial localization, which has important implications for understanding nuclear structure and function. The source code of UNADON can be found at https://github.com/ma-compbio/UNADON .

Title: DeepCORE: An interpretable multi-view deep neural network model to detect co-operative regulatory elements
Authors: Pramod Bharadwaj Chandrashekar, Hai Chen, Matthew Lee, Navid Ahmadinejad, Li Liu
Date: 2024-12

Abstract:
Gene transcription is an essential process involved in all aspects of cellular functions with significant impact on biological traits and diseases. This process is tightly regulated by multiple elements that co-operate to jointly modulate the transcription levels of target genes. To decipher the complicated regulatory network, we present a novel multi-view attention-based deep neural network that models the relationship between genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptional patterns and identifies co-operative regulatory elements (COREs). We applied this new method, named DeepCORE, to predict transcriptomes in various tissues and cell lines, which outperformed the state-of-the-art algorithms. Furthermore, DeepCORE contains an interpreter that extracts the attention values embedded in the deep neural network, maps the attended regions to putative regulatory elements, and infers COREs based on correlated attentions. The identified COREs are significantly enriched with known promoters and enhancers. Novel regulatory elements discovered by DeepCORE showed epigenetic signatures consistent with the status of histone modification marks.

Date: 2025

Abstract:
Transformer-based language models are making an impact in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). As relevant parallels can be drawn between biological sequences and natural languages, the models used in NLP can be easily extended and adapted for applications in bioinformatics. This paper introduces the recent developments of Transformer-based models in the context of nucleotide sequences. We have reviewed and analysed a large number of application-based papers on this subject, giving evidence of the main characterizing features and to the different approaches that may be adopted to customize such powerful computational machines. Besides discussing what Transformers do and may do for the analysis of biological sequences, we also provide an overview of what Transformers are and why they work. We believe this review will help the scientific community in understanding the application of Transformer-based language models to nucleotide sequences, and that will motivate the readers to build on idea of Transformers as well as the discussed methodologies to tackle different problems in the field of bioinformatics.

Abstract:
Genome annotation models that directly analyze DNA sequences are indispensable for modern biological research, enabling rapid and accurate identification of genes and other functional elements. Current annotation tools are typically developed for specific element classes and trained from scratch using supervised learning on datasets that are often limited in size. Here we frame the genome annotation problem as multilabel semantic segmentation and introduce a methodology for fine-tuning pretrained DNA foundation models to segment 14 different genic and regulatory elements at single-nucleotide resolution. We leverage the self-supervised pretrained model Nucleotide Transformer to develop a general segmentation model, SegmentNT, capable of processing DNA sequences up to 50-kb long and that achieves state-of-the-art performance on gene annotation, splice site and regulatory elements detection. We also integrated in our framework the foundation models Enformer and Borzoi, extending the sequence context up to 500 kb and enhancing performance on regulatory elements. Finally, we show that a SegmentNT model trained on human genomic elements generalizes to different species, and a multispecies SegmentNT model achieves strong generalization across unseen species. Our approach is readily extensible to additional models, genomic elements and species.

Date: 2025-10-09

Abstract:
Single-cell mapping of chromosomal accessibility patterns has recently led to improved predictive modelling of epigenomic activity from sequence. However, quantitative models explaining the epigenome using directly interpretable components are still lacking. Here we develop IceQream (IQ), a modelling strategy and inference algorithm for regressing accessibility from sequences using physical models of transcription factor (TF) binding. IQ uses spatial integration of sequences over a range of TF-DNA affinities and localization relative to the target locus. It infers TF effective concentrations as latent variables that activate or repress regulatory elements in a non-linear fashion. These are supplemented with synergistic and antagonistic pairwise interactions between TFs. Analysis of both human and mouse data shows that IQ derives similar, and in some cases, better performance compared to state-of-the-art deep neural network models. IQ provides an essential mechanistic and explicable baseline for further developments toward understanding gene and genome regulation from sequence.

Title: Fundamentals for predicting transcriptional regulations from DNA sequence patterns
Authors: Masaru Koido, Kohei Tomizuka, Chikashi Terao
Date: 2024-05-10

Abstract:
Cell-type-specific regulatory elements, cataloged through extensive experiments and bioinformatics in large-scale consortiums, have enabled enrichment analyses of genetic associations that primarily utilize positional information of the regulatory elements. These analyses have identified cell types and pathways genetically associated with human complex traits. However, our understanding of detailed allelic effects on these elements’ activities and on-off states remains incomplete, hampering the interpretation of human genetic study results. This review introduces machine learning methods to learn sequence-dependent transcriptional regulation mechanisms from DNA sequences for predicting such allelic effects (not associations). We provide a concise history of machine-learning-based approaches, the requirements, and the key computational processes, focusing on primers in machine learning. Convolution and self-attention, pivotal in modern deep-learning models, are explained through geometrical interpretations using dot products. This facilitates understanding of the concept and why these have been used for machine learning for DNA sequences. These will inspire further research in this genetics and genomics field.

Title: Supervised promoter recognition: a benchmark framework
Authors: Raul I. Perez Martell, Alison Ziesel, Hosna Jabbari, Ulrike Stege
Date: 2022-04-02

Abstract:
Deep learning has become a prevalent method in identifying genomic regulatory sequences such as promoters. In a number of recent papers, the performance of deep learning models has continually been reported as an improvement over alternatives for sequence-based promoter recognition. However, the performance improvements in these models do not account for the different datasets that models are evaluated on. The lack of a consensus dataset and procedure for benchmarking purposes has made the comparison of each model’s true performance difficult to assess. We present a framework called Supervised Promoter Recognition Framework (‘SUPR REF’) capable of streamlining the complete process of training, validating, testing, and comparing promoter recognition models in a systematic manner. SUPR REF includes the creation of biologically relevant benchmark datasets to be used in the evaluation process of deep learning promoter recognition models. We showcase this framework by comparing the models’ performances on alternative datasets, and properly evaluate previously published models on new benchmark datasets. Our results show that the reliability of deep learning ab initio promoter recognition models on eukaryotic genomic sequences is still not at a sufficient level, as overall performance is still low. These results originate from a subset of promoters, the well-known RNA Polymerase II core promoters. Furthermore, given the observational nature of these data, cross-validation results from small promoter datasets need to be interpreted with caution.

Title: scDIFF: automatic cell type annotation using scATAC-seq data by incorporating bulk-level genomic and epigenomic information in a deep diffusive transformer
Authors: Hao-Yu Wang, Hao Dong, Pu-Feng Du
Date: 2025-11

Abstract:
Single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (scATAC-seq) provides an opportunity to look deeply into the gene regulation mechanism at the single-cell resolution. With the rapid accumulation of scATAC-seq data, there is an urgent need for automatic cell type annotations using scATAC-seq data. Most existing methods rely on creating artificial gene activity matrix, due to the extreme sparsity nature of the scATAC-seq data. However, these methods fail to exploit the intrinsic information inherent in the scATAC-seq peaks. We present scDIFF, a diffusive transformer-based method that integrates bulk-level genomic and epigenomic information with scATAC-seq data to annotate cell types without creating artificial gene activity matrix. Our scDIFF performed constantly better than state-of-the-art methods on all 46 benchmarking pairs of reference and query datasets across different sequencing platforms. The complete implementation of scDIFF is well-documented and freely available on GitHub ( https://github.com/haoyu-wangg/scDIFF ).

Abstract:
We present SpliceTransformer (SpTransformer), a deep-learning framework that predicts tissue-specific RNA splicing alterations linked to human diseases based on genomic sequence. SpTransformer outperforms all previous methods on splicing prediction. Application to approximately 1.3 million genetic variants in the ClinVar database reveals that splicing alterations account for 60% of intronic and synonymous pathogenic mutations, and occur at different frequencies across tissue types. Importantly, tissue-specific splicing alterations match their clinical manifestations independent of gene expression variation. We validate the enrichment in three brain disease datasets involving over 164,000 individuals. Additionally, we identify single nucleotide variations that cause brain-specific splicing alterations, and find disease-associated genes harboring these single nucleotide variations with distinct expression patterns involved in diverse biological processes. Finally, SpTransformer analysis of whole exon sequencing data from blood samples of patients with diabetic nephropathy predicts kidney-specific RNA splicing alterations with 83% accuracy, demonstrating the potential to infer disease-causing tissue-specific splicing events. SpTransformer provides a powerful tool to guide biological and clinical interpretations of human diseases.

Title: CatLearning: highly accurate gene expression prediction from histone mark
Authors: Weining Lu, Yin Tang, Yu Liu, Shiyi Lin, Qifan Shuai, Bin Liang, Rongqing Zhang, Yu Cheng, Dong Fang
Date: 2024-09

Abstract:
Histone modifications, known as histone marks, are pivotal in regulating gene expression within cells. The vast array of potential combinations of histone marks presents a considerable challenge in decoding the regulatory mechanisms solely through biological experimental approaches. To overcome this challenge, we have developed a method called CatLearning. It utilizes a modified convolutional neural network architecture with a specialized adaptation Residual Network to quantitatively interpret histone marks and predict gene expression. This architecture integrates long-range histone information up to 500Kb and learns chromatin interaction features without 3D information. By using only one histone mark, CatLearning achieves a high level of accuracy. Furthermore, CatLearning predicts gene expression by simulating changes in histone modifications at enhancers and throughout the genome. These findings help comprehend the architecture of histone marks and develop diagnostic and therapeutic targets for diseases with epigenetic changes.

Title: Computational Methods for Single-cell DNA Methylome Analysis

Date: 2023-02

Abstract:
Dissecting intercellular epigenetic differences is key to understanding tissue heterogeneity. Recent advances in single-cell DNA methylome profiling have presented opportunities to resolve this heterogeneity at the maximum resolution. While these advances enable us to explore frontiers of chromatin biology and better understand cell lineage relationships, they pose new challenges in data processing and interpretation. This review surveys the current state of computational tools developed for single-cell DNA methylome data analysis. We discuss critical components of single-cell DNA methylome data analysis, including data preprocessing, quality control, imputation, dimensionality reduction, cell clustering, supervised cell annotation, cell lineage reconstruction, gene activity scoring, and integration with transcriptome data. We also highlight unique aspects of single-cell DNA methylome data analysis and discuss how techniques common to other single-cell omics data analyses can be adapted to analyze DNA methylomes. Finally, we discuss existing challenges and opportunities for future development.

Abstract:
Biological systems exhibit remarkable heterogeneity, characterized by intricate interplay among diverse cell types. Resolving the regulatory processes of specific cell types is crucial for delineating developmental mechanisms and disease etiologies. While single-cell sequencing methods such as scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq have revolutionized our understanding of individual cellular functions, adapting bulk genome-wide assays to achieve single-cell resolution of other genomic features remains a significant technical challenge. Here, we introduce Deep-learning-based DEconvolution of Tissue profiles with Accurate Interpretation of Locus-specific Signals (DeepDETAILS), a novel quasi-supervised framework to reconstruct cell-type-specific genomic signals with base-pair precision. DeepDETAILS’ core innovation lies in its ability to perform cross-modality deconvolution using scATAC-seq reference libraries for other bulk datasets, benefiting from the affordability and availability of scATAC-seq data. DeepDETAILS enables high-resolution mapping of genomic signals across diverse cell types, with great versatility for various omics datasets, including nascent transcript sequencing (such as PRO-cap and PRO-seq) and ChIP-seq for chromatin modifications. Our results demonstrate that DeepDETAILS significantly outperformed traditional statistical deconvolution methods. Using DeepDETAILS, we developed a comprehensive compendium of high-resolution nascent transcription and histone modification signals across 39 diverse human tissues and 86 distinct cell types. Furthermore, we applied our compendium to fine-map risk variants associated with Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC), a progressive cholestatic liver disorder, and revealed a potential etiology of the disease. Our tool and compendium provide invaluable insights into cellular complexity, opening new avenues for studying biological processes in various contexts.

Title: sscNOVA: a semi-supervised convolutional neural network for predicting functional regulatory variants in autoimmune diseases
Authors: Haibo Li, Zhenhua Yu, Fang Du, Lijuan Song, Yang Gao, Fangyuan Shi
Date: 2024-02-06

Abstract:
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of variants in the human genome with autoimmune diseases. However, identifying functional regulatory variants associated with autoimmune diseases remains challenging, largely because of insufficient experimental validation data. We adopt the concept of semi-supervised learning by combining labeled and unlabeled data to develop a deep learning-based algorithm framework, sscNOVA, to predict functional regulatory variants in autoimmune diseases and analyze the functional characteristics of these regulatory variants. Compared to traditional supervised learning methods, our approach leverages more variants’ data to explore the relationship between functional regulatory variants and autoimmune diseases. Based on the experimentally curated testing dataset and evaluation metrics, we find that sscNOVA outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we illustrate that sscNOVA can help to improve the prioritization of functional regulatory variants from lead single-nucleotide polymorphisms and the proxy variants in autoimmune GWAS data.

Title: Negative dataset selection impacts machine learning-based predictors for multiple bacterial species promoters
Authors: Marcelo González, Roberto E Durán, Michael Seeger, Mauricio Araya, Nicolás Jara
Date: 2025-04

Abstract:
Advances in bacterial promoter predictors based on machine learning have greatly improved identification metrics. However, existing models overlooked the impact of negative datasets, previously identified in GC-content discrepancies between positive and negative datasets in single-species models. This study aims to investigate whether multiple-species models for promoter classification are inherently biased due to the selection criteria of negative datasets. We further explore whether the generation of synthetic random sequences (SRS) that mimic GC-content distribution of promoters can partly reduce this bias. Multiple-species predictors exhibited GC-content bias when using CDS as a negative dataset, suggested by specificity and sensibility metrics in a species-specific manner, and investigated by dimensionality reduction. We demonstrated a reduction in this bias by using the SRS dataset, with less detection of background noise in real genomic data. In both scenarios DNABERT showed the best metrics. These findings suggest that GC-balanced datasets can enhance the generalizability of promoter predictors across Bacteria.

Date: 2025-02-10

Abstract:
RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is widely adopted for transcriptome analysis but has inherent biases that hinder the comprehensive detection and quantification of alternative splicing. To address this, we present an efficient targeted RNA-seq method that greatly enriches for splicing-informative junction-spanning reads. Local splicing variation sequencing (LSV-seq) utilizes multiplexed reverse transcription from highly scalable pools of primers anchored near splicing events of interest. Primers are designed using Optimal Prime, a novel machine learning algorithm trained on the performance of thousands of primer sequences. In experimental benchmarks, LSV-seq achieves high on-target capture rates and concordance with RNA-seq, while requiring significantly lower sequencing depth. Leveraging deep learning splicing code predictions, we used LSV-seq to target events with low coverage in GTEx RNA-seq data and newly discover hundreds of tissue-specific splicing events. Our results demonstrate the ability of LSV-seq to quantify splicing of events of interest at high-throughput and with exceptional sensitivity.

Abstract:
The human genome contains millions of candidate cis -regulatory elements (CREs) with cell-type-specific activities that shape both health and myriad disease states. However, we lack a functional understanding of the sequence features that control the activity and cell-type-specific features of these CREs. Here, we used lentivirus-based massively parallel reporter assays (lentiMPRAs) to test the regulatory activity of over 680,000 sequences, representing a nearly comprehensive set of all annotated CREs among three cell types (HepG2, K562, and WTC11), finding 41.7% to be functional. By testing sequences in both orientations, we find promoters to have significant strand orientation effects. We also observe that their 200 nucleotide cores function as non-cell-type-specific ‘on switches’ providing similar expression levels to their associated gene. In contrast, enhancers have weaker orientation effects, but increased tissue-specific characteristics. Utilizing our lentiMPRA data, we develop sequence-based models to predict CRE function with high accuracy and delineate regulatory motifs. Testing an additional lentiMPRA library encompassing 60,000 CREs in all three cell types, we further identified factors that determine cell-type specificity. Collectively, our work provides an exhaustive catalog of functional CREs in three widely used cell lines, and showcases how large-scale functional measurements can be used to dissect regulatory grammar.

Title: Multiomics-integrated deep language model enables in silico genome-wide detection of transcription factor binding site in unexplored biosamples
Authors: Zikun Yang, Xin Li, Lele Sheng, Ming Zhu, Xun Lan, Fei Gu
Date: 2024-01

Abstract:
Transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) are regulatory elements that have significant impact on transcription regulation and cell fate determination. Canonical motifs, biological experiments, and computational methods have made it possible to discover TFBS. However, most existing in silico TFBS prediction models are solely DNA-based, and are trained and utilized within the same biosample, which fail to infer TFBS in experimentally unexplored biosamples. Here, we propose TFBS prediction by modified TransFormer (TFTF), a multimodal deep language architecture which integrates multiomics information in epigenetic studies. In comparison to existing computational techniques, TFTF has state-of-the-art accuracy, and is also the first approach to accurately perform genome-wide detection for cell-type and species-specific TFBS in experimentally unexplored biosamples. Compared to peak calling methods, TFTF consistently discovers true TFBS in threshold tuning-free way, with higher recalled rates. The underlying mechanism of TFTF reveals greater attention to the targeted TF’s motif region in TFBS, and general attention to the entire peak region in non-TFBS. TFTF can benefit from the integration of broader and more diverse data for improvement and can be applied to multiple epigenetic scenarios. We provide a web server ( https://tftf.ibreed.cn/ ) for users to utilize TFTF model. Users can train TFTF model and discover TFBS with their own data.

By incorporating transcription factor activities and 3D genome interactions, EpiGePT outperforms existing methods in epigenomic signal prediction tasks, especially in cell-type-specific long-range interaction predictions and genetic variant impacts, advancing our understanding of gene regulation.

Authors: Kuan-Hao Chao, Majed Mohamed Magzoub, Emily Stoops, Sean Hackett, Johannes Linder, David R. Kelley
Date: 2025-09-21

Abstract:
Predicting gene expression from DNA sequence remains challenging due to complex regulatory codes. We introduce a masked DNA language model pretrained on 165 fungal genomes closely related to budding yeast that captures conserved regulatory grammar. Fine-tuning the LM on yeast RNA-seq data—including high-resolution transcriptional regulator induction time courses generated in this study—yielded Shorkie, a model that substantially improves gene expression prediction compared to baselines trained without self-supervision. Shorkie identified canonical transcription factor (TF) binding motifs and tracked their usage across induction experiments. Furthermore, Shorkie accurately predicted variant effects, outperforming leading sequence-to-expression models in cis -eQTL classification and achieving high concordance with massively parallel reporter assays. Interpretability analyses revealed Shorkie’s ability to resolve promoter dynamics, splicing signals, and temporal changes in regulatory motif usage. This framework demonstrates that evolutionary-scale pretraining combined with transfer learning substantially improves our ability to decode gene regulation from sequence, providing insights into noncoding variants and regulatory networks.

Title: A Comprehensive Review on RNA Subcellular Localization Prediction
Authors: Cece Zhang, Xuehuan Zhu, Nick Peterson, Jieqiong Wang, Shibiao Wan
Date: 2025-04-24

Abstract:
The subcellular localization of RNAs, including long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), messenger RNAs (mRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs) and other smaller RNAs, plays a critical role in determining their biological functions. For instance, lncRNAs are predominantly associated with chromatin and act as regulators of gene transcription and chromatin structure, while mRNAs are distributed across the nucleus and cytoplasm, facilitating the transport of genetic information for protein synthesis. Understanding RNA localization sheds light on processes like gene expression regulation with spatial and temporal precision. However, traditional wet lab methods for determining RNA localization, such as in situ hybridization, are often time-consuming, resource-demanding, and costly. To overcome these challenges, computational methods leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have emerged as powerful alternatives, enabling large-scale prediction of RNA subcellular localization. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the latest advancements in AI-based approaches for RNA subcellular localization prediction, covering various RNA types and focusing on sequence-based, image-based, and hybrid methodologies that combine both data types. We highlight the potential of these methods to accelerate RNA research, uncover molecular pathways, and guide targeted disease treatments. Furthermore, we critically discuss the challenges in AI/ML approaches for RNA subcellular localization, such as data scarcity and lack of benchmarks, and opportunities to address them. This review aims to serve as a valuable resource for researchers seeking to develop innovative solutions in the field of RNA subcellular localization and beyond.

Authors: Sreemoyee Ghosh, Shivam Kumar, Rohit Verma, Shabnam Ansari, Samrat Chatterjee, Milan Surjit
Date: 2025-05-21

Abstract:
Positive sense single strand RNA (+ssRNA) viruses are one of the evolutionary successful organisms and many of them pose a significant threat to human health. Diseases caused by +ssRNA viruses such as COVID-19, Flu and acute viral hepatitis are major public health concern worldwide. Therefore, a lot of research is focused at decoding the life cycle of +ssRNA viruses and develop specific antiviral therapeutics against them. Interaction of the viral RNA with virus-encoded proteins and host proteins drives the lifecycle and pathogenesis of +ssRNA viruses. Recent developments in computational and high-throughput omics-based experimental technologies offer the sensitivity and specificity for molecular characterization of these RNA-protein complexes. These are promising tools to revolutionize the field of +ssRNA virus research and pave the way for antiviral discovery. This review summarizes the current scientific resources available to characterize the RNA-protein interactome of +ssRNA viruses and provides an overview of the drug discovery pipeline for developing antivirals against pathogenic +ssRNA viruses.

Title: Explainable AI in Genomics: Transcription Factor Binding Site Prediction with Mixture of Experts
Authors: Aakash Tripathi, Ian E. Nielsen, Muhammad Umer, Ravi P. Ramachandran, Ghulam Rasool
Date: 2025-07-18

Abstract:
Transcription Factor Binding Site (TFBS) prediction is crucial for understanding gene regulation and various biological processes. This study introduces a novel Mixture of Experts (MoE) approach for TFBS prediction, integrating multiple pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models, each specializing in different TFBS patterns. We evaluate the performance of our MoE model against individual expert models on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets, using six randomly selected transcription factors (TFs) for OOD testing. Our results demonstrate that the MoE model achieves competitive or superior performance across diverse TF binding sites, particularly excelling in OOD scenarios. The Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) statistical test confirms the significance of these performance differences. Additionally, we introduce ShiftSmooth, a novel attribution mapping technique that provides more robust model interpretability by considering small shifts in input sequences. Through comprehensive explainability analysis, we show that ShiftSmooth offers superior attribution for motif discovery and localization compared to traditional Vanilla Gradient methods. Our work presents an efficient, generalizable, and interpretable solution for TFBS prediction, potentially enabling new discoveries in genome biology and advancing our understanding of transcriptional regulation.

Date: 2022-10-14

Abstract:
Asymmetric subcellular mRNA localization allows spatial regulation of gene expression and functional compartmentalization. In neurons, localization of specific mRNAs to neurites is essential for cellular functioning. However, it is largely unknown how transcript sorting works in a sequence-specific manner. Here, we combined subcellular transcriptomics and massively parallel reporter assays and tested ∼50 000 sequences for their ability to localize to neurites. Mapping the localization potential of >300 genes revealed two ways neurite targeting can be achieved: focused localization motifs and broadly encoded localization potential. We characterized the interplay between RNA stability and localization and identified motifs able to bias localization towards neurite or soma as well as the trans-acting factors required for their action. Based on our data, we devised machine learning models that were able to predict the localization behavior of novel reporter sequences. Testing this predictor on native mRNA sequencing data showed good agreement between predicted and observed localization potential, suggesting that the rules uncovered by our MPRA also apply to the localization of native full-length transcripts.

Date: 2024-02-27

Abstract:
Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have identified a number of genomic loci that are associated with Parkinson’s disease (PD) risk. However, the majority of these variants lie in non-coding regions, and thus the mechanisms by which they influence disease development, and/or potential subtypes, remain largely elusive. To address this, we used a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to screen the regulatory function of 5254 variants that have a known or putative connection to PD. We identified 138 loci with enhancer activity, of which 27 exhibited allele-specific regulatory activity in HEK293 cells. The identified regulatory variant(s) typically did not match the original tag variant within the PD associated locus, supporting the need for deeper exploration of these loci. The existence of allele specific transcriptional impacts within HEK293 cells, confirms that at least a subset of the PD associated regions mark functional gene regulatory elements. Future functional studies that confirm the putative targets of the empirically verified regulatory variants will be crucial for gaining a greater understanding of how gene regulatory network(s) modulate PD risk.

Abstract:
Regulation of gene expression through enhancers is one of the major processes shaping the structure and function of the human brain during development. High-throughput assays have predicted thousands of enhancers involved in neurodevelopment, and confirming their activity through orthogonal functional assays is crucial. Here, we utilized Massively Parallel Reporter Assays (MPRAs) in stem cells and forebrain organoids to evaluate the activity of ~7,000 gene-linked enhancers previously identified in human fetal tissues and brain organoids. We used a Gaussian mixture model to evaluate the contribution of background noise in the measured activity signal to confirm the activity of ~35% of the tested enhancers, with most showing temporal-specific activity, suggesting their evolving role in neurodevelopment. The temporal specificity was further supported by the correlation of activity with gene expression. Our findings provide a valuable gene regulatory resource to the scientific community.

Date: 2022-10-14

Abstract:
Hundreds of RNAs are enriched in the projections of neuronal cells. For the vast majority of them, though, the sequence elements that regulate their localization are unknown. To identify RNA elements capable of directing transcripts to neurites, we deployed a massively parallel reporter assay that tested the localization regulatory ability of thousands of sequence fragments drawn from endogenous mouse 3′ UTRs. We identified peaks of regulatory activity within several 3′ UTRs and found that sequences derived from these peaks were both necessary and sufficient for RNA localization to neurites in mouse and human neuronal cells. The localization elements were enriched in adenosine and guanosine residues. They were at least tens to hundreds of nucleotides long as shortening of two identified elements led to significantly reduced activity. Using RNA affinity purification and mass spectrometry, we found that the RNA-binding protein Unk was associated with the localization elements. Depletion of Unk in cells reduced the ability of the elements to drive RNAs to neurites, indicating a functional requirement for Unk in their trafficking. These results provide a framework for the unbiased, high-throughput identification of RNA elements and mechanisms that govern transcript localization in neurons.

Title: Affinity-optimizing enhancer variants disrupt development

Abstract:
Enhancers control the location and timing of gene expression and contain the majority of variants associated with disease 1 – 3 . The ZRS is arguably the most well-studied vertebrate enhancer and mediates the expression of Shh in the developing limb 4 . Thirty-one human single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) within the ZRS are associated with polydactyly 4 – 6 . However, how this enhancer encodes tissue-specific activity, and the mechanisms by which SNVs alter the number of digits, are poorly understood. Here we show that the ETS sites within the ZRS are low affinity, and identify a functional ETS site, ETS-A, with extremely low affinity. Two human SNVs and a synthetic variant optimize the binding affinity of ETS-A subtly from 15% to around 25% relative to the strongest ETS binding sequence, and cause polydactyly with the same penetrance and severity. A greater increase in affinity results in phenotypes that are more penetrant and more severe. Affinity-optimizing SNVs in other ETS sites in the ZRS, as well as in ETS, interferon regulatory factor (IRF), HOX and activator protein 1 (AP-1) sites within a wide variety of enhancers, cause gain-of-function gene expression. The prevalence of binding sites with suboptimal affinity in enhancers creates a vulnerability in genomes whereby SNVs that optimize affinity, even slightly, can be pathogenic. Searching for affinity-optimizing SNVs in genomes could provide a mechanistic approach to identify causal variants that underlie enhanceropathies.

Title: Massively parallel reporter perturbation assays uncover temporal regulatory architecture during neural differentiation

Abstract:
Gene regulatory elements play a key role in orchestrating gene expression during cellular differentiation, but what determines their function over time remains largely unknown. Here, we perform perturbation-based massively parallel reporter assays at seven early time points of neural differentiation to systematically characterize how regulatory elements and motifs within them guide cellular differentiation. By perturbing over 2,000 putative DNA binding motifs in active regulatory regions, we delineate four categories of functional elements, and observe that activity direction is mostly determined by the sequence itself, while the magnitude of effect depends on the cellular environment. We also find that fine-tuning transcription rates is often achieved by a combined activity of adjacent activating and repressing elements. Our work provides a blueprint for the sequence components needed to induce different transcriptional patterns in general and specifically during neural differentiation.

Title: Sequence-based correction of barcode bias in massively parallel reporter assays
Authors: Dongwon Lee, Ashish Kapoor, Changhee Lee, Michael Mudgett, Michael A. Beer, Aravinda Chakravarti
Date: 2021-09

Abstract:
Massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) are a high-throughput method for evaluating in vitro activities of thousands of candidate cis -regulatory elements (CREs). In these assays, candidate sequences are cloned upstream or downstream from a reporter gene tagged by unique DNA sequences. However, tag sequences may themselves affect reporter gene expression and lead to major potential biases in the measured cis -regulatory activity. Here, we present a sequence-based method for correcting tag-sequence-specific effects and show that our method can significantly reduce this source of variation and improve the identification of functional regulatory variants by MPRAs. We also show that our model captures sequence features associated with post-transcriptional regulation of mRNA. Thus, this new method helps not only to improve detection of regulatory signals in MPRA experiments but also to design better MPRA protocols.

Title: Just a SNP away: The future of in vivo massively parallel reporter assay
Authors: Katherine N. Degner, Jessica L. Bell, Sean D. Jones, Hyejung Won
Date: 2025-02

Abstract:
The human genome is largely noncoding, yet the field is still grasping to understand how noncoding variants impact transcription and contribute to disease etiology. The massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) has been employed to characterize the function of noncoding variants at unprecedented scales, but its application has been largely limited by the in vitro context. The field will benefit from establishing a systemic platform to study noncoding variant function across multiple tissue types under physiologically relevant conditions. However, to date, MPRA has been applied to only a handful of in vivo conditions. Given the complexity of the central nervous system and its widespread interactions with all other organ systems, our understanding of neuropsychiatric disorder-associated noncoding variants would be greatly advanced by studying their functional impact in the intact brain. In this review, we discuss the importance, technical considerations, and future applications of implementing MPRA in the in vivo space with the focus on neuropsychiatric disorders.

Abstract:
Identifying the causal variants and mechanisms that drive complex traits and diseases remains a core problem in human genetics. The majority of these variants have individually weak effects and lie in non-coding gene-regulatory elements where we lack a complete understanding of how single nucleotide alterations modulate transcriptional processes to affect human phenotypes. To address this, we measured the activity of 221,412 trait-associated variants that had been statistically fine-mapped using a Massively Parallel Reporter Assay (MPRA) in 5 diverse cell-types. We show that MPRA is able to discriminate between likely causal variants and controls, identifying 12,025 regulatory variants with high precision. Although the effects of these variants largely agree with orthogonal measures of function, only 69% can plausibly be explained by the disruption of a known transcription factor (TF) binding motif. We dissect the mechanisms of 136 variants using saturation mutagenesis and assign impacted TFs for 91% of variants without a clear canonical mechanism. Finally, we provide evidence that epistasis is prevalent for variants in close proximity and identify multiple functional variants on the same haplotype at a small, but important, subset of trait-associated loci. Overall, our study provides a systematic functional characterization of likely causal common variants underlying complex and molecular human traits, enabling new insights into the regulatory grammar underlying disease risk.

Abstract:
Genome-wide chromatin annotations have permitted the mapping of putative regulatory elements across multiple human cell types. However, their experimental dissection by directed regulatory motif disruption has remained unfeasible at the genome scale. Here, we use a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to measure the transcriptional levels induced by 145-bp DNA segments centered on evolutionarily conserved regulatory motif instances within enhancer chromatin states. We select five predicted activators (HNF1, HNF4, FOXA, GATA, NFE2L2) and two predicted repressors (GFI1, ZFP161) and measure reporter expression in erythroleukemia (K562) and liver carcinoma (HepG2) cell lines. We test 2104 wild-type sequences and 3314 engineered enhancer variants containing targeted motif disruptions, each using 10 barcode tags and two replicates. The resulting data strongly confirm the enhancer activity and cell-type specificity of enhancer chromatin states, the ability of 145-bp segments to recapitulate both, the necessary role of regulatory motifs in enhancer function, and the complementary roles of activator and repressor motifs. We find statistically robust evidence that (1) disrupting the predicted activator motifs abolishes enhancer function, while silent or motif-improving changes maintain enhancer activity; (2) evolutionary conservation, nucleosome exclusion, binding of other factors, and strength of the motif match are predictive of enhancer activity; (3) scrambling repressor motifs leads to aberrant reporter expression in cell lines where the enhancers are usually inactive. Our results suggest a general strategy for deciphering cis -regulatory elements by systematic large-scale manipulation and provide quantitative enhancer activity measurements across thousands of constructs that can be mined to develop predictive models of gene expression.

Abstract:
The function of regulatory elements is highly dependent on the cellular context, and thus for understanding the function of elements associated with psychiatric diseases these would ideally be studied in neurons in a living brain. Massively Parallel Reporter Assays (MPRAs) are molecular genetic tools that enable functional screening of hundreds of predefined sequences in a single experiment. These assays have not yet been adapted to query specific cell types in vivo in a complex tissue like the mouse brain. Here, using a test-case 3′UTR MPRA library with genomic elements containing variants from autism patients, we developed a method to achieve reproducible measurements of element effects in vivo in a cell type-specific manner, using excitatory cortical neurons and striatal medium spiny neurons as test cases. This targeted technique should enable robust, functional annotation of genetic elements in the cellular contexts most relevant to psychiatric disease.

Title: Leveraging massively parallel reporter assays for evolutionary questions
Authors: Irene Gallego Romero, Amanda J. Lea
Date: 2023-02-14

Abstract:
A long-standing goal of evolutionary biology is to decode how gene regulation contributes to organismal diversity. Doing so is challenging because it is hard to predict function from non-coding sequence and to perform molecular research with non-model taxa. Massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) enable the testing of thousands to millions of sequences for regulatory activity simultaneously. Here, we discuss the execution, advantages, and limitations of MPRAs, with a focus on evolutionary questions. We propose solutions for extending MPRAs to rare taxa and those with limited genomic resources, and we underscore MPRA’s broad potential for driving genome-scale, functional studies across organisms. The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s13059-023-02856-6.

Date: 2019-03-12

Abstract:
Massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) have emerged as a popular means for understanding noncoding variation in a variety of conditions. While a large number of experiments have been described in the literature, analysis typically uses ad-hoc methods. There has been little attention to comparing performance of methods across datasets. We present the mpralm method which we show is calibrated and powerful, by analyzing its performance on multiple MPRA datasets. We show that it outperforms existing statistical methods for analysis of this data type, in the first comprehensive evaluation of statistical methods on several datasets. We investigate theoretical and real-data properties of barcode summarization methods and show an unappreciated impact of summarization method for some datasets. Finally, we use our model to conduct a power analysis for this assay and show substantial improvements in power by performing up to 6 replicates per condition, whereas sequencing depth has smaller impact; we recommend to always use at least 4 replicates. An R package is available from the Bioconductor project. Together, these results inform recommendations for differential analysis, general group comparisons, and power analysis and will help improve design and analysis of MPRA experiments.

Title: Optimizing sequence design strategies for perturbation MPRAs: a computational evaluation framework
Authors: Jiayi Liu, Tal Ashuach, Fumitaka Inoue, Nadav Ahituv, Nir Yosef, Anat Kreimer
Date: 2024-02-28

Abstract:
The advent of perturbation-based massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) technique has facilitated the delineation of the roles of non-coding regulatory elements in orchestrating gene expression. However, computational efforts remain scant to evaluate and establish guidelines for sequence design strategies for perturbation MPRAs. In this study, we propose a framework for evaluating and comparing various perturbation strategies for MPRA experiments. Within this framework, we benchmark three different perturbation approaches from the perspectives of alteration in motif-based profiles, consistency of MPRA outputs, and robustness of models that predict the activities of putative regulatory motifs. While our analyses show very similar results across multiple benchmarking metrics, the predictive modeling for the approach involving random nucleotide shuffling shows significant robustness compared with the other two approaches. Thus, we recommend designing sequences by randomly shuffling the nucleotides of the perturbed site in perturbation-MPRA, followed by a coherence check to prevent the introduction of other variations of the target motifs. In summary, our evaluation framework and the benchmarking findings create a resource of computational pipelines and highlight the potential of perturbation-MPRA in predicting non-coding regulatory activities.

Abstract:
3′ untranslated region (3′ UTR) somatic mutations represent a largely unexplored avenue of alternative oncogenic gene dysregulation. To determine the significance of 3′ UTR mutations in disease, we identify 3′ UTR somatic variants across 185 advanced prostate tumors, discovering 14,497 single-nucleotide mutations enriched in oncogenic pathways and 3′ UTR regulatory elements. By developing two complementary massively parallel reporter assays, we measure how thousands of patient-based mutations affect mRNA translation and stability and identify hundreds of functional variants that allow us to define determinants of mutation significance. We demonstrate the clinical relevance of these mutations, observing that CRISPR-Cas9 endogenous editing of distinct variants increases cellular stress resistance and that patients harboring oncogenic 3′ UTR mutations have a particularly poor prognosis. This work represents an expansive view of the extent to which disease-relevant 3′ UTR mutations affect mRNA stability, translation, and cancer progression, uncovering principles of regulatory functionality and potential therapeutic targets in previously unexplored regulatory regions.

Abstract:
Rare coding mutations cause ~45% of congenital heart disease (CHD). Noncoding mutations that perturb cis -regulatory elements (CREs) likely contribute to the remaining cases, but their identification has been problematic. Using a lentiviral massively parallel reporter assay (lentiMPRA) in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs), we functionally evaluated 6,590 noncoding de novo variants (ncDNVs) prioritized from the whole-genome sequencing of 750 CHD trios. A total of 403 ncDNVs substantially affected cardiac CRE activity. A majority increased enhancer activity, often at regions with undetectable reference sequence activity. Of ten DNVs tested by introduction into their native genomic context, four altered the expression of neighboring genes and iPSC-CM transcriptional state. To prioritize future DNVs for functional testing, we used the MPRA data to develop a regression model, EpiCard. Analysis of an independent CHD cohort by EpiCard found enrichment of DNVs. Together, we developed a scalable system to measure the effect of ncDNVs on CRE activity and deployed it to systematically assess the contribution of ncDNVs to CHD.

Abstract:
Regulation of gene expression through enhancers is one of the major processes shaping the structure and function of the human brain during development. High-throughput assays have predicted thousands of enhancers involved in neurodevelopment, and confirming their activity through orthogonal functional assays is crucial. Here, we utilized Massively Parallel Reporter Assays (MPRAs) in stem cells and forebrain organoids to evaluate the activity of ~ 7000 gene-linked enhancers previously identified in human fetal tissues and brain organoids. We used a Gaussian mixture model to evaluate the contribution of background noise in the measured activity signal to confirm the activity of ~ 35% of the tested enhancers, with most showing temporal-specific activity, suggesting their evolving role in neurodevelopment. The temporal specificity was further supported by the correlation of activity with gene expression. Our findings provide a valuable gene regulatory resource to the scientific community.

Abstract:
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) involves aggregation of amyloid β and tau, neuron loss, cognitive decline, and neuroinflammatory responses. Both resident microglia and peripheral immune cells have been associated with the immune component of AD. However, the relative contribution of resident and peripheral immune cell types to AD predisposition has not been thoroughly explored due to their similarity in gene expression and function. To study the effects of AD-associated variants on cis -regulatory elements, we train convolutional neural network (CNN) regression models that link genome sequence to cell type-specific levels of open chromatin, a proxy for regulatory element activity. We then use in silico mutagenesis of regulatory sequences to predict the relative impact of candidate variants across these cell types. We develop and apply criteria for evaluating our models and refine our models using massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) data. Our models identify multiple AD-associated variants with a greater predicted impact in peripheral cells relative to microglia or neurons. Our results support their use as models to study the effects of AD-associated variants and even suggest that peripheral immune cells themselves may mediate a component of AD predisposition. We make our library of CNN models and predictions available as a resource for the community to study immune and neurological disorders.

Title: Massively parallel analysis of human 3′ UTRs reveals that AU-rich element length and registration predict mRNA destabilization
Authors: David A Siegel, Olivier Le Tonqueze, Anne Biton, Noah Zaitlen, David J Erle
Date: 2022-01

Abstract:
AU-rich elements (AREs) are 3′ UTR cis-regulatory elements that regulate the stability of mRNAs. Consensus ARE motifs have been determined, but little is known about how differences in 3′ UTR sequences that conform to these motifs affect their function. Here, we use functional annotation of sequences from 3′ UTRs (fast-UTR), a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA), to investigate the effects of 41,288 3′ UTR sequence fragments from 4653 transcripts on gene expression and mRNA stability in Jurkat and Beas2B cells. Our analyses demonstrate that the length of an ARE and its registration (the first and last nucleotides of the repeating ARE motif) have significant effects on gene expression and stability. Based on this finding, we propose improved ARE classification and concomitant methods to categorize and predict the effect of AREs on gene expression and stability. Finally, to investigate the advantages of our general experimental design we examine other motifs including constitutive decay elements (CDEs), where we show that the length of the CDE stem-loop has a significant impact on steady-state expression and mRNA stability. We conclude that fast-UTR, in conjunction with our analytical approach, can produce improved yet simple sequence-based rules for predicting the activity of human 3′ UTRs.

Abstract:
High-throughput massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) and phenotype-rich in vivo transgenic mouse assays are two potentially complementary ways to study the impact of noncoding variants associated with psychiatric diseases. Here, we investigate the utility of combining these assays. Specifically, we carry out an MPRA in induced human neurons on over 50,000 sequences derived from fetal neuronal ATAC-seq datasets and enhancers validated in mouse assays. We also test the impact of over 20,000 variants, including synthetic mutations and 167 common variants associated with psychiatric disorders. We find a strong and specific correlation between MPRA and mouse neuronal enhancer activity. Four out of five tested variants with significant MPRA effects affected neuronal enhancer activity in mouse embryos. Mouse assays also reveal pleiotropic variant effects that could not be observed in MPRA. Our work provides a catalog of functional neuronal enhancers and variant effects and highlights the effectiveness of combining MPRAs and mouse transgenic assays.

Date: 2025-07-08

Abstract:
Control of gene expression is fundamental to biology, and post-transcriptional regulation is an important component of this process. In mammals, the 3′UTR in particular serves as a major source of regulatory information within the transcript. Here we developed an accurate massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) system to evaluate the impact of >1400 full-length human 3′UTRs on RNA abundance, stability, translational regulation, and total protein output. We demonstrated that our MPRA is consistent with regulation of the corresponding endogenous transcripts. We used the MPRA datasets to model the relative contributions of RNA abundance and translational efficiency toward total 3′UTR-mediated regulation, revealing an unexpectedly large role for 3′UTR-specified translational control, and providing additional evidence that much of 3′UTR-encoded regulation is mediated by concerted regulation of translation plus decay. We observed relationships between GC content and 3′UTR length and different modes of regulation, and identified sequence motifs corresponding to regulatory RNA-binding proteins associated with mediating 3′UTR-dependent gene expression. We compared regulation from >1400 3′UTRs under control of two dissimilar promoters, which revealed promoter-associated differences in post-transcriptional regulation for certain 3′UTRs. Together, this dataset represents a comprehensive characterization of 3′UTR-mediated quantitative regulation.

Title: Combining TSS-MPRA and sensitive TSS profile dissimilarity scoring to study the sequence determinants of transcription initiation

Date: 2023-08-25

Abstract:
 Cis -regulatory elements (CREs) can be classified by the shapes of their transcription start site (TSS) profiles, which are indicative of distinct regulatory mechanisms. Massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) are increasingly being used to study CRE regulatory mechanisms, yet the degree to which MPRAs replicate individual endogenous TSS profiles has not been determined. Here, we present a new low-input MPRA protocol (TSS-MPRA) that enables measuring TSS profiles of episomal reporters as well as after lentiviral reporter chromatinization. To sensitively compare MPRA and endogenous TSS profiles, we developed a novel dissimilarity scoring algorithm (WIP score) that outperforms the frequently used earth mover's distance on experimental data. Using TSS-MPRA and WIP scoring on 500 unique reporter inserts, we found that short (153 bp) MPRA promoter inserts replicate the endogenous TSS patterns of ∼60% of promoters. Lentiviral reporter chromatinization did not improve fidelity of TSS-MPRA initiation patterns, and increasing insert size frequently led to activation of extraneous TSS in the MPRA that are not active in vivo . We discuss the implications of our findings, which highlight important caveats when using MPRAs to study transcription mechanisms. Finally, we illustrate how TSS-MPRA and WIP scoring can provide novel insights into the impact of transcription factor motif mutations and genetic variants on TSS patterns and transcription levels.

Abstract:
Brain size and cortical folding have increased and decreased recurrently during mammalian evolution. Identifying genetic elements whose sequence or functional properties co-evolve with these traits can provide unique information on evolutionary and developmental mechanisms. A good candidate for such a comparative approach is TRNP1 , as it controls proliferation of neural progenitors in mice and ferrets. Here, we investigate the contribution of both regulatory and coding sequences of TRNP1 to brain size and cortical folding in over 30 mammals. We find that the rate of TRNP1 protein evolution ( ω ) significantly correlates with brain size, slightly less with cortical folding and much less with body size. This brain correlation is stronger than for >95% of random control proteins. This co-evolution is likely affecting TRNP1 activity, as we find that TRNP1 from species with larger brains and more cortical folding induce higher proliferation rates in neural stem cells. Furthermore, we compare the activity of putative cis-regulatory elements (CREs) of TRNP1 in a massively parallel reporter assay and identify one CRE that likely co-evolves with cortical folding in Old World monkeys and apes. Our analyses indicate that coding and regulatory changes that increased TRNP1 activity were positively selected either as a cause or a consequence of increases in brain size and cortical folding. They also provide an example how phylogenetic approaches can inform biological mechanisms, especially when combined with molecular phenotypes across several species.

Abstract:
As researchers and clinicians seek to identify human genomic alterations relevant to traits and disorders, identifying and aggregating evidence providing mechanistic support for associations between alterations and phenotypes remains challenging. In particular, the study of non-coding genomic variation remains a major challenge due to the lack of accurate functional annotation for activity in a given context and across alleles. Experimental evidence is critical for prioritizing and interpreting functional effects of genetic alterations. Massively Parallel Reporter Assays (MPRAs) have emerged as a powerful high-throughput approach, enabling quantification of regulatory element activity and allelic effects, and systematic dissection of gene regulatory logic and variant effects across different contexts. However, the diversity of MPRA designs, lack of standardized formats, and many potential processing parameters hamper data integration, reproducibility, and meta-analyses across studies. To address these challenges, the Impact of Genomic Variation on Function (IGVF) Consortium established an MPRA focus group to develop community standards, including harmonized file formats, and robust analysis pipelines for a wide range of library types and experimental designs. Here, we present these formats and comprehensive computational tools, MPRAlib and MPRAsnakeflow, for uniform processing from raw sequencing reads to counts, processing and visualization. Using diverse MPRA datasets, we characterize technical variability sources including barcode sequence bias, outlier barcodes, and delivery method (episomal vs. lentiviral). Our results establish best practices for MPRA data generation and analysis, facilitating robust, reproducible research and large-scale integration. The presented tools and standards are publicly available, providing a foundation for future collaborative efforts in regulatory genomics.

Abstract:
The prenatal environment influences neurodevelopment and subsequent clinical trajectories for psychiatric outcomes in childhood and adolescence. Yet it remains unclear if the impact of maternal and fetal immune activation varies with distinct polygenic risk profiles. Therefore, here we catalogue genotype and environment (GxE) interactions, contrasting allele-specific regulatory activity between inflammatory contexts. We report a cue-specific neuronal massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) of 220 loci from genome-wide association study (GWAS) linked to ten brain traits/disorders, empirically dissecting the impact of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interferon-alpha (IFNα) on transcriptional activity. Of 1,469 active candidate regulatory risk elements (MPRA-active CRSs) across three conditions, we identify 316 with dynamic variant-specific effects (MPRA-QTLs) in human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived glutamatergic neurons. Broadly, across hundreds of variants, neuronal immune-mediated regulatory activity is driven by differences in transcription factor binding and chromatin accessibility, the gene targets of which show pleiotropic enrichments for brain, metabolic, and immune disorders. Dynamic genetic regulation mediates immune effects, informing our understanding of mechanisms governing pleiotropy and variable penetrance. Understanding neurodevelopmental GxE interactions will inform mental health trajectories and resolve mechanisms mediating prenatal risk.

Abstract:
Many transposable elements (TEs) contain transcription factor binding sites and are implicated as potential regulatory elements. However, TEs are rarely functionally tested for regulatory activity, which in turn limits our understanding of how TE regulatory activity has evolved. We systematically tested the human LTR18A subfamily for regulatory activity using massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) and found AP-1- and CEBP-related binding motifs as drivers of enhancer activity. Functional analysis of evolutionarily reconstructed ancestral sequences revealed that LTR18A elements have generally lost regulatory activity over time through sequence changes, with the largest effects occurring owing to mutations in the AP-1 and CEBP motifs. We observed that the two motifs are conserved at higher rates than expected based on neutral evolution. Finally, we identified LTR18A elements as potential enhancers in the human genome, primarily in epithelial cells. Together, our results provide a model for the origin, evolution, and co-option of TE-derived regulatory elements.

Title: U-rich elements drive pervasive cryptic splicing in 3’ UTR massively parallel reporter assays
Authors: Khoa Dao, Courtney F. Jungers, Sergej Djuranovic, Anthony M. Mustoe
Date: 2024-08-05

Abstract:
Non-coding RNA sequences play essential roles in orchestrating gene expression. However, the sequence codes and mechanisms underpinning post-transcriptional regulation remain incompletely understood. Here, we revisit the finding from a prior massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) that AU-rich (U-rich) elements in 3’ untranslated regions (3’ UTRs) can drive upregulation or downregulation of mRNA expression depending on 3’ UTR context. We unexpectedly discover that this variable regulation arises from widespread cryptic splicing, predominately from an unannotated splice donor in the coding sequence of GFP to diverse acceptor sites in reporter 3’ UTRs. Splicing is activated by U-rich sequences, which function as potent position-dependent regulators of 5’ and 3’ splice site choice and overall splicing efficiency. Splicing has diverse impacts on reporter expression, causing both increases and decreases in reporter expression via multiple mechanisms. We further provide evidence that cryptic splicing impacts between 10 to 50% of measurements made by other published 3’ UTR MPRAs. Overall, our work emphasizes U-rich sequences as principal drivers of splicing and provides strategies to minimize cryptic splicing artifacts in reporter assays.

Abstract:
Massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) functionally screen thousands of sequences for regulatory activity in parallel. To date, there has been no systematic comparison of differences in MPRA design. Here, we screen a library of 2,440 candidate liver enhancers and controls for regulatory activity in HepG2 cells using nine different MPRA designs. We identify subtle but significant differences that correlate with epigenetic and sequence-level features, as well as differences in dynamic range and reproducibility. We also validate en masse that enhancer activity is robustly independent of orientation, at least for our library and designs. Finally, with a new method, we assemble and test the same enhancers as 192-mers, 354-mers, and 678-mers, and observe surprisingly large differences. This work provides a framework for the experimental design of high-throughput reporter assays, suggesting that the extended sequence context of tested elements, and to a lesser degree the precise assay, influence MPRA results.

Abstract:
Genetic variation at thousands of short tandem repeats (STRs), which consist of consecutive repeated sequences of 1–6bp, has been statistically associated with gene expression and other molecular phenotypes in humans. However, the causality and regulatory mechanisms for most of these STRs remains unknown. Massively parallel reporter assays (MPRA) enable testing the regulatory activity of a large number of synthesized variants, but have not been applied to STRs due to experimental and computational challenges. Here, we optimized an MPRA framework based on random barcoding to study the impact of variation in repeat copy number on expression. We first performed an MPRA on sequences derived from 30,516 promoter-proximal STR loci along with up to 152bp of genomic context, testing 3–4 variants with differing repeat copy numbers for each locus in HEK293T cells. We identified 1,366 loci with significant associations between repeat copy number and expression, which were enriched for positive effect sizes (P=2.08e-110). We then designed a second MPRA in which we performed deeper perturbations, including systematic manipulation of the repeat unit sequence, orientation, and copy number, with 200–300 perturbations for each of the 300 loci with the strongest signals. Our results revealed that the repeat unit sequence is the primary driver of differences in the relationship between copy number and expression across loci, whereas orientation and flanking sequence have weaker effects, primarily for AT-rich repeat units. The high resolution of these perturbations enabled us to detect non-linear effects, most notably for AAAC/GTTT repeats, which emerge only beyond a certain copy number threshold. Finally, we observed that a subset of STRs in our library show expression levels that are tightly linked with predicted DNA secondary structure formation. We repeated our perturbation MPRA in HeLa S3 cells under wildtype and RNase H1 knockdown conditions, which, via reduction in RNase H1 activity, are expected to hinder resolution of R-loops. This demonstrated that associations between copy number and expression at G-quadruplex-forming CCCCG/CGGGG repeats are particularly sensitive to loss of RNase H1, providing support for an R-loop mediated mechanism for these repeats. Altogether, we establish STRs as a critical component of the non-coding regulatory grammar and provide a framework for understanding how this dynamic form of genetic variation shapes gene expression.

Abstract:
Genetic studies find hundreds of thousands of noncoding variants associated with psychiatric disorders. Massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) and in vivo transgenic mouse assays can be used to assay the impact of these variants. However, the relevance of MPRAs to in vivo function is unknown and transgenic assays suffer from low throughput. Here, we studied the utility of combining the two assays to study the impact of non-coding variants. We carried out an MPRA on over 50,000 sequences derived from enhancers validated in transgenic mouse assays and from multiple fetal neuronal ATAC-seq datasets. We also tested over 20,000 variants, including synthetic mutations in highly active neuronal enhancers and 177 common variants associated with psychiatric disorders. Variants with a high impact on MPRA activity were further tested in mice. We found a strong and specific correlation between MPRA and mouse neuronal enhancer activity including changes in neuronal enhancer activity in mouse embryos for variants with strong MPRA effects. Mouse assays also revealed pleiotropic variant effects that could not be observed in MPRA. Our work provides a large catalog of functional neuronal enhancers and variant effects and highlights the effectiveness of combining MPRAs and mouse transgenic assays.

Abstract:
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have linked single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at >250 loci in the human genome to type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk. For each locus, identifying the functional variant(s) among multiple SNPs in high linkage disequilibrium is critical to understand molecular mechanisms underlying T2D genetic risk. Using massively parallel reporter assays (MPRA), we test the cis -regulatory effects of SNPs associated with T2D and altered in vivo islet chromatin accessibility in MIN6 β cells under steady state and pathophysiologic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress conditions. We identify 1,982/6,621 (29.9%) SNP-containing elements that activate transcription in MIN6 and 879 SNP alleles that modulate MPRA activity. Multiple T2D-associated SNPs alter the activity of short interspersed nuclear element (SINE)-containing elements that are strongly induced by ER stress. We identify 220 functional variants at 104 T2D association signals, narrowing 54 signals to a single candidate SNP. Together, this study identifies elements driving β cell steady state and ER stress-responsive transcriptional activation, nominates causal T2D SNPs, and uncovers potential roles for repetitive elements in β cell transcriptional stress response and T2D genetics.

Abstract:
Cellular responses to stimuli underpin discoveries in drug development, synthetic biology, and general life sciences. We introduce a library comprising 6144 synthetic promoters, each shorter than 250 bp, designed as transcriptional readouts of cellular stimulus responses in massively parallel reporter assay format. This library facilitates precise detection and amplification of transcriptional activity from our promoters, enabling the systematic development of tunable reporters with dynamic ranges of 50−100 fold. Our library proved functional in numerous cell lines and responsive to a variety of stimuli, including metabolites, mitogens, toxins, and pharmaceutical agents, generating robust and scalable reporters effective in screening assays, biomarkers, and synthetic circuits attuned to endogenous cellular activities. Particularly valuable in therapeutic development, our library excels in capturing candidate reporters to signals mediated by drug targets, a feature we illustrate across nine diverse G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), critical targets in drug development. We detail how this tool isolates and defines discrete signaling pathways associated with specific GPCRs, elucidating their transcriptional signatures. With its ease of implementation, broad utility, publicly available data, and comprehensive documentation, our library will be beneficial in synthetic biology, cellular engineering, ligand exploration, and drug development.

Abstract:
Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have successfully identified 145 genomic regions that contribute to schizophrenia risk, but linkage disequilibrium makes it challenging to discern causal variants. We performed a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) on 5,173 fine-mapped schizophrenia GWAS variants in primary human neural progenitors and identified 439 variants with allelic regulatory effects (MPRA-positive variants). Transcription factor binding had modest predictive power, while fine-map posterior probability, enhancer overlap, and evolutionary conservation failed to predict MPRA-positive variants. Furthermore, 64% of MPRA-positive variants did not exhibit expressive quantitative trait loci signature, suggesting that MPRA could identify yet unexplored variants with regulatory potentials. To predict the combinatorial effect of MPRA-positive variants on gene regulation, we propose an accessibility-by-contact model that combines MPRA-measured allelic activity with neuronal chromatin architecture.

Abstract:
CD36 is a platelet membrane glycoprotein whose engagement with oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) results in platelet activation. The CD36 gene has been associated with platelet count, platelet volume, as well as lipid levels and CVD risk by genome-wide association studies. Platelet CD36 expression levels have been shown to be associated with both the platelet oxLDL response and an elevated risk of thrombo-embolism. Several genomic variants have been identified as associated with platelet CD36 levels, however none have been conclusively demonstrated to be causative. We screened 81 expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with platelet CD36 expression by a Massively Parallel Reporter Assay (MPRA) and analyzed the results with a novel Bayesian statistical method. Ten eQTLs located 13kb to 55kb upstream of the CD36 transcriptional start site of transcript ENST00000309881 and 49kb to 92kb upstream of transcript ENST00000447544, demonstrated significant transcription shifts between their minor and major allele in the MPRA assay. Of these, rs2366739 and rs1194196, separated by only 20bp, were confirmed by luciferase assay to alter transcriptional regulation. In addition, electromobility shift assays demonstrated differential DNA:protein complex formation between the two alleles of this locus. Furthermore, deletion of the genomic locus by CRISPR/Cas9 in K562 and Meg-01 cells results in upregulation of CD36 transcription. These data indicate that we have identified a variant that regulates expression of CD36 , which in turn affects platelet function. To assess the clinical relevance of our findings we used the PhenoScanner tool, which aggregates large scale GWAS findings; the results reinforce the clinical relevance of our variants and the utility of the MPRA assay. The study demonstrates a generalizable paradigm for functional testing of genetic variants to inform mechanistic studies, support patient management and develop precision therapies.

Date: 2022-11-11

Abstract:
Massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) is a high-throughput method that enables the study of the regulatory activities of tens of thousands of DNA oligonucleotides in a single experiment. While MPRA experiments have grown in popularity, their small sample sizes compared to the scale of the human genome limits our understanding of the regulatory effects they detect. To address this, we develop a deep learning model, MpraNet, to distinguish potential MPRA targets from the background genome. This model achieves high discriminative performance (AUROC = 0.85) at differentiating MPRA positives from a set of control variants that mimic the background genome when applied to the lymphoblastoid cell line. We observe that existing functional scores represent very distinct functional effects, and most of them fail to characterize the regulatory effect that MPRA detects. Using MpraNet, we predict potential MPRA functional variants across the genome and identify the distributions of MPRA effect relative to other characteristics of genetic variation, including allele frequency, alternative functional annotations specified by FAVOR, and phenome-wide associations. We also observed that the predicted MPRA positives are not uniformly distributed across the genome; instead, they are clumped together in active regions comprising 9.95% of the genome and inactive regions comprising 89.07% of the genome. Furthermore, we propose our model as a screen to filter MPRA experiment candidates at genome-wide scale, enabling future experiments to be more cost-efficient by increasing precision relative to that observed from previous MPRAs.

Abstract:
Enhancers are cis -regulatory elements that play critical regulatory roles in modulating developmental transcription programs and driving cell-type-specific and context-dependent gene expression in the brain. The development of massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) has enabled high-throughput functional screening of candidate DNA sequences for enhancer activity. Tissue-specific screening of in vivo enhancer function at scale has the potential to greatly expand our understanding of the role of non-coding sequences in development, evolution, and disease. Here, we adapted a self-transcribing regulatory element MPRA strategy for delivery to early postnatal mouse brain via recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV). We identified and validated putative enhancers capable of driving reporter gene expression in mouse forebrain, including regulatory elements within an intronic CACNA1C linkage disequilibrium block associated with risk in neuropsychiatric disorder genetic studies. Paired screening and single enhancer in vivo functional testing, as we show here, represents a powerful approach towards characterizing regulatory activity of enhancers and understanding how enhancer sequences organize gene expression in the brain.

Authors: Allison N Catizone, Gizem Karsli Uzunbas, Petra Celadova, Sylvia Kuang, Daniel Bose, Morgan A Sammons
Date: 2020-05-07

Abstract:
The master tumor suppressor p53 controls transcription of a wide-ranging gene network involved in apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, DNA damage repair, and senescence. Recent studies revealed pervasive binding of p53 to cis- regulatory elements (CREs), which are non-coding segments of DNA that spatially and temporally control transcription through the combinatorial binding of local transcription factors. Although the role of p53 as a strong trans- activator of gene expression is well known, the co-regulatory factors and local sequences acting at p53-bound CREs are comparatively understudied. We designed and executed a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to investigate the effect of transcription factor binding motifs and local sequence context on p53-bound CRE activity. Our data indicate that p53-bound CREs are both positively and negatively affected by alterations in local sequence context and changes to co-regulatory TF motifs. Our data suggest p53 has the flexibility to cooperate with a variety of transcription factors in order to regulate CRE activity. By utilizing different sets of co-factors across CREs, we hypothesize that global p53 activity is guarded against loss of any one regulatory partner, allowing for dynamic and redundant control of p53-mediated transcription.

Abstract:
Deciphering the potential of noncoding loci to influence gene regulation has been the subject of intense research, with important implications in understanding genetic underpinnings of human diseases. Massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) can measure regulatory activity of thousands of DNA sequences and their variants in a single experiment. With increasing number of publically available MPRA data sets, one can now develop data‐driven models which, given a DNA sequence, predict its regulatory activity. Here, we performed a comprehensive meta‐analysis of several MPRA data sets in a variety of cellular contexts. We first applied an ensemble of methods to predict MPRA output in each context and observed that the most predictive features are consistent across data sets. We then demonstrate that predictive models trained in one cellular context can be used to predict MPRA output in another, with loss of accuracy attributed to cell‐type‐specific features. Finally, we show that our approach achieves top performance in the Fifth Critical Assessment of Genome Interpretation “Regulation Saturation” Challenge for predicting effects of single‐nucleotide variants. Overall, our analysis provides insights into how MPRA data can be leveraged to highlight functional regulatory regions throughout the genome and can guide effective design of future experiments by better prioritizing regions of interest.

Abstract:
Genome-wide association studies have identified loci associated with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), but identifying the exact causal variants and genes at each locus is challenging due to linkage disequilibrium and their largely non-coding nature. To address this, we performed a massively parallel reporter assay of 3,576 AD-associated variants in THP-1 macrophages in both resting and proinflammatory states and identified 47 expression-modulating variants (emVars). To understand the endogenous chromatin context of emVars, we built an activity-by-contact model using epigenomic maps of macrophage inflammation and inferred condition-specific enhancer-promoter pairs. Intersection of emVars with enhancer-promoter pairs and microglia expression quantitative trait loci allowed us to connect 39 emVars to 76 putative AD risk genes enriched for AD-associated molecular signatures. Overall, systematic characterization of AD-associated variants enhances our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms underlying AD pathogenesis.

Abstract:
In the mammalian liver, hepatocytes exhibit diverse metabolic and functional profiles based on their location within the liver lobule. However, it is unclear whether this spatial variation, called zonation, is governed by a well-defined gene regulatory code. Here, using a combination of single-cell multiomics, spatial omics, massively parallel reporter assays and deep learning, we mapped enhancer-gene regulatory networks across mouse liver cell types. We found that zonation affects gene expression and chromatin accessibility in hepatocytes, among other cell types. These states are driven by the repressors TCF7L1 and TBX3, alongside other core hepatocyte transcription factors, such as HNF4A, CEBPA, FOXA1 and ONECUT1. To examine the architecture of the enhancers driving these cell states, we trained a hierarchical deep learning model called DeepLiver. Our study provides a multimodal understanding of the regulatory code underlying hepatocyte identity and their zonation state that can be used to engineer enhancers with specific activity levels and zonation patterns.

Abstract:
Although some variation introgressed from Neanderthals has undergone selective sweeps, little is known about its functional significance. We used a Massively Parallel Reporter Assay (MPRA) to assay 5,353 high-frequency introgressed variants for their ability to modulate the gene expression within 170 bp of endogenous sequence. We identified 2,548 variants in active putative cis -regulatory elements (CREs) and 292 expression-modulating variants (emVars). These emVars are predicted to alter the binding motifs of important immune transcription factors, are enriched for associations with neutrophil and white blood cell count, and are associated with the expression of genes that function in innate immune pathways including inflammatory response and antiviral defense. We combined the MPRA data with other data sets to identify strong candidates to be driver variants of positive selection including an emVar that may contribute to protection against severe COVID-19 response. We endogenously deleted two CREs containing expression-modulation variants linked to immune function, rs11624425 and rs80317430, identifying their primary genic targets as ELMSAN1 , and PAN2 and STAT2 , respectively, three genes differentially expressed during influenza infection. Overall, we present the first database of experimentally identified expression-modulating Neanderthal-introgressed alleles contributing to potential immune response in modern humans.

Abstract:
Genetic association studies have identified hundreds of largely non-coding loci associated with inter-individual differences in the structure of the human cortex, though the specific genetic variants that impact regulatory activity are unknown. We implemented a Massively Parallel Reporter Assay (MPRA) to measure the regulatory activity of 9,092 cortical structure associated DNA variants in human neural progenitor cells during Wnt stimulation and at baseline. We identified 918 variants with regulatory potential from 150 cortical structure associated loci (76% of loci studied), of which >50% showed allelic effects. Wnt stimulation modified regulatory activity at a subset of loci that functioned as condition-dependent enhancers. Regulatory activity in MPRA was largely induced by Alu elements that were hypothesized to contribute to cortical expansion. The regionally specific impact of genetic variants that disrupt motifs is likely mediated through the levels of transcription factor expression during development, further clarifying the molecular mechanisms altering cortical structure.

Whereas cis effects are caused by genetic variants located on the same DNA molecule as the target gene, trans effects are due to genetic variants that affect diffusible elements. Previous studies have mostly assessed the impact of cis and trans effects at the gene level. However, how cis and trans effects differentially impact regulatory elements such as enhancers and promoters remains poorly understood. Here, we use massively parallel reporter assays to directly measure the transcriptional outputs of thousands of individual regulatory elements in embryonic stem cells and measure cis and trans effects between human and mouse. Our approach reveals that cis effects are widespread across transcribed regulatory elements, and the strongest cis effects are associated with the disruption of motifs recognized by strong transcriptional activators. Conversely, we find that trans effects are rare but stronger in enhancers than promoters and are associated with a subset of transcription factors that are differentially expressed between human and mouse. While we find that cis - trans compensation is common within promoters, we do not see evidence of widespread cis - trans compensation at enhancers. Cis - trans compensation is inversely correlated with enhancer redundancy, suggesting that such compensation may often occur across multiple enhancers. Our results highlight differences in the mode of evolution between promoters and enhancers in complex mammalian genomes and indicate that studying the evolution of individual regulatory elements is pivotal to understand the tempo and mode of gene expression evolution.

Title: Massively parallel reporter assay for mapping gene-specific regulatory regions at single nucleotide resolution
Authors: Alastair J Tulloch, Ryan N Delgado, Rinaldo Catta-Preta, Constance L Cepko
Date: 2025-05-14

Abstract:
Precise gene regulation is essential for the development and function of complex tissues, yet comprehensive mapping of cis -regulatory modules (CRMs) remains challenging due to limitations in throughput, resolution, and the ability to assay within specific cell types. Here, we introduce two complementary approaches—a locus-specific massively parallel reporter assay (LS-MPRA) and a degenerate MPRA (d-MPRA)—specifically designed to address some of these shortcomings. LS-MPRA leverages bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) to generate high-complexity libraries spanning large genomic regions, enabling unbiased interrogation of millions of DNA fragments potentially relevant for the regulation of a specific gene or set of genes. The d-MPRA employs systematic mutagenesis to resolve the functional architecture of CRMs at nucleotide resolution, thereby nominating critical nucleotides as potential TF binding sites, or for other regulatory roles. We applied these methods to retinal genes that are stably expressed in differentiated cells of the retina, in rod photoreceptors and in subsets of bipolar interneurons, using both in vivo and ex vivo preparations of mouse tissue. LS-MPRA recapitulated some of the known CRMs for these genes—such as the proximal promoter region of Rho —and identified potentially novel CRMs, including those located within neighboring genes. The method was then applied to a gene that is dynamically expressed in subsets of retinal progenitor cells, Olig2, where it identified three distinct CRM regions (Olig2-NR1, NR2, and NR3). D-MPRA and subsequent motif analyses nominated critical TF binding sites within these regions. CUT&RUN experiments confirmed direct binding of these candidates. Moreover, extending LS-MPRA to chick retina and spinal cord demonstrated the applicability of these methods across species and tissues. Together, the integrated LS-MPRA and d-MPRA strategies provide a robust, high-resolution platform for discovery of the cis -regulatory code underlying tissue-specific gene expression. It does not require prior knowledge of potential CRMs, and is quite rapid and straightforward to deploy, using typical molecular biology methods. The fragment size can be scaled to create short CRMs, e.g. for cell type-specific expression within viral vectors. It should enable CRM discovery at a scale and affordability for laboratories wishing to focus on a particular locus or set of loci.

Title: Deciphering regulatory DNA sequences and noncoding genetic variants using neural network models of massively parallel reporter assays
Authors: Rajiv Movva, Peyton Greenside, Georgi K. Marinov, Surag Nair, Avanti Shrikumar, Anshul Kundaje
Date: 2019

Abstract:
The relationship between noncoding DNA sequence and gene expression is not well-understood. Massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs), which quantify the regulatory activity of large libraries of DNA sequences in parallel, are a powerful approach to characterize this relationship. We present MPRA-DragoNN, a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based framework to predict and interpret the regulatory activity of DNA sequences as measured by MPRAs. While our method is generally applicable to a variety of MPRA designs, here we trained our model on the Sharpr-MPRA dataset that measures the activity of ∼500,000 constructs tiling 15,720 regulatory regions in human K562 and HepG2 cell lines. MPRA-DragoNN predictions were moderately correlated (Spearman ρ = 0.28) with measured activity and were within range of replicate concordance of the assay. State-of-the-art model interpretation methods revealed high-resolution predictive regulatory sequence features that overlapped transcription factor (TF) binding motifs. We used the model to investigate the cell type and chromatin state preferences of predictive TF motifs. We explored the ability of our model to predict the allelic effects of regulatory variants in an independent MPRA experiment and fine map putative functional SNPs in loci associated with lipid traits. Our results suggest that interpretable deep learning models trained on MPRA data have the potential to reveal meaningful patterns in regulatory DNA sequences and prioritize regulatory genetic variants, especially as larger, higher-quality datasets are produced.

Date: 2022-05-09

Abstract:
Clinical whole genome sequencing has enabled the discovery of potentially pathogenic noncoding variants in the genomes of rare disease patients with a prior history of negative genetic testing. However, interpreting the functional consequences of noncoding variants and distinguishing those that contribute to disease etiology remains a challenge. Here we address this challenge by experimentally profiling the functional consequences of rare noncoding variants detected in a cohort of undiagnosed rare disease patients at scale using a massively parallel reporter assay. We demonstrate that this approach successfully identifies rare noncoding variants that alter the regulatory capacity of genomic sequences. In addition, we describe an integrative analysis that utilizes genomic features alongside patient clinical data to further prioritize candidate variants with an increased likelihood of pathogenicity. This work represents an important step towards establishing a framework for the functional interpretation of clinically detected noncoding variants.

Title: U-rich elements drive pervasive cryptic splicing in 3’ UTR massively parallel reporter assays
Authors: Khoa Dao, Courtney F. Jungers, Sergej Djuranovic, Anthony M. Mustoe
Date: 2025-07-25

Abstract:
Untranslated RNA sequences play essential roles in orchestrating gene expression. However, the sequence codes and mechanisms underpinning post-transcriptional regulation remain incompletely understood. Here, we revisit the finding from a prior massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) that AU-rich elements in 3’ untranslated regions (3’ UTRs) can drive upregulation or downregulation of mRNA expression depending on 3’ UTR context. We unexpectedly discover that this variable regulation arises from widespread cryptic splicing, predominately from an unannotated splice donor in the coding sequence of GFP to diverse acceptor sites in reporter 3’ UTRs. Splicing is activated by U-rich sequences, which function as potent position-dependent regulators of 5’ and 3’ splice site choice and overall splicing efficiency. Splicing has diverse impacts on reporter expression, causing both increases and decreases in reporter expression via multiple mechanisms. We further provide evidence that cryptic splicing significantly impacts measurements made by other published 3’ UTR MPRAs. Overall, our work emphasizes U-rich sequences as principal drivers of splicing and provides strategies to minimize cryptic splicing artifacts in reporter assays.

Authors: Ilya Vainberg Slutskin, Shira Weingarten-Gabbay, Ronit Nir, Adina Weinberger, Eran Segal
Date: 2018-02-06

Abstract:
Despite extensive research, the sequence features affecting microRNA-mediated regulation are not well understood, limiting our ability to predict gene expression levels in both native and synthetic sequences. Here we employed a massively parallel reporter assay to investigate the effect of over 14,000 rationally designed 3′ UTR sequences on reporter construct repression. We found that multiple factors, including microRNA identity, hybridization energy, target accessibility, and target multiplicity, can be manipulated to achieve a predictable, up to 57-fold, change in protein repression. Moreover, we predict protein repression and RNA levels with high accuracy ( R = 0.84 and R = 0.80, respectively) using only 3′ UTR sequence, as well as the effect of mutation in native 3′ UTRs on protein repression ( R = 0.63). Taken together, our results elucidate the effect of different sequence features on miRNA-mediated regulation and demonstrate the predictability of their effect on gene expression with applications in regulatory genomics and synthetic biology.

Title: Genome-wide census of ATF4 binding sites and functional profiling of trait-associated genetic variants overlapping ATF4 binding motifs
Authors: Tiit Örd, Daima Örd, Priit Adler, Tõnis Örd
Date: 2023-10-31

Abstract:
Activating Transcription Factor 4 (ATF4) is an important regulator of gene expression in stress responses and developmental processes in many cell types. Here, we catalogued ATF4 binding sites in the human genome and identified overlaps with trait-associated genetic variants. We probed these genetic variants for allelic regulatory activity using a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) in HepG2 hepatoma cells exposed to tunicamycin to induce endoplasmic reticulum stress and ATF4 upregulation. The results revealed that in the majority of cases, the MPRA allelic activity of these SNPs was in agreement with the nucleotide preference seen in the ATF4 binding motif from ChIP-Seq. Luciferase and electrophoretic mobility shift assays in additional cellular models further confirmed ATF4-dependent regulatory effects for the SNPs rs532446 ( GADD45A intronic; linked to hematological parameters), rs7011846 ( LPL upstream; myocardial infarction), rs2718215 (diastolic blood pressure), rs281758 (psychiatric disorders) and rs6491544 (educational attainment). CRISPR-Cas9 disruption and/or deletion of the regulatory elements harboring rs532446 and rs7011846 led to the downregulation of GADD45A and LPL , respectively. Thus, these SNPs could represent examples of GWAS genetic variants that affect gene expression by altering ATF4-mediated transcriptional activation.

Abstract:
Massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) represent a set of high-throughput technologies that measure the functional effects of thousands of sequences/variants on gene regulatory activity. There are several different variations of MPRA technology and they are used for numerous applications, including regulatory element discovery, variant effect measurement, saturation mutagenesis, synthetic regulatory element generation or characterization of evolutionary gene regulatory differences. Despite their many designs and uses, there is no comprehensive database that incorporates the results of these experiments. To address this, we developed MPRAbase, a manually curated database that currently harbors 129 experiments, encompassing 17,718,677 elements tested across 35 cell types and 4 organisms. The MPRAbase web interface ( http://www.mprabase.com ) serves as a centralized user-friendly repository to download existing MPRA data for independent analysis and is designed with the ability to allow researchers to share their published data for rapid dissemination to the community.

Title: Genome-wide strand asymmetry in massively parallel reporter activity favors genic strands

Date: 2021-05

Abstract:
Massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) are useful tools to characterize regulatory elements in human genomes. An aspect of MPRAs that is not typically the focus of analysis is their intrinsic ability to differentiate activity levels for a given sequence element when placed in both of its possible orientations relative to the reporter construct. Here, we describe pervasive strand asymmetry of MPRA signals in data sets from multiple reporter configurations in both published and newly reported data. These effects are reproducible across different cell types and in different treatments within a cell type and are observed both within and outside of annotated regulatory elements. From elements in gene bodies, MPRA strand asymmetry favors the sense strand, suggesting that function related to endogenous transcription is driving the phenomenon. Similarly, we find that within Alu mobile element insertions, strand asymmetry favors the transcribed strand of the ancestral retrotransposon. The effect is consistent across the multiplicity of Alu elements in human genomes and is more pronounced in less diverged Alu elements. We find sequence features driving MPRA strand asymmetry and show its prediction from sequence alone. We see some evidence for RNA stabilization and transcriptional activation mechanisms and hypothesize that the effect is driven by natural selection favoring efficient transcription. Our results indicate that strand asymmetry is a pervasive and reproducible feature in MPRA data. More importantly, the fact that MPRA asymmetry favors naturally transcribed strands suggests that it stems from preserved biological functions that have a substantial, global impact on gene and genome evolution.

Abstract:
Interactions between genetic variants and environmental factors influence malignancy risk, including for colorectal cancer (CRC). Prevalent CRC susceptibility loci reside predominantly in noncoding regulatory DNA where they may interact with dietary influences to dysregulate expression of specific genes predisposing to neoplasia. The impacts of CRC protective and risk dietary metabolites, butyrate and deoxycholic acid, were thus studied on the transcription-directing activity of 3703 regulatory CRC-associated variants via massively parallel reporter assays (MPRA) in human colonic cells. 1595 variant-dietary metabolite interactions were identified, pointing to dysregulation of MED13L, NKD2, and several modulators of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in potential CRC gene-environment interactions (GxE). Opposing impacts of butyrate and deoxycholic acid were also uncovered, indicating dietary influences may converge on common CRC risk loci and nominating FOSL1 and SP1 as mediators of these opposing responses. Coupling MPRA to relevant environmental factors offers an approach to extend insight into GxE in common human cancers.

Title: Massively Parallel Reporter Assays for High-Throughput In Vivo Analysis of Cis-Regulatory Elements
Authors: Yanjiang Zheng, Nathan J. VanDusen
Date: 2023-03-29

Abstract:
The rapid improvement of descriptive genomic technologies has fueled a dramatic increase in hypothesized connections between cardiovascular gene expression and phenotypes. However, in vivo testing of these hypotheses has predominantly been relegated to slow, expensive, and linear generation of genetically modified mice. In the study of genomic cis -regulatory elements, generation of mice featuring transgenic reporters or cis -regulatory element knockout remains the standard approach. While the data obtained is of high quality, the approach is insufficient to keep pace with candidate identification and therefore results in biases introduced during the selection of candidates for validation. However, recent advances across a range of disciplines are converging to enable functional genomic assays that can be conducted in a high-throughput manner. Here, we review one such method, massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs), in which the activities of thousands of candidate genomic regulatory elements are simultaneously assessed via the next-generation sequencing of a barcoded reporter transcript. We discuss best practices for MPRA design and use, with a focus on practical considerations, and review how this emerging technology has been successfully deployed in vivo. Finally, we discuss how MPRAs are likely to evolve and be used in future cardiovascular research.

Title: MPRAdecoder: Processing of the Raw MPRA Data With a priori Unknown Sequences of the Region of Interest and Associated Barcodes
Authors: Anna E. Letiagina, Evgeniya S. Omelina, Anton V. Ivankin, Alexey V. Pindyurin
Date: 2021-05-11

Abstract:
Massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) enable high-throughput functional evaluation of numerous DNA regulatory elements and/or their mutant variants. The assays are based on the construction of reporter plasmid libraries containing two variable parts, a region of interest (ROI) and a barcode (BC), located outside and within the transcription unit, respectively. Importantly, each plasmid molecule in a such a highly diverse library is characterized by a unique BC–ROI association. The reporter constructs are delivered to target cells and expression of BCs at the transcript level is assayed by RT-PCR followed by next-generation sequencing (NGS). The obtained values are normalized to the abundance of BCs in the plasmid DNA sample. Altogether, this allows evaluating the regulatory potential of the associated ROI sequences. However, depending on the MPRA library construction design, the BC and ROI sequences as well as their associations can be a priori unknown. In such a case, the BC and ROI sequences, their possible mutant variants, and unambiguous BC–ROI associations have to be identified, whereas all uncertain cases have to be excluded from the analysis. Besides the preparation of additional “mapping” samples for NGS, this also requires specific bioinformatics tools. Here, we present a pipeline for processing raw MPRA data obtained by NGS for reporter construct libraries with a priori unknown sequences of BCs and ROIs. The pipeline robustly identifies unambiguous (so-called genuine) BCs and ROIs associated with them, calculates the normalized expression level for each BC and the averaged values for each ROI, and provides a graphical visualization of the processed data.

Title: A genome-integrated massively parallel reporter assay reveals DNA sequence determinants of cis -regulatory activity in neural cells
Authors: Brett B. Maricque, Joseph D. Dougherty, Barak A. Cohen
Date: 2017-02-28

Abstract:
Recent large-scale genomics efforts to characterize the cis- regulatory sequences that orchestrate genome-wide expression patterns have produced impressive catalogues of putative regulatory elements. Most of these sequences have not been functionally tested, and our limited understanding of the non-coding genome prevents us from predicting which sequences are bona fide cis- regulatory elements. Recently, massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) have been deployed to measure the activity of putative cis -regulatory sequences in several biological contexts, each with specific advantages and distinct limitations. We developed LV-MPRA, a novel lentiviral-based, massively parallel reporter gene assay, to study the function of genome-integrated regulatory elements in any mammalian cell type; thus, making it possible to apply MPRAs in more biologically relevant contexts. We measured the activity of 2,600 sequences in U87 glioblastoma cells and human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) and explored how regulatory activity is encoded in DNA sequence. We demonstrate that LV-MPRA can be applied to estimate the effects of local DNA sequence and regional chromatin on regulatory activity. Our data reveal that primary DNA sequence features, such as GC content and dinucleotide composition, accurately distinguish sequences with high activity from sequences with low activity in a full chromosomal context, and may also function in combination with different transcription factor binding sites to determine cell type specificity. We conclude that LV-MPRA will be an important tool for identifying cis- regulatory elements and stimulating new understanding about how the non-coding genome encodes information.

Abstract:
 Introduction: Transcriptional regulation is an important process wherein non-protein coding enhancer sequences play a key role in determining cell type identity and phenotypic diversity. In neural tissue, these gene regulatory processes are crucial for coordinating a plethora of interconnected and regionally specialized cell types, ensuring their synchronized activity in generating behavior. Recognizing the intricate interplay of gene regulatory processes in the brain is imperative, as mounting evidence links neurodevelopment and neurological disorders to non-coding genome regions. While genome-wide association studies are swiftly identifying non-coding human disease-associated loci, decoding regulatory mechanisms is challenging due to causal variant ambiguity and their specific tissue impacts.  Methods: Massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) are widely used in cell culture to study the non-coding enhancer regions, linking genome sequence differences to tissue-specific regulatory function. However, widespread use in animals encounters significant challenges, including insufficient viral library delivery and library quantification, irregular viral transduction rates, and injection site inflammation disrupting gene expression. Here, we introduce a systemic MPRA (sysMPRA) to address these challenges through systemic intravenous AAV viral delivery.  Results: We demonstrate successful transduction of the MPRA library into diverse mouse tissues, efficiently identifying tissue specificity in candidate enhancers and aligning well with predictions from machine learning models. We highlight that sysMPRA effectively uncovers regulatory effects stemming from the disruption of MEF2C transcription factor binding sites, single-nucleotide polymorphisms, and the consequences of genetic variations associated with late-onset Alzheimer‘s disease.  Conclusion: SysMPRA is an effective library delivering method that simultaneously determines the transcriptional functions of hundreds of enhancers in vivo across multiple tissues.

Abstract:
Gene expression is controlled by transcription factors (TFs) that bind cognate DNA motif sequences in cis -regulatory elements (CREs). The combinations of DNA motifs acting within homeostasis and disease, however, are unclear. Gene expression, chromatin accessibility, TF footprinting, and H3K27ac-dependent DNA looping data were generated and a random-forest-based model was applied to identify 7,531 cell-type-specific cis -regulatory modules (CRMs) across 15 diploid human cell types. A co-enrichment framework within CRMs nominated 838 cell-type-specific, recurrent heterotypic DNA motif combinations (DMCs), which were functionally validated using massively parallel reporter assays. Cancer cells engaged DMCs linked to neoplasia-enabling processes operative in normal cells while also activating new DMCs only seen in the neoplastic state. This integrative approach identifies cell-type-specific cis -regulatory combinatorial DNA motifs in diverse normal and diseased human cells and represents a general framework for deciphering cis -regulatory sequence logic in gene regulation.

Date: 2022-09-09

Abstract:
A growing number of variants associated with risk for neurodevelopmental disorders have been identified by genome-wide association and whole genome sequencing studies. As common risk variants often fall within large haplotype blocks covering long stretches of the noncoding genome, the causal variants within an associated locus are often unknown. Similarly, the effect of rare noncoding risk variants identified by whole genome sequencing on molecular traits is seldom known without functional assays. A massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) is an assay that can functionally validate thousands of regulatory elements simultaneously using high-throughput sequencing and barcode technology. MPRA has been adapted to various experimental designs that measure gene regulatory effects of genetic variants within cis- and trans-regulatory elements as well as posttranscriptional processes. This review discusses different MPRA designs that have been or could be used in the future to experimentally validate genetic variants associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. Though MPRA has limitations such as it does not model genomic context, this assay can help narrow down the underlying genetic causes of neurodevelopmental disorders by screening thousands of sequences in one experiment. We conclude by describing future directions of this technique such as applications of MPRA for gene-by-environment interactions and pharmacogenetics.

Abstract:
Massively parallel reporter assays (MPRA) enable nucleotide-resolution dissection of transcriptional regulatory regions, such as enhancers, but only few regions at a time. Here, we present a combined experimental and computational approach, Sharpr-MPRA, that allows high-resolution analysis of thousands of regions simultaneously. Sharpr-MPRA combines dense tiling of overlapping MPRA constructs with a probabilistic graphical model to recognize functional regulatory nucleotides, and to distinguish activating and repressive nucleotides, using their inferred contribution to reporter gene expression. We use Sharpr-MPRA to test 4.6 million nucleotides spanning 15,000 putative regulatory regions tiled at 5-nucleotide resolution in two human cell types. Our results recover known cell type-specific regulatory motifs and evolutionarily-conserved nucleotides, and distinguish known activating and repressive motifs. Our results also show that endogenous chromatin state and DNA accessibility are both predictive of regulatory function in reporter assays, identify retroviral elements with activating roles, and uncover ‘attenuator’ motifs with repressive roles in active chromatin.

Abstract:
Transcriptional regulatory sequences in metazoans contain intricate combinations of transcription factor (TF) motifs. Stereospecific arrangements of simple motifs constitute composite elements (CEs) that enhance DNA-protein interaction specificity and enable combinatorial regulatory logic. Despite their importance, CEs remain underexplored. We advance CE discovery and functional characterization by developing an integrated framework that combines computational prediction, experimental testing and deep learning. The extended TF motif catalog comprises both synergistic and counteracting CEs, which are supported by evidence of TF binding in vivo and in vitro . A deep learning model GRACE trained on customized massively parallel reporter assays learns the lexicon of CEs at single-nucleotide resolution. Comparative analysis with a neural network model trained on chromatin accessibility demonstrates striking convergence and distinctions within the expanded regulatory lexicon, enabling joint predictions of motif contributions and the impact of variants on chromatin structure and transcriptional activity in diverse cellular contexts.

Abstract:
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified ~20 melanoma susceptibility loci, most of which are not functionally characterized. Here we report an approach integrating massively-parallel reporter assays (MPRA) with cell-type-specific epigenome and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) to identify susceptibility genes/variants from multiple GWAS loci. From 832 high-LD variants, we identify 39 candidate functional variants from 14 loci displaying allelic transcriptional activity, a subset of which corroborates four colocalizing melanocyte cis -eQTL genes. Among these, we further characterize the locus encompassing the HIV-1 restriction gene, MX2 (Chr21q22.3), and validate a functional intronic variant, rs398206. rs398206 mediates the binding of the transcription factor, YY1, to increase MX2 levels, consistent with the cis -eQTL of MX2 in primary human melanocytes. Melanocyte-specific expression of human MX2 in a zebrafish model demonstrates accelerated melanoma formation in a BRAF V600E background. Our integrative approach streamlines GWAS follow-up studies and highlights a pleiotropic function of MX2 in melanoma susceptibility.

However, it is unclear how complex spatiotemporal patterns of gene expression driven by these elements emerge from the activity of short, transcription factor binding sequences. We describe a comprehensive promoter extension assay in which the regulatory potential of all 6 base-pair (bp) sequences was tested in the context of a minimal promoter. To enable this large-scale screen, we developed algorithms that use a reverse-complement aware decomposition of the de Bruijn graph to design a library of DNA oligomers incorporating every 6-bp sequence exactly once. Our library multiplexes all 4,096 unique 6-mers into 184 double-stranded 15-bp oligomers, which is sufficiently compact for in vivo testing. We injected each multiplexed construct into zebrafish embryos and scored GFP expression in 15 tissues at two developmental time points. Twenty-seven constructs produced consistent expression patterns, with the majority doing so in only one tissue. Functional sequences are enriched near biologically relevant genes, match motifs for developmental transcription factors, and are required for enhancer activity. By concatenating tissue-specific functional sequences, we generated completely synthetic enhancers for the notochord, epidermis, spinal cord, forebrain and otic lateral line, and show that short regulatory sequences do not always function modularly. This work introduces a unique in vivo catalog of short, functional regulatory sequences and demonstrates several important principles of regulatory element organization. Furthermore, we provide resources for designing compact, reverse-complement aware k -mer libraries.

Abstract:
Massively parallel reporter assays (MPRA) are a high-throughput method of assessing the activity of candidate cis-regulatory sequences, and can be used to detect allelic differences at disease-associated variants. Previous MPRA studies have screened thousands of functional SNPs associated with various complex traits and conditions. Most MPRA libraries utilize a single plasmid configuration, a single minimal promoter to drive expression, and a single-strand orientation, which may fail to capture the context-dependent activity of disease-associated cis-regulatory elements. We interrogate the potential regulatory differences introduced by variable MPRA plasmid promoters and positions. We used an MPRA library to quantify the activity of 1,305 pancreatic islet-derived transcription start sites generated from CAP analysis of gene expression profiling. We cloned fragments upstream or downstream of a reporter gene along with either the human insulin ( INS ) promoter or a synthetic housekeeping promoter (SCP1). We used elastic net regression to predict position-specific fragment activity based on enrichment of transcription factor binding site motifs, and generalized linear models to predict position-specific fragment activity from tissue-specific chromatin state regulatory annotations. Our results support the use of MPRA strategies that account for context-dependent factors when assaying candidate regulatory elements in pursuit of understanding complex genetic diseases.

Title: Systematic identification of cis -regulatory variants that cause gene expression differences in a yeast cross

Date: 2020-11-12

Abstract:
Sequence variation in regulatory DNA alters gene expression and shapes genetically complex traits. However, the identification of individual, causal regulatory variants is challenging. Here, we used a massively parallel reporter assay to measure the cis -regulatory consequences of 5832 natural DNA variants in the promoters of 2503 genes in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae . We identified 451 causal variants, which underlie genetic loci known to affect gene expression. Several promoters harbored multiple causal variants. In five promoters, pairs of variants showed non-additive, epistatic interactions. Causal variants were enriched at conserved nucleotides, tended to have low derived allele frequency, and were depleted from promoters of essential genes, which is consistent with the action of negative selection. Causal variants were also enriched for alterations in transcription factor binding sites. Models integrating these features provided modest, but statistically significant, ability to predict causal variants. This work revealed a complex molecular basis for cis -acting regulatory variation.

Abstract:
Individuals infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus present with a wide variety of symptoms ranging from asymptomatic to severe and even lethal outcomes. Past research has revealed a genetic haplotype on chromosome 3 that entered the human population via introgression from Neanderthals as the strongest genetic risk factor for the severe response to COVID-19. However, the specific variants along this introgressed haplotype that contribute to this risk and the biological mechanisms that are involved remain unclear. Here, we assess the variants present on the risk haplotype for their likelihood of driving the genetic predisposition to severe COVID-19 outcomes. We do this by first exploring their impact on the regulation of genes involved in COVID-19 infection using a variety of population genetics and functional genomics tools. We then perform a locus-specific massively parallel reporter assay to individually assess the regulatory potential of each allele on the haplotype in a multipotent immune-related cell line. We ultimately reduce the set of over 600 linked genetic variants to identify four introgressed alleles that are strong functional candidates for driving the association between this locus and severe COVID-19. Using reporter assays in the presence/absence of SARS-CoV-2 , we find evidence that these variants respond to viral infection. These variants likely drive the locus’ impact on severity by modulating the regulation of two critical chemokine receptor genes: CCR1 and CCR5 . These alleles are ideal targets for future functional investigations into the interaction between host genomics and COVID-19 outcomes.

Title: A phylogenetic approach uncovers cryptic endogenous retrovirus subfamilies in the primate lineage

Date: 2025-07-18

Abstract:
Current approaches for classifying and annotating endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) and their long terminal repeats (LTRs) have limited resolution and are inaccurate. Here, we developed an annotation approach based on phylogenetic analysis and cross-species conservation. Focusing on the evolutionarily young LTR subfamilies known as MER11A/B/C, we revealed the presence of four “new subfamilies,” suggesting a new annotation for 412 (19.8%) of these repeat elements. We then validated their regulatory potential using a massively parallel reporter assay. We further identified motifs associated with their differential activities including an ape-specific gain of SOX-related motifs through a single-nucleotide deletion. By applying our approach across 53 simian-enriched LTR subfamilies, we defined 75 new subfamilies and found a novel annotation for a total of 3807 (30.0%) instances from 26 subfamilies. With this refined annotation of simian-enriched LTRs, it will be possible to better understand the evolution in primate genomes and potentially identify critical roles for ERVs and their LTRs in the hosts.

Abstract:
Deriving mechanisms of immune‐mediated disease from GWAS data remains a formidable challenge, with attempts to identify causal variants being frequently hampered by strong linkage disequilibrium. To determine whether causal variants could be identified from their functional effects, we adapted a massively parallel reporter assay for use in primary CD 4 T cells, the cell type whose regulatory DNA is most enriched for immune‐mediated disease SNP s. This enabled the effects of candidate SNP s to be examined in a relevant cellular context and generated testable hypotheses into disease mechanisms. To illustrate the power of this approach, we investigated a locus that has been linked to six immune‐mediated diseases but cannot be fine‐mapped. By studying the lead expression‐modulating SNP , we uncovered an NF ‐κB‐driven regulatory circuit which constrains T‐cell activation through the dynamic formation of a super‐enhancer that upregulates TNFAIP 3 (A20), a key NF ‐κB inhibitor. In activated T cells, this feedback circuit is disrupted—and super‐enhancer formation prevented—by the risk variant at the lead SNP , leading to unrestrained T‐cell activation via a molecular mechanism that appears to broadly predispose to human autoimmunity.

Abstract:
Genome-wide association studies have identified thousands of genetic variants associated with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), however, it is still challenging to determine the causal variants and to improve disease risk prediction. Here, we applied massively parallel reporter assays to perform NSCLC variant-to-function mapping at scale. A total of 1249 candidate variants were evaluated, and 30 potential causal variants within 12 loci were identified. Accordingly, we proposed three genetic architectures underlying NSCLC susceptibility: multiple causal variants in a single haplotype block (e.g. 4q22.1), multiple causal variants in multiple haplotype blocks (e.g. 5p15.33), and a single causal variant (e.g. 20q11.23). We developed a modified polygenic risk score using the potential causal variants from Chinese populations, improving the performance of risk prediction in 450,821 Europeans from the UK Biobank. Our findings not only augment the understanding of the genetic architecture underlying NSCLC susceptibility but also provide strategy to advance NSCLC risk stratification.

Abstract:
Identification of somatic driver mutations in the noncoding genome remains challenging. To comprehensively characterize noncoding driver mutations for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), we first created genome-scale maps of accessible chromatin regions (ACRs) and histone modification marks (HMMs) in pancreatic cell lines and purified pancreatic acinar and duct cells. Integration with whole-genome mutation calls from 506 PDACs revealed 314 ACRs/HMMs significantly enriched with 3,614 noncoding somatic mutations (NCSMs). Functional assessment using massively parallel reporter assays (MPRA) identified 178 NCSMs impacting reporter activity (19.45% of those tested). Focused luciferase validation confirmed negative effects on gene regulatory activity for NCSMs near CDKN2A and ZFP36L2 . For the latter, CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) further identified ZFP36L2 as a target gene (16.0 – 24.0% reduced expression, P = 0.023–0.0047) with disrupted KLF9 binding likely mediating the effect. Our integrative approach provides a catalog of potentially functional noncoding driver mutations and nominates ZFP36L2 as a PDAC driver gene.

Abstract:
High blood pressure (BP) is the major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Genome-wide association studies have identified genetic variants for BP, but functional insights into causality and related molecular mechanisms lag behind. We functionally characterize 4,608 genetic variants in linkage with 135 BP loci in vascular smooth muscle cells and cardiomyocytes by massively parallel reporter assays. High densities of regulatory variants at BP loci (i.e., ULK4 , MAP4 , CFDP1 , PDE5A ) indicate that multiple variants drive genetic association. Regulatory variants are enriched in repeats, alter cardiovascular-related transcription factor motifs, and spatially converge with genes controlling specific cardiovascular pathways. Using heuristic scoring, we define likely causal variants, and CRISPR prime editing finally determines causal variants for KCNK9 , SFXN2 , and PCGF6 , which are candidates for developing high BP. Our systems-level approach provides a catalog of functionally relevant variants and their genomic architecture in two trait-relevant cell lines for a better understanding of BP gene regulation.

Abstract:
Dozens of variants in the gene for the homeodomain transcription factor (TF) cone-rod homeobox ( CRX ) are linked with human blinding diseases that vary in their severity and age of onset. How different variants in this single TF alter its function in ways that lead to a range of phenotypes is unclear. We characterized the effects of human disease-causing variants on CRX cis -regulatory function by deploying massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) in mouse retina explants carrying knock-ins of two variants, one in the DNA-binding domain (p.R90W) and the other in the transcriptional effector domain (p.E168d2). The degree of reporter gene dysregulation in these mutant Crx retinas corresponds with their phenotypic severity. The two variants affect similar sets of enhancers, and p.E168d2 has distinct effects on silencers. Cis -regulatory elements (CREs) near cone photoreceptor genes are enriched for silencers that are derepressed in the presence of p.E168d2. Chromatin environments of CRX-bound loci are partially predictive of episomal MPRA activity, and distal elements whose accessibility increases later in retinal development are enriched for CREs with silencer activity. We identified a set of potentially pleiotropic regulatory elements that convert from silencers to enhancers in retinas that lack a functional CRX effector domain. Our findings show that phenotypically distinct variants in different domains of CRX have partially overlapping effects on its cis -regulatory function, leading to misregulation of similar sets of enhancers while having a qualitatively different impact on silencers.

Abstract:
Oral facial cleft (OFC) comprises cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL/P) or cleft palate only. Genome wide association studies (GWAS) of isolated OFC have identified common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in many genomic loci where the presumed effector gene (for example, IRF6 in the 1q32 locus) is expressed in embryonic oral epithelium. To identify candidates for functional SNPs at eight such loci we conduct a massively parallel reporter assay in a fetal oral epithelial cell line, revealing SNPs with allele-specific effects on enhancer activity. We filter these SNPs against chromatin-mark evidence of enhancers and test a subset in traditional reporter assays, which support the candidacy of SNPs at loci containing FOXE1 , IRF6 , MAFB , TFAP2A , and TP63 . For two SNPs near IRF6 and one near FOXE1 , we engineer the genome of induced pluripotent stem cells, differentiate the cells into embryonic oral epithelium, and discover allele-specific effects on the levels of effector gene expression, and, in two cases, the binding affinity of transcription factors FOXE1 or ETS2. Conditional analyses of GWAS data suggest the two functional SNPs near IRF6 account for the majority of risk for CL/P at this locus. This study connects genetic variation associated with OFC to mechanisms of pathogenesis.

Abstract:
Genome-wide association studies of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) nominate 3073 genetic variants at 91 risk loci. To systematically screen these variants for allelic transcriptional enhancer activity, we construct a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) library comprising 12,396 DNA oligonucleotides containing the genomic context around every allele of each SLE variant. Transfection into the Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cell line GM12878 reveals 482 variants with enhancer activity, with 51 variants showing genotype-dependent (allelic) enhancer activity at 27 risk loci. Comparison of MPRA results in GM12878 and Jurkat T cell lines highlights shared and unique allelic transcriptional regulatory mechanisms at SLE risk loci. In-depth analysis of allelic transcription factor (TF) binding at and around allelic variants identifies one class of TFs whose DNA-binding motif tends to be directly altered by the risk variant and a second class of TFs that bind allelically without direct alteration of their motif by the variant. Collectively, our approach provides a blueprint for the discovery of allelic gene regulation at risk loci for any disease and offers insight into the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms underlying SLE.

Abstract:
Alternative DNA conformations, termed non-B DNA structures, can affect transcription, but the underlying mechanisms and their functional impact have not been systematically characterized. Here, we used computational genomic analyses coupled with massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) to show that certain non-B DNA structures have a substantial effect on gene expression. Genomic analyses found that non-B DNA structures at promoters harbor an excess of germline variants. Analysis of multiple MPRAs, including a promoter library specifically designed to perturb non-B DNA structures, functionally validated that Z-DNA can significantly affect promoter activity. We also observed that biophysical properties of non-B DNA motifs, such as the length of Z-DNA motifs and the orientation of G-quadruplex structures relative to transcriptional direction, have a significant effect on promoter activity. Combined, their higher mutation rate and functional effect on transcription implicate a subset of non-B DNA motifs as major drivers of human gene-expression-associated phenotypes.

Title: Uncovering methylation-dependent genetic effects on regulatory element function in diverse genomes
Authors: Rachel M. Petersen, Christopher M. Vockley, Amanda J. Lea
Date: 2025-08

Abstract:
A major goal in evolutionary biology and biomedicine is to understand the complex interactions between genetic variants, the epigenome, and gene expression. However, the causal relationships between these factors remain poorly understood. mSTARR-seq, a methylation-sensitive massively parallel reporter assay, is capable of identifying methylation-dependent regulatory activity at many thousands of genomic regions simultaneously and allows for the testing of causal relationships between DNA methylation and gene expression on a region-by-region basis. Here, we develop a multiplexed mSTARR-seq protocol to assay naturally occurring human genetic variation from 25 individuals from 10 localities in Europe and Africa. We identify 6957 regulatory elements in either the unmethylated or methylated state, and this set was enriched for enhancer and promoter chromatin annotations, as expected. The expression of 58% of these regulatory elements is modulated by methylation, which is generally associated with decreased transcription. Within our set of regulatory elements, we use allele-specific expression analyses to identify 8020 sites with genetic effects on gene regulation; further, we find that 42.3% of these genetic effects vary in direction or magnitude between methylated and unmethylated states. Sites exhibiting methylation-dependent genetic effects are enriched for GWAS and EWAS annotations, implicating them in human disease. Compared with data sets that assay DNA from a single European ancestry individual, our multiplexed assay is able to uncover more genetic effects and methylation-dependent genetic effects, highlighting the importance of including diverse genomes in assays that aim to understand gene regulatory processes.

Date: 2024-09-12

Abstract:
Much of what we know about eukaryotic transcription stems from animals and yeast; however, plants evolved separately for over a billion years, leaving ample time for divergence in transcriptional regulation. Here we set out to elucidate fundamental properties of cis -regulatory sequences in plants. Using massively parallel reporter assays across four plant species, we demonstrate the central role of sequences downstream of the transcription start site (TSS) in transcriptional regulation. Unlike animal enhancers that are position independent, plant regulatory elements depend on their position, as altering their location relative to the TSS significantly affects transcription. We highlight the importance of the region downstream of the TSS in regulating transcription by identifying a DNA motif that is conserved across vascular plants and is sufficient to enhance gene expression in a dose-dependent manner. The identification of a large number of position-dependent enhancers points to fundamental differences in gene regulation between plants and animals.

Abstract:
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified >30 loci with multiple common noncoding variants explaining interindividual electrocardiographic QT interval (QTi) variation. Of the many types of noncoding functional elements, here we sought to identify transcriptional enhancers with sequence variation and their cognate transcription factors (TFs) that alter the expression of proximal cardiac genes to affect QTi variation. We used massively parallel reporter assays (MPRA) in mouse cardiomyocyte HL-1 cells to screen for functional enhancer variants among 1,018 QTi-associated GWAS variants that overlap candidate cardiac enhancers across 31 loci. We identified 445 GWAS variant-containing enhancers of which 79 showed significant allelic difference in enhancer activity across 21 GWAS loci, with multiple enhancer variants per locus. Of these, we predicted differential binding by cardiac TFs, including AP-1, ATF-1, GATA2, MEF2, NKX2.5, SRF and TBX5 which are known to play key roles in development and homeostasis, at 49 enhancer variants. Finally, we used expression quantitative trait locus mapping and predicted promoter-enhancer contacts to identify 14 candidate target genes through analyses of 36 enhancer variants at 16 loci. This study provides strong evidence for 14 cardiac genes, 10 of them novel, impacting on QTi variation, beyond explaining observed genetic associations.

Date: 2019-08-08

Abstract:
The majority of common variants associated with common diseases, as well as an unknown proportion of causal mutations for rare diseases, fall in noncoding regions of the genome. Although catalogs of noncoding regulatory elements are steadily improving, we have a limited understanding of the functional effects of mutations within them. Here, we perform saturation mutagenesis in conjunction with massively parallel reporter assays on 20 disease-associated gene promoters and enhancers, generating functional measurements for over 30,000 single nucleotide substitutions and deletions. We find that the density of putative transcription factor binding sites varies widely between regulatory elements, as does the extent to which evolutionary conservation or integrative scores predict functional effects. These data provide a powerful resource for interpreting the pathogenicity of clinically observed mutations in these disease-associated regulatory elements, and comprise a rich dataset for the further development of algorithms that aim to predict the regulatory effects of noncoding mutations.

Abstract:
Cellular transcription enables cells to adapt to various stimuli and maintain homeostasis. Transcription factors bind to transcription response elements (TREs) in gene promoters, initiating transcription. Synthetic promoters, derived from natural TREs, can be engineered to control exogenous gene expression using endogenous transcription machinery. This technology has found extensive use in biological research for applications including reporter gene assays, biomarker development, and programming synthetic circuits in living cells. However, a reliable and precise method for selecting minimally-sized synthetic promoters with desired background, amplitude, and stimulation response profiles has been elusive. In this study, we introduce a massively parallel reporter assay library containing 6184 synthetic promoters, each less than 250 bp in length. This comprehensive library allows for rapid identification of promoters with optimal transcriptional output parameters across multiple cell lines and stimuli. We showcase this library’s utility to identify promoters activated in unique cell types, and in response to metabolites, mitogens, cellular toxins, and agonism of both aminergic and non-aminergic GPCRs. We further show these promoters can be used in luciferase reporter assays, eliciting 50–100 fold dynamic ranges in response to stimuli. Our platform is effective, easily implemented, and provides a solution for selecting short-length promoters with precise performance for a multitude of applications.

Abstract:
Although acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common childhood cancer, there is limited understanding of the contribution of inherited genetic variation on inter-individual differences in chemotherapy response. Defining genetic factors impacting therapy failure can help better predict response and identify drug resistance mechanisms. We therefore mapped inherited noncoding variants associated with chemotherapeutic drug resistance and/or treatment outcome to ALL cis -regulatory elements and investigated their gene regulatory potential and genomic connectivity using massively parallel reporter assays and promoter capture Hi-C, respectively. We identified 53 variants with reproducible allele-specific effects on transcription and high-confidence gene targets. Subsequent functional interrogation of the top variant (rs1247117) determined that it disrupted a PU.1 consensus motif and PU.1 binding affinity. Importantly, deletion of the genomic interval containing rs1247117 sensitized ALL cells to vincristine. Together, these data demonstrate that noncoding regulatory variation associated with diverse pharmacological traits harbor significant effects on allele-specific transcriptional activity and impact sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents in ALL.

Abstract:
Large-scale sequencing efforts have been undertaken to understand the mutational landscape of the coding genome. However, the vast majority of variants occur within non-coding genomic regions. We designed an integrative computational and experimental framework to identify recurrently mutated non-coding regulatory regions that drive tumor progression. Applying this framework to sequencing data from a large prostate cancer patient cohort revealed a large set of candidate drivers. We used (1) in silico analyses, (2) massively parallel reporter assays, and (3) in vivo CRISPR interference screens to systematically validate metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) drivers. One identified enhancer region, GH22I030351, acts on a bidirectional promoter to simultaneously modulate expression of the U2-associated splicing factor SF3A1 and chromosomal protein CCDC157. SF3A1 and CCDC157 promote tumor growth in vivo . We nominated a number of transcription factors, notably SOX6, to regulate expression of SF3A1 and CCDC157. Our integrative approach enables the systematic detection of non-coding regulatory regions that drive human cancers.

Title: High-throughput functional analysis of lncRNA core promoters elucidates rules governing tissue specificity

Abstract:
Transcription initiates at both coding and noncoding genomic elements, including mRNA and long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) core promoters and enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). However, each class has a different expression profile with lncRNAs and eRNAs being the most tissue specific. How these complex differences in expression profiles and tissue specificities are encoded in a single DNA sequence remains unresolved. Here, we address this question using computational approaches and massively parallel reporter assays (MPRA) surveying hundreds of promoters and enhancers. We find that both divergent lncRNA and mRNA core promoters have higher capacities to drive transcription than nondivergent lncRNA and mRNA core promoters, respectively. Conversely, intergenic lncRNAs (lincRNAs) and eRNAs have lower capacities to drive transcription and are more tissue specific than divergent genes. This higher tissue specificity is strongly associated with having less complex transcription factor (TF) motif profiles at the core promoter. We experimentally validated these findings by testing both engineered single-nucleotide deletions and human single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in MPRA. In both cases, we observe that single nucleotides associated with many motifs are important drivers of promoter activity. Thus, we suggest that high TF motif density serves as a robust mechanism to increase promoter activity at the expense of tissue specificity. Moreover, we find that 22% of common SNPs in core promoter regions have significant regulatory effects. Collectively, our findings show that high TF motif density provides redundancy and increases promoter activity at the expense of tissue specificity, suggesting that specificity of expression may be regulated by simplicity of motif usage.

Title: Transcription factor binding site orientation and order are major drivers of gene regulatory activity

Abstract:
The gene regulatory code and grammar remain largely unknown, precluding our ability to link phenotype to genotype in regulatory sequences. Here, using a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) of 209,440 sequences, we examine all possible pair and triplet combinations, permutations and orientations of eighteen liver-associated transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). We find that TFBS orientation and order have a major effect on gene regulatory activity. Corroborating these results with genomic analyses, we find clear human promoter TFBS orientation biases and similar TFBS orientation and order transcriptional effects in an MPRA that tested 164,307 liver candidate regulatory elements. Additionally, by adding TFBS orientation to a model that predicts expression from sequence we improve performance by 7.7%. Collectively, our results show that TFBS orientation and order have a significant effect on gene regulatory activity and need to be considered when analyzing the functional effect of variants on the activity of these sequences.

Abstract:
Epithelial responses to the cytokine interleukin-13 (IL-13) cause airway obstruction in asthma. Here we utilized multiple genomic techniques to identify IL-13-responsive regulatory elements in bronchial epithelial cells and used these data to develop a CRISPR interference (CRISPRi)-based therapeutic approach to downregulate airway obstruction-inducing genes in a cell type- and IL-13-specific manner. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and acetylated lysine 27 on histone 3 (H3K27ac) chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) in primary human bronchial epithelial cells, we identified IL-13-responsive genes and regulatory elements. These sequences were functionally validated and optimized via massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) for IL-13-inducible activity. The top secretory cell-selective sequence from the MPRA, a novel, distal enhancer of the sterile alpha motif pointed domain containing E-26 transformation-specific transcription factor ( SPDEF ) gene, was utilized to drive CRISPRi and knock down SPDEF or mucin 5AC ( MUC5AC ), both involved in pathologic mucus production in asthma. Our work provides a catalog of cell type-specific genes and regulatory elements involved in IL-13 bronchial epithelial response and showcases their use for therapeutic purposes.

Title: Local sequence features that influence AP-1 cis -regulatory activity
Authors: Hemangi G. Chaudhari, Barak A. Cohen
Date: 2018-02

Abstract:
In the genome, most occurrences of transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) have no cis -regulatory activity, which suggests that flanking sequences contain information that distinguishes functional from nonfunctional TFBS. We interrogated the role of flanking sequences near Activator Protein 1 (AP-1) binding sites that reside in DNase I Hypersensitive Sites (DHS) and regions annotated as Enhancers. In these regions, we found that sequence features directly adjacent to the core motif distinguish high from low activity AP-1 sites. Some nearby features are motifs for other TFs that genetically interact with the AP-1 site. Other features are extensions of the AP-1 core motif, which cause the extended sites to match motifs of multiple AP-1 binding proteins. Computational models trained on these data distinguish between sequences with high and low activity AP-1 sites and also predict changes in cis -regulatory activity due to mutations in AP-1 core sites and their flanking sequences. Our results suggest that extended AP-1 binding sites, together with adjacent binding sites for additional TFs, encode part of the information that governs TFBS activity in the genome.

Title: Systematic representation and optimization enable the inverse design of cross-species regulatory sequences in bacteria
Authors: Pengcheng Zhang, Qixiu Du, Ye Wang, Lei Wei, Xiaowo Wang
Date: 2025-02-19

Abstract:
Regulatory sequences encode crucial gene expression signals, yet the sequence characteristics that determine their functionality across species remain obscure. Deep generative models have demonstrated considerable potential in various inverse design applications, especially in engineering genetic elements. Here, we introduce DeepCROSS, a generative artificial intelligence framework for the inverse design of cross-species and species-preferred 5’ regulatory sequences in bacteria. DeepCROSS constructs a meta-representation using 1.8 million regulatory sequences from thousands of bacterial genomes to depict the general constraints of regulatory sequences, employs artificial intelligence-guided massively parallel reporter assay experiments in E. coli and P. aeruginosa to explore the potential sequence space, and performs multi-task optimization to obtain de novo regulatory sequences. The optimized regulatory sequences achieve similar or better performance to functional natural regulatory sequences, with high success rates and low sequence similarities with the natural genome. Collectively, DeepCROSS efficiently navigates the sequence-function landscape and enables the inverse design of cross-species and species-preferred 5’ regulatory sequences.

Date: 2017-10-23

Abstract:
Most cancer risk-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are noncoding and it is challenging to assess their functional impacts. To systematically identify the SNPs that affect gene expression by modulating activities of distal regulatory elements, we adapt the self-transcribing active regulatory region sequencing (STARR-seq) strategy, a high-throughput technique to functionally quantify enhancer activities. From 10,673 SNPs linked with 996 cancer risk-associated SNPs identified in previous GWAS studies, we identify 575 SNPs in the fragments that positively regulate gene expression, and 758 SNPs in the fragments with negative regulatory activities. Among them, 70 variants are regulatory variants for which the two alleles confer different regulatory activities. We analyze in depth two regulatory variants—breast cancer risk SNP rs11055880 and leukemia risk-associated SNP rs12142375—and demonstrate their endogenous regulatory activities on expression of ATF7IP and PDE4B genes, respectively, using a CRISPR-Cas9 approach. By identifying regulatory variants associated with cancer susceptibility and studying their molecular functions, we hope to help the interpretation of GWAS results and provide improved information for cancer risk assessment.

Abstract:
A scarcity of functionally validated enhancers in the human genome presents a significant hurdle to understanding how these cis -regulatory elements contribute to human diseases. We carry out highly multiplexed CRISPR-based perturbation and sequencing to identify enhancers required for cell proliferation and fitness in 10 human cancer cell lines. Our results suggest that the cell fitness enhancers, unlike their target genes, display high cell-type specificity of chromatin features. They typically adopt a modular structure, comprised of activating elements enriched for motifs of oncogenic transcription factors, surrounded by repressive elements enriched for motifs recognized by transcription factors with tumor suppressor functions. We further identify cell fitness enhancers that are selectively accessible in clinical tumor samples, and the levels of chromatin accessibility are associated with patient survival. These results reveal functional enhancers across multiple cancer cell lines, characterize their context-dependent chromatin organization, and yield insights into altered transcription programs in cancer cells.

Date: 2022-03

Abstract:
Functional consequences of genetic variation in the noncoding human genome are difficult to ascertain despite demonstrated associations to common, complex disease traits. To elucidate properties of functional noncoding SNPs with effects in human endothelial cells (ECs), we utilized our previous molecular quantitative trait locus (molQTL) analysis for transcription factor binding, chromatin accessibility, and H3K27 acetylation to nominate a set of likely functional noncoding SNPs. Together with information from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) for vascular disease traits, we tested the ability of 34,344 variants to perturb enhancer function in ECs using the highly multiplexed STARR-seq assay. Of these, 5711 variants validated, whose enriched attributes included: (1) mutations to TF binding motifs for ETS or AP-1 that are regulators of the EC state; (2) location in accessible and H3K27ac-marked EC chromatin; and (3) molQTL associations whereby alleles associate with differences in chromatin accessibility and TF binding across genetically diverse ECs. Next, using pro-inflammatory IL1B as an activator of cell state, we observed robust evidence (>50%) of context-specific SNP effects, underscoring the prevalence of noncoding gene-by-environment (GxE) effects. Lastly, using these cumulative data, we fine-mapped vascular disease loci and highlighted evidence suggesting mechanisms by which noncoding SNPs at two loci affect risk for pulse pressure/large artery stroke and abdominal aortic aneurysm through respective effects on transcriptional regulation of POU4F1 and LDAH . Together, we highlight the attributes and context dependence of functional noncoding SNPs and provide new mechanisms underlying vascular disease risk.

Abstract:
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of vision loss worldwide. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of AMD have identified dozens of risk loci that may house disease targets. However, variants at these loci are largely noncoding, making it difficult to assess their function and whether they are causal. Here, we present a single-cell gene expression and chromatin accessibility atlas of human retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and choroid to systematically analyze both coding and noncoding variants implicated in AMD. We employ HiChIP and Activity-by-Contact modeling to map enhancers in these tissues and predict cell and gene targets of risk variants. We further perform allele-specific self-transcribing active regulatory region sequencing (STARR-seq) to functionally test variant activity in RPE cells, including in the context of complement activation. Our work nominates new pathogenic variants and mechanisms in AMD and offers a rich and accessible resource for studying diseases of the RPE and choroid.

Abstract:
Genome-wide epigenomic maps have revealed millions of putative enhancers and promoters, but experimental validation of their function and high-resolution dissection of their driver nucleotides remain limited. Here, we present HiDRA (High-resolution Dissection of Regulatory Activity), a combined experimental and computational method for high-resolution genome-wide testing and dissection of putative regulatory regions. We test ~7 million accessible DNA fragments in a single experiment, by coupling accessible chromatin extraction with self-transcribing episomal reporters (ATAC-STARR-seq). By design, fragments are highly overlapping in densely-sampled accessible regions, enabling us to pinpoint driver regulatory nucleotides by exploiting differences in activity between partially-overlapping fragments using a machine learning model (SHARPR-RE). In GM12878 lymphoblastoid cells, we find ~65,000 regions showing enhancer function, and pinpoint ~13,000 high-resolution driver elements. These are enriched for regulatory motifs, evolutionarily-conserved nucleotides, and disease-associated genetic variants from genome-wide association studies. Overall, HiDRA provides a high-throughput, high-resolution approach for dissecting regulatory regions and driver nucleotides.

Date: 2020-12-08

Abstract:
STARR-seq technology has employed progressively more complex genomic libraries and increased sequencing depths. An issue with the increased complexity and depth is that the coverage in STARR-seq experiments is non-uniform, overdispersed, and often confounded by sequencing biases, such as GC content. Furthermore, STARR-seq readout is confounded by RNA secondary structure and thermodynamic stability. To address these potential confounders, we developed a negative binomial regression framework for uniformly processing STARR-seq data, called STARRPeaker. Moreover, to aid our effort, we generated whole-genome STARR-seq data from the HepG2 and K562 human cell lines and applied STARRPeaker to comprehensively and unbiasedly call enhancers in them.

Title: Translating non-coding genetic associations into a better understanding of immune-mediated disease
Authors: Christina T. Stankey, James C. Lee
Date: 2023-03-01

Abstract:
Genome-wide association studies have identified hundreds of genetic loci that are associated with immune-mediated diseases. Most disease-associated variants are non-coding, and a large proportion of these variants lie within enhancers. As a result, there is a pressing need to understand how common genetic variation might affect enhancer function and thereby contribute to immune-mediated (and other) diseases. In this Review, we first describe statistical and experimental methods to identify causal genetic variants that modulate gene expression, including statistical fine-mapping and massively parallel reporter assays. We then discuss approaches to characterise the mechanisms by which these variants modulate immune function, such as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-based screens. We highlight examples of studies that, by elucidating the effects of disease variants within enhancers, have provided important insights into immune function and uncovered key pathways of disease.

Title: Breaking enhancers to gain insights into developmental defects
Authors: Daniel A Armendariz, Anjana Sundarrajan, Gary C Hon
Date: 2023-07-27

Abstract:
Despite ground-breaking genetic studies that have identified thousands of risk variants for developmental diseases, how these variants lead to molecular and cellular phenotypes remains a gap in knowledge. Many of these variants are non-coding and occur at enhancers, which orchestrate key regulatory programs during development. The prevailing paradigm is that non-coding variants alter the activity of enhancers, impacting gene expression programs, and ultimately contributing to disease risk. A key obstacle to progress is the systematic functional characterization of non-coding variants at scale, especially since enhancer activity is highly specific to cell type and developmental stage. Here, we review the foundational studies of enhancers in developmental disease and current genomic approaches to functionally characterize developmental enhancers and their variants at scale. In the coming decade, we anticipate systematic enhancer perturbation studies to link non-coding variants to molecular mechanisms, changes in cell state, and disease phenotypes.

Title: STARR‐seq and UMI‐STARR‐seq: Assessing Enhancer Activities for Genome‐Wide‐, High‐, and Low‐Complexity Candidate Libraries
Authors: Christoph Neumayr, Michaela Pagani, Alexander Stark, Cosmas D. Arnold
Date: 2019-09-09

Abstract:
The identification of transcriptional enhancers and the quantitative assessment of enhancer activities is essential to understanding how regulatory information for gene expression is encoded in animal and human genomes. Further, it is key to understanding how sequence variants affect enhancer function. STARR‐seq enables the direct and quantitative assessment of enhancer activity for millions of candidate sequences of arbitrary length and origin in parallel, allowing the screening of entire genomes and the establishment of genome‐wide enhancer activity maps. In STARR‐seq, the candidate sequences are cloned downstream of the core promoter into a reporter gene's transcription unit (i.e., the 3′ UTR). Candidates that function as active enhancers lead to the transcription of reporter mRNAs that harbor the candidates’ sequences. This direct coupling of enhancer sequence and enhancer activity in cis enables the straightforward and efficient cloning of complex candidate libraries and the assessment of enhancer activities of millions of candidates in parallel by quantifying the reporter mRNAs by deep sequencing. This article describes how to create focused and genome‐wide human STARR‐seq libraries and how to perform STARR‐seq screens in mammalian cells, and also describes a novel STARR‐seq variant (UMI‐STARR‐seq) that allows the accurate counting of reporter mRNAs for STARR‐seq libraries of low complexity. © 2019 The Authors.

Title: Beyond the Exome: The Non-coding Genome and Enhancers in Neurodevelopmental Disorders and Malformations of Cortical Development
Authors: Elena Perenthaler, Soheil Yousefi, Eva Niggl, Tahsin Stefan Barakat
Date: 2019-07-31

Abstract:
The development of the human cerebral cortex is a complex and dynamic process, in which neural stem cell proliferation, neuronal migration, and post-migratory neuronal organization need to occur in a well-organized fashion. Alterations at any of these crucial stages can result in malformations of cortical development (MCDs), a group of genetically heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorders that present with developmental delay, intellectual disability and epilepsy. Recent progress in genetic technologies, such as next generation sequencing, most often focusing on all protein-coding exons (e.g., whole exome sequencing), allowed the discovery of more than a 100 genes associated with various types of MCDs. Although this has considerably increased the diagnostic yield, most MCD cases remain unexplained. As Whole Exome Sequencing investigates only a minor part of the human genome (1–2%), it is likely that patients, in which no disease-causing mutation has been identified, could harbor mutations in genomic regions beyond the exome. Even though functional annotation of non-coding regions is still lagging behind that of protein-coding genes, tremendous progress has been made in the field of gene regulation. One group of non-coding regulatory regions are enhancers, which can be distantly located upstream or downstream of genes and which can mediate temporal and tissue-specific transcriptional control via long-distance interactions with promoter regions. Although some examples exist in literature that link alterations of enhancers to genetic disorders, a widespread appreciation of the putative roles of these sequences in MCDs is still lacking. Here, we summarize the current state of knowledge on cis -regulatory regions and discuss novel technologies such as massively-parallel reporter assay systems, CRISPR-Cas9-based screens and computational approaches that help to further elucidate the emerging role of the non-coding genome in disease. Moreover, we discuss existing literature on mutations or copy number alterations of regulatory regions involved in brain development. We foresee that the future implementation of the knowledge obtained through ongoing gene regulation studies will benefit patients and will provide an explanation to part of the missing heritability of MCDs and other genetic disorders.

Abstract:
Estrogen Receptor 1 (ESR1; also known as ERα, encoded by ESR1 gene) is the main driver and prime drug target in luminal breast cancer. ESR1 chromatin binding is extensively studied in cell lines and a limited number of human tumors, using consensi of peaks shared among samples. However, little is known about inter-tumor heterogeneity of ESR1 chromatin action, along with its biological implications. Here, we use a large set of ESR1 ChIP-seq data from 70 ESR1 + breast cancers to explore inter-patient heterogeneity in ESR1 DNA binding to reveal a striking inter-tumor heterogeneity of ESR1 action. Of note, commonly shared ESR1 sites show the highest estrogen-driven enhancer activity and are most engaged in long-range chromatin interactions. In addition, the most commonly shared ESR1-occupied enhancers are enriched for breast cancer risk SNP loci. We experimentally confirm SNVs to impact chromatin binding potential for ESR1 and its pioneer factor FOXA1. Finally, in the TCGA breast cancer cohort, we can confirm these variations to associate with differences in expression for the target gene. Cumulatively, we reveal a natural hierarchy of ESR1–chromatin interactions in breast cancers within a highly heterogeneous inter-tumor ESR1 landscape, with the most common shared regions being most active and affected by germline functional risk SNPs for breast cancer development.

Abstract:
The precise roles of chromatin organization at osteoporosis risk loci remain largely elusive. Here, we combined chromatin interaction conformation (Hi-C) profiling and self-transcribing active regulatory region sequencing (STARR-seq) to qualify enhancer activities of prioritized osteoporosis-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We identified 319 SNPs with biased allelic enhancer activity effect (baaSNPs) that linked to hundreds of candidate target genes through chromatin interactions across 146 loci. Functional characterizations revealed active epigenetic enrichment for baaSNPs and prevailing osteoporosis-relevant regulatory roles for their chromatin interaction genes. Further motif enrichment and network mapping prioritized several putative, key transcription factors (TFs) controlling osteoporosis binding to baaSNPs. Specifically, we selected one top-ranked TF and deciphered that an intronic baaSNP (rs11202530) could allele-preferentially bind to YY2 to augment PAPSS2 expression through chromatin interactions and promote osteoblast differentiation. Our results underline the roles of TF-mediated enhancer-promoter contacts for osteoporosis, which may help to better understand the intricate molecular regulatory mechanisms underlying osteoporosis risk loci.

Abstract:
Glucocorticoids (GCs) are a mainstay of contemporary, multidrug chemotherapy in the treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and resistance to GCs remains a major clinical concern. Resistance to GCs is predictive of ALL relapse and poor clinical outcome, and therefore represents a major hurdle limiting further improvements in survival rates. While advances have been made in identifying genes implicated in GC resistance, there remains an insufficient understanding of the impact of cis -regulatory disruptions in resistance. To address this, we mapped the gene regulatory response to GCs in two ALL cell lines using functional genomics and high-throughput reporter assays and identified thousands of GC-responsive changes to chromatin state, including the formation of over 250 GC-responsive super-enhancers and a depletion of AP-1 bound cis -regulatory elements implicated in cell proliferation and anti-apoptotic processes. By integrating our GC response maps with genetic and epigenetic datasets in primary ALL cells from patients, we further uncovered cis -regulatory disruptions at GC-responsive genes that impact GC resistance in childhood ALL. Overall, these data indicate that GCs initiate pervasive effects on the leukemia epigenome, and that alterations to the GC gene regulatory network contribute to GC resistance.

Title: Translation of genome-wide association study: from genomic signals to biological insights
Authors: Winter S. Bruner, Struan F. A. Grant
Date: 2024-10-03

Abstract:
Since the turn of the 21st century, genome-wide association study (GWAS) have successfully identified genetic signals associated with a myriad of common complex traits and diseases. As we transition from establishing robust genetic associations with diverse phenotypes, the central challenge is now focused on characterizing the underlying functional mechanisms driving these signals. Previous GWAS efforts have revealed multiple variants, each conferring relatively subtle susceptibility, collectively contributing to the pathogenesis of various common diseases. Such variants can further exhibit associations with multiple other traits and differ across ancestries, plus disentangling causal variants from non-causal due to linkage disequilibrium complexities can lead to challenges in drawing direct biological conclusions. Combined with cellular context considerations, such challenges can reduce the capacity to definitively elucidate the biological significance of GWAS signals, limiting the potential to define mechanistic insights. This review will detail current and anticipated approaches for functional interpretation of GWAS signals, both in terms of characterizing the underlying causal variants and the corresponding effector genes.

Abstract:
Gene expression is controlled by the collective binding of transcription factors to cis -regulatory regions. Deciphering gene-centered regulatory networks is vital to understanding and controlling gene misexpression in human disease; however, systematic approaches to uncovering regulatory networks have been lacking. Here we present high-throughput interrogation of gene-centered activation networks (HIGAN), a pipeline that employs a suite of multifaceted genomic approaches to connect upstream signaling inputs, trans -acting TFs, and cis -regulatory elements. We apply HIGAN to understand the aberrant activation of the cytidine deaminase APOBEC3B, an intrinsic source of cancer hypermutation. We reveal that nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and AP-1 pathways are the most salient trans -acting inputs, with minor roles for other inflammatory pathways. We identify a cis -regulatory architecture dominated by a major intronic enhancer that requires coordinated NF-κB and AP-1 activity with secondary inputs from distal regulatory regions. Our data demonstrate how integration of cis and trans genomic screening platforms provides a paradigm for building gene-centered regulatory networks.

Title: MAE-seq refines regulatory elements across the genome

Abstract:
Proper cell fate determination relies on precise spatial and temporal genome-wide cooperation between regulatory elements (REs) and their targeted genes. However, the lengths of REs defined using different methods vary, which indicates that there is sequence redundancy and that the context of the genome may be unintelligible. We developed a method called MAE-seq (Massive Active Enhancers by Sequencing) to experimentally identify functional REs at a 25-bp scale. In this study, MAE-seq was used to identify 626879, 541617 and 554826 25-bp enhancers in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), C2C12 and HEK 293T, respectively. Using ∼1.6 trillion 25 bp DNA fragments and screening 12 billion cells, we identified 626879 as active enhancers in mESCs as an example. Comparative analysis revealed that most of the histone modification datasets were annotated by MAE-Seq loci. Furthermore, 33.85% (212195) of the identified enhancers were identified as de novo ones with no epigenetic modification. Intriguingly, distinct chromatin states dictate the requirement for dissimilar cofactors in governing novel and known enhancers. Validation results show that these 25-bp sequences could act as a functional unit, which shows identical or similar expression patterns as the previously defined larger elements, Enhanced resolution facilitated the identification of numerous cell-specific enhancers and their accurate annotation as super enhancers. Moreover, we characterized novel elements capable of augmenting gene activity. By integrating with high-resolution Hi-C data, over 55.64% of novel elements may have a distal association with different targeted genes. For example, we found that the Cdh1 gene interacts with one novel and two known REs in mESCs. The biological effects of these interactions were investigated using CRISPR-Cas9, revealing their role in coordinating Cdh1 gene expression and mESC proliferation. Our study presents an experimental approach to refine the REs at 25-bp resolution, advancing the precision of genome annotation and unveiling the underlying genome context. This novel approach not only advances our understanding of gene regulation but also opens avenues for comprehensive exploration of the genomic landscape.

Abstract:
Functional characterization of disease-causing variants at risk loci has been a significant challenge. Here we report a high-throughput single-nucleotide polymorphisms sequencing (SNPs-seq) technology to simultaneously screen hundreds to thousands of SNPs for their allele-dependent protein-binding differences. This technology takes advantage of higher retention rate of protein-bound DNA oligos in protein purification column to quantitatively sequence these SNP-containing oligos. We apply this technology to test prostate cancer-risk loci and observe differential allelic protein binding in a significant number of selected SNPs. We also test a unique application of self-transcribing active regulatory region sequencing (STARR-seq) in characterizing allele-dependent transcriptional regulation and provide detailed functional analysis at two risk loci ( RGS17 and ASCL2 ). Together, we introduce a powerful high-throughput pipeline for large-scale screening of functional SNPs at disease risk loci.

Abstract:
The identification of transcriptional enhancers in the human genome is a prime goal in biology. Enhancers are typically predicted via chromatin marks, yet their function is primarily assessed with plasmid-based reporter assays. Here, we show that two previous observations relating to plasmid-transfection into human cells render such assays unreliable: (1) the function of the bacterial plasmid origin-of-replication (ORI) as conflicting core-promoter and (2) the activation of a type-I-interferon (IFN-I) response. These problems cause strongly confounding false-positives and -negatives in luciferase assays and STARR-seq screens. We overcome both problems by employing the ORI as core-promoter and by inhibiting two IFN-I-inducing kinases. This corrects luciferase assays and enables genome-wide STARR-seq screens in human cells. In HeLa-S3 cells, we uncover strong enhancers, IFN-I-induced enhancers, and enhancers endogenously silenced at the chromatin level. Our findings apply to all episomal enhancer activity assays in mammalian cells, and are key to the characterization of human enhancers.

Title: HDI-STARR-seq: Condition-specific enhancer discovery in mouse liver in vivo
Authors: Ting-Ya Chang, David J Waxman
Date: 2024-06-12

Abstract:
STARR-seq and other massively-parallel reporter assays are widely used to discover functional enhancers in transfected cell models, which can be confounded by plasmid vector-induced type-I interferon immune responses and lack the multicellular environment and endogenous chromatin state of complex mammalian tissues. Here, we describe HDI-STARR-seq, which combines STARR-seq plasmid library delivery to the liver, by hydrodynamic tail vein injection (HDI), with reporter RNA transcriptional initiation driven by a minimal Albumin promoter, which we show is essential for mouse liver STARR-seq enhancer activity assayed 7 days after HDI. Importantly, little or no vector-induced innate type-I interferon responses were observed. Comparisons of HDI-STARR-seq activity between male and female mouse livers and in livers from males treated with an activating ligand of the transcription factor CAR ( Nr1i3 ) identified many condition-dependent enhancers linked to condition-specific gene expression. Further, thousands of active liver enhancers were identified using a high complexity STARR-seq library comprised of ~ 50,000 genomic regions released by DNase-I digestion of mouse liver nuclei. When compared to stringently inactive library sequences, the active enhancer sequences identified were highly enriched for liver open chromatin regions with activating histone marks (H3K27ac, H3K4me1, H3K4me3), were significantly closer to gene transcriptional start sites, and were significantly depleted of repressive (H3K27me3, H3K9me3) and transcribed region histone marks (H3K36me3). HDI-STARR-seq offers substantial improvements over current methodologies for large scale, functional profiling of enhancers, including condition-dependent enhancers, in liver tissue in vivo, and can be adapted to characterize enhancer activities in a variety of species and tissues by selecting suitable tissue- and species-specific promoter sequences.

Abstract:
To elucidate the genetic basis of primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG) by identifying pathogenic tissue and critical tissue-specific variants. The correlations among PACG susceptibility, axial length (AL), and anterior chamber depth (ACD) were evaluated using meta-analyses. Propensity score matching was utilized on 2161 participants from the Handan Eye Study to determine the risk factors independent of ACD and AL for PACG. Subsequently, we employed the assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (ATAC-seq) and allele-specific self-transcribing active regulatory region sequencing (STARR-seq) to screen 202 PACG genome-wide association study (GWAS) variants for chromatin accessibility and functional roles. The meta-analysis found that PACG susceptibility loci are not associated with ACD or AL. However, abnormal iris phenotypes emerged as significant independent risk factors for primary angle-closure disease (PACD), unrelated to ACD and AL. Substantial enrichment of PACG heritability was observed in the open chromatin regions of the human iris. Within the iris-relevant cellular context, 22 out of the 202 PACG GWAS variants could influence enhancer activity. Two variants in the iris open chromatin regions were implicated in the modulation of PLEKHA7 and C10orf53 expression. The downregulation of these two genes affects cytoskeletal organization. Our findings underscore the importance of the iris in the pathogenesis of PACG and identified iris-specific, enhancer-modulating variants that may influence disease risk. Our approach also provides a generalizable framework for studying ocular diseases from the perspective of enhancer-modulating variants.

Abstract:
Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) can differentiate into any given cell type and therefore represent a versatile model to study the link between gene regulation and differentiation. To quantitatively assess the dynamics of enhancer activity during the early stages of murine ESC differentiation, we analyzed accessible genomic regions using STARR-seq, a massively parallel reporter assay. This resulted in a genome-wide quantitative map of active mESC enhancers, in pluripotency and during the early stages of differentiation. We find that only a minority of accessible regions is active and that such regions are enriched near promoters, characterized by specific chromatin marks, enriched for distinct sequence motifs, and modeling shows that active regions can be predicted from sequence alone. Regions that change their activity upon retinoic acid-induced differentiation are more prevalent at distal intergenic regions when compared to constitutively active enhancers. Further, analysis of differentially active enhancers verified the contribution of individual TF motifs toward activity and inducibility as well as their role in regulating endogenous genes. Notably, the activity of retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARα) occupied regions can either increase or decrease upon the addition of its ligand, retinoic acid, with the direction of the change correlating with spacing and orientation of the RARα consensus motif and the co-occurrence of additional sequence motifs. Together, our genome-wide enhancer activity map elucidates features associated with enhancer activity levels, identifies regulatory regions disregarded by computational prediction tools, and provides a resource for future studies into regulatory elements in mESCs.

Abstract:
Bound by lineage-determining transcription factors and signaling effectors, enhancers play essential roles in controlling spatiotemporal gene expression profiles during development, homeostasis and disease. Recent synergistic advances in functional genomic technologies, combined with the developmental biology toolbox, have resulted in unprecedented genome-wide annotation of heart enhancers and their target genes. Starting with early studies of vertebrate heart enhancers and ending with state-of-the-art genome-wide enhancer discovery and testing, we will review how studying heart enhancers in metazoan species has helped inform our understanding of cardiac development and disease.

Abstract:
Oct4, along with Sox2 and Klf4 (SK), can induce pluripotency but structurally similar factors like Oct6 cannot. To decode why Oct4 has this unique ability, we compare Oct4-binding, accessibility patterns and transcriptional waves with Oct6 and an Oct4 mutant defective in the dimerization with Sox2 (Oct4 defSox2 ). We find that initial silencing of the somatic program proceeds indistinguishably with or without Oct4. Oct6 mitigates the mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition and derails reprogramming. These effects are a consequence of differences in genome-wide binding, as the early binding profile of Oct4 defSox2 resembles Oct4, whilst Oct6 does not bind pluripotency enhancers. Nevertheless, in the Oct6-SK condition many otherwise Oct4-bound locations become accessible but chromatin opening is compromised when Oct4 defSox2 occupies these sites. We find that Sox2 predominantly facilitates chromatin opening, whilst Oct4 serves an accessory role. Formation of Oct4/Sox2 heterodimers is essential for pluripotency establishment; however, reliance on Oct4/Sox2 heterodimers declines during pluripotency maintenance.

Title: Underlying causes for prevalent false positives and false negatives in STARR-seq data
Authors: Pengyu Ni, Siwen Wu, Zhengchang Su
Date: 2023-09

Abstract:
Self-transcribing active regulatory region sequencing (STARR-seq) and its variants have been widely used to characterize enhancers. However, it has been reported that up to 87% of STARR-seq peaks are located in repressive chromatin and are not functional in the tested cells. While some of the STARR-seq peaks in repressive chromatin might be active in other cell/tissue types, some others might be false positives. Meanwhile, many active enhancers may not be identified by the current STARR-seq methods. Although methods have been proposed to mitigate systematic errors caused by the use of plasmid vectors, the artifacts due to the intrinsic limitations of current STARR-seq methods are still prevalent and the underlying causes are not fully understood. Based on predicted cis -regulatory modules (CRMs) and non-CRMs in the human genome as well as predicted active CRMs and non-active CRMs in a few human cell lines/tissues with STARR-seq data available, we reveal prevalent false positives and false negatives in STARR-seq peaks generated by major variants of STARR-seq methods and possible underlying causes. Our results will help design strategies to improve STARR-seq methods and interpret the results.

Title: Master lineage transcription factors anchor trans mega transcriptional complexes at highly accessible enhancer sites to promote long-range chromatin clustering and transcription of distal target genes
Authors: Shannon M White, Michael P Snyder, Chunling Yi
Date: 2021-12-02

Abstract:
The term ‘super enhancers’ (SE) has been widely used to describe stretches of closely localized enhancers that are occupied collectively by large numbers of transcription factors (TFs) and co-factors, and control the transcription of highly-expressed genes. Through integrated analysis of >600 DNase-seq, ChIP-seq, GRO-seq, STARR-seq, RNA-seq, Hi-C and ChIA-PET data in five human cancer cell lines, we identified a new class of autonomous SEs (aSEs) that are excluded from classic SE calls by the widely used Rank Ordering of Super-Enhancers (ROSE) method. TF footprint analysis revealed that compared to classic SEs and regular enhancers, aSEs are tightly bound by a dense array of master lineage TFs, which serve as anchors to recruit additional TFs and co-factors in trans . In addition, aSEs are preferentially enriched for Cohesins, which likely involve in stabilizing long-distance interactions between aSEs and their distal target genes. Finally, we showed that aSEs can be reliably predicted using a single DNase-seq data or combined with Mediator and/or P300 ChIP-seq. Overall, our study demonstrates that aSEs represent a unique class of functionally important enhancer elements that distally regulate the transcription of highly expressed genes.

Title: Integration of Count Difference and Curve Similarity in Negative Regulatory Element Detection
Authors: Na He, Wenjing Wang, Chao Fang, Yongjian Tan, Li Li, Chunhui Hou
Date: 2022-02-18

Abstract:
Negative regulatory elements (NREs) down-regulate gene expression by inhibiting the activities of promoters or enhancers. The repressing activity of NREs can be measured globally by massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs). However, most existing algorithms are designed for the statistical detection of positively enriched signals in MPRA datasets. To identify reduced signals in MPRA experiments, we designed a NRE identification program, fast-NR, by integrating the count and graphic features of sequenced reads to detect NREs using datasets generated by experiments of self-transcribing active regulatory region sequencing (STARR-seq). Fast-NR identified hundreds of silencers in human K562 cells that can be validated by independent methods.

Abstract:
Genome-wide association studies have identified numerous variants associated with human complex traits, most of which reside in the non-coding regions, but biological mechanisms remain unclear. However, assigning function to the non-coding elements is still challenging. Here we apply Activity-by-Contact (ABC) model to evaluate enhancer-gene regulation effect by integrating multi-omics data and identified 544,849 connections across 20 cancer types. ABC model outperforms previous approaches in linking regulatory variants to target genes. Furthermore, we identify over 30,000 enhancer-gene connections in colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues. By integrating large-scale population cohorts (23,813 cases and 29,973 controls) and multipronged functional assays, we demonstrate an ABC regulatory variant rs4810856 associated with CRC risk (Odds Ratio = 1.11, 95%CI = 1.05–1.16, P = 4.02 × 10 −5 ) by acting as an allele-specific enhancer to distally facilitate PREX1 , CSE1L and STAU1 expression, which synergistically activate p-AKT signaling. Our study provides comprehensive regulation maps and illuminates a single variant regulating multiple genes, providing insights into cancer etiology.

Date: 2015-08

Abstract:
We report a novel high-throughput method to empirically quantify individual-specific regulatory element activity at the population scale. The approach combines targeted DNA capture with a high-throughput reporter gene expression assay. As demonstration, we measured the activity of more than 100 putative regulatory elements from 95 individuals in a single experiment. In agreement with previous reports, we found that most genetic variants have weak effects on distal regulatory element activity. Because haplotypes are typically maintained within but not between assayed regulatory elements, the approach can be used to identify causal regulatory haplotypes that likely contribute to human phenotypes. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of the method to functionally fine map causal regulatory variants in regions of high linkage disequilibrium identified by expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analyses.

Abstract:
Joint profiling of chromatin accessibility and gene expression in individual cells provides an opportunity to decipher enhancer-driven gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Here we present a method for the inference of enhancer-driven GRNs, called SCENIC+. SCENIC+ predicts genomic enhancers along with candidate upstream transcription factors (TFs) and links these enhancers to candidate target genes. To improve both recall and precision of TF identification, we curated and clustered a motif collection with more than 30,000 motifs. We benchmarked SCENIC+ on diverse datasets from different species, including human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, ENCODE cell lines, melanoma cell states and Drosophila retinal development. Next, we exploit SCENIC+ predictions to study conserved TFs, enhancers and GRNs between human and mouse cell types in the cerebral cortex. Finally, we use SCENIC+ to study the dynamics of gene regulation along differentiation trajectories and the effect of TF perturbations on cell state. SCENIC+ is available at scenicplus.readthedocs.io .

Title: Transcriptional repression and enhancer decommissioning silence cell cycle genes in postmitotic tissues
Authors: Elizabeth A Fogarty, Elli M Buchert, Yiqin Ma, Ava B Nicely, Laura A Buttitta
Date: 2024-10

Abstract:
The mechanisms that maintain a non-cycling status in postmitotic tissues are not well understood. Many cell cycle genes have promoters and enhancers that remain accessible even when cells are terminally differentiated and in a non-cycling state, suggesting their repression must be maintained long term. In contrast, enhancer decommissioning has been observed for rate-limiting cell cycle genes in the Drosophila wing, a tissue where the cells die soon after eclosion, but it has been unclear if this also occurs in other contexts of terminal differentiation. In this study, we show that enhancer decommissioning also occurs at specific, rate-limiting cell cycle genes in the long-lived tissues of the Drosophila eye and brain, and we propose this loss of chromatin accessibility may help maintain a robust postmitotic state. We examined the decommissioned enhancers at specific rate-limiting cell cycle genes and showed that they encode for dynamic temporal and spatial expression patterns that include shared, as well as tissue-specific elements, resulting in broad gene expression with developmentally controlled temporal regulation. We extend our analysis to cell cycle gene expression and chromatin accessibility in the mammalian retina using a published dataset and find that the principles of cell cycle gene regulation identified in terminally differentiating Drosophila tissues are conserved in the differentiating mammalian retina. We propose a robust, non-cycling status is maintained in long-lived postmitotic tissues through a combination of stable repression at most cell cycle genes, alongside enhancer decommissioning at specific rate-limiting cell cycle genes.

Abstract:
Genome wide association studies (GWASs) have identified numerous risk loci associated with prostate cancer, yet unraveling their functional significance remains elusive. Leveraging our high-throughput SNPs-seq method, we pinpointed rs4519489 within the multi-ancestry GWAS-discovered 2p25 locus as a potential functional SNP due to its significant allelic differences in protein binding. Here, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of rs4519489 and its associated gene, NOL10, employing diverse cohort data and experimental models. Clinical findings reveal a synergistic effect between rs4519489 genotype and NOL10 expression on prostate cancer prognosis and severity. Through unbiased proteomics screening, we reveal that the risk allele A of rs4519489 exhibits enhanced binding to USF1, a novel oncogenic transcription factor (TF) implicated in prostate cancer progression and prognosis, resulting in elevated NOL10 expression. Furthermore, we elucidate that NOL10 regulates cell cycle pathways, fostering prostate cancer progression. The concurrent expression of NOL10 and USF1 correlates with aggressive prostate cancer characteristics and poorer prognosis. Collectively, our study offers a robust strategy for functional SNP screening and TF identification through high-throughput SNPs-seq and unbiased proteomics, highlighting the rs4519489-USF1-NOL10 regulatory axis as a promising biomarker or therapeutic target for clinical diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer.

Further, thousands of active liver enhancers were identified using a high complexity STARR-seq library comprised of ~ 50,000 genomic regions released by DNase-I digestion of mouse liver nuclei. When compared to stringently inactive library sequences, the active enhancer sequences identified were highly enriched for liver open chromatin regions with activating histone marks (H3K27ac, H3K4me1, H3K4me3), were significantly closer to gene transcriptional start sites, and were significantly depleted of repressive (H3K27me3, H3K9me3) and transcribed region histone marks (H3K36me3). HDI-STARR-seq offers substantial improvements over current methodologies for large scale, functional profiling of enhancers, including condition-dependent enhancers, in liver tissue in vivo, and can be adapted to characterize enhancer activities in a variety of species and tissues by selecting suitable tissue- and species-specific promoter sequences.

Title: Exploring the Role of Enhancer-Mediated Transcriptional Regulation in Precision Biology
Authors: Xueyan Wang, Danli Liu, Jing Luo, Dashuai Kong, Yubo Zhang
Date: 2023-06-29

Abstract:
The emergence of precision biology has been driven by the development of advanced technologies and techniques in high-resolution biological research systems. Enhancer-mediated transcriptional regulation, a complex network of gene expression and regulation in eukaryotes, has attracted significant attention as a promising avenue for investigating the underlying mechanisms of biological processes and diseases. To address biological problems with precision, large amounts of data, functional information, and research on the mechanisms of action of biological molecules is required to address biological problems with precision. Enhancers, including typical enhancers and super enhancers, play a crucial role in gene expression and regulation within this network. The identification and targeting of disease-associated enhancers hold the potential to advance precision medicine. In this review, we present the concepts, progress, importance, and challenges in precision biology, transcription regulation, and enhancers. Furthermore, we propose a model of transcriptional regulation for multi-enhancers and provide examples of their mechanisms in mammalian cells, thereby enhancing our understanding of how enhancers achieve precise regulation of gene expression in life processes. Precision biology holds promise in providing new tools and platforms for discovering insights into gene expression and disease occurrence, ultimately benefiting individuals and society as a whole.

Title: Progress and challenges in bioinformatics approaches for enhancer identification
Authors: Dimitrios Kleftogiannis, Panos Kalnis, Vladimir B. Bajic
Date: 2016-11

Abstract:
Enhancers are cis -acting DNA elements that play critical roles in distal regulation of gene expression. Identifying enhancers is an important step for understanding distinct gene expression programs that may reflect normal and pathogenic cellular conditions. Experimental identification of enhancers is constrained by the set of conditions used in the experiment. This requires multiple experiments to identify enhancers, as they can be active under specific cellular conditions but not in different cell types/tissues or cellular states. This has opened prospects for computational prediction methods that can be used for high-throughput identification of putative enhancers to complement experimental approaches. Potential functions and properties of predicted enhancers have been catalogued and summarized in several enhancer-oriented databases. Because the current methods for the computational prediction of enhancers produce significantly different enhancer predictions, it will be beneficial for the research community to have an overview of the strategies and solutions developed in this field. In this review, we focus on the identification and analysis of enhancers by bioinformatics approaches. First, we describe a general framework for computational identification of enhancers, present relevant data types and discuss possible computational solutions. Next, we cover over 30 existing computational enhancer identification methods that were developed since 2000. Our review highlights advantages, limitations and potentials, while suggesting pragmatic guidelines for development of more efficient computational enhancer prediction methods. Finally, we discuss challenges and open problems of this topic, which require further consideration.

Title: Enhancer and super‐enhancer: Positive regulators in gene transcription
Authors: Yanling Peng, Yubo Zhang
Date: 2018-09-25

Abstract:
Enhancer is a positive regulator for spatiotemporal development in eukaryotes. As a cluster, super‐enhancer is closely related to cell identity‐ and fate‐determined processes. Both of them function tightly depending on their targeted transcription factors, cofactors, and genes through distal genomic interactions. They have been recognized as critical components and played positive roles in transcriptional regulatory network or factory. Recent advances of next‐generation sequencing have dramatically expanded our ability and knowledge to interrogate the molecular mechanism of enhancer and super‐enhancer for transcription. Here, we review the history, importance, advances and challenges on enhancer and super‐enhancer field. This will benefit our understanding of their function mechanism for transcription underlying precise gene expression.

Title: Transcriptional repression and enhancer decommissioning silence cell cycle genes in postmitotic tissues
Authors: Elizabeth A. Fogarty, Elli M. Buchert, Yiqin Ma, Ava B. Nicely, Laura A. Buttitta
Date: 2024-05-07

Abstract:
The mechanisms that maintain a non-cycling status in postmitotic tissues are not well understood. Many cell cycle genes have promoters and enhancers that remain accessible even when cells are terminally differentiated and in a non-cycling state, suggesting their repression must be maintained long term. In contrast, enhancer decommissioning has been observed for rate-limiting cell cycle genes in the Drosophila wing, a tissue where the cells die soon after eclosion, but it has been unclear if this also occurs in other contexts of terminal differentiation. In this study, we show that enhancer decommissioning also occurs at specific, rate-limiting cell cycle genes in the long-lived tissues of the Drosophila eye and brain, and we propose this loss of chromatin accessibility may help maintain a robust postmitotic state. We examined the decommissioned enhancers at specific rate-limiting cell cycle genes and show that they encode dynamic temporal and spatial expression patterns that include shared, as well as tissue-specific elements, resulting in broad gene expression with developmentally controlled temporal regulation. We extend our analysis to cell cycle gene expression and chromatin accessibility in the mammalian retina using a published dataset, and find that the principles of cell cycle gene regulation identified in terminally differentiating Drosophila tissues are conserved in the differentiating mammalian retina. We propose a robust, non-cycling status is maintained in long-lived postmitotic tissues through a combination of stable repression at most cell cycle gens, alongside enhancer decommissioning at specific rate-limiting cell cycle genes.

Title: Abundant repressor binding sites in human enhancers are associated with the fine-tuning of gene regulation
Authors: Wei Song, Ivan Ovcharenko
Date: 2025-01-17

Abstract:
The regulation of gene expression relies on the coordinated action of transcription factors (TFs) at enhancers, including both activator and repressor TFs. We employed deep learning (DL) to dissect HepG2 enhancers into positive (PAR), negative (NAR), and neutral activity regions. Sharpr-MPRA and STARR-seq highlight the dichotomy impact of NARs and PARs on modulating and catalyzing the activity of enhancers, respectively. Approximately 22% of HepG2 enhancers, termed "repressive impact enhancers" (RIEs), are predominantly populated by NARs and transcriptional repression motifs. Genes flanking RIEs exhibit a stage-specific decline in expression during late development, suggesting RIEs' role in trimming enhancer activities. About 16.7% of human NARs emerge from neutral rhesus macaque DNA. This gain of repressor binding sites in RIEs is associated with a 30% decrease in the average expression of flanking genes in humans compared to rhesus macaque. Our work reveals modulated enhancer activity and adaptable gene regulation through the evolutionary dynamics of TF binding sites.

Abstract:
Non-coding regulatory elements (NCREs), such as enhancers, play a crucial role in gene regulation, and genetic aberrations in NCREs can lead to human disease, including brain disorders. The human brain is a complex organ that is susceptible to numerous disorders; many of these are caused by genetic changes, but a multitude remain currently unexplained. Understanding NCREs acting during brain development has the potential to shed light on previously unrecognized genetic causes of human brain disease. Despite immense community-wide efforts to understand the role of the non-coding genome and NCREs, annotating functional NCREs remains challenging. Here we performed an integrative computational analysis of virtually all currently available epigenome data sets related to human fetal brain. Our in-depth analysis unravels 39,709 differentially active enhancers (DAEs) that show dynamic epigenomic rearrangement during early stages of human brain development, indicating likely biological function. Many of these DAEs are linked to clinically relevant genes, and functional validation of selected DAEs in cell models and zebrafish confirms their role in gene regulation. Compared to enhancers without dynamic epigenomic rearrangement, DAEs are subjected to higher sequence constraints in humans, have distinct sequence characteristics and are bound by a distinct transcription factor landscape. DAEs are enriched for GWAS loci for brain-related traits and for genetic variation found in individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism. This compendium of high-confidence enhancers will assist in deciphering the mechanism behind developmental genetics of human brain and will be relevant to uncover missing heritability in human genetic brain disorders.

Abstract:
Control of cell‐type‐specific gene activation requires the coordinated activity of distal regulatory elements, including enhancers, whose inputs must be temporally integrated. Dysregulation of this regulatory capacity, such as aberrant usage of enhancers, can result in malignant transformation of cells. In this review, we provide an overview of our current understanding of enhancer‐driven gene regulation and discuss how this activity may be integrated across time, followed by epigenetic and structural alterations of enhancers in cancers.

Title: Massively parallel reporter assays identify enhancer elements in oesophageal Adenocarcinoma
Authors: Shen-Hsi Yang, Ibrahim Ahmed, Yaoyong Li, Christopher W Bleaney, Andrew D Sharrocks
Date: 2024-12

Abstract:
Cancer is a disease underpinned by aberrant gene expression. Enhancers are regulatory elements that play a major role in transcriptional control and changes in active enhancer function are likely critical in the pathogenesis of oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC). Here, we utilise STARR-seq to profile the genome-wide enhancer landscape in OAC and identify hundreds of high-confidence enhancer elements. These regions are enriched in enhancer-associated chromatin marks, are actively transcribed and exhibit high levels of associated gene activity in OAC cells. These characteristics are maintained in human patient samples, demonstrating their disease relevance. This relevance is further underlined by their responsiveness to oncogenic ERBB2 inhibition and increased activity compared to the pre-cancerous Barrett's state. Mechanistically, these enhancers are linked to the core OAC transcriptional network and in particular KLF5 binding is associated with high level activity, providing further support for a role of this transcription factor in defining the OAC transcriptome. Our results therefore uncover a set of enhancer elements with physiological significance, that widen our understanding of the molecular alterations in OAC and point to mechanisms through which response to targeted therapy may occur.

Abstract:
Environmental stimuli commonly act via changes in gene regulation. Human-genome-scale assays to measure such responses are indirect or require knowledge of the transcription factors (TFs) involved. Here, we present the use of human genome-wide high-throughput reporter assays to measure environmentally-responsive regulatory element activity. We focus on responses to glucocorticoids (GCs), an important class of pharmaceuticals and a paradigmatic genomic response model. We assay GC-responsive regulatory activity across >10 8 unique DNA fragments, covering the human genome at >50×. Those assays directly detected thousands of GC-responsive regulatory elements genome-wide. We then validate those findings with measurements of transcription factor occupancy, histone modifications, chromatin accessibility, and gene expression. We also detect allele-specific environmental responses. Notably, the assays did not require knowledge of GC response mechanisms. Thus, this technology can be used to agnostically quantify genomic responses for which the underlying mechanism remains unknown.

Abstract:
Stress exposure is associated with increased risk for a wide range of psychiatric disorders. The individual long-term impact of stress may be moderated by genetic variants. Using a massively parallel enhancer assay, we identify genetic variants located in gene regulatory elements that modulate the transcriptomic response to glucocorticoids, a major stress hormone. These variants are enriched for variants associated with psychiatric disorders and neurobehavioral traits and influence transcripts that are altered in the postmortem brain of individuals with psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, these genetic variants are associated with changes in the physiological stress response. Together, this suggests that these functional genetic variants may be causally involved in psychopathology, possibly by influencing the physiological stress response and stress-responsive brain transcription.

Abstract:
Schizophrenia is a neuropsychiatric disorder with heritability estimates between 60% and 80%. Although genome-wide association studies have identified many genetic loci linked to the disorder, most of these are noncoding variants whose functional impacts are not well understood. To bridge this gap, we prioritized potential functional variants linked to schizophrenia by utilizing a human brain epigenomic roadmap. We assessed the regulatory activity of these variants using an adapted STARR-seq screening method across four cell lines: Neuro-2a, SH-SY5Y, HEK-293T, and PC-12. Furthermore, we pinpointed candidate target genes through functional characterization and investigated their roles using zebrafish models. Our study identified 351 candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Among these, 46 SNPs exhibited biased allelic enhancer activity, termed baaSNPs, with notable cell-type specificity. Chromatin interaction profiling and expression quantitative trait loci analyses linked these baaSNPs to 217 candidate target genes, and pathway enrichment analysis indicated that these genes are involved in critical neurological processes such as synaptic transmission and GABAergic signaling. One baaSNP in particular, rs13072690, showed regulatory effects across all examined cell lines and was associated with reduced expression of the PCCB gene in multiple brain regions. Heterozygous pccb knockout zebrafish exhibited abnormal behaviors, including hyperactivity, increased anxiety-like responses, and social deficits. In conclusion, our study demonstrates a valuable strategy for functionally annotating putative risk variants, complementing epigenetic approaches by providing insights into the regulatory potential of noncoding variants associated with schizophrenia. These findings offer promising candidates for further research into the underlying mechanisms of the disorder.

Title: Functional genomic approaches to elucidate the role of enhancers during development
Authors: Genevieve E. Ryan, Emma K. Farley
Date: 2019-12-05

Abstract:
Successful development depends on the precise tissue‐specific regulation of genes by enhancers, genetic elements that act as switches to control when and where genes are expressed. Because enhancers are critical for development, and the majority of disease‐associated mutations reside within enhancers, it is essential to understand which sequences within enhancers are important for function. Advances in sequencing technology have enabled the rapid generation of genomic data that predict putative active enhancers, but functionally validating these sequences at scale remains a fundamental challenge. Herein, we discuss the power of genome‐wide strategies used to identify candidate enhancers, and also highlight limitations and misconceptions that have arisen from these data. We discuss the use of massively parallel reporter assays to test enhancers for function at scale. We also review recent advances in our ability to study gene regulation during development, including CRISPR‐based tools to manipulate genomes and single‐cell transcriptomics to finely map gene expression. Finally, we look ahead to a synthesis of complementary genomic approaches that will advance our understanding of enhancer function during development.

Title: Challenges and considerations for reproducibility of STARR-seq assays

Date: 2023-04

Abstract:
High-throughput methods such as RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, and ATAC-seq have well-established guidelines, commercial kits, and analysis pipelines that enable consistency and wider adoption for understanding genome function and regulation. STARR-seq, a popular assay for directly quantifying the activities of thousands of enhancer sequences simultaneously, has seen limited standardization across studies. The assay is long, with more than 250 steps, and frequent customization of the protocol and variations in bioinformatics methods raise concerns for reproducibility of STARR-seq studies. Here, we assess each step of the protocol and analysis pipelines from published sources and in-house assays, and identify critical steps and quality control (QC) checkpoints necessary for reproducibility of the assay. We also provide guidelines for experimental design, protocol scaling, customization, and analysis pipelines for better adoption of the assay. These resources will allow better optimization of STARR-seq for specific research needs, enable comparisons and integration across studies, and improve the reproducibility of results.

Abstract:
Massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) and self-transcribing active regulatory region sequencing (STARR-seq) have revolutionized enhancer characterization by enabling high-throughput functional assessment of regulatory sequences. Here, we systematically evaluate six MPRA and STARR-seq datasets generated in the human K562 cell line and find substantial inconsistencies in enhancer calls from different labs that are primarily due to technical variations in data processing and experimental workflows. To address these variations, we implement a uniform enhancer call pipeline, which significantly improve cross-assay agreement. While increasing sequence overlap thresholds enhanced concordance in STARR-seq assays, cross-assay consistency in LentiMPRA is strongly influenced by assay-specific factors. Functional validation using candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) confirms that epigenomic features such as chromatin accessibility and histone modifications are strong predictors of enhancer activity. Importantly, our study validates transcription as a critical hallmark of active enhancers, demonstrating that highly transcribed regions exhibit significantly higher active rates across assays. Furthermore, we show that transcription enhances the predictive power of epigenomic features, enabling more accurate and refined enhancer annotation. Our study provides a comprehensive framework for integrating different enhancer datasets and underscores the importance of accounting for assay-specific biases when interpreting enhancer activity. These findings refine enhancer identification using massively parallel reporter assays and improve the functional annotation of the human genome.

Title: Constructing eRNA-mediated gene regulatory networks to explore the genetic basis of muscle and fat-relevant traits in pigs
Authors: Chao Wang, Choulin Chen, Bowen Lei, Shenghua Qin, Yuanyuan Zhang, Kui Li, Song Zhang, Yuwen Liu
Date: 2024-04-09

Abstract:
Enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) play a crucial role in transcriptional regulation. While significant progress has been made in understanding epigenetic regulation mediated by eRNAs, research on the construction of eRNA-mediated gene regulatory networks (eGRN) and the identification of critical network components that influence complex traits is lacking. Here, employing the pig as a model, we conducted a comprehensive study using H3K27ac histone ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data to construct eRNA expression profiles from multiple tissues of two distinct pig breeds, namely Enshi Black (ES) and Duroc. In addition to revealing the regulatory landscape of eRNAs at the tissue level, we developed an innovative network construction and refinement method by integrating RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals and enhancer-modulating effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) measured by self-transcribing active regulatory region sequencing (STARR-seq) experiments. Using this approach, we unraveled eGRN that significantly influence the growth and development of muscle and fat tissues, and identified several novel genes that affect adipocyte differentiation in a cell line model. Our work not only provides novel insights into the genetic basis of economic pig traits, but also offers a generalizable approach to elucidate the eRNA-mediated transcriptional regulation underlying a wide spectrum of complex traits for diverse organisms.

Title: STARR-seq identifies active, chromatin-masked, and dormant enhancers in pluripotent mouse embryonic stem cells
Authors: Tianran Peng, Yanan Zhai, Yaser Atlasi, Menno ter Huurne, Hendrik Marks, Hendrik G. Stunnenberg, Wout Megchelenbrink

Abstract:
Enhancers are distal regulators of gene expression that shape cell identity and control cell fate transitions. In mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), the pluripotency network is maintained by the function of a complex network of enhancers, that are drastically altered upon differentiation. Genome-wide chromatin accessibility and histone modification assays are commonly used as a proxy for identifying putative enhancers and for describing their activity levels and dynamics. Here, we applied STARR-seq, a genome-wide plasmid-based assay, as a read-out for the enhancer landscape in “ground-state” (2i+LIF; 2iL) and “metastable” (serum+LIF; SL) mESCs. This analysis reveals that active STARR-seq loci show modest overlap with enhancer locations derived from peak calling of ChIP-seq libraries for common enhancer marks. We unveil ZIC3-bound loci with significant STARR-seq activity in SL-ESCs. Knock-out of Zic3 removes STARR-seq activity only in SL-ESCs and increases their propensity to differentiate towards the endodermal fate. STARR-seq also reveals enhancers that are not accessible, masked by a repressive chromatin signature. We describe a class of dormant, p53 bound enhancers that gain H3K27ac under specific conditions, such as after treatment with Nocodazol, or transiently during reprogramming from fibroblasts to pluripotency. In conclusion, loci identified as active by STARR-seq often overlap with those identified by chromatin accessibility and active epigenetic marking, yet a significant fraction is epigenetically repressed or display condition-specific enhancer activity.

Title: Analyzing super-enhancer temporal dynamics reveals potential critical enhancers and their gene regulatory networks underlying skeletal muscle development

Abstract:
Super-enhancers (SEs) govern the expression of genes defining cell identity. However, the dynamic landscape of SEs and their critical constituent enhancers involved in skeletal muscle development remains unclear. In this study, using pig as a model, we employed cleavage under targets and tagmentation (CUT&Tag) to profile the enhancer-associated histone modification marker H3K27ac in skeletal muscle across two prenatal and three postnatal stages, and investigated how SEs influence skeletal muscle development. We identify three SE families with distinct temporal dynamics: continuous (Con, 397), transient (TS, 434), and de novo (DN, 756). These SE families are associated with different temporal gene expression trajectories, biological functions, and DNA methylation levels. Notably, several lines of evidence suggest a potential prominent role of Con SEs in regulating porcine muscle development and meat traits. To pinpoint key cis -regulatory units in Con SEs, we developed an integrative approach that leverages information from eRNA annotation, genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals, and high-throughput capture self-transcribing active regulatory region sequencing (STARR-seq) experiments. Within Con SEs, we identify 20 candidate critical enhancers with meat and carcass-associated DNA variations that affect enhancer activity, and infer their upstream transcription factors and downstream target genes. As a proof of concept, we experimentally validate the role of one such enhancer and its potential target gene during myogenesis. Our findings reveal the dynamic regulatory features of SEs in skeletal muscle development and provide a general integrative framework for identifying critical enhancers underlying the formation of complex traits.

Abstract:
Genome-wide association studies have implicated common genomic variants in the gene desert upstream of TBX3 in cardiac conduction velocity. Whether these noncoding variants affect expression of TBX3 or neighboring genes and how they affect cardiac conduction is not understood. Here, we use high-throughput STARR-seq to test the entire 1.3 Mb human and mouse TBX3 locus, including two cardiac conduction-associated variant regions, for regulatory function. We identified multiple accessible and functional regulatory DNA elements that harbor variants affecting their activity. Both variant regions drove gene expression in the cardiac conduction tissue in transgenic reporter mice. Genomic deletion from the mouse genome of one of the regions caused increased cardiac expression of only Tbx3, PR interval shortening and increased QRS duration. Combined, our findings address the mechanistic link between trait-associated variants in the gene desert, TBX3 regulation and cardiac conduction.

Abstract:
There is growing evidence that a wide range of human diseases and physiological traits are influenced by genetic variation of cis -regulatory elements. We and others have shown that a subset of promoter elements, termed Epromoters, also function as enhancer regulators of distal genes. This opens a paradigm in the study of regulatory variants, as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within Epromoters might influence the expression of several (distal) genes at the same time, which could disentangle the identification of disease-associated genes. Here, we built a comprehensive resource of human Epromoters using newly generated and publicly available high-throughput reporter assays. We showed that Epromoters display intrinsic and epigenetic features that distinguish them from typical promoters. By integrating Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS), expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTLs) and 3D chromatin interactions, we found that regulatory variants at Epromoters are concurrently associated with more disease and physiological traits, as compared with typical promoters. To dissect the regulatory impact of Epromoter variants, we evaluated their impact on regulatory activity by analyzing allelic-specific high-throughput reporter assays and provided reliable examples of pleiotropic Epromoters. In summary, our study represents a comprehensive resource of regulatory variants supporting the pleiotropic role of Epromoters.

Title: Global Quantitative Mapping of Enhancers in Rice by STARR-seq
Authors: Jialei Sun, Na He, Longjian Niu, Yingzhang Huang, Wei Shen, Yuedong Zhang, Li Li, Chunhui Hou
Date: 2019-04

Abstract:
Enhancers activate transcription in a distance-, orientation-, and position-independent manner, which makes them difficult to be identified. Self-transcribing active regulatory region sequencing (STARR-seq) measures the enhancer activity of millions of DNA fragments in parallel. Here we used STARR-seq to generate a quantitative global map of rice enhancers. Most enhancers were mapped within genes, especially at the 5′ untranslated regions (5′UTR) and in coding sequences. Enhancers were also frequently mapped proximal to silent and lowly-expressed genes in transposable element (TE)-rich regions. Analysis of the epigenetic features of enhancers at their endogenous loci revealed that most enhancers do not co-localize with DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs) and lack the enhancer mark of histone modification H3K4me1. Clustering analysis of enhancers according to their epigenetic marks revealed that about 40% of identified enhancers carried one or more epigenetic marks. Repressive H3K27me3 was frequently enriched with positive marks, H3K4me3 and/or H3K27ac, which together label enhancers. Intergenic enhancers were also predicted based on the location of DHS regions relative to genes, which overlap poorly with STARR-seq enhancers. In summary, we quantitatively identified enhancers by functional analysis in the genome of rice, an important model plant . This work provides a valuable resource for further mechanistic studies in different biological contexts.

Abstract:
Androgen receptor (AR) drives prostate cancer (PCa) development and progression. AR chromatin binding profiles are highly plastic and form recurrent programmatic changes that differentiate disease stages, subtypes and patient outcomes. While prior studies focused on concordance between patient subgroups, inter-tumor heterogeneity of AR enhancer selectivity remains unexplored. Here we report high levels of AR chromatin binding heterogeneity in human primary prostate tumors, that overlap with heterogeneity observed in healthy prostate epithelium. Such heterogeneity has functional consequences, as somatic mutations converge on commonly-shared AR sites in primary over metastatic tissues. In contrast, less-frequently shared AR sites associate strongly with AR-driven gene expression, while such heterogeneous AR enhancer usage also distinguishes patients’ outcome. These findings indicate that epigenetic heterogeneity in primary disease is directly informative for risk of biochemical relapse. Cumulatively, our results illustrate a high level of AR enhancer heterogeneity in primary PCa driving differential expression and clinical impact.

Authors: David Santiago-Algarra, Lan T.M. Dao, Lydie Pradel, Alexandre España, Salvatore Spicuglia
Date: 2017-06-19

Abstract:
The regulation of gene transcription in higher eukaryotes is accomplished through the involvement of transcription start site (TSS)-proximal (promoters) and -distal (enhancers) regulatory elements. It is now well acknowledged that enhancer elements play an essential role during development and cell differentiation, while genetic alterations in these elements are a major cause of human disease. Many strategies have been developed to identify and characterize enhancers. Here, we discuss recent advances in high-throughput approaches to assess enhancer activity, from the well-established massively parallel reporter assays to the recent clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9-based technologies. We highlight how these approaches contribute toward a better understanding of enhancer function, eventually leading to the discovery of new types of regulatory sequences, and how the alteration of enhancers can affect transcriptional regulation.

Abstract:
Next-generation sequencing technologies have revolutionarily advanced sequence-based research with the advantages of high-throughput, high-sensitivity, and high-speed. RNA-seq is now being used widely for uncovering multiple facets of transcriptome to facilitate the biological applications. However, the large-scale data analyses associated with RNA-seq harbors challenges. In this study, we present a detailed overview of the applications of this technology and the challenges that need to be addressed, including data preprocessing, differential gene expression analysis, alternative splicing analysis, variants detection and allele-specific expression, pathway analysis, co-expression network analysis, and applications combining various experimental procedures beyond the achievements that have been made. Specifically, we discuss essential principles of computational methods that are required to meet the key challenges of the RNA-seq data analyses, development of various bioinformatics tools, challenges associated with the RNA-seq applications, and examples that represent the advances made so far in the characterization of the transcriptome.

Date: 2021-01-27

Abstract:
The growth of human cancer cells is driven by aberrant enhancer and gene transcription activity. Here, we use transient transcriptome sequencing (TT‐seq) to map thousands of transcriptionally active putative enhancers in fourteen human cancer cell lines covering seven types of cancer. These enhancers were associated with cell type‐specific gene expression, enriched for genetic variants that predispose to cancer, and included functionally verified enhancers. Enhancer–promoter (E–P) pairing by correlation of transcription activity revealed ~ 40,000 putative E–P pairs, which were depleted for housekeeping genes and enriched for transcription factors, cancer‐associated genes, and 3D conformational proximity. The cell type specificity and transcription activity of target genes increased with the number of paired putative enhancers. Our results represent a rich resource for future studies of gene regulation by enhancers and their role in driving cancerous cell growth.

Authors: Junyou Zhang, Qilin Wang, Jiaxin Liu, Yingying Duan, Zhaoshuo Liu, Ziyi Zhang, Chunyan Li
Date: 2024-11-12

Abstract:
Precise regulation of gene expression is crucial to development. Enhancers, the core of gene regulation, determine the spatiotemporal pattern of gene transcription. Since many disease-associated mutations are characterized in enhancers, the research on enhancer will provide clues to precise medicine. Rapid advances in high-throughput sequencing technology facilitate the characterization of enhancers at genome wide, but understanding the functional mechanisms of enhancers remains challenging. Herein, we provide a panorama of enhancer characteristics, including epigenetic modifications, enhancer transcripts, and enhancer-promoter interaction patterns. Furthermore, we outline the applications of high-throughput sequencing technology and functional genomics methods in enhancer research. Finally, we discuss the role of enhancers in human disease and their potential as targets for disease prevention and treatment strategies.

Abstract:
Transcriptional dysregulation is a hallmark of cancer initiation and progression, driven by genetic and epigenetic alterations. Enhancer reprogramming has emerged as a pivotal driver of carcinogenesis, with cancer cells often relying on aberrant transcriptional programs. The advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies has provided critical insights into enhancer reprogramming events and their role in malignancy. While targeting enhancers presents a promising therapeutic strategy, significant challenges remain. These include the off-target effects of enhancer-targeting technologies, the complexity and redundancy of enhancer networks, and the dynamic nature of enhancer reprogramming, which may contribute to therapeutic resistance. This review comprehensively encapsulates the structural attributes of enhancers, delineates the mechanisms underlying their dysregulation in malignant transformation, and evaluates the therapeutic opportunities and limitations associated with targeting enhancers in cancer.

Authors: Li Yao, Jin Liang, Abdullah Ozer, Alden King-Yung Leung, John T. Lis, Haiyuan Yu
Date: 2022-07

Abstract:
Mounting evidence supports the idea that transcriptional patterns serve as more specific identifiers of active enhancers than histone marks; however, the optimal strategy to identify active enhancers both experimentally and computationally has not been determined. Here, we compared 13 genome-wide RNA sequencing assays in K562 cells and showed that the nuclear run-on followed by cap-selection assay (GRO/PRO-cap) has advantages in eRNA detection and active enhancer identification. We also introduced a tool, Peak Identifier for Nascent Transcript Starts (PINTS), to identify active promoters and enhancers genome-wide and pinpoint the precise location of the 5′ transcription start sites. Finally, we compiled a comprehensive enhancer candidate compendium based on the detected eRNA TSSs available in 120 cell and tissue types that can be accessed at https://pints.yulab.org . With the knowledge of the best available assays and pipelines, this large-scale annotation of candidate enhancers will pave the way for selection and characterization of their functions in a time- and labor-efficient manner in the future.

Title: Effects of super-enhancers in cancer metastasis: mechanisms and therapeutic targets
Authors: Shenglan Liu, Wei Dai, Bei Jin, Feng Jiang, Hao Huang, Wen Hou, Jinxia Lan, Yanli Jin, Weijie Peng, Jingxuan Pan
Date: 2024-06-07

Abstract:
Metastasis remains the principal cause of cancer-related lethality despite advancements in cancer treatment. Dysfunctional epigenetic alterations are crucial in the metastatic cascade. Among these, super-enhancers (SEs), emerging as new epigenetic regulators, consist of large clusters of regulatory elements that drive the high-level expression of genes essential for the oncogenic process, upon which cancer cells develop a profound dependency. These SE-driven oncogenes play an important role in regulating various facets of metastasis, including the promotion of tumor proliferation in primary and distal metastatic organs, facilitating cellular migration and invasion into the vasculature, triggering epithelial-mesenchymal transition, enhancing cancer stem cell-like properties, circumventing immune detection, and adapting to the heterogeneity of metastatic niches. This heavy reliance on SE-mediated transcription delineates a vulnerable target for therapeutic intervention in cancer cells. In this article, we review current insights into the characteristics, identification methodologies, formation, and activation mechanisms of SEs. We also elaborate the oncogenic roles and regulatory functions of SEs in the context of cancer metastasis. Ultimately, we discuss the potential of SEs as novel therapeutic targets and their implications in clinical oncology, offering insights into future directions for innovative cancer treatment strategies.

Title: Acetylation of histone H2B marks active enhancers and predicts CBP/p300 target genes
Authors: Takeo Narita, Yoshiki Higashijima, Sinan Kilic, Tim Liebner, Jonas Walter, Chunaram Choudhary
Date: 2023-04-06

Abstract:
Chromatin features are widely used for genome-scale mapping of enhancers. However, discriminating active enhancers from other cis -regulatory elements, predicting enhancer strength and identifying their target genes is challenging. Here we establish histone H2B N-terminus multisite lysine acetylation (H2BNTac) as a signature of active enhancers. H2BNTac prominently marks candidate active enhancers and a subset of promoters and discriminates them from ubiquitously active promoters. Two mechanisms underlie the distinct H2BNTac specificity: (1) unlike H3K27ac, H2BNTac is specifically catalyzed by CBP/p300; (2) H2A–H2B, but not H3–H4, are rapidly exchanged through transcription-induced nucleosome remodeling. H2BNTac-positive candidate enhancers show a high validation rate in orthogonal enhancer activity assays and a vast majority of endogenously active enhancers are marked by H2BNTac and H3K27ac. Notably, H2BNTac intensity predicts enhancer strength and outperforms current state-of-the-art models in predicting CBP/p300 target genes. These findings have broad implications for generating fine-grained enhancer maps and modeling CBP/p300-dependent gene regulation.

Title: Filtering the Junk: Assigning Function to the Mosquito Non-Coding Genome
Authors: Elise J. Farley, Heather Eggleston, Michelle M. Riehle
Date: 2021-02-22

Abstract:
In eukaryotes, the fraction of the genome not coding for proteins vastly outsizes the portion containing protein-coding genes. This non-coding genome, once termed “junk”, was thought for decades to be inconsequential to the biology of an organism. It is now widely acknowledged that elements within the non-coding genome serve important gene-regulatory functions impacting when, where, and to what levels genes and their protein products are expressed. Without an amino acid-like code to decipher non-coding regulatory elements within the genome, significant technology development has aided in their discovery. Currently, genome-wide identification of non-coding regulatory elements is an active area of research with significant progress made in humans, mice, and other model organisms. However, work to address the roles of these elements in mosquito disease vectors is in its infancy. In this article, we review existing methodology to generate genome-wide catalogs for three classes of non-coding elements and discuss their use in mosquito disease vectors and other insects. The portion of the mosquito genome that does not code for proteins contains regulatory elements that likely underlie variation for important phenotypes including resistance and susceptibility to infection with arboviruses and Apicomplexan parasites. Filtering the non-coding genome to uncover these functional elements is an expanding area of research, though identification of non-coding regulatory elements is challenging due to the lack of an amino acid-like code for the non-coding genome and a lack of sequence conservation across species. This review focuses on three types of non-coding regulatory elements: (1) microRNAs (miRNAs), (2) long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and (3) enhancers, and summarizes current advances in technical and analytical approaches for measurement of each of these elements on a genome-wide scale. The review also summarizes and highlights novel findings following application of these techniques in mosquito-borne disease research. Looking beyond the protein-coding genome is essential for understanding the complexities that underlie differential gene expression in response to arboviral or parasite infection in mosquito disease vectors. A comprehensive understanding of the regulation of gene and protein expression will inform transgenic and other vector control methods rooted in naturally segregating genetic variation.

Abstract:
Enhancers play an essential role in developmental processes by regulating the spatiotemporal expression of genes. Characterizing their spatiotemporal activity remains however an important challenge. Here we introduce a novel in vivo / in silico method for spatial single-cell enhancer-reporter assays (spatial-scERA) designed to reconstruct the spatial activity of candidate enhancer regions in parallel in multicellular organisms. Spatial-scERA integrates parallel reporter assays with single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial reconstruction using optimal transport, to map cell-type-specific enhancer activity at the single-cell level on a 3D virtual sample. We evaluated spatial-scERA in Drosophila embryos using 25 candidate enhancers, and validated the robustness of our reconstructions by comparing them to in situ hybridization. Remarkably, spatial-scERA faithfully reconstructed the spatial activity of these enhancers, even when the reporter construct was expressed in as few as 10 cells. Our results demonstrate the importance of integrating transcriptomic and spatial data for accurately predicting enhancer activity patterns in complex multicellular samples and linking enhancers to their potential target genes. Overall, spatial-scERA provides a scalable approach to map the spatial activity of enhancers at single-cell resolution without the need for imaging or a priori knowledge of embryology and can be applied to any multicellular organism amenable to transgenesis.

for investigation of enhancers
Authors: S.E. Romanov, D.A. Kalashnikova, P.P. Laktionov
Date: 2021-05

Abstract:
The correct deployment of genetic programs for development and differentiation relies on finely coordinated regulation of specific gene sets. Genomic regulatory elements play an exceptional role in this process. There
are few types of gene regulatory elements, including promoters, enhancers, insulators and silencers. Alterations of
gene regulatory elements may cause various pathologies, including cancer, congenital disorders and autoimmune
diseases. The development of high-throughput genomic assays has made it possible to significantly accelerate the
accumulation of information about the characteristic epigenetic properties of regulatory elements. In combination
with high-throughput studies focused on the genome-wide distribution of epigenetic marks, regulatory proteins
and the spatial structure of chromatin, this significantly expands the understanding of the principles of epigenetic
regulation of genes and allows potential regulatory elements to be searched for in silico. However, common experimental approaches used to study the local characteristics of chromatin have a number of technical limitations that
may reduce the reliability of computational identification of genomic regulatory sequences. Taking into account the
variability of the functions of epigenetic determinants and complex multicomponent regulation of genomic elements activity, their functional verification is often required. A plethora of methods have been developed to study
the functional role of regulatory elements on the genome scale. Common experimental approaches for in silico identification of regulatory elements and their inherent technical limitations will be described. The present review is focused on original high-throughput methods of enhancer activity reporter analysis that are currently used to validate
predicted regulatory elements and to perform de novo searches. The methods described allow assessing the functional role of the nucleotide sequence of a regulatory element, to determine its exact boundaries and to assess the
influence of the local state of chromatin on the activity of enhancers and gene expression. These approaches have
contributed substantially to the understanding of the fundamental principles of gene regulation.

Abstract:
Gene expression is controlled by the involvement of gene-proximal (promoters) and distal (enhancers) regulatory elements. Our previous results demonstrated that a subset of gene promoters, termed Epromoters, work as bona fide enhancers and regulate distal gene expression. Here, we hypothesized that Epromoters play a key role in the coordination of rapid gene induction during the inflammatory response. Using a high-throughput reporter assay we explored the function of Epromoters in response to type I interferon. We find that clusters of IFNa-induced genes are frequently associated with Epromoters and that these regulatory elements preferentially recruit the STAT1/2 and IRF transcription factors and distally regulate the activation of interferon-response genes. Consistently, we identified and validated the involvement of Epromoter-containing clusters in the regulation of LPS-stimulated macrophages. Our findings suggest that Epromoters function as a local hub recruiting the key TFs required for coordinated regulation of gene clusters during the inflammatory response.

Authors: Amanda J Lea, Christopher M Vockley, Rachel A Johnston, Christina A Del Carpio, Luis B Barreiro, Timothy E Reddy, Jenny Tung
Date: 2018-12-21

Abstract:
Changes in DNA methylation are involved in development, disease, and the response to environmental conditions. However, not all regulatory elements are functionally methylation-dependent (MD). Here, we report a method, mSTARR-seq, that assesses the causal effects of DNA methylation on regulatory activity at hundreds of thousands of fragments (millions of CpG sites) simultaneously. Using mSTARR-seq, we identify thousands of MD regulatory elements in the human genome. MD activity is partially predictable using sequence and chromatin state information, and distinct transcription factors are associated with higher activity in unmethylated versus methylated DNA. Further, pioneer TFs linked to higher activity in the methylated state appear to drive demethylation of experimentally methylated sites. MD regulatory elements also predict methylation-gene expression relationships across individuals, where they are 1.6x enriched among sites with strong negative correlations. mSTARR-seq thus provides a map of MD regulatory activity in the human genome and facilitates interpretation of differential methylation studies.

Authors: Yuwen Liu, Shan Yu, Vineet K. Dhiman, Tonya Brunetti, Heather Eckart, Kevin P. White
Date: 2017-11-20

Abstract:
Genome-wide quantification of enhancer activity in the human genome has proven to be a challenging problem. Recent efforts have led to the development of powerful tools for enhancer quantification. However, because of genome size and complexity, these tools have yet to be applied to the whole human genome. In the current study, we use a human prostate cancer cell line, LNCaP as a model to perform whole human genome STARR-seq (WHG-STARR-seq) to reliably obtain an assessment of enhancer activity. This approach builds upon previously developed STARR-seq in the fly genome and CapSTARR-seq techniques in targeted human genomic regions. With an improved library preparation strategy, our approach greatly increases the library complexity per unit of starting material, which makes it feasible and cost-effective to explore the landscape of regulatory activity in the much larger human genome. In addition to our ability to identify active, accessible enhancers located in open chromatin regions, we can also detect sequences with the potential for enhancer activity that are located in inaccessible, closed chromatin regions. When treated with the histone deacetylase inhibitor, Trichostatin A, genes nearby this latter class of enhancers are up-regulated, demonstrating the potential for endogenous functionality of these regulatory elements. WHG-STARR-seq provides an improved approach to current pipelines for analysis of high complexity genomes to gain a better understanding of the intricacies of transcriptional regulation.

Title: Demystifying the secret mission of enhancers: linking distal regulatory elements to target genes
Authors: Lijing Yao, Benjamin P. Berman, Peggy J. Farnham
Date: 2015-11-02

Abstract:
Enhancers are short regulatory sequences bound by sequence-specific transcription factors and play a major role in the spatiotemporal specificity of gene expression patterns in development and disease. While it is now possible to identify enhancer regions genomewide in both cultured cells and primary tissues using epigenomic approaches, it has been more challenging to develop methods to understand the function of individual enhancers because enhancers are located far from the gene(s) that they regulate. However, it is essential to identify target genes of enhancers not only so that we can understand the role of enhancers in disease but also because this information will assist in the development of future therapeutic options. After reviewing models of enhancer function, we discuss recent methods for identifying target genes of enhancers. First, we describe chromatin structure-based approaches for directly mapping interactions between enhancers and promoters. Second, we describe the use of correlation-based approaches to link enhancer state with the activity of nearby promoters and/or gene expression. Third, we describe how to test the function of specific enhancers experimentally by perturbing enhancer–target relationships using high-throughput reporter assays and genome editing. Finally, we conclude by discussing as yet unanswered questions concerning how enhancers function, how target genes can be identified, and how to distinguish direct from indirect changes in gene expression mediated by individual enhancers.

Title: Androgen Receptor-Mediated Transcription in Prostate Cancer
Authors: Doğancan Özturan, Tunç Morova, Nathan A. Lack
Date: 2022-03-05

Abstract:
Androgen receptor (AR)-mediated transcription is critical in almost all stages of prostate cancer (PCa) growth and differentiation. This process involves a complex interplay of coregulatory proteins, chromatin remodeling complexes, and other transcription factors that work with AR at cis -regulatory enhancer regions to induce the spatiotemporal transcription of target genes. This enhancer-driven mechanism is remarkably dynamic and undergoes significant alterations during PCa progression. In this review, we discuss the AR mechanism of action in PCa with a focus on how cis -regulatory elements modulate gene expression. We explore emerging evidence of genetic variants that can impact AR regulatory regions and alter gene transcription in PCa. Finally, we highlight several outstanding questions and discuss potential mechanisms of this critical transcription factor.

Title: Splicing-Mediated Autoregulation Modulates Rpl22p Expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae
Authors: Jason Gabunilas, Guillaume Chanfreau
Date: 2016-04-20

Abstract:
In Saccharomyces cerevisiae , splicing is critical for expression of ribosomal protein genes (RPGs), which are among the most highly expressed genes and are tightly regulated according to growth and environmental conditions. However, knowledge of the precise mechanisms by which RPG pre-mRNA splicing is regulated on a gene-by-gene basis is lacking. Here we show that Rpl22p has an extraribosomal role in the inhibition of splicing of the RPL22B pre-mRNA transcript. A stem loop secondary structure within the intron is necessary for pre-mRNA binding by Rpl22p in vivo and splicing inhibition in vivo and in vitro and can rescue splicing inhibition in vitro when added in trans to splicing reactions. Splicing inhibition by Rpl22p may be partly attributed to the reduction of co-transcriptional U1 snRNP recruitment to the pre-mRNA at the RPL22B locus. We further demonstrate that the inhibition of RPL22B pre-mRNA splicing contributes to the down-regulation of mature transcript during specific stress conditions, and provide evidence hinting at a regulatory role for this mechanism in conditions of suppressed ribosome biogenesis. These results demonstrate an autoregulatory mechanism that fine-tunes the expression of the Rpl22 protein and by extension Rpl22p paralog composition according to the cellular demands for ribosome biogenesis.

Title: Dynamic interplay between non-coding enhancer transcription and gene activity in development
Authors: Kota Hamamoto, Yusuke Umemura, Shiho Makino, Takashi Fukaya
Date: 2023-02-20

Abstract:
Non-coding transcription at the intergenic regulatory regions is a prevalent feature of metazoan genomes, but its biological function remains uncertain. Here, we devise a live-imaging system that permits simultaneous visualization of gene activity along with intergenic non-coding transcription at single-cell resolution in Drosophila . Quantitative image analysis reveals that elongation of RNA polymerase II across the internal core region of enhancers leads to suppression of transcriptional bursting from linked genes. Super-resolution imaging and genome-editing analysis further demonstrate that enhancer transcription antagonizes molecular crowding of transcription factors, thereby interrupting the formation of a transcription hub at the gene locus. We also show that a certain class of developmental enhancers are structurally optimized to co-activate gene transcription together with non-coding transcription effectively. We suggest that enhancer function is flexibly tunable through the modulation of hub formation via surrounding non-coding transcription during development.

Abstract:
Expression of the tissue-type plasminogen activator gene (t-PA; gene name PLAT ) is regulated, in part, by epigenetic mechanisms. We investigated the relationship between PLAT methylation and PLAT expression in five primary human cell types and six transformed cell lines. CpG methylation was analyzed in the proximal PLAT gene promoter and near the multihormone responsive enhancer (MHRE) -7.3 kilobase pairs upstream of the PLAT transcriptional start site (TSS, -7.3 kb). In Bowes melanoma cells, the PLAT promoter and the MHRE were fully unmethylated and t-PA secretion was extremely high. In other cell types the region from -647 to -366 was fully methylated, whereas an unmethylated stretch of DNA from -121 to +94 was required but not sufficient for detectable t-PA mRNA and t-PA secretion. DNA methylation near the MHRE was not correlated with t-PA secretion. Specific methylation of the PLAT promoter region -151 to +151, inserted into a firefly luciferase reporter gene, abolished reporter gene activity. The region -121 to + 94 contains two well-described regulatory elements, a PMA-responsive element (CRE) near -106 and a GC-rich region containing an Sp1 binding site near +59. Methylation of double-stranded DNA oligonucleotides containing the CRE or the GC-rich region had little or no effect on transcription factor binding. Methylated CpGs may attract co-repressor complexes that contain histone deacetylases (HDAC). However, reporter gene activity of methylated plasmids was not restored by the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin. In conclusion, efficient PLAT gene expression requires a short stretch of unmethylated CpG sites in the proximal promoter.

Abstract:
Expansion of a single repetitive DNA sequence, termed a tandem repeat (TR), is known to cause more than 50 diseases 1 , 2 . However, repeat expansions are often not explored beyond neurological and neurodegenerative disorders. In some cancers, mutations accumulate in short tracts of TRs, a phenomenon termed microsatellite instability; however, larger repeat expansions have not been systematically analysed in cancer 3 – 8 . Here we identified TR expansions in 2,622 cancer genomes spanning 29 cancer types. In seven cancer types, we found 160 recurrent repeat expansions (rREs), most of which (155/160) were subtype specific. We found that rREs were non-uniformly distributed in the genome with enrichment near candidate cis -regulatory elements, suggesting a potential role in gene regulation. One rRE, a GAAA-repeat expansion, located near a regulatory element in the first intron of UGT2B7 was detected in 34% of renal cell carcinoma samples and was validated by long-read DNA sequencing. Moreover, in preliminary experiments, treating cells that harbour this rRE with a GAAA-targeting molecule led to a dose-dependent decrease in cell proliferation. Overall, our results suggest that rREs may be an important but unexplored source of genetic variation in human cancer, and we provide a comprehensive catalogue for further study.

Title: Tissue expression profiles and transcriptional regulation of elongase of very long chain fatty acid 6 in bovine mammary epithelial cells
Authors: Si Chen, Hua He, Xiaolin Liu
Date: 2017-04-17

Abstract:
In mammals, very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) perform pleiotropic roles in a wide range of biological processes, such as cell membrane formation, cell signal transduction, and endocrine regulation. Beef and milk are abundant of palmitic acid which can be further elongated into stearic acid for synthesizing VLCFAs. Elongase of very long chain fatty acid 6 (ELOVL6) is a rate-limiting enzyme for converting palmitic acid to stearic acid. Consequently, investigating the tissue expression patterns and transcriptional regulation of bovine ELOVL6 can provide new insights into improving the composition of beneficial fats in cattle and expanding the knowledge of transcriptional regulation mechanism among domestic animals. In the current study, we found that bovine ELOVL6 expressed ubiquitously. Dual-luciferase reporter assay identified that the core promoter region (-130/-41 bp) was located in the second CpG island. In addition, the deletion mutation of binding sites demonstrated that sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1 (SREBF1) and specific protein 1 (SP1) both were able to stimulate bovine ELOVL6 promoter activity independently, while resulting the similar effect. To confirm these findings, further RNA interference assays were executed in bovine mammary epithelial cells (BMECs). In summary, these data suggest that bovine ELOVL6 expressed ubiquitously and is activated by SREBF1 and SP1, via two binding sites present in the ELOVL6 promoter region between -130 bp to -41bp.

Title: Identification of High-Impact cis -Regulatory Mutations Using Transcription Factor Specific Random Forest Models
Authors: Dmitry Svetlichnyy, Hana Imrichova, Mark Fiers, Zeynep Kalender Atak, Stein Aerts
Date: 2015-11-12

Abstract:
Cancer genomes contain vast amounts of somatic mutations, many of which are passenger mutations not involved in oncogenesis. Whereas driver mutations in protein-coding genes can be distinguished from passenger mutations based on their recurrence, non-coding mutations are usually not recurrent at the same position. Therefore, it is still unclear how to identify cis -regulatory driver mutations, particularly when chromatin data from the same patient is not available, thus relying only on sequence and expression information. Here we use machine-learning methods to predict functional regulatory regions using sequence information alone, and compare the predicted activity of the mutated region with the reference sequence. This way we define the Predicted Regulatory Impact of a Mutation in an Enhancer (PRIME). We find that the recently identified driver mutation in the TAL1 enhancer has a high PRIME score, representing a “gain-of-target” for MYB, whereas the highly recurrent TERT promoter mutation has a surprisingly low PRIME score. We trained Random Forest models for 45 cancer-related transcription factors, and used these to score variations in the HeLa genome and somatic mutations across more than five hundred cancer genomes. Each model predicts only a small fraction of non-coding mutations with a potential impact on the function of the encompassing regulatory region. Nevertheless, as these few candidate driver mutations are often linked to gains in chromatin activity and gene expression, they may contribute to the oncogenic program by altering the expression levels of specific oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes.

Abstract:
Understanding the molecular basis for phenotypic differences between humans and other primates remains an outstanding challenge. Mutations in non-coding regulatory DNA that alter gene expression have been hypothesized as a key driver of these phenotypic differences. This has been supported by differential gene expression analyses in general, but not by the identification of specific regulatory elements responsible for changes in transcription and phenotype. To identify the genetic source of regulatory differences, we mapped DNaseI hypersensitive (DHS) sites, which mark all types of active gene regulatory elements, genome-wide in the same cell type isolated from human, chimpanzee, and macaque. Most DHS sites were conserved among all three species, as expected based on their central role in regulating transcription. However, we found evidence that several hundred DHS sites were gained or lost on the lineages leading to modern human and chimpanzee. Species-specific DHS site gains are enriched near differentially expressed genes, are positively correlated with increased transcription, show evidence of branch-specific positive selection, and overlap with active chromatin marks. Species-specific sequence differences in transcription factor motifs found within these DHS sites are linked with species-specific changes in chromatin accessibility. Together, these indicate that the regulatory elements identified here are genetic contributors to transcriptional and phenotypic differences among primate species.

Title: Modeling and designing enhancers by introducing and harnessing transcription factor binding units
Authors: Jiaqi Li, Pengcheng Zhang, Xi Xi, Liyang Liu, Lei Wei, Xiaowo Wang
Date: 2025-02-08

Abstract:
Enhancers serve as pivotal regulators of gene expression throughout various biological processes by interacting with transcription factors (TFs). While transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) are widely acknowledged as key determinants of TF binding and enhancer activity, the significant role of their surrounding context sequences remains to be quantitatively characterized. Here we propose the concept of transcription factor binding unit (TFBU) to modularly model enhancers by quantifying the impact of context sequences surrounding TFBSs using deep learning models. Based on this concept, we develop DeepTFBU, a comprehensive toolkit for enhancer design. We demonstrate that designing TFBS context sequences can significantly modulate enhancer activities and produce cell type-specific responses. DeepTFBU is also highly efficient in the de novo design of enhancers containing multiple TFBSs. Furthermore, DeepTFBU enables flexible decoupling and optimization of generalized enhancers. We prove that TFBU is a crucial concept, and DeepTFBU is highly effective for rational enhancer design.

Date: 2023-05-27

Abstract:
The ever-increasing prevalence of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) represents a major public health burden worldwide. The most common form of NCD is metabolic diseases, which affect people of all ages and usually manifest their pathobiology through life-threatening cardiovascular complications. A comprehensive understanding of the pathobiology of metabolic diseases will generate novel targets for improved therapies across the common metabolic spectrum. Protein posttranslational modification (PTM) is an important term that refers to biochemical modification of specific amino acid residues in target proteins, which immensely increases the functional diversity of the proteome. The range of PTMs includes phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation, ubiquitination, SUMOylation, neddylation, glycosylation, palmitoylation, myristoylation, prenylation, cholesterylation, glutathionylation, S-nitrosylation, sulfhydration, citrullination, ADP ribosylation, and several novel PTMs. Here, we offer a comprehensive review of PTMs and their roles in common metabolic diseases and pathological consequences, including diabetes, obesity, fatty liver diseases, hyperlipidemia, and atherosclerosis. Building upon this framework, we afford a through description of proteins and pathways involved in metabolic diseases by focusing on PTM-based protein modifications, showcase the pharmaceutical intervention of PTMs in preclinical studies and clinical trials, and offer future perspectives. Fundamental research defining the mechanisms whereby PTMs of proteins regulate metabolic diseases will open new avenues for therapeutic intervention.

Abstract:
Enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) are long non-coding RNAs that originate from enhancers. Although eRNA transcription is a canonical feature of activated enhancers, the molecular features required for eRNA function and the mechanism of how eRNAs impinge on target gene transcription have not been established. Thus, using eRNA-dependent RNA polymerase II (Pol II) pause release as a model, we here investigate the requirement of sequence, structure and length of eRNAs for their ability to stimulate Pol II pause release by detaching NELF from paused Pol II. We find eRNAs not to exert their function through common structural or sequence motifs. Instead, eRNAs that exhibit a length >200 nucleotides and that contain unpaired guanosines make multiple, allosteric contacts with NELF subunits -A and -E to trigger efficient NELF release. By revealing the molecular determinants of eRNA function, our study establishes eRNAs as an important player in Pol II pause release, and it provides new insight into the regulation of metazoan transcription.

Abstract:
Many single nucleotide variants (SNVs) associated with human traits and genetic diseases are thought to alter the activity of existing regulatory elements. Some SNVs may also create entirely new regulatory elements which change gene expression, but the mechanism by which they do so is largely unknown. Here we show that a single base change in an otherwise unremarkable region of the human α-globin cluster creates an entirely new promoter and an associated unidirectional transcript. This SNV downregulates α-globin expression causing α-thalassaemia. Of note, the new promoter lying between the α-globin genes and their associated super-enhancer disrupts their interaction in an orientation-dependent manner. Together these observations show how both the order and orientation of the fundamental elements of the genome determine patterns of gene expression and support the concept that active genes may act to disrupt enhancer-promoter interactions in mammals as in Drosophila. Finally, these findings should prompt others to fully evaluate SNVs lying outside of known regulatory elements as causing changes in gene expression by creating new regulatory elements.

Title: CRISPR/Cas9 and active genetics-based trans-species replacement of the endogenous Drosophila kni -L2 CRM reveals unexpected complexity
Authors: Xiang-Ru Shannon Xu, Valentino Matteo Gantz, Natalia Siomava, Ethan Bier
Date: 2017-12-23

Abstract:
The knirps ( kni ) locus encodes transcription factors required for induction of the L2 wing vein in Drosophila . Here, we employ diverse CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tools to generate a series of targeted lesions within the endogenous cis-regulatory module (CRM) required for kni expression in the L2 vein primordium. Phenotypic analysis of these ‘ in locus ’ mutations based on both expression of Kni protein and adult wing phenotypes, reveals novel unexpected features of L2-CRM function including evidence for a chromosome pairing-dependent process that promotes transcription. We also demonstrate that self-propagating active genetic elements (CopyCat elements) can efficiently delete and replace the L2-CRM with orthologous sequences from other divergent fly species. Wing vein phenotypes resulting from these trans-species enhancer replacements parallel features of the respective donor fly species. This highly sensitive phenotypic readout of enhancer function in a native genomic context reveals novel features of CRM function undetected by traditional reporter gene analysis.

Title: Enhancer RNAs step forward: new insights into enhancer function
Authors: Laura J. Harrison, Daniel Bose
Date: 2022-08-15

Abstract:
Enhancers confer precise spatiotemporal patterns of gene expression in response to developmental and environmental stimuli. Over the last decade, the transcription of enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) – nascent RNAs transcribed from active enhancers – has emerged as a key factor regulating enhancer activity. eRNAs are relatively short-lived RNA species that are transcribed at very high rates but also quickly degraded. Nevertheless, eRNAs are deeply intertwined within enhancer regulatory networks and are implicated in a number of transcriptional control mechanisms. Enhancers show changes in function and sequence over evolutionary time, raising questions about the relationship between enhancer sequences and eRNA function. Moreover, the vast majority of single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with human complex diseases map to the non-coding genome, with causal disease variants enriched within enhancers. In this Primer, we survey the diverse roles played by eRNAs in enhancer-dependent gene expression, evaluating different models for eRNA function. We also explore questions surrounding the genetic conservation of enhancers and how this relates to eRNA function and dysfunction.

Abstract:
Super-enhancers are compound regulatory elements that control expression of key cell identity genes. They recruit high levels of tissue-specific transcription factors and co-activators such as the Mediator complex and contact target gene promoters with high frequency. Most super-enhancers contain multiple constituent regulatory elements, but it is unclear whether these elements have distinct roles in activating target gene expression. Here, by rebuilding the endogenous multipartite α-globin super-enhancer, we show that it contains bioinformatically equivalent but functionally distinct element types: classical enhancers and facilitator elements. Facilitators have no intrinsic enhancer activity, yet in their absence, classical enhancers are unable to fully upregulate their target genes. Without facilitators, classical enhancers exhibit reduced Mediator recruitment, enhancer RNA transcription, and enhancer-promoter interactions. Facilitators are interchangeable but display functional hierarchy based on their position within a multipartite enhancer. Facilitators thus play an important role in potentiating the activity of classical enhancers and ensuring robust activation of target genes.

Title: Predictive modeling reveals that higher-order cooperativity drives transcriptional repression in a synthetic developmental enhancer
Authors: Yang Joon Kim, Kaitlin Rhee, Jonathan Liu, Selene Jeammet, Meghan A Turner, Stephen J Small, Hernan G Garcia, Jie Xiao
Date: 2022-12-12

Abstract:
A challenge in quantitative biology is to predict output patterns of gene expression from knowledge of input transcription factor patterns and from the arrangement of binding sites for these transcription factors on regulatory DNA. We tested whether widespread thermodynamic models could be used to infer parameters describing simple regulatory architectures that inform parameter-free predictions of more complex enhancers in the context of transcriptional repression by Runt in the early fruit fly embryo. By modulating the number and placement of Runt binding sites within an enhancer, and quantifying the resulting transcriptional activity using live imaging, we discovered that thermodynamic models call for higher-order cooperativity between multiple molecular players. This higher-order cooperativity captures the combinatorial complexity underlying eukaryotic transcriptional regulation and cannot be determined from simpler regulatory architectures, highlighting the challenges in reaching a predictive understanding of transcriptional regulation in eukaryotes and calling for approaches that quantitatively dissect their molecular nature.

Title: CIPHER: a flexible and extensive workflow platform for integrative next-generation sequencing data analysis and genomic regulatory element prediction
Authors: Carlos Guzman, Iván D’Orso
Date: 2017-08-08

Abstract:
Next-generation sequencing (NGS) approaches are commonly used to identify key regulatory networks that drive transcriptional programs. Although these technologies are frequently used in biological studies, NGS data analysis remains a challenging, time-consuming, and often irreproducible process. Therefore, there is a need for a comprehensive and flexible workflow platform that can accelerate data processing and analysis so more time can be spent on functional studies. We have developed an integrative, stand-alone workflow platform, named CIPHER, for the systematic analysis of several commonly used NGS datasets including ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, MNase-seq, DNase-seq, GRO-seq, and ATAC-seq data. CIPHER implements various open source software packages, in-house scripts, and Docker containers to analyze and process single-ended and pair-ended datasets. CIPHER’s pipelines conduct extensive quality and contamination control checks, as well as comprehensive downstream analysis. A typical CIPHER workflow includes: (1) raw sequence evaluation, (2) read trimming and adapter removal, (3) read mapping and quality filtering, (4) visualization track generation, and (5) extensive quality control assessment. Furthermore, CIPHER conducts downstream analysis such as: narrow and broad peak calling, peak annotation, and motif identification for ChIP-seq, differential gene expression analysis for RNA-seq, nucleosome positioning for MNase-seq, DNase hypersensitive site mapping, site annotation and motif identification for DNase-seq, analysis of nascent transcription from Global-Run On (GRO-seq) data, and characterization of chromatin accessibility from ATAC-seq datasets. In addition, CIPHER contains an “analysis” mode that completes complex bioinformatics tasks such as enhancer discovery and provides functions to integrate various datasets together. Using public and simulated data, we demonstrate that CIPHER is an efficient and comprehensive workflow platform that can analyze several NGS datasets commonly used in genome biology studies. Additionally, CIPHER’s integrative “analysis” mode allows researchers to elicit important biological information from the combined dataset analysis.

Date: 2020-12-02

Abstract:
Promoters serve a critical role in establishing baseline transcriptional capacity through the recruitment of proteins, including transcription factors. Previously, a paucity of data for cis -regulatory elements in plants meant that it was challenging to determine which sequence elements in plant promoter sequences contributed to transcriptional function. In this study, we have identified functional elements in the promoters of plant genes and plant pathogens that utilize plant transcriptional machinery for gene expression. We have established a quantitative experimental system to investigate transcriptional function, investigating how identity, density and position contribute to regulatory function. We then identified permissive architectures for minimal synthetic plant promoters enabling the computational design of a suite of synthetic promoters of different strengths. These have been used to regulate the relative expression of output genes in simple genetic devices.

Abstract:
Genomic enhancer elements regulate gene expression programs important for neuronal fate and function and are implicated in brain disease states. Enhancers undergo bidirectional transcription to generate non-coding enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). However, eRNA function remains controversial. Here, we combined Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using Sequencing (ATAC-Seq) and RNA-Seq datasets from three distinct neuronal culture systems in two activity states, enabling genome-wide enhancer identification and prediction of putative enhancer–gene pairs based on correlation of transcriptional output. Notably, stimulus-dependent enhancer transcription preceded mRNA induction, and CRISPR-based activation of eRNA synthesis increased mRNA at paired genes, functionally validating enhancer–gene predictions. Focusing on enhancers surrounding the Fos gene, we report that targeted eRNA manipulation bidirectionally modulates Fos mRNA, and that Fos eRNAs directly interact with the histone acetyltransferase domain of the enhancer-linked transcriptional co-activator CREB-binding protein (CBP). Together, these results highlight the unique role of eRNAs in neuronal gene regulation and demonstrate that eRNAs can be used to identify putative target genes.

Abstract:
Adeno‐associated virus (AAV)‐based therapies are recognized as one of the most potent next‐generation treatments for inherited and genetic diseases. However, several biological and technological aspects of AAV vectors remain a critical issue for their widespread clinical application. Among them, the limited capacity of the AAV genome significantly hinders the development of AAV‐based gene therapy. In this context, genetically modified transgenes compatible with AAV are opening up new opportunities for unlimited gene therapies for many genetic disorders. Recent advances in de novo protein design and remodelling are paving the way for new, more efficient and targeted gene therapeutics. Using computational and genetic tools, AAV expression cassette and transgenic DNA can be split, miniaturized, shuffled or created from scratch to mediate efficient gene transfer into targeted cells. In this review, we highlight recent advances in AAV‐based gene therapy with a focus on its use in translational research. We summarize recent research and development in gene therapy, with an emphasis on large transgenes (>4.8 kb) and optimizing strategies applied by biomedical companies in the research pipeline. We critically discuss the prospects for AAV‐based treatment and some emerging challenges. We anticipate that the continued development of novel computational tools will lead to rapid advances in basic gene therapy research and translational studies.

Abstract:
Water solubility and structural stability are key merits
for proteins
defined by the primary sequence and 3D-conformation. Their manipulation
represents important aspects of the protein design field that relies
on the accurate placement of amino acids and molecular interactions,
guided by underlying physiochemical principles. Emulated designer
proteins with well-defined properties both fuel the knowledge-base
for more precise computational design models and are used in various
biomedical and nanotechnological applications. The continuous developments
in protein science, increasing computing power, new algorithms, and
characterization techniques provide sophisticated toolkits for solubility
design beyond guess work. In this review, we summarize recent advances
in the protein design field with respect to water solubility and structural
stability. After introducing fundamental design rules, we discuss
the transmembrane protein solubilization and de novo transmembrane protein design. Traditional strategies to enhance
protein solubility and structural stability are introduced. The designs
of stable protein complexes and high-order assemblies are covered.
Computational methodologies behind these endeavors, including structure
prediction programs, machine learning algorithms, and specialty software
dedicated to the evaluation of protein solubility and aggregation,
are discussed. The findings and opportunities for Cryo-EM are presented.
This review provides an overview of significant progress and prospects
in accurate protein design for solubility and stability.

Abstract:
Planarians are non-parasitic Platyhelminthes (flatworms) famous for their regeneration ability and for having a well-organized brain. Dugesia japonica is a typical planarian species that is widely distributed in the East Asia. Extensive cellular and molecular experimental methods have been developed to identify the functions of thousands of genes in this species, making this planarian a good experimental model for regeneration biology and neurobiology. However, no genome-level information is available for D. japonica , and few gene regulatory networks have been identified thus far. To obtain whole-genome information on this species and to study its gene regulatory networks, we extracted genomic DNA from 200 planarians derived from a laboratory-bred asexual clonal strain, and sequenced 476 Gb of data by second-generation sequencing. Kmer frequency graphing and fosmid sequence analysis indicated a complex genome that would be difficult to assemble using second-generation sequencing short reads. To address this challenge, we developed a new assembly strategy and improved the de novo genome assembly, producing a 1.56 Gb genome sequence (DjGenome ver1.0, including 202,925 scaffolds and N50 length 27,741 bp) that covers 99.4% of all 19,543 genes in the assembled transcriptome, although the genome is fragmented as 80% of the genome consists of repeated sequences (genomic frequency ≥ 2). By genome comparison between two planarian genera, we identified conserved non-coding elements (CNEs), which are indicative of gene regulatory elements. Transgenic experiments using Xenopus laevis indicated that one of the CNEs in the Djndk gene may be a regulatory element, suggesting that the regulation of the ndk gene and the brain formation mechanism may be conserved between vertebrates and invertebrates. This draft genome and CNE analysis will contribute to resolving gene regulatory networks in planarians. The genome database is available at: http://www.planarian.jp .

Title: Nucleic acid drug vectors for diagnosis and treatment of brain diseases
Authors: Zhi-Guo Lu, Jie Shen, Jun Yang, Jing-Wen Wang, Rui-Chen Zhao, Tian-Lu Zhang, Jing Guo, Xin Zhang
Date: 2023-01-17

Abstract:
Nucleic acid drugs have the advantages of rich target selection, simple in design, good and enduring effect. They have been demonstrated to have irreplaceable superiority in brain disease treatment, while vectors are a decisive factor in therapeutic efficacy. Strict physiological barriers, such as degradation and clearance in circulation, blood-brain barrier, cellular uptake, endosome/lysosome barriers, release, obstruct the delivery of nucleic acid drugs to the brain by the vectors. Nucleic acid drugs against a single target are inefficient in treating brain diseases of complex pathogenesis. Differences between individual patients lead to severe uncertainties in brain disease treatment with nucleic acid drugs. In this Review, we briefly summarize the classification of nucleic acid drugs. Next, we discuss physiological barriers during drug delivery and universal coping strategies and introduce the application methods of these universal strategies to nucleic acid drug vectors. Subsequently, we explore nucleic acid drug-based multidrug regimens for the combination treatment of brain diseases and the construction of the corresponding vectors. In the following, we address the feasibility of patient stratification and personalized therapy through diagnostic information from medical imaging and the manner of introducing contrast agents into vectors. Finally, we take a perspective on the future feasibility and remaining challenges of vector-based integrated diagnosis and gene therapy for brain diseases.

Title: A cis -regulatory element promoting increased transcription at low temperature in cultured ectothermic Drosophila cells
Authors: Yu Bai, Emmanuel Caussinus, Stefano Leo, Fritz Bosshardt, Faina Myachina, Gregor Rot, Mark D. Robinson, Christian F. Lehner
Date: 2021-10-28

Abstract:
Temperature change affects the myriad of concurrent cellular processes in a non-uniform, disruptive manner. While endothermic organisms minimize the challenge of ambient temperature variation by keeping the core body temperature constant, cells of many ectothermic species maintain homeostatic function within a considerable temperature range. The cellular mechanisms enabling temperature acclimation in ectotherms are still poorly understood. At the transcriptional level, the heat shock response has been analyzed extensively. The opposite, the response to sub-optimal temperature, has received lesser attention in particular in animal species. The tissue specificity of transcriptional responses to cool temperature has not been addressed and it is not clear whether a prominent general response occurs. Cis -regulatory elements (CREs), which mediate increased transcription at cool temperature, and responsible transcription factors are largely unknown. The ectotherm Drosophila melanogaster with a presumed temperature optimum around 25 °C was used for transcriptomic analyses of effects of temperatures at the lower end of the readily tolerated range (14–29 °C). Comparative analyses with adult flies and cell culture lines indicated a striking degree of cell-type specificity in the transcriptional response to cool. To identify potential cis -regulatory elements (CREs) for transcriptional upregulation at cool temperature, we analyzed temperature effects on DNA accessibility in chromatin of S2R+ cells. Candidate cis -regulatory elements (CREs) were evaluated with a novel reporter assay for accurate assessment of their temperature-dependency. Robust transcriptional upregulation at low temperature could be demonstrated for a fragment from the pastrel gene, which expresses more transcript and protein at reduced temperatures. This CRE is controlled by the JAK/STAT signaling pathway and antagonizing activities of the transcription factors Pointed and Ets97D. Beyond a rich data resource for future analyses of transcriptional control within the readily tolerated range of an ectothermic animal, a novel reporter assay permitting quantitative characterization of CRE temperature dependence was developed. Our identification and functional dissection of the pst _E1 enhancer demonstrate the utility of resources and assay. The functional characterization of this CoolUp enhancer provides initial mechanistic insights into transcriptional upregulation induced by a shift to temperatures at the lower end of the readily tolerated range.

Abstract:
Understanding the genetic regulatory code governing gene expression is an important challenge in molecular biology. However, how individual coding and non-coding regions of the gene regulatory structure interact and contribute to mRNA expression levels remains unclear. Here we apply deep learning on over 20,000 mRNA datasets to examine the genetic regulatory code controlling mRNA abundance in 7 model organisms ranging from bacteria to Human. In all organisms, we can predict mRNA abundance directly from DNA sequence, with up to 82% of the variation of transcript levels encoded in the gene regulatory structure. By searching for DNA regulatory motifs across the gene regulatory structure, we discover that motif interactions could explain the whole dynamic range of mRNA levels. Co-evolution across coding and non-coding regions suggests that it is not single motifs or regions, but the entire gene regulatory structure and specific combination of regulatory elements that define gene expression levels.

Title: SeqGL Identifies Context-Dependent Binding Signals in Genome-Wide Regulatory Element Maps
Authors: Manu Setty, Christina S. Leslie
Date: 2015-05-27

Abstract:
Genome-wide maps of transcription factor (TF) occupancy and regions of open chromatin implicitly contain DNA sequence signals for multiple factors. We present SeqGL, a novel de novo motif discovery algorithm to identify multiple TF sequence signals from ChIP-, DNase-, and ATAC-seq profiles. SeqGL trains a discriminative model using a k -mer feature representation together with group lasso regularization to extract a collection of sequence signals that distinguish peak sequences from flanking regions. Benchmarked on over 100 ChIP-seq experiments, SeqGL outperformed traditional motif discovery tools in discriminative accuracy. Furthermore, SeqGL can be naturally used with multitask learning to identify genomic and cell-type context determinants of TF binding. SeqGL successfully scales to the large multiplicity of sequence signals in DNase- or ATAC-seq maps. In particular, SeqGL was able to identify a number of ChIP-seq validated sequence signals that were not found by traditional motif discovery algorithms. Thus compared to widely used motif discovery algorithms, SeqGL demonstrates both greater discriminative accuracy and higher sensitivity for detecting the DNA sequence signals underlying regulatory element maps. SeqGL is available at http://cbio.mskcc.org/public/Leslie/SeqGL/ .

Abstract:
Mammalian genomes harbor abundant transposable elements (TEs) and their remnants, with numerous epigenetic repression mechanisms enacted to silence TE transcription. However, TEs are upregulated during early development, neuronal lineage, and cancers, although the epigenetic factors contributing to the transcription of TEs have yet to be fully elucidated. Here, we demonstrate that the male-specific lethal (MSL)-complex-mediated histone H4 acetylation at lysine 16 (H4K16ac) is enriched at TEs in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and cancer cells. This in turn activates transcription of subsets of full-length long interspersed nuclear elements (LINE1s, L1s) and endogenous retrovirus (ERV) long terminal repeats (LTRs). Furthermore, we show that the H4K16ac-marked L1 and LTR subfamilies display enhancer-like functions and are enriched in genomic locations with chromatin features associated with active enhancers. Importantly, such regions often reside at boundaries of topologically associated domains and loop with genes. CRISPR-based epigenetic perturbation and genetic deletion of L1s reveal that H4K16ac-marked L1s and LTRs regulate the expression of genes in cis . Overall, TEs enriched with H4K16ac contribute to the cis -regulatory landscape at specific genomic locations by maintaining an active chromatin landscape at TEs.

Title: Deep flanking sequence engineering for efficient promoter design using DeepSEED
Authors: Pengcheng Zhang, Haochen Wang, Hanwen Xu, Lei Wei, Liyang Liu, Zhirui Hu, Xiaowo Wang
Date: 2023-10-09

Abstract:
Designing promoters with desirable properties is essential in synthetic biology. Human experts are skilled at identifying strong explicit patterns in small samples, while deep learning models excel at detecting implicit weak patterns in large datasets. Biologists have described the sequence patterns of promoters via transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs). However, the flanking sequences of cis-regulatory elements, have long been overlooked and often arbitrarily decided in promoter design. To address this limitation, we introduce DeepSEED, an AI-aided framework that efficiently designs synthetic promoters by combining expert knowledge with deep learning techniques. DeepSEED has demonstrated success in improving the properties of Escherichia coli constitutive, IPTG-inducible, and mammalian cell doxycycline (Dox)-inducible promoters. Furthermore, our results show that DeepSEED captures the implicit features in flanking sequences, such as k-mer frequencies and DNA shape features, which are crucial for determining promoter properties.

Title: Post-Transcriptional Regulation of Connexin43 in H-Ras-Transformed Cells
Authors: Mustapha Kandouz, Jing Zhao, Andrew Bier, Sergio Di Marco, Irene Oviedo-Landaverde, Imed-Eddine Gallouzi, Gerald Batist
Date: 2013

Abstract:
Connexin43 (Cx43) expression is lost in cancer cells and many studies have reported that Cx43 is a tumor suppressor gene. Paradoxically, in a cellular NIH3T3 model, we have previously shown that Ha-Ras-mediated oncogenic transformation results in increased Cx43 expression. Although the examination of transcriptional regulation revealed essential regulatory elements, it could not solve this paradox. Here we studied post-transcriptional regulation of Cx43 expression in cancer using the same model in search of novel gene regulatory elements. Upon Ras transformation, both Cx43 mRNA stability and translation efficiency were increased. We investigated the role of Cx43 mRNA 3′ and 5′Untranslated regions (UTRs) and found an opposing effect; a 5′UTR-driven positive regulation is observed in Ras-transformed cells (NIH-3T3 Ras ), while the 3′UTR is active only in normal NIH-3T3 Neo cells and completely silenced in NIH-3T3 Ras cells. Most importantly, we identified a previously unknown regulatory element within the 3′UTR, named S1516, which accounts for this 3′UTR-mediated regulation. We also examined the effect of other oncogenes and found that Ras- and Src-transformed cells show a different Cx43 UTRs post-transcriptional regulation than ErbB2-transformed cells, suggesting distinct regulatory pathways. Next, we detected different patterns of S1516 RNA-protein complexes in NIH-3T3 Neo compared to NIH-3T3 Ras cells. A proteomic approach identified most of the S1516-binding proteins as factors involved in post-transcriptional regulation. Building on our new findings, we propose a model to explain the discrepancy between the Cx43 expression in Ras-transformed NIH3T3 cells and the data in clinical specimens.

Title: Targeted design of synthetic enhancers for selected tissues in the Drosophila embryo
Authors: Bernardo P. de Almeida, Christoph Schaub, Michaela Pagani, Stefano Secchia, Eileen E. M. Furlong, Alexander Stark
Date: 2023-12-12

Abstract:
Enhancers control gene expression and have crucial roles in development and homeostasis 1 – 3 . However, the targeted de novo design of enhancers with tissue-specific activities has remained challenging. Here we combine deep learning and transfer learning to design tissue-specific enhancers for five tissues in the Drosophila melanogaster embryo: the central nervous system, epidermis, gut, muscle and brain. We first train convolutional neural networks using genome-wide single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (ATAC-seq) datasets and then fine-tune the convolutional neural networks with smaller-scale data from in vivo enhancer activity assays, yielding models with 13% to 76% positive predictive value according to cross-validation. We designed and experimentally assessed 40 synthetic enhancers (8 per tissue) in vivo, of which 31 (78%) were active and 27 (68%) functioned in the target tissue (100% for central nervous system and muscle). The strategy of combining genome-wide and small-scale functional datasets by transfer learning is generally applicable and should enable the design of tissue-, cell type- and cell state-specific enhancers in any system.

Abstract:
Regulatory Tcells (Treg) are essential components of peripheral immune homeostasis. Adoptive Treg cell therapy has shown efficacy in a variety of immune-mediated diseases in preclinical studies and is now moving from phase I/IIa to larger phase II studies aiming to demonstrate efficacy. However, hurdles such as in vivo stability and efficacy remain to be addressed. Nevertheless, preclinical models have shown that Treg function and specificity can be increased by pharmacological substances or gene modifications, and even that conventional T cells can be converted to Treg potentially providing new sources of Treg and facilitating Treg cell therapy. The exponential growth in genetic engineering techniques and their application to T cells coupled to a large body of knowledge on Treg open numerous opportunities to generate Treg with “superpowers”. This review summarizes the genetic engineering techniques available and their applications for the next-generation of Super-Treg with increased function, stability, redirected specificity and survival.

Authors: Benjamin P. Song, Michelle F. Ragsac, Krissie Tellez, Granton A. Jindal, Jessica L. Grudzien, Sophia H. Le, Emma K. Farley
Date: 2023-02-28

Abstract:
The notochord is a defining feature of all chordates. The transcription factors Zic and ETS regulate enhancer activity within the notochord. We conduct high-throughput screens of genomic elements within developing Ciona embryos to understand how Zic and ETS sites encode notochord activity. Our screen discovers an enhancer located near Lama , a gene critical for notochord development. Reversing the orientation of an ETS site within this enhancer abolishes expression, indicating that enhancer grammar is critical for notochord activity. Similarly organized clusters of Zic and ETS sites occur within mouse and human Lama1 introns. Within a Brachyury (Bra) enhancer, FoxA and Bra, in combination with Zic and ETS binding sites, are necessary and sufficient for notochord expression. This binding site logic also occurs within other Ciona and vertebrate Bra enhancers. Collectively, this study uncovers the importance of grammar within notochord enhancers and discovers signatures of enhancer logic and grammar conserved across chordates.

Abstract:
Identifying gene regulatory elements and their target genes in vertebrates remains a significant challenge. It is now recognized that transcriptional regulatory sequences are critical in orchestrating dynamic controls of tissue-specific gene expression during vertebrate development and in adult tissues, and that these elements can be positioned at great distances in relation to the promoters of the genes they control. While significant progress has been made in mapping DNA binding regions by combining chromatin immunoprecipitation and next generation sequencing, functional validation remains a limiting step in improving our ability to correlate in silico predictions with biological function. We recently developed a computational method that synergistically combines genome-wide gene-expression profiling, vertebrate genome comparisons, and transcription factor binding-site analysis to predict tissue-specific enhancers in the human genome. We applied this method to 270 genes highly expressed in skeletal muscle and predicted 190 putative cis -regulatory modules. Furthermore, we optimized Tol2 transgenic constructs in Xenopus laevis to interrogate 20 of these elements for their ability to function as skeletal muscle-specific transcriptional enhancers during embryonic development. We found 45% of these elements expressed only in the fast muscle fibers that are oriented in highly organized chevrons in the Xenopus laevis tadpole. Transcription factor binding site analysis identified >2 Mef2/MyoD sites within ∼200 bp regions in 6 of the validated enhancers, and systematic mutagenesis of these sites revealed that they are critical for the enhancer function. The data described herein introduces a new reporter system suitable for interrogating tissue-specific cis -regulatory elements which allows monitoring of enhancer activity in real time, throughout early stages of embryonic development, in Xenopus .

Abstract:
The regulatory elements controlling gene expression during acute inflammation are not fully elucidated. Here we report the identification of a set of NF-κB-bound elements and common chromatin landscapes underlying the acute inflammatory response across cell-types and mammalian species. Using primary vascular endothelial cells (human/mouse/bovine) treated with the pro−inflammatory cytokine, Tumor Necrosis Factor-α, we identify extensive (~30%) conserved orthologous binding of NF-κB to accessible, as well as nucleosome-occluded chromatin. Regions with the highest NF-κB occupancy pre-stimulation show dramatic increases in NF-κB binding and chromatin accessibility post-stimulation. These ‘pre-bound’ regions are typically conserved (~56%), contain multiple NF-κB motifs, are utilized by diverse cell types, and overlap rare non-coding mutations and common genetic variation associated with both inflammatory and cardiovascular phenotypes. Genetic ablation of conserved, ‘pre-bound’ NF-κB regions within the super-enhancer associated with the chemokine-encoding CCL2 gene and elsewhere supports the functional relevance of these elements.

Title: The chromatin signatures of enhancers and their dynamic regulation
Authors: Amandine Barral, Jérôme Déjardin
Date: 2023-01-05

Abstract:
Enhancers are cis -regulatory elements that can stimulate gene expression from distance, and drive precise spatiotemporal gene expression profiles during development. Functional enhancers display specific features including an open chromatin conformation, Histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation, Histone H3 lysine 4 mono-methylation enrichment, and enhancer RNAs production. These features are modified upon developmental cues which impacts their activity. In this review, we describe the current state of knowledge about enhancer functions and the diverse chromatin signatures found on enhancers. We also discuss the dynamic changes of enhancer chromatin signatures, and their impact on lineage specific gene expression profiles, during development or cellular differentiation.

Title:  In silico design of context-responsive mammalian promoters with user-defined functionality
Authors: Adam J. Brown, Suzanne J. Gibson, Diane Hatton, David C. James
Date: 2017-10-13

Abstract:
Comprehensive de novo -design of complex mammalian promoters is restricted by unpredictable combinatorial interactions between constituent transcription factor regulatory elements (TFREs). In this study, we show that modular binding sites that do not function cooperatively can be identified by analyzing host cell transcription factor expression profiles, and subsequently testing cognate TFRE activities in varying homotypic and heterotypic promoter architectures. TFREs that displayed position-insensitive, additive function within a specific expression context could be rationally combined together in silico to create promoters with highly predictable activities. As TFRE order and spacing did not affect the performance of these TFRE-combinations, compositions could be specifically arranged to preclude the formation of undesirable sequence features. This facilitated simple in silico -design of promoters with context-required, user-defined functionalities. To demonstrate this, we de novo -created promoters for biopharmaceutical production in CHO cells that exhibited precisely designed activity dynamics and long-term expression-stability, without causing observable retroactive effects on cellular performance. The design process described can be utilized for applications requiring context-responsive, customizable promoter function, particularly where co-expression of synthetic TFs is not suitable. Although the synthetic promoter structure utilized does not closely resemble native mammalian architectures, our findings also provide additional support for a flexible billboard model of promoter regulation.

Abstract:
The recent discovery of vast non-coding RNA-based regulatory networks that can be easily modulated by nucleic acid-based drugs has opened numerous new therapeutic possibilities. Long non-coding RNA, and natural antisense transcripts (NATs) in particular, play a significant role in networks that involve a wide variety of disease-relevant biological mechanisms such as transcription, splicing, translation, mRNA degradation and others. Currently, significant efforts are dedicated to harnessing these newly emerging NAT-mediated biological mechanisms for therapeutic purposes. This review will highlight the recent clinical and pre-clinical developments in this field and survey the advances in nucleic acid-based drug technologies that make these developments possible.

Abstract:
As the 3D structure of the genome is analysed at ever increasing resolution it is clear that there is considerable variation in the 3D chromatin architecture across different cell types. It has been proposed that this may, in part, be due to increased recruitment of cohesin to activated cis-elements (enhancers and promoters) leading to cell-type specific loop extrusion underlying the formation of new sub-TADs. Here we show that cohesin correlates well with the presence of active enhancers and that this varies in an allele-specific manner with the presence or absence of polymorphic enhancers which vary from one individual to another. Using the alpha globin cluster as a model, we show that when all enhancers are removed, peaks of cohesin disappear from these regions and the erythroid specific sub-TAD is no longer formed. Re-insertion of the major alpha globin enhancer (R2) is associated with re-establishment of recruitment and increased interactions. In complementary experiments insertion of the R2 enhancer element into a “neutral” region of the genome recruits cohesin, induces transcription and creates a new large (75 kb) erythroid-specific domain. Together these findings support the proposal that active enhancers recruit cohesin, stimulate loop extrusion and promote the formation of cell specific sub-TADs.

Abstract:
The mammalian cortex is comprised of cells classified into types according to shared properties. Defining the contribution of each cell type to the processes guided by the cortex is essential for understanding its function in health and disease. We used transcriptomic and epigenomic cortical cell type taxonomies from mouse and human to define marker genes and putative enhancers and created a large toolkit of transgenic lines and enhancer AAVs for selective targeting of cortical cell populations. We report evaluation of fifteen new transgenic driver lines, two new reporter lines, and >800 different enhancer AAVs covering most subclasses of cortical cells. The tools reported here as well as the scaled process of tool creation and modification enable diverse experimental strategies towards understanding mammalian cortex and brain function.

Abstract:
Transcription factor (TF) binding is a key component of genomic regulation. There are numerous high-throughput experimental methods to characterize TF–DNA binding specificities. Their application, however, is both laborious and expensive, which makes profiling all TFs challenging. For instance, the binding preferences of ∼25% human TFs remain unknown; they neither have been determined experimentally nor inferred computationally. We introduce a structure-based learning approach to predict the binding preferences of TFs and the automated modelling of TF regulatory complexes. We show the advantage of using our approach over the classical nearest-neighbor prediction in the limits of remote homology. Starting from a TF sequence or structure, we predict binding preferences in the form of motifs that are then used to scan a DNA sequence for occurrences. The best matches are either profiled with a binding score or collected for their subsequent modeling into a higher-order regulatory complex with DNA. Co-operativity is modelled by: (i) the co-localization of TFs and (ii) the structural modeling of protein–protein interactions between TFs and with co-factors. We have applied our approach to automatically model the interferon-β enhanceosome and the pioneering complexes of OCT4, SOX2 (or SOX11) and KLF4 with a nucleosome, which are compared with the experimentally known structures.

Abstract:
Developmental enhancers bind transcription factors and dictate patterns of gene expression during development. Their molecular evolution can underlie phenotypical evolution, but the contributions of the evolutionary pathways involved remain little understood. Here, using mutation libraries in Drosophila melanogaster embryos, we observed that most point mutations in developmental enhancers led to changes in gene expression levels but rarely resulted in novel expression outside of the native pattern. In contrast, random sequences, often acting as developmental enhancers, drove expression across a range of cell types; random sequences including motifs for transcription factors with pioneer activity acted as enhancers even more frequently. Our findings suggest that the phenotypic landscapes of developmental enhancers are constrained by enhancer architecture and chromatin accessibility. We propose that the evolution of existing enhancers is limited in its capacity to generate novel phenotypes, whereas the activity of de novo elements is a primary source of phenotypic novelty.

Abstract:
Epigenetic information regulates gene expression and development. However, our understanding of the evolution of epigenetic regulation on brain development in primates is limited. Here, we compared chromatin accessibility landscapes and transcriptomes during fetal prefrontal cortex (PFC) development between rhesus macaques and humans. A total of 304,761 divergent DNase I-hypersensitive sites (DHSs) are identified between rhesus macaques and humans, although many of these sites share conserved DNA sequences. Interestingly, most of the cis -elements linked to orthologous genes with dynamic expression are divergent DHSs. Orthologous genes expressed at earlier stages tend to have conserved cis -elements, whereas orthologous genes specifically expressed at later stages seldom have conserved cis -elements. These genes are enriched in synapse organization, learning and memory. Notably, DHSs in the PFC at early stages are linked to human educational attainment and cognitive performance. Collectively, the comparison of the chromatin epigenetic landscape between rhesus macaques and humans suggests a potential role for regulatory elements in the evolution of differences in cognitive ability between non-human primates and humans.

Abstract:
Functional analysis of non-coding variants associated with human congenital disorders remains challenging due to the lack of efficient in vivo models. Here we introduce dual-enSERT, a robust Cas9-based two-color fluorescent reporter system which enables rapid, quantitative comparison of enhancer allele activities in live mice of any genetic background. We use this new technology to examine and measure the gain- and loss-of-function effects of enhancer variants linked to limb polydactyly, autism, and craniofacial malformation. By combining dual-enSERT with single-cell transcriptomics, we characterize variant enhancer alleles at cellular resolution, thereby implicating candidate molecular pathways in pathogenic enhancer misregulation. We further show that independent, polydactyly-linked enhancer variants lead to ectopic expression in the same cell populations, indicating shared genetic mechanisms underlying non-coding variant pathogenesis. Finally, we streamline dual-enSERT for analysis in F0 animals by placing both reporters on the same transgene separated by a synthetic insulator. Dual-enSERT allows researchers to go from identifying candidate enhancer variants to analysis of comparative enhancer activity in live embryos in under two weeks.

Date: 2023-02-20

Abstract:
Cancer is driven by both genetic and epigenetic changes that impact on gene expression profiles and the resulting tumourigenic phenotype. Enhancers are transcriptional regulatory elements that are key to our understanding of how this rewiring of gene expression is achieved in cancer cells. Here, we have harnessed the power of RNA-seq data from hundreds of patients with oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC) or its precursor state Barrett’s oesophagus coupled with open chromatin maps to identify potential enhancer RNAs and their associated enhancer regions in this cancer. We identify ~1000 OAC-specific enhancers and use these data to uncover new cellular pathways that are operational in OAC. Among these are enhancers for JUP , MYBL2 , and CCNE1 , and we show that their activity is required for cancer cell viability. We also demonstrate the clinical utility of our dataset for identifying disease stage and patient prognosis. Our data therefore identify an important set of regulatory elements that enhance our molecular understanding of OAC and point to potential new therapeutic directions.

Title: Identification of determinants of differential chromatin accessibility through a massively parallel genome-integrated reporter assay
Authors: Jennifer Hammelman, Konstantin Krismer, Budhaditya Banerjee, David K. Gifford, Richard I. Sherwood
Date: 2020-10

Abstract:
A key mechanism in cellular regulation is the ability of the transcriptional machinery to physically access DNA. Transcription factors interact with DNA to alter the accessibility of chromatin, which enables changes to gene expression during development or disease or as a response to environmental stimuli. However, the regulation of DNA accessibility via the recruitment of transcription factors is difficult to study in the context of the native genome because every genomic site is distinct in multiple ways. Here we introduce the multiplexed integrated accessibility assay (MIAA), an assay that measures chromatin accessibility of synthetic oligonucleotide sequence libraries integrated into a controlled genomic context with low native accessibility. We apply MIAA to measure the effects of sequence motifs on cell type–specific accessibility between mouse embryonic stem cells and embryonic stem cell–derived definitive endoderm cells, screening 7905 distinct DNA sequences. MIAA recapitulates differential accessibility patterns of 100-nt sequences derived from natively differential genomic regions, identifying E-box motifs common to epithelial–mesenchymal transition driver transcription factors in stem cell–specific accessible regions that become repressed in endoderm. We show that a single binding motif for a key regulatory transcription factor is sufficient to open chromatin, and classify sets of stem cell–specific, endoderm-specific, and shared accessibility-modifying transcription factor motifs. We also show that overexpression of two definitive endoderm transcription factors, T and Foxa2 , results in changes to accessibility in DNA sequences containing their respective DNA-binding motifs and identify preferential motif arrangements that influence accessibility.

Abstract:
Limbs are a defining characteristic of tetrapods, yet numerous taxa, primarily among amphibians and reptiles, have independently lost limbs as an adaptation to new ecological niches. To elucidate the genetic factors contributing to this convergent limb loss, we present a 12 Gb chromosome-level assembly of the Banna caecilian ( Ichthyophis bannanicus ), a limbless amphibian. Our comparative analysis, which includes the reconstruction of amphibian karyotype evolution, reveals constrained gene length evolution in a subset of developmental genes across 3 large genomes. Investigation of limb development genes uncovered the loss of Grem1 in caecilians and Tulp3 in snakes. Interestingly, caecilians and snakes share a significantly larger number of convergent degenerated conserved noncoding elements than limbless lizards, which have a shorter evolutionary history of limb loss. These convergent degenerated conserved noncoding elements overlap significantly with active genomic regions during mouse limb development and are conserved in limbed species, suggesting their essential role in limb patterning in the tetrapod common ancestor. While most convergent degenerated conserved noncoding elements emerged in the jawed vertebrate ancestor, coinciding with the origin of paired appendage, more recent degenerated conserved noncoding elements also contribute to limb development, as demonstrated through functional experiments. Our study provides novel insights into the regulatory elements associated with limb development and loss, offering an evolutionary perspective on the genetic basis of morphological specialization.

Abstract:
Genes with multiple co-active promoters appear common in brain, yet little is known about functional requirements for these potentially redundant genomic regulatory elements. SCN1A, which encodes the Na V 1.1 sodium channel alpha subunit, is one such gene with two co-active promoters. Mutations in SCN1A are associated with epilepsy, including Dravet syndrome (DS). The majority of DS patients harbor coding mutations causing SCN1A haploinsufficiency; however, putative causal non-coding promoter mutations have been identified. To determine the functional role of one of these potentially redundant Scn1a promoters, we focused on the non-coding Scn1a 1b regulatory region, previously described as a non-canonical alternative transcriptional start site. We generated a transgenic mouse line with deletion of the extended evolutionarily conserved 1b non-coding interval and characterized changes in gene and protein expression, and assessed seizure activity and alterations in behavior. Mice harboring a deletion of the 1b non-coding interval exhibited surprisingly severe reductions of Scn1a and Na V 1.1 expression throughout the brain. This was accompanied by electroencephalographic and thermal-evoked seizures, and behavioral deficits. This work contributes to functional dissection of the regulatory wiring of a major epilepsy risk gene, SCN1A . We identified the 1b region as a critical disease-relevant regulatory element and provide evidence that non-canonical and seemingly redundant promoters can have essential function.

Title: The +37 kb Cebpa Enhancer Is Critical for Cebpa Myeloid Gene Expression and Contains Functional Sites that Bind SCL, GATA2, C/EBPα, PU.1, and Additional Ets Factors
Authors: Stacy Cooper, Hong Guo, Alan D. Friedman
Date: 2015-05-04

Abstract:
The murine Cebpa gene contains an evolutionarily conserved 453 bp enhancer located at +37 kb that, together with its promoter, directs expression to myeloid progenitors and to long-term hematopoietic stem cells in transgenic mice. In human acute myeloid leukemia cases, the enhancer lacks point mutations but binds the RUNX1-ETO oncoprotein. The enhancer contains the H3K4me1 and H3K27Ac histone modifications, denoting an active enhancer, at progressively increasing levels as long-term hematopoietic stem cells transition to granulocyte-monocyte progenitors. We previously identified four enhancer sites that bind RUNX1 and demonstrated that their integrity is required for maximal enhancer activity in 32Dcl3 myeloid cells. The +37 kb Cebpa enhancer also contains C/EBP, Ets factor, Myb, GATA, and E-box consensus sites conserved in the human +42 kb CEBPA enhancer. Mutation of the two C/EBP, seven Ets, one Myb, two GATA, or two E-box sites reduces activity of an enhancer-promoter reporter in 32Dcl3 cells. In 293T gel shift assays, exogenous C/EBPα binds both C/EBP sites, c-Myb binds the Myb site, PU.1 binds the second Ets site, PU.1, Fli-1, ERG, and Ets1 bind the sixth Ets site, GATA2 binds both GATA sites, and SCL binds the second E-box. Endogenous hematopoietic RUNX1, PU.1, Fli-1, ERG, C/EBPα, GATA2, and SCL were previously shown to bind the enhancer, and we find that endogenous PU.1 binds the second Ets site in 32Dcl3 cells. Using CRISPR/Cas9, we developed 32Dcl3 lines in which the wild-type enhancer alleles are replaced with a variant mutant in the seven Ets sites. These lines have 20-fold reduced Cebpa mRNA when cultured in IL-3 or G-CSF, demonstrating a critical requirement for enhancer integrity for optimal Cebpa expression. In addition, these results indicate that the +37 kb Cebpa enhancer is the focus of multiple regulatory transcriptional pathways that impact its expression during normal hematopoiesis and potentially during myeloid transformation.

Title: A Discrete Transition Zone Organizes the Topological and Regulatory Autonomy of the Adjacent Tfap2c and Bmp7 Genes
Authors: Taro Tsujimura, Felix A. Klein, Katja Langenfeld, Juliane Glaser, Wolfgang Huber, François Spitz
Date: 2015-01

Abstract:
Despite the well-documented role of remote enhancers in controlling developmental gene expression, the mechanisms that allocate enhancers to genes are poorly characterized. Here, we investigate the cis- regulatory organization of the locus containing the Tfap2c and Bmp7 genes in vivo , using a series of engineered chromosomal rearrangements. While these genes lie adjacent to one another, we demonstrate that they are independently regulated by distinct sets of enhancers, which in turn define non-overlapping regulatory domains. Chromosome conformation capture experiments reveal a corresponding partition of the locus in two distinct structural entities, demarcated by a discrete transition zone. The impact of engineered chromosomal rearrangements on the topology of the locus and the resultant gene expression changes indicate that this transition zone functionally organizes the structural partition of the locus, thereby defining enhancer-target gene allocation. This partition is, however, not absolute: we show that it allows competing interactions across it that may be non-productive for the competing gene, but modulate expression of the competed one. Altogether, these data highlight the prime role of the topological organization of the genome in long-distance regulation of gene expression.

Title: Improving plant transient expression through the rational design of synthetic 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions
Authors: Hadrien Peyret, James K. M. Brown, George P. Lomonossoff
Date: 2019-09-18

Abstract:
The growing field of plant molecular farming relies on expression vectors that allow high yields of recombinant proteins to be produced through transient gene expression. While numerous expression vectors currently exist for this purpose, there are very few examples of systematic efforts to improve upon these. Moreover, the current generation of expression systems makes use of naturally-occurring regulatory elements, typically selected from plant viruses, to maximise yields. This study aims to use rational design to generate synthetic sequences that can rival existing ones. In this work, we present the rational design of novel synthetic 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs) which can be used in various combinations to modulate accumulation levels of transiently-expressed recombinant proteins. Using the pEAQ- HT expression vector as a point of comparison, we show that pre-existing expression systems can be improved by the deployment of rationally designed synthetic UTRs. Notably, we show that a suite of short, synthetic 5′UTRs behave as expression enhancers that outperform the HT 5′UTR present in the CPMV- HT expression system. Furthermore, we confirm the critical role played by the 3′UTR of cowpea mosaic virus RNA-2 in the performance of the CPMV- HT system. Finally, we use the knowledge obtained from these results to develop novel expression vectors (named pHRE and pHREAC) that equal or outperform pEAQ- HT in terms of recombinant protein yield. These new vectors are also domesticated for the use of certain Type IIS restriction enzymes, which allows for quicker cloning and straightforward assessment of different combinations of UTRs. We have shown that it is possible to rationally design a suite of expression modulators in the form of synthetic UTRs. We have created novel expression vectors that allow very high levels of recombinant protein expression in a transient expression context. This will have important consequences for future efforts to develop ever-better plant transient overexpression vectors for research or industrial applications.

Abstract:
Although major advances in genomics have initiated an exciting new era of research, a lack of information regarding cis -regulatory elements has limited the genetic improvement or manipulation of pigs as a meat source and biomedical model. Here, we systematically characterize cis -regulatory elements and their functions in 12 diverse tissues from four pig breeds by adopting similar strategies as the ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics projects, which include RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and ChIP-seq. In total, we generate 199 datasets and identify more than 220,000 cis -regulatory elements in the pig genome. Surprisingly, we find higher conservation of cis -regulatory elements between human and pig genomes than those between human and mouse genomes. Furthermore, the differences of topologically associating domains between the pig and human genomes are associated with morphological evolution of the head and face. Beyond generating a major new benchmark resource for pig epigenetics, our study provides basic comparative epigenetic data relevant to using pigs as models in human biomedical research.

Title: A k -mer grammar analysis to uncover maize regulatory architecture
Authors: María Katherine Mejía-Guerra, Edward S. Buckler
Date: 2019-03-15

Abstract:
Only a small percentage of the genome sequence is involved in regulation of gene expression, but to biochemically identify this portion is expensive and laborious. In species like maize, with diverse intergenic regions and lots of repetitive elements, this is an especially challenging problem that limits the use of the data from one line to the other. While regulatory regions are rare, they do have characteristic chromatin contexts and sequence organization (the grammar) with which they can be identified. We developed a computational framework to exploit this sequence arrangement. The models learn to classify regulatory regions based on sequence features - k -mers. To do this, we borrowed two approaches from the field of natural language processing: (1) “bag-of-words” which is commonly used for differentially weighting key words in tasks like sentiment analyses, and (2) a vector-space model using word2vec (vector- k -mers), that captures semantic and linguistic relationships between words. We built “bag-of- k -mers” and “vector- k -mers” models that distinguish between regulatory and non-regulatory regions with an average accuracy above 90%. Our “bag-of- k -mers” achieved higher overall accuracy, while the “vector- k -mers” models were more useful in highlighting key groups of sequences within the regulatory regions. These models now provide powerful tools to annotate regulatory regions in other maize lines beyond the reference, at low cost and with high accuracy. The online version of this article (10.1186/s12870-019-1693-2) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.

Date: 2025-04-02

Abstract:
Introducing novel functions in plants through synthetic multigene circuits requires strict transcriptional regulation. Currently, the use of natural regulatory modules in synthetic circuits is hindered by our limited knowledge of complex plant regulatory mechanisms, the paucity of characterized promoters, and the possibility of crosstalk with endogenous circuits. Synthetic regulatory modules can overcome these limitations. This article introduces an integrative de novo approach for designing plant synthetic promoters by utilizing the available online tools and databases. The recent achievements in designing and validating synthetic plant promoters, enhancers, transcription factors, and the challenges of establishing synthetic circuits in plants are also discussed.

Abstract:
Sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins (DBPs) play critical roles in biology and biotechnology, and there has been considerable interest in the engineering of DBPs with new or altered specificities for genome editing and other applications. While there has been some success in reprogramming naturally occurring DBPs using selection methods, the computational design of new DBPs that recognize arbitrary target sites remains an outstanding challenge. We describe a computational method for the design of small DBPs that recognize specific target sequences through interactions with bases in the major groove, and employ this method in conjunction with experimental screening to generate binders for 5 distinct DNA targets. These binders exhibit specificity closely matching the computational models for the target DNA sequences at as many as 6 base positions and affinities as low as 30–100 nM. The crystal structure of a designed DBP-target site complex is in close agreement with the design model, highlighting the accuracy of the design method. The designed DBPs function in both Escherichia coli and mammalian cells to repress and activate transcription of neighboring genes. Our method is a substantial step towards a general route to small and hence readily deliverable sequence-specific DBPs for gene regulation and editing.

Date: 2022-06-15

Abstract:
Modifications in gene regulation are driving forces in the evolution of organisms. Part of these changes involve cis- regulatory elements (CREs), which contact their target genes through higher-order chromatin structures. However, how such architectures and variations in CREs contribute to transcriptional evolvability remains elusive. We use Hoxd genes as a paradigm for the emergence of regulatory innovations, as many relevant enhancers are located in a regulatory landscape highly conserved in amniotes. Here, we analysed their regulation in murine vibrissae and chicken feather primordia, two skin appendages expressing different Hoxd gene subsets, and compared the regulation of these genes in these appendages with that in the elongation of the posterior trunk. In the two former structures, distinct subsets of Hoxd genes are contacted by different lineage-specific enhancers, probably as a result of using an ancestral chromatin topology as an evolutionary playground, whereas the gene regulation that occurs in the mouse and chicken embryonic trunk partially relies on conserved CREs. A high proportion of these non-coding sequences active in the trunk have functionally diverged between species, suggesting that transcriptional robustness is maintained, despite considerable divergence in enhancer sequences.

Date: 2021-08-11

Abstract:
Fluctuation ('noise') in gene expression is critical for mammalian cellular processes. Numerous mechanisms contribute to its origins, yet the mechanisms behind large fluctuations that are induced by single transcriptional activators remain elusive. Here, we probed putative mechanisms by studying the dynamic regulation of transcriptional activator binding, histone regulator inhibitors, chromatin accessibility, and levels of mRNAs and proteins in single cells. Using a light-induced expression system, we showed that the transcriptional activator could form an interplay with dual functional co-activator/histone acetyltransferases CBP/p300. This interplay resulted in substantial heterogeneity in H3K27ac, chromatin accessibility, and transcription. Simultaneous attenuation of CBP/p300 and HDAC4/5 reduced heterogeneity in the expression of endogenous genes, suggesting that this mechanism is universal. We further found that the noise was reduced by pulse-wide modulation of transcriptional activator binding possibly as a result of alternating the epigenetic states. Our findings suggest a mechanism for the modulation of noise in synthetic and endogenous gene expression systems.

Date: 2022-01-04

Abstract:
The ability to build
synthetic cellular populations from the bottom-up
provides the groundwork to realize minimal living tissues comprising
single cells which can communicate and bridge scales into multicellular
systems. Engineered systems made of synthetic micron-sized compartments
and integrated reaction networks coupled with mathematical modeling
can facilitate the design and construction of complex and multiscale
chemical systems from the bottom-up. Toward this goal, we generated
populations of monodisperse liposomes encapsulating cell-free expression
systems (CFESs) using double-emulsion microfluidics and quantified
transcription and translation dynamics within individual synthetic
cells of the population using a fluorescent Broccoli RNA aptamer and
mCherry protein reporter. CFE dynamics in bulk reactions were used
to test different coarse-grained resource-limited gene expression
models using model selection to obtain transcription and translation
rate parameters by likelihood-based parameter estimation. The selected
model was then applied to quantify cell-free gene expression dynamics
in populations of synthetic cells. In combination, our experimental
and theoretical approaches provide a statistically robust analysis
of CFE dynamics in bulk and monodisperse synthetic cell populations.
We demonstrate that compartmentalization of CFESs leads to different
transcription and translation rates compared to bulk CFE and show
that this is due to the semipermeable lipid membrane that allows the
exchange of materials between the synthetic cells and the external
environment.

Abstract:
Synthetic biology is an emerging discipline, offering new perspectives in many industrial fields, from pharma and row-material production to renewable energy. Developing synthetic biology applications is often a lengthy and expensive process with extensive and tedious trial-and-error runs. Computational models can direct the engineering of biological circuits in a computer-aided design setting. By providing a virtual lab environment, in silico models of synthetic circuits can contribute to a quantitative understanding of the underlying molecular pathways before a wet-lab implementation. Here, we illustrate this notion from the point of view of signal fidelity and noise relationship. Noise in gene expression can undermine signal fidelity with implications on the well-functioning of the engineered organisms. For our analysis, we use a specific biological circuit that regulates the gene expression in bacterial inorganic phosphate economy. Applications that use this circuit include those in pollutant detection and wastewater treatment. We provide computational models with different levels of molecular detail as virtual labs. We show that inherent fluctuations in the gene expression machinery can be predicted via stochastic simulations to introduce control in the synthetic promoter design process. Our analysis suggests that noise in the system can be alleviated by strong synthetic promoters with slow unbinding rates. Overall, we provide a recipe for the computer-aided design of synthetic promoter libraries with specific signal to noise characteristics. The design and development of synthetic biology applications in a workflow often involve connecting modular components. Whereas computer-aided design tools are picking up in synthetic biology as in other areas of engineering, the methods for verifying the correct functioning of living technologies are still in their infancy. Especially, fine-tuning for the right promoter strength to match the design specifications is often a lengthy and expensive experimental process. In particular, the relationship between signal fidelity and noise in synthetic promoter design can be a key parameter that can affect the healthy functioning of the engineered organism. To this end, based on our previous work on synthetic promoters for the E. coli PhoBR two-component system, we make a case for using chemical reaction network models for computational verification of various promoter designs before a lab implementation. We provide an analysis of this system with extensive stochastic simulations at a single-cell level to assess the signal fidelity and noise relationship. We then show how quasi-steady-state analysis via ordinary differential equations can be used to navigate between models with different levels of detail. We compare stochastic simulations with our full and reduced models by using various metrics for assessing noise. Our analysis suggests that strong promoters with low unbinding rates can act as control tools for filtering out intrinsic noise in the PhoBR context. Our results confirm that even simpler models can be used to determine promoters with specific signal to noise characteristics.

Abstract:
Responses to extracellular signals via Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) pathways control complex transcriptional programs where hundreds of genes are induced at a desired level with a specific timing. Gene expression regulation is largely encoded in the promoter of the gene, which harbors numerous transcription factor binding sites. In the mating MAPK pathway of Saccharomyces cerevisiae , one major transcription factor, Ste12, controls the chronology of gene expression necessary for the fusion of two haploid cells. Because endogenous promoters encode a large diversity of Ste12 binding sites (PRE), we engineered synthetic promoters to decipher the rules that dictate mating gene induction. Conformations of PRE dimers that allow efficient gene expression were identified. The strength of binding of Ste12 to the PRE and the distance of the binding sites to the core promoter modulate the level of induction. The speed of activation is ensured by favoring a basal association of Ste12 by using a strong dimer of PRE located in a nucleosome depleted region.

Title: Regulatory systems for gene expression control in cyanobacteria
Authors: Petra Till, Jörg Toepel, Bruno Bühler, Robert L. Mach, Astrid R. Mach-Aigner
Date: 2020-01-22

Abstract:
As photosynthetic microbes, cyanobacteria are attractive hosts for the production of high-value molecules from CO 2 and light. Strategies for genetic engineering and tightly controlled gene expression are essential for the biotechnological application of these organisms. Numerous heterologous or native promoter systems were used for constitutive and inducible expression, yet many of them suffer either from leakiness or from a low expression output. Anyway, in recent years, existing systems have been improved and new promoters have been discovered or engineered for cyanobacteria. Moreover, alternative tools and strategies for expression control such as riboswitches, riboregulators or genetic circuits have been developed. In this mini-review, we provide a broad overview on the different tools and approaches for the regulation of gene expression in cyanobacteria and explain their advantages and disadvantages.

Title: Orthogonal control of gene expression in plants using synthetic promoters and CRISPR-based transcription factors

Date: 2022-03-29

Abstract:
The construction and application of synthetic genetic circuits is frequently improved if gene expression can be orthogonally controlled, relative to the host. In plants, orthogonality can be achieved via the use of CRISPR-based transcription factors that are programmed to act on natural or synthetic promoters. The construction of complex gene circuits can require multiple, orthogonal regulatory interactions, and this in turn requires that the full programmability of CRISPR elements be adapted to non-natural and non-standard promoters that have few constraints on their design. Therefore, we have developed synthetic promoter elements in which regions upstream of the minimal 35S CaMV promoter are designed from scratch to interact via programmed gRNAs with dCas9 fusions that allow activation of gene expression. A panel of three, mutually orthogonal promoters that can be acted on by artificial gRNAs bound by CRISPR regulators were designed. Guide RNA expression targeting these promoters was in turn controlled by either Pol III (U6) or ethylene-inducible Pol II promoters, implementing for the first time a fully artificial Orthogonal Control System (OCS). Following demonstration of the complete orthogonality of the designs, the OCS was tied to cellular metabolism by putting gRNA expression under the control of an endogenous plant signaling molecule, ethylene. The ability to form complex circuitry was demonstrated via the ethylene-driven, ratiometric expression of fluorescent proteins in single plants. The design of synthetic promoters is highly generalizable to large tracts of sequence space, allowing Orthogonal Control Systems of increasing complexity to potentially be generated at will. The ability to tie in several different basal features of plant molecular biology (Pol II and Pol III promoters, ethylene regulation) to the OCS demonstrates multiple opportunities for engineering at the system level. Moreover, given the fungibility of the core 35S CaMV promoter elements, the derived synthetic promoters can potentially be utilized across a variety of plant species.

Abstract:
Abiotic stress resistance traits may be especially crucial for sustainable production of bioenergy tree crops. Here, we show the performance of a set of rationally designed osmotic‐related and salt stress‐inducible synthetic promoters for use in hybrid poplar. De novo motif‐detecting algorithms yielded 30 water‐deficit (SD) and 34 salt stress (SS) candidate DNA motifs from relevant poplar transcriptomes. We selected three conserved water‐deficit stress motifs (SD18, SD13 and SD9) found in 16 co‐expressed gene promoters, and we discovered a well‐conserved motif for salt response (SS16). We characterized several native poplar stress‐inducible promoters to enable comparisons with our synthetic promoters. Fifteen synthetic promoters were designed using various SD and SS subdomains, in which heptameric repeats of five‐to‐eight subdomain bases were fused to a common core promoter downstream, which, in turn, drove a green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene for reporter assays. These 15 synthetic promoters were screened by transient expression assays in poplar leaf mesophyll protoplasts and agroinfiltrated Nicotiana benthamiana leaves under osmotic stress conditions. Twelve synthetic promoters were induced in transient expression assays with a GFP readout. Of these, five promoters (SD18‐1, SD9‐2, SS16‐1, SS16‐2 and SS16‐3) endowed higher inducibility under osmotic stress conditions than native promoters. These five synthetic promoters were stably transformed into Arabidopsis thaliana to study inducibility in whole plants. Herein, SD18‐1 and SD9‐2 were induced by water‐deficit stress, whereas SS16‐1, SS16‐2 and SS16‐3 were induced by salt stress. The synthetic biology design pipeline resulted in five synthetic promoters that outperformed endogenous promoters in transgenic plants.

Authors: Bo Larsen, Roberto Hofmann, Ines S. Camacho, Richard W. Clarke, J Clark Lagarias, Alex R. Jones, Alexander M. Jones
Date: 2023-09-21

Abstract:
Optogenetic actuators have revolutionized the resolution at which biological processes can be controlled. In plants, deployment of optogenetics is challenging due to the need for these light-responsive systems to function in the context of horticultural light environments. Furthermore, many available optogenetic actuators are based on plant photoreceptors that might crosstalk with endogenous signaling processes, while others depend on exogenously supplied cofactors. To overcome such challenges, we have developed Highlighter, a synthetic, light-gated gene expression system tailored for in planta function. Highlighter is based on the photoswitchable CcaS-CcaR system from cyanobacteria and is repurposed for plants as a fully genetically encoded system. Analysis of a re-engineered CcaS in Escherichia coli demonstrated green/red photoswitching with phytochromobilin, a chromophore endogenous to plants, but also revealed a blue light response likely derived from a flavin-binding LOV-like domain. We deployed Highlighter in transiently transformed Nicotiana benthamiana for optogenetic control of fluorescent protein expression. Using light to guide differential fluorescent protein expression in nuclei of neighboring cells, we demonstrate unprecedented spatiotemporal control of target gene expression. We implemented the system to demonstrate optogenetic control over plant immunity and pigment production through modulation of the spectral composition of broadband visible (white) light. Highlighter is a step forward for optogenetics in plants and a technology for high-resolution gene induction that will advance fundamental plant biology and provide new opportunities for crop improvement.

Authors: Xinyi Wang, Xuantong Zhou, Liping Kang, Yuqin Lai, Haifeng Ye
Date: 2023-09

Abstract:
The ability to precisely control activities of engineered designer cells provides a novel strategy for modern precision medicine. Dynamically adjustable gene- and cell-based precision therapies are recognized as next generation medicines. However, the translation of these controllable therapeutics into clinical practice is severely hampered by the lack of safe and highly specific genetic switches controlled by triggers that are nontoxic and side-effect free. Recently, natural products derived from plants have been extensively explored as trigger molecules to control genetic switches and synthetic gene networks for multiple applications. These controlled genetic switches could be further introduced into mammalian cells to obtain synthetic designer cells for adjustable and fine tunable cell-based precision therapy. In this review, we introduce various available natural molecules that were engineered to control genetic switches for controllable transgene expression, complex logic computation, and therapeutic drug delivery to achieve precision therapy. We also discuss current challenges and prospects in translating these natural molecule-controlled genetic switches developed for biomedical applications from the laboratory to the clinic.

Date: 2020-08-06

Abstract:
Promoters play an essential role in the regulation of gene expression for fine-tuning genetic circuits and metabolic pathways in Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( S. cerevisiae ). However, native promoters in S. cerevisiae have several limitations which hinder their applications in metabolic engineering. These limitations include an inadequate number of well-characterized promoters, poor dynamic range, and insufficient orthogonality to endogenous regulations. Therefore, it is necessary to perform promoter engineering to create synthetic promoters with better properties. Here, we review recent advances related to promoter architecture, promoter engineering and synthetic promoter applications in S. cerevisiae . We also provide a perspective of future directions in this field with an emphasis on the recent advances of machine learning based promoter designs.

Date: 2021-06-21

Abstract:
The ability to tune RNA and gene expression dynamics is greatly needed for biotechnological applications. Native RNA stabilizers or engineered 5’ stability hairpins have been utilized to regulate transcript half-life to control recombinant protein expression. However, these methods have been mostly ad-hoc and hence lack predictability and modularity. Here, we report a library of RNA modules called degradation-tuning RNAs (dtRNAs) that can increase or decrease transcript stability in vivo and in vitro . dtRNAs enable modulation of transcript stability over a 40-fold dynamic range in Escherichia coli with minimal influence on translation initiation. We harness dtRNAs in mRNAs and noncoding RNAs to tune gene circuit dynamics and enhance CRISPR interference in vivo . Use of stabilizing dtRNAs in cell-free transcription-translation reactions also tunes gene and RNA aptamer production. Finally, we combine dtRNAs with toehold switch sensors to enhance the performance of paper-based norovirus diagnostics, illustrating the potential of dtRNAs for biotechnological applications.

Title: Fine-tuning the expression of pathway gene in yeast using a regulatory library formed by fusing a synthetic minimal promoter with different Kozak variants
Authors: Liping Xu, Pingping Liu, Zhubo Dai, Feiyu Fan, Xueli Zhang
Date: 2021-07-28

Abstract:
Tailoring gene expression to balance metabolic fluxes is critical for the overproduction of metabolites in yeast hosts, and its implementation requires coordinated regulation at both transcriptional and translational levels. Although synthetic minimal yeast promoters have shown many advantages compared to natural promoters, their transcriptional strength is still limited, which restricts their applications in pathway engineering. In this work, we sought to expand the application scope of synthetic minimal yeast promoters by enhancing the corresponding translation levels using specific Kozak sequence variants. Firstly, we chose the reported UAS F-E-C -Core1 minimal promoter as a library template and determined its Kozak motif (K 0 ). Next, we randomly mutated the K 0 to generate a chimeric promoter library, which was able to drive green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression with translational strengths spanning a 500-fold range. A total of 14 chimeric promoters showed at least two-fold differences in GFP expression strength compared to the K 0 control. The best one named K 528 even showed 8.5- and 3.3-fold increases in fluorescence intensity compared with UAS F-E-C -Core1 and the strong native constitutive promoter P TDH3 , respectively. Subsequently, we chose three representative strong chimeric promoters (K 540 , K 536 , and K 528 ) from this library to regulate pathway gene expression. In conjunction with the tHMG1 gene for squalene production, the K 528 variant produced the best squalene titer of 32.1 mg/L in shake flasks, which represents a more than 10-fold increase compared to the parental K 0 control (3.1 mg/L). All these results demonstrate that this chimeric promoter library developed in this study is an effective tool for pathway engineering in yeast.

Title: Effective control of tumor growth through spatial and temporal control of theranostic sodium iodide symporter ( NIS ) gene expression using a heat-inducible gene promoter in engineered mesenchymal stem cells

Abstract:
Purpose : The tumor homing characteristics of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) make them attractive vehicles for the tumor-specific delivery of therapeutic agents, such as the sodium iodide symporter (NIS). NIS is a theranostic protein that allows non-invasive monitoring of the in vivo biodistribution of functional NIS expression by radioiodine imaging as well as the therapeutic application of 131 I. To gain local and temporal control of transgene expression, and thereby improve tumor selectivity, we engineered MSCs to express the NIS gene under control of a heat-inducible HSP70B promoter (HSP70B-NIS-MSCs). Experimental Design : NIS induction in heat-treated HSP70B-NIS-MSCs was verified by 125 I uptake assay, RT-PCR, Western blot and immunofluorescence staining. HSP70B-NIS-MSCs were then injected i.v. into mice carrying subcutaneous hepatocellular carcinoma HuH7 xenografts, and hyperthermia (1 h at 41°C) was locally applied to the tumor. 0 - 72 h later radioiodine uptake was assessed by 123 I-scintigraphy. The most effective uptake regime was then selected for 131 I therapy. Results : The HSP70B promoter showed low basal activity in vitro and was significantly induced in response to heat. In vivo , the highest tumoral iodine accumulation was seen 12 h after application of hyperthermia. HSP70B-NIS-MSC-mediated 131 I therapy combined with hyperthermia resulted in a significantly reduced tumor growth with prolonged survival as compared to control groups. Conclusions : The heat-inducible HSP70B promoter allows hyperthermia-induced spatial and temporal control of MSC-mediated theranostic NIS gene radiotherapy with efficient tumor-selective and temperature-dependent accumulation of radioiodine in heat-treated tumors.

Abstract:
Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) offer opportunities to study human biology where primary cell types are limited. CRISPR technology allows forward genetic screens using engineered Cas9-expressing cells. Here, we sought to generate a CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) hiPSC line to activate endogenous genes during pluripotency and differentiation. We first targeted catalytically inactive Cas9 fused to VP64, p65 and Rta activators (dCas9-VPR) regulated by the constitutive CAG promoter to the AAVS1 safe harbor site. These CRISPRa hiPSC lines effectively activate target genes in pluripotency, however the dCas9-VPR transgene expression is silenced after differentiation into cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells. To understand this silencing, we systematically tested different safe harbor sites and different promoters. Targeting to safe harbor sites hROSA26 and CLYBL loci also yielded hiPSCs that expressed dCas9-VPR in pluripotency but silenced during differentiation. Muscle-specific regulatory cassettes, derived from cardiac troponin T or muscle creatine kinase promoters, were also silent after differentiation when dCas9-VPR was introduced. In contrast, in cell lines where the dCas9-VPR sequence was replaced with cDNAs encoding fluorescent proteins, expression persisted during differentiation in all loci and with all promoters. Promoter DNA was hypermethylated in CRISPRa-engineered lines, and demethylation with 5-azacytidine enhanced dCas9-VPR gene expression. In summary, the dCas9-VPR cDNA is readily expressed from multiple loci during pluripotency but induces silencing in a locus- and promoter-independent manner during differentiation to mesoderm derivatives. Researchers intending to use this CRISPRa strategy during stem cell differentiation should pilot their system to ensure it remains active in their population of interest.

Abstract:
Synthetic biology has grown exponentially in the last few years, with a variety of biological applications. One of the emerging applications of synthetic biology is to exploit the link between microorganisms, biologics, and human health. To exploit this link, it is critical to select effective synthetic biology tools for use in appropriate microorganisms that would address unmet needs in human health through the development of new game-changing applications and by complementing existing technological capabilities. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are considered appropriate chassis organisms that can be genetically engineered for therapeutic and industrial applications. Here, we have reviewed comprehensively various synthetic biology techniques for engineering probiotic LAB strains, such as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 mediated genome editing, homologous recombination, and recombineering. In addition, we also discussed heterologous protein expression systems used in engineering probiotic LAB. By combining computational biology with genetic engineering, there is a lot of potential to develop next-generation synthetic LAB with capabilities to address bottlenecks in industrial scale-up and complex biologics production. Recently, we started working on Lactochassis project where we aim to develop next generation synthetic LAB for biomedical application.

Abstract:
Precise, scalable, and sustainable control of genetic and cellular activities in mammalian cells is key to developing precision therapeutics and smart biomanufacturing. Here we create a highly tunable, modular, versatile CRISPR-based synthetic transcription system for the programmable control of gene expression and cellular phenotypes in mammalian cells. Genetic circuits consisting of well-characterized libraries of guide RNAs, binding motifs of synthetic operators, transcriptional activators, and additional genetic regulatory elements express mammalian genes in a highly predictable and tunable manner. We demonstrate the programmable control of reporter genes episomally and chromosomally, with up to 25-fold more activity than seen with the EF1α promoter, in multiple cell types. We use these circuits to program the secretion of human monoclonal antibodies and to control T-cell effector function marked by interferon-γ production. Antibody titers and interferon-γ concentrations significantly correlate with synthetic promoter strengths, providing a platform for programming gene expression and cellular function in diverse applications.

Title: Engineering and application of synthetic nar promoter for fine-tuning the expression of metabolic pathway genes in Escherichia coli
Authors: Hee Jin Hwang, Sang Yup Lee, Pyung Cheon Lee
Date: 2018-04-07

Abstract:
Promoters regulate the expression of metabolic pathway genes to control the flux of metabolism. Therefore, fine-tuning of metabolic pathway gene expression requires an applicable promoter system. In this study, a dissolved oxygen-dependent nar promoter was engineered for fine-tuning the expression levels of biosynthetic pathway enzymes in Escherichia coli . To demonstrate the feasibility of using the synthetic nar promoters in production of biochemicals in E. coli , the d -lactate pathway consisting of one enzyme and the 2,3-butanediol (BDO) pathway consisting of three enzymes were investigated. The spacer sequence of 15 bp between the − 35 and − 10 elements of the upstream region of the wild-type nar promoter was randomized, fused to the GFP gene, transduced into E. coli , and screened by flow cytometry. The sorted synthetic nar promoters were divided into three groups according to fluorescence intensity levels: strong, intermediate, and weak. The selected three representative nar promoters of strong, intermediate, and weak intensities were used to control the expression level of the d -lactate and 2,3-BDO biosynthetic pathway enzymes in E. coli . When the ldhD gene encoding d -lactate dehydrogenase was expressed under the control of the strong synthetic nar promoter in fed-batch cultures of E. coli , the d -lactate titers were 105.6 g/L, 34% higher than those using the wild-type promoter (79.0 g/L). When the three 2,3-BDO pathway genes ( ilvBN , aldB , and bdh1 ) were expressed under the control of combinational synthetic nar promoters (strong–weak–strong) in fed-batch cultures of E. coli , the titers of 2,3-BDO were 88.0 g/L, 72% higher than those using the wild-type promoter (51.1 g/L). The synthetic nar promoters, which were engineered to have strong, intermediate, and weak intensities, were successfully applied to metabolic engineering of d -lactate and 2,3-BDO pathways in E. coli . By controlling expression levels of d -lactate and 2,3-BDO pathway enzymes using the synthetic nar promoters, the production of d -lactate and 2,3-BDO was increased over that using the wild-type promoter by 34 and 72%, respectively. Thus, this synthetic promoter module system will support the improved production of biochemicals and biofuels through fine-tuning of gene expression levels.

Title: Cas9-assisted biological containment of a genetically engineered human commensal bacterium and genetic elements
Authors: Naoki Hayashi, Yong Lai, Jay Fuerte-Stone, Mark Mimee, Timothy K. Lu
Date: 2024-03-07

Abstract:
Sophisticated gene circuits built by synthetic biology can enable bacteria to sense their environment and respond predictably. Engineered biosensing bacteria outfitted with such circuits can potentially probe the human gut microbiome to prevent, diagnose, or treat disease. To provide robust biocontainment for engineered bacteria, we devised a Cas9-assisted auxotrophic biocontainment system combining thymidine auxotrophy, an Engineered Riboregulator (ER) for controlled gene expression, and a CRISPR Device (CD). The CD prevents the engineered bacteria from acquiring thyA via horizontal gene transfer, which would disrupt the biocontainment system, and inhibits the spread of genetic elements by killing bacteria harboring the gene cassette. This system tunably controlled gene expression in the human gut commensal bacterium Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron , prevented escape from thymidine auxotrophy, and blocked transgene dissemination. These capabilities were validated in vitro and in vivo. This biocontainment system exemplifies a powerful strategy for bringing genetically engineered microorganisms safely into biomedicine.

Title: Light-regulated gene expression in Bacteria: Fundamentals, advances, and perspectives
Authors: Robert Ohlendorf, Andreas Möglich
Date: 2022-10-14

Abstract:
Numerous photoreceptors and genetic circuits emerged over the past two decades and now enable the light-dependent i.e., optogenetic, regulation of gene expression in bacteria. Prompted by light cues in the near-ultraviolet to near-infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum, gene expression can be up- or downregulated stringently, reversibly, non-invasively, and with precision in space and time. Here, we survey the underlying principles, available options, and prominent examples of optogenetically regulated gene expression in bacteria. While transcription initiation and elongation remain most important for optogenetic intervention, other processes e.g., translation and downstream events, were also rendered light-dependent. The optogenetic control of bacterial expression predominantly employs but three fundamental strategies: light-sensitive two-component systems, oligomerization reactions, and second-messenger signaling. Certain optogenetic circuits moved beyond the proof-of-principle and stood the test of practice. They enable unprecedented applications in three major areas. First, light-dependent expression underpins novel concepts and strategies for enhanced yields in microbial production processes. Second, light-responsive bacteria can be optogenetically stimulated while residing within the bodies of animals, thus prompting the secretion of compounds that grant health benefits to the animal host. Third, optogenetics allows the generation of precisely structured, novel biomaterials. These applications jointly testify to the maturity of the optogenetic approach and serve as blueprints bound to inspire and template innovative use cases of light-regulated gene expression in bacteria. Researchers pursuing these lines can choose from an ever-growing, versatile, and efficient toolkit of optogenetic circuits.

Abstract:
Engineered transactivation domains (TADs) combined with programmable DNA binding platforms have revolutionized synthetic transcriptional control. Despite recent progress in programmable CRISPR–Cas-based transactivation (CRISPRa) technologies, the TADs used in these systems often contain poorly tolerated elements and/or are prohibitively large for many applications. Here, we defined and optimized minimal TADs built from human mechanosensitive transcription factors. We used these components to construct potent and compact multipartite transactivation modules (MSN, NMS and eN3x9) and to build the CRISPR–dCas9 recruited enhanced activation module (CRISPR-DREAM) platform. We found that CRISPR-DREAM was specific and robust across mammalian cell types, and efficiently stimulated transcription from diverse regulatory loci. We also showed that MSN and NMS were portable across Type I, II and V CRISPR systems, transcription activator-like effectors and zinc finger proteins. Further, as proofs of concept, we used dCas9-NMS to efficiently reprogram human fibroblasts into induced pluripotent stem cells and demonstrated that mechanosensitive transcription factor TADs are efficacious and well tolerated in therapeutically important primary human cell types. Finally, we leveraged the compact and potent features of these engineered TADs to build dual and all-in-one CRISPRa AAV systems. Altogether, these compact human TADs, fusion modules and delivery architectures should be valuable for synthetic transcriptional control in biomedical applications.

Title: Engineered live bacteria as disease detection and diagnosis tools
Authors: Imen Tanniche, Bahareh Behkam
Date: 2023-10-24

Abstract:
Sensitive and minimally invasive medical diagnostics are essential to the early detection of diseases, monitoring their progression and response to treatment. Engineered bacteria as live sensors are being developed as a new class of biosensors for sensitive, robust, noninvasive, and in situ detection of disease onset at low cost. Akin to microrobotic systems, a combination of simple genetic rules, basic logic gates, and complex synthetic bioengineering principles are used to program bacterial vectors as living machines for detecting biomarkers of diseases, some of which cannot be detected with other sensing technologies. Bacterial whole-cell biosensors (BWCBs) can have wide-ranging functions from detection only, to detection and recording, to closed-loop detection-regulated treatment. In this review article, we first summarize the unique benefits of bacteria as living sensors. We then describe the different bacteria-based diagnosis approaches and provide examples of diagnosing various diseases and disorders. We also discuss the use of bacteria as imaging vectors for disease detection and image-guided surgery. We conclude by highlighting current challenges and opportunities for further exploration toward clinical translation of these bacteria-based systems.

Title: Control of Multigene Expression Stoichiometry in Mammalian
Cells Using Synthetic Promoters
Authors: Yash D. Patel, Adam J. Brown, Jie Zhu, Guglielmo Rosignoli, Suzanne J. Gibson, Diane Hatton, David C. James
Date: 2021-05-03

Abstract:
To successfully engineer
mammalian cells for a desired purpose,
multiple recombinant genes are required to be coexpressed at a specific
and optimal ratio. In this study, we hypothesized that synthetic promoters
varying in transcriptional activity could be used to create single
multigene expression vectors coexpressing recombinant genes at a predictable
relative stoichiometry. A library of 27 multigene constructs was created
comprising three discrete fluorescent reporter gene transcriptional
units in fixed series, each under the control of either a relatively
low, medium, or high transcriptional strength synthetic promoter in
every possible combination. Expression of each reporter gene was determined
by absolute quantitation qRT-PCR in CHO cells. The synthetic promoters
did generally function as designed within a multigene vector context;
however, significant divergences from predicted promoter-mediated
transcriptional activity were observed. First, expression of all three
genes within a multigene vector was repressed at varying levels relative
to coexpression of identical reporter genes on separate single gene
vectors at equivalent gene copies. Second, gene positional effects
were evident across all constructs where expression of the reporter
genes in positions 2 and 3 was generally reduced relative to position
1. Finally, after accounting for general repression, synthetic promoter
transcriptional activity within a local multigene vector format deviated
from that expected. Taken together, our data reveal that mammalian
synthetic promoters can be employed in vectors to mediate expression
of multiple genes at predictable relative stoichiometries. However,
empirical validation of functional performance is a necessary prerequisite,
as vector and promoter design features can significantly impact performance.

Abstract:
Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) expressed in cell-free systems hold great promise for investigating the limits of biological information processing and developing platforms for molecular biosensing and chemical bioproduction. We address the challenge of engineering GRNs that can dynamically activate many targets. The work described here enables classes of deep, wide, and multi-input CRISPR-based genetic circuits.

Title: A portable library of phosphate‐depletion based synthetic promoters for customable and automata control of gene expression in bacteria
Authors: Jesús Torres‐Bacete, José Luís García, Juan Nogales
Date: 2021-03-30

Abstract:
Industrial biotechnology gene expression systems relay on constitutive promoters compromising cellular growth from the start of the bioprocess, or on inducible devices, which require manual addition of cognate inducers. To overcome this shortcoming, we engineered an automata regulatory system based on cell‐stress mechanisms. Specifically, we engineered a synthetic and highly portable phosphate‐depletion library of promoters inspired by bacterial PHO starvation system (Pliar promoters). Furthermore, we fully characterized 10 synthetic promoters within the background of two well‐known bacterial workhorses such as E. coli W and P. putida KT2440. The promoters displayed an interesting host‐dependent performance and a wide strength spectrum ranging from 0.4‐ to 1.3‐fold when compared to the wild‐type phosphatase alkaline promoter (P phoA ). By comparing with available gene expression systems, we proved the suitability of this new library for the automata and effective decoupling of growth from production in P. putida . Growth phase‐dependent expression of these promoters could therefore be activated by fine tuning the initial concentration of phosphate in the medium. Finally, the Pliar library was implemented in the SEVA platform in a ready‐to‐use mode allowing its broad use by the scientific community.

Date: 2024-01-03

Abstract:
Cell and gene therapies hold tremendous promise for treating a range of difficult-to-treat diseases. However, concerns over the safety and efficacy require to be further addressed in order to realize their full potential. Synthetic receptors, a synthetic biology tool that can precisely control the function of therapeutic cells and genetic modules, have been rapidly developed and applied as a powerful solution. Delicately designed and engineered, they can be applied to finetune the therapeutic activities, i.e., to regulate production of dosed, bioactive payloads by sensing and processing user-defined signals or biomarkers. This review provides an overview of diverse synthetic receptor systems being used to reprogram therapeutic cells and their wide applications in biomedical research. With a special focus on four synthetic receptor systems at the forefront, including chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) and synthetic Notch (synNotch) receptors, we address the generalized strategies to design, construct and improve synthetic receptors. Meanwhile, we also highlight the expanding landscape of therapeutic applications of the synthetic receptor systems as well as current challenges in their clinical translation.

Title: Optimization of Constitutive Promoters Using a Promoter-Trapping Vector in Burkholderia pyrrocinia JK-SH007
Authors: Xue-Lian Wu, Xiao-Wei Liu, Yang Wang, Meng-Yun Guo, Jian-Ren Ye
Date: 2023-05-29

Abstract:
Selecting suitable promoters to drive gene overexpression can provide significant insight into the development of engineered bacteria. In this study, we analyzed the transcriptome data of Burkholderia pyrrocinia JK-SH007 and identified 54 highly expressed genes. The promoter sequences were located using genome-wide data and scored using the prokaryotic promoter prediction software BPROM to further screen out 18 promoter sequences. We also developed a promoter trap system based on two reporter proteins adapted for promoter optimization in B. pyrrocinia JK-SH007: firefly luciferase encoded by the luciferase gene set ( Luc ) and trimethoprim ( TP )-resistant dihydrofolate reductase ( TP r ). Ultimately, eight constitutive promoters were successfully inserted into the probe vector and transformed into B. pyrrocinia JK-SH007. The transformants were successfully grown on Tp antibiotic plates, and firefly luciferase expression was determined by measuring the relative light unit (RLU). Five of the promoters (P4, P9, P10, P14, and P19) showed 1.01–2.51-fold higher activity than the control promoter λ phage transcriptional promoter (PRPL). The promoter activity was further validated via qPCR analysis, indicating that promoters P14 and P19 showed stable high transcription levels at all time points. Then, GFP and RFP proteins were overexpressed in JK-SH007. In addition, promoters P14 and P19 were successfully used to drive gene expression in Burkholderia multivorans WS-FJ9 and Escherichia coli S17-1. The two constitutive promoters can be used not only in B. pyrrocinia JK-SH007 itself to gene overexpression but also to expand the scope of application.

Abstract:
Genetically programmed circuits allowing bifunctional dynamic regulation of enzyme expression have far-reaching significances for various bio-manufactural purposes. However, building a bio-switch with a post log-phase response and reversibility during scale-up bioprocesses is still a challenge in metabolic engineering due to the lack of robustness. Here, we report a robust thermosensitive bio-switch that enables stringent bidirectional control of gene expression over time and levels in living cells. Based on the bio-switch, we obtain tree ring-like colonies with spatially distributed patterns and transformer cells shifting among spherical-, rod- and fiber-shapes of the engineered Escherichia coli . Moreover, fed-batch fermentations of recombinant E. coli are conducted to obtain ordered assembly of tailor-made biopolymers polyhydroxyalkanoates including diblock- and random-copolymer, composed of 3-hydroxybutyrate and 4-hydroxybutyrate with controllable monomer molar fraction. This study demonstrates the possibility of well-organized, chemosynthesis-like block polymerization on a molecular scale by reprogrammed microbes, exemplifying the versatility of thermo-response control for various practical uses.

Title: Engineering an inducible gene expression system for Bacillus subtilis from a strong constitutive promoter and a theophylline-activated synthetic riboswitch
Authors: Wenjing Cui, Laichuang Han, Jintao Cheng, Zhongmei Liu, Li Zhou, Junling Guo, Zhemin Zhou
Date: 2016-11-22

Abstract:
Synthetic riboswitches have been increasingly used to control and tune gene expression in diverse organisms. Although a set of theophylline-responsive riboswitches have been developed for bacteria, fully functional expression elements mediated by synthetic riboswitches in Bacillus subtilis are rarely used because of the host-dependent compatibility between the promoters and riboswitches. A novel genetic element composed of the promoter P43 and a theophylline-riboswitch was developed and characterized in B. subtilis . When combined with a P43 promoter (P43′-riboE1), the theophylline-riboswitch successfully switched the constitutive expression pattern of P43 to an induced pattern. The expression mediated by the novel element could be activated at the translational level by theophylline with a relatively high induction ratio. The induction ratios for P43′-riboE1 by 4-mM theophylline were elevated during the induction period. The level of induced expression was dependent on the theophylline dose. Correspondingly, the induction ratios gradually increased in parallel with the elevated dose of theophylline. Importantly, the induced expression level was higher than three other strong constitutive promoters including P srfA , P aprE , and the native P43. It was found that the distance between the SD sequence within the expression element and the start codon significantly influenced both the level of induced expression and the induction ratio. A 9-bp spacer was suitable for producing desirable expression level and induction ratio. Longer spacer reduced the activation efficiency. Importantly, the system successfully overexpressed β-glucuronidase at equal levels, and induction ratio was similar to that of GFP. The constructed theophylline-inducible gene expression system has broad compatibility and robustness, which has great potential in over-production of pharmaceutical and industrial proteins and utilization in building more complex gene circuits.

Abstract:
Microbes are increasingly employed as cell factories to produce biomolecules. This often involves the expression of complex heterologous biosynthesis pathways in host strains. Achieving maximal product yields and avoiding build-up of (toxic) intermediates requires balanced expression of every pathway gene. However, despite progress in metabolic modeling, the optimization of gene expression still heavily relies on trial-and-error. Here, we report an approach for in vivo, multiplexed G ene E xpression M odification b y L oxPsym-Cr e R ecombination (GEMbLeR). GEMbLeR exploits orthogonal LoxPsym sites to independently shuffle promoter and terminator modules at distinct genomic loci. This approach facilitates creation of large strain libraries, in which expression of every pathway gene ranges over 120-fold and each strain harbors a unique expression profile. When applied to the biosynthetic pathway of astaxanthin, an industrially relevant antioxidant, a single round of GEMbLeR improved pathway flux and doubled production titers. Together, this shows that GEMbLeR allows rapid and efficient gene expression optimization in heterologous biosynthetic pathways, offering possibilities for enhancing the performance of microbial cell factories.

Abstract:
High-precision bioengineering and synthetic biology require fine-tuning gene expression at both transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. Gene transcription is tightly regulated by promoters and terminators. Promoters determine the timing, tissues and cells, and levels of the expression of genes. Terminators mediate transcription termination of genes and affect mRNA levels posttranscriptionally, e.g., the 3′-end processing, stability, translation efficiency, and nuclear to cytoplasmic export of mRNAs. The promoter and terminator combination affects gene expression. In the present article, we review the function and features of plant core promoters, proximal and distal promoters, and terminators, and their effects on and benchmarking strategies for regulating gene expression.

Abstract:
Synthetic promoters may be designed using short cis ‐regulatory elements (CREs) and core promoter sequences for specific purposes. We identified novel conserved DNA motifs from the promoter sequences of leaf palisade and vascular cell type‐specific expressed genes in water‐deficit stressed poplar ( Populus tremula × Populus alba ), collected through low‐input RNA‐seq analysis using laser capture microdissection. Hexamerized sequences of four conserved 20‐base motifs were inserted into each synthetic promoter construct. Two of these synthetic promoters (Syn2 and Syn3) induced GFP in transformed poplar mesophyll protoplasts incubated in 0.5 M mannitol solution. To identify effect of length and sequence from a valuable 20 base motif, 5′ and 3′ regions from a basic sequence ( GTTAACTTCAGGGCCTGTGG) of Syn3 were hexamerized to generate two shorter synthetic promoters, Syn3‐10b‐1 (5′: GTTAACTTCA ) and Syn3‐10b‐2 (3′: GGGCCTGTGG ). These promoters' activities were compared with Syn3 in plants. Syn3 and Syn3‐10b‐1 were specifically induced in transient agroinfiltrated Nicotiana benthamiana leaves in water cessation for 3 days. In stable transgenic poplar, Syn3 presented as a constitutive promoter but had the highest activity in leaves. Syn3‐10b‐1 had stronger induction in green tissues under water‐deficit stress conditions than mock control. Therefore, a synthetic promoter containing the 5′ sequence of Syn3 endowed both tissue‐specificity and water‐deficit inducibility in transgenic poplar, whereas the 3′ sequence did not. Consequently, we have added two new synthetic promoters to the poplar engineering toolkit: Syn3‐10b‐1, a green tissue‐specific and water‐deficit stress‐induced promoter, and Syn3, a green tissue‐preferential constitutive promoter.

Title: Spatiotemporal control of engineered bacteria to express interferon-γ by focused ultrasound for tumor immunotherapy
Authors: Yuhao Chen, Meng Du, Zhen Yuan, Zhiyi Chen, Fei Yan
Date: 2022-08-02

Abstract:
Bacteria-based tumor therapy has recently attracted wide attentions due to its unique capability in targeting tumors and preferentially colonizing the core area of the tumor. Various therapeutic genes are also harbored into these engineering bacteria to enhance their anti-tumor efficacy. However, it is difficult to spatiotemporally control the expression of these inserted genes in the tumor site. Here, we engineer an ultrasound-responsive bacterium (URB) which can induce the expression of exogenous genes in an ultrasound-controllable manner. Owing to the advantage of ultrasound in tissue penetration, an acoustic remote control of bacterial gene expression can be realized by designing a temperature-actuated genetic switch. Cytokine interferon-γ (IFN-γ), an important immune regulatory molecule that plays a significant role in tumor immunotherapy, is used to test the system. Our results show that brief hyperthermia induced by focused ultrasound promotes the expression of IFN-γ gene, improving anti-tumor efficacy of URB in vitro and in vivo. Our study provides an alternative strategy for bacteria-mediated tumor immunotherapy.

Lactone Sensors for Gram-Positive Bacillus subtilis Using LuxR-Type Regulators
Authors: Min Zeng, Biprodev Sarker, Nathaniel Howitz, Ishita Shah, Lauren B. Andrews
Date: 2023-12-11

Abstract:
A universal biochemical
signal for bacterial cell–cell
communication
could facilitate programming dynamic responses in diverse bacterial
consortia. However, the classical quorum sensing paradigm is that
Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria generally communicate via
homoserine lactones (HSLs) or oligopeptide molecular signals, respectively,
to elicit population responses. Here, we create synthetic HSL sensors
for Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis 168 using allosteric LuxR-type regulators (RpaR, LuxR, RhlR, and
CinR) and synthetic promoters. Promoters were combinatorially designed
from different sequence elements (−35, −16, −10,
and transcriptional start regions). We quantified the effects of these
combinatorial promoters on sensor activity and determined how regulator
expression affects its activation, achieving up to 293-fold activation.
Using the statistical design of experiments, we identified significant
effects of promoter regions and pairwise interactions on sensor activity,
which helped to understand the sequence–function relationships
for synthetic promoter design. We present the first known set of functional
HSL sensors (≥20-fold dynamic range) in B. subtilis for four different HSL chemical signals: p -coumaroyl-HSL,
3-oxohexanoyl-HSL, n -butyryl-HSL, and n -(3-hydroxytetradecanoyl)-HSL. This set of synthetic HSL sensors
for a Gram-positive bacterium can pave the way for designable interspecies
communication within microbial consortia.

Abstract:
Abiotic stresses can cause significant damage to plants. For sustainable bioenergy crop production, it is critical to generate resistant crops to such stress. Engineering promoters to control the precise expression of stress resistance genes is a very effective way to address the problem. Here we developed stably transformed Populus tremula × Populus alba hybrid poplar (INRA 717-1B4) containing one-of-six s ynthetic d rought stress-inducible promoters (SDs; SD9-1, SD9-2, SD9-3, SD13-1, SD18-1, and SD18-3) identified previously by transient transformation assays. We screened green fluorescent protein (GFP) induction in poplar under osmotic stress conditions. Of six transgenic lines containing synthetic promoter, three lines (SD18-1, 9-2, and 9-3) had significant GFP expression in both salt and osmotic stress treatments. Each synthetic promoter employed heptamerized repeats of specific and short cis -regulatory elements (7 repeats of 7-8 bases). To verify whether the repeats of longer sequences can improve osmotic stress responsiveness, a transgenic poplar containing the synthetic promoter of the heptamerized entire SD9 motif (20 bases, containing all partial SD9 motifs) was generated and measured for GFP induction under osmotic stress. The heptamerized entire SD9 motif did not result in higher GFP expression than the shorter promoters consisting of heptamerized SD9-1, 9-2, and 9-3 (partial SD9) motifs. This result indicates that shorter synthetic promoters (~50 bp) can be used for versatile control of gene expression in transgenic poplar. These synthetic promoters will be useful tools to engineer stress-resilient bioenergy tree crops in the future.

Abstract:
Synthetic biology research and its industrial applications rely on deterministic spatiotemporal control of gene expression. Recently, electrochemical control of gene expression has been demonstrated in electrogenetic systems (redox-responsive promoters used alongside redox inducers and electrodes), allowing for the direct integration of electronics with biological processes. However, the use of electrogenetic systems is limited by poor activity, tunability, and standardization. In this work, we developed a strong, unidirectional, redox-responsive promoter before deriving a mutant promoter library with a spectrum of strengths. We constructed genetic circuits with these parts and demonstrated their activation by multiple classes of redox molecules. Last, we demonstrated electrochemical activation of gene expression under aerobic conditions using a novel, modular bioelectrochemical device. These genetic and electrochemical tools facilitate the design and improve the performance of electrogenetic systems. Furthermore, the genetic design strategies used can be applied to other redox-responsive promoters to further expand the available tools for electrogenetics.

Abstract:
Gene expression is thought to be affected not only by the concentration of transcription factors (TFs) but also the dynamics of their nuclear translocation. Testing this hypothesis requires direct control of TF dynamics. Here, we engineer CLASP, an optogenetic tool for rapid and tunable translocation of a TF of interest. Using CLASP fused to Crz1, we observe that, for the same integrated concentration of nuclear TF over time, changing input dynamics changes target gene expression: pulsatile inputs yield higher expression than continuous inputs, or vice versa, depending on the target gene. Computational modeling reveals that a dose-response saturating at low TF input can yield higher gene expression for pulsatile versus continuous input, and that multi-state promoter activation can yield the opposite behavior. Our integrated tool development and modeling approach characterize promoter responses to Crz1 nuclear translocation dynamics, extracting quantitative features that may help explain the differential expression of target genes.

Title: An electrogenetic interface to program mammalian gene expression by direct current
Authors: Jinbo Huang, Shuai Xue, Peter Buchmann, Ana Palma Teixeira, Martin Fussenegger
Date: 2023-07-31

Abstract:
Wearable electronic devices are playing a rapidly expanding role in the acquisition of individuals’ health data for personalized medical interventions; however, wearables cannot yet directly program gene-based therapies because of the lack of a direct electrogenetic interface. Here we provide the missing link by developing an electrogenetic interface that we call direct current (DC)-actuated regulation technology (DART), which enables electrode-mediated, time- and voltage-dependent transgene expression in human cells using DC from batteries. DART utilizes a DC supply to generate non-toxic levels of reactive oxygen species that act via a biosensor to reversibly fine-tune synthetic promoters. In a proof-of-concept study in a type 1 diabetic male mouse model, a once-daily transdermal stimulation of subcutaneously implanted microencapsulated engineered human cells by energized acupuncture needles (4.5 V DC for 10 s) stimulated insulin release and restored normoglycemia. We believe this technology will enable wearable electronic devices to directly program metabolic interventions.

Title: Natural promoters and promoter engineering strategies for metabolic regulation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae
Authors: Shifan He, Zhanwei Zhang, Wenyu Lu
Date: 2023

Abstract:
 Sharomyces cerevisiae is currently one of the most important foreign gene expression systems. S. cerevisiae is an excellent host for high-value metabolite cell factories due to its advantages of simplicity, safety, and nontoxicity. A promoter, as one of the basic elements of gene transcription, plays an important role in regulating gene expression and optimizing metabolic pathways. Promoters control the direction and intensity of transcription, and the application of promoters with different intensities and performances will largely determine the effect of gene expression and ultimately affect the experimental results. Due to its significant role, there have been many studies on promoters for decades. While some studies have explored and analyzed new promoters with different functions, more studies have focused on artificially modifying promoters to meet their own scientific needs. Thus, this article reviews current research on promoter engineering techniques and related natural promoters in S. cerevisiae . First, we introduce the basic structure of promoters and the classification of natural promoters. Then, the classification of various promoter strategies is reviewed. Finally, by grouping related articles together using various strategies, this review anticipates the future development direction of promoter engineering.

Abstract:
Engineered living materials (ELMs) fabricated by encapsulating microbes in hydrogels have great potential as bioreactors for sustained bioproduction. While long-term metabolic activity has been demonstrated in these systems, the capacity and dynamics of gene expression over time is not well understood. Thus, we investigate the long-term gene expression dynamics in microbial ELMs constructed using different microbes and hydrogel matrices. Through direct gene expression measurements of engineered E. coli in F127-bisurethane methacrylate (F127-BUM) hydrogels, we show that inducible, input-responsive genetic programs in ELMs can be activated multiple times and maintained for multiple weeks. Interestingly, the encapsulated bacteria sustain inducible gene expression almost 10 times longer than free-floating, planktonic cells. These ELMs exhibit dynamic responsiveness to repeated induction cycles, with up to 97% of the initial gene expression capacity retained following a subsequent induction event. We demonstrate multi-week bioproduction cycling by implementing inducible CRISPR transcriptional activation (CRISPRa) programs that regulate the expression of enzymes in a pteridine biosynthesis pathway. ELMs fabricated from engineered S. cerevisiae in bovine serum albumin (BSA) - polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA) hydrogels were programmed to express two different proteins, each under the control of a different chemical inducer. We observed scheduled bioproduction switching between betaxanthin pigment molecules and proteinase A in S. cerevisiae ELMs over the course of 27 days under continuous cultivation. Overall, these results suggest that the capacity for long-term genetic expression may be a general property of microbial ELMs. This work establishes approaches for implementing dynamic, input-responsive genetic programs to tailor ELM functions for a wide range of advanced applications.

Abstract:
Here, we present a gene regulation strategy enabling programmable control over eukaryotic translational initiation. By excising the natural poly-adenylation (poly-A) signal of target genes and replacing it with a synthetic control region harboring RNA-binding protein (RBP)-specific aptamers, cap-dependent translation is rendered exclusively dependent on synthetic translation initiation factors (STIFs) containing different RBPs engineered to conditionally associate with different eIF4F-binding proteins (eIFBPs). This modular design framework facilitates the engineering of various gene switches and intracellular sensors responding to many user-defined trigger signals of interest, demonstrating tightly controlled, rapid and reversible regulation of transgene expression in mammalian cells as well as compatibility with various clinically applicable delivery routes of in vivo gene therapy. Therapeutic efficacy was demonstrated in two animal models. To exemplify disease treatments that require on-demand drug secretion, we show that a custom-designed gene switch triggered by the FDA-approved drug grazoprevir can effectively control insulin expression and restore glucose homeostasis in diabetic mice. For diseases that require instantaneous sense-and-response treatment programs, we create highly specific sensors for various subcellularly (mis)localized protein markers (such as cancer-related fusion proteins) and show that translation-based protein sensors can be used either alone or in combination with other cell-state classification strategies to create therapeutic biocomputers driving self-sufficient elimination of tumor cells in mice. This design strategy demonstrates unprecedented flexibility for translational regulation and could form the basis for a novel class of programmable gene therapies in vivo.

Abstract:
Efficient genome engineering is critical to understand and use microbial functions. Despite recent development of tools such as CRISPR-Cas gene editing, efficient integration of exogenous DNA with well-characterized functions remains limited to model bacteria. Here, we describe serine recombinase–assisted genome engineering, or SAGE, an easy-to-use, highly efficient, and extensible technology that enables selection marker–free, site-specific genome integration of up to 10 DNA constructs, often with efficiency on par with or superior to replicating plasmids. SAGE uses no replicating plasmids and thus lacks the host range limitations of other genome engineering technologies. We demonstrate the value of SAGE by characterizing genome integration efficiency in five bacteria that span multiple taxonomy groups and biotechnology applications and by identifying more than 95 heterologous promoters in each host with consistent transcription across environmental and genetic contexts. We anticipate that SAGE will rapidly expand the number of industrial and environmental bacteria compatible with high-throughput genetics and synthetic biology.

Title: Accelerating Genetic Sensor Development, Scale-up, and Deployment Using Synthetic Biology
Authors: Shivang Hina-Nilesh Joshi, Christopher Jenkins, David Ulaeto, Thomas E. Gorochowski
Date: 2024-06-25

Abstract:
Living cells are exquisitely tuned to sense and respond to changes in their environment. Repurposing these systems to create engineered biosensors has seen growing interest in the field of synthetic biology and provides a foundation for many innovative applications spanning environmental monitoring to improved biobased production. In this review, we present a detailed overview of currently available biosensors and the methods that have supported their development, scale-up, and deployment. We focus on genetic sensors in living cells whose outputs affect gene expression. We find that emerging high-throughput experimental assays and evolutionary approaches combined with advanced bioinformatics and machine learning are establishing pipelines to produce genetic sensors for virtually any small molecule, protein, or nucleic acid. However, more complex sensing tasks based on classifying compositions of many stimuli and the reliable deployment of these systems into real-world settings remain challenges. We suggest that recent advances in our ability to precisely modify nonmodel organisms and the integration of proven control engineering principles (e.g., feedback) into the broader design of genetic sensing systems will be necessary to overcome these hurdles and realize the immense potential of the field.

Abstract:
Synthetic biology aims to design or assemble existing bioparts or bio-components for useful bioproperties. During the past decades, progresses have been made to build delicate biocircuits, standardized biological building blocks and to develop various genomic/metabolic engineering tools and approaches. Medical and pharmaceutical demands have also pushed the development of synthetic biology, including integration of heterologous pathways into designer cells to efficiently produce medical agents, enhanced yields of natural products in cell growth media to equal or higher than that of the extracts from plants or fungi, constructions of novel genetic circuits for tumor targeting, controllable releases of therapeutic agents in response to specific biomarkers to fight diseases such as diabetes and cancers. Besides, new strategies are developed to treat complex immune diseases, infectious diseases and metabolic disorders that are hard to cure via traditional approaches. In general, synthetic biology brings new capabilities to medical and pharmaceutical researches. This review summarizes the timeline of synthetic biology developments, the past and present of synthetic biology for microbial productions of pharmaceutics, engineered cells equipped with synthetic DNA circuits for diagnosis and therapies, live and auto-assemblied biomaterials for medical treatments, cell-free synthetic biology in medical and pharmaceutical fields, and DNA engineering approaches with potentials for biomedical applications.

Abstract:
Engineered probiotics can effectively manage hyperuricemia, a condition characterized by increased serum uric acid (UA) levels, leading to several chronic diseases. In this study, we design a probiotic-based UA level sensing and adjustment (PULSE)-engineered bacterium to maintain UA homeostasis. We generate a UA sensor in the E. coli Nissle 1917 strain based on a UA-responsive transcriptional repressor HucR, integrated with a synthetic promoter. Upon oral administration of engineered probiotics, PULSE cells dynamically regulate urate oxidase expression, reducing UA in the gastrointestinal tract in response to increased serum levels. We have demonstrated the potential of PULSE-engineered bacteria in maintaining UA balance in acute and chronic hyperuricemic mouse and rat models, highlighting the potential for long-term oral administration in reducing hyperuricemia-associated renal damage. Our probiotic-based living drug supports the progress of engineered probiotics as a safe, effective, and patient-friendly alternative to typical therapeutics for chronic disease management.

Abstract:
The emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains, the decreased effectiveness of conventional therapies, and the side effects have led researchers to seek a safer, more cost-effective, patient-friendly, and effective method that does not develop antibiotic resistance. With progress in synthetic biology and genetic engineering, genetically engineered microorganisms effective in treatment, prophylaxis, drug delivery, and diagnosis have been developed. The present study reviews the types of genetically engineered bacteria and phages, their impacts on diseases, cancer, and metabolic and inflammatory disorders, the biosynthesis of these modified strains, the route of administration, and their effects on the environment. We conclude that genetically engineered microorganisms can be considered promising candidates for adjunctive treatment of diseases and cancers.

Title: Characterization and mitigation of gene expression burden in mammalian cells
Authors: Timothy Frei, Federica Cella, Fabiana Tedeschi, Joaquín Gutiérrez, Guy-Bart Stan, Mustafa Khammash, Velia Siciliano
Date: 2020-09-15

Abstract:
Despite recent advances in circuit engineering, the design of genetic networks in mammalian cells is still painstakingly slow and fraught with inexplicable failures. Here, we demonstrate that transiently expressed genes in mammalian cells compete for limited transcriptional and translational resources. This competition results in the coupling of otherwise independent exogenous and endogenous genes, creating a divergence between intended and actual function. Guided by a resource-aware mathematical model, we identify and engineer natural and synthetic miRNA-based incoherent feedforward loop (iFFL) circuits that mitigate gene expression burden. The implementation of these circuits features the use of endogenous miRNAs as elementary components of the engineered iFFL device, a versatile hybrid design that allows burden mitigation to be achieved across different cell-lines with minimal resource requirements. This study establishes the foundations for context-aware prediction and improvement of in vivo synthetic circuit performance, paving the way towards more rational synthetic construct design in mammalian cells.

Authors: I. Cody MacDonald, Travis R. Seamons, Jonathan C. Emmons, Shwan B. Javdan, Tara L. Deans
Date: 2021-07-05

Abstract:
Expanding the genetic toolbox for prokaryotic synthetic biology is a promising strategy for enhancing the dynamic range of gene expression and enabling new engineered applications for research and biomedicine. Here, we reverse the current trend of moving genetic parts from prokaryotes to eukaryotes and demonstrate that the activating eukaryotic transcription factor QF and its corresponding DNA-binding sequence can be moved to E. coli to introduce transcriptional activation, in addition to tight off states. We further demonstrate that the QF transcription factor can be used in genetic devices that respond to low input levels with robust and sustained output signals. Collectively, we show that eukaryotic gene regulator elements are functional in prokaryotes and establish a versatile and broadly applicable approach for constructing genetic circuits with complex functions. These genetic tools hold the potential to improve biotechnology applications for medical science and research.

Title: An operator-based expression toolkit for Bacillus subtilis enables fine-tuning of gene expression and biosynthetic pathway regulation
Authors: Gang Fu, Jie Yue, Dandan Li, Yixin Li, Sang Yup Lee, Dawei Zhang
Date: 2022-03-09

Abstract:
A gene regulatory system is an important tool for the engineering of biosynthetic pathways of organisms. Here, we report the development of an inducible-ON/OFF regulatory system using a malO operator as a key element. We identified and modulated sequence, position, numbers, and spacing distance of malO operators, generating a series of activating or repressive promoters with tunable strength. The stringency and robustness are both guaranteed in this system, a maximal induction factor of 790-fold was achieved, and nine proteins from different organisms were expressed with high yields. This system can be utilized as a gene switch, promoter enhancer, or metabolic valve in synthetic biology applications. This operator-based engineering strategy can be employed for developing similar regulatory systems in different microorganisms.

Title: Unraveling the Complex Interplay of Fis and IHF Through Synthetic Promoter Engineering
Authors: Lummy Maria Oliveira Monteiro, Ananda Sanches-Medeiros, Cauã Antunes Westmann, Rafael Silva-Rocha
Date: 2020-06-18

Abstract:
Bacterial promoters are usually formed by multiple cis -regulatory elements recognized by a plethora of transcriptional factors (TFs). From those, global regulators are key elements since these TFs are responsible for the regulation of hundreds of genes in the bacterial genome. For instance, Fis and IHF are global regulators that play a major role in gene expression control in Escherichia coli , and usually, multiple cis -regulatory elements for these proteins are present at target promoters. Here, we investigated the relationship between the architecture of the cis -regulatory elements for Fis and IHF in E. coli . For this, we analyze 42 synthetic promoter variants harboring consensus cis -elements for Fis and IHF at different distances from the core −35/−10 region and in various numbers and combinations. We first demonstrated that although Fis preferentially recognizes its consensus cis -element, it can also recognize, to some extent, the consensus-binding site for IHF, and the same was true for IHF, which was also able to recognize Fis binding sites. However, changing the arrangement of the cis -elements (i.e., the position or number of sites) can completely abolish the non-specific binding of both TFs. More remarkably, we demonstrated that combining cis -elements for both TFs could result in Fis and IHF repressed or activated promoters depending on the final architecture of the promoters in an unpredictable way. Taken together, the data presented here demonstrate how small changes in the architecture of bacterial promoters could result in drastic changes in the final regulatory logic of the system, with important implications for the understanding of natural complex promoters in bacteria and their engineering for novel applications.

Title: The Red Edge: Bilin-Binding Photoreceptors as Optogenetic
Tools and Fluorescence Reporters
Authors: Kun Tang, Hannes M. Beyer, Matias D. Zurbriggen, Wolfgang Gärtner
Date: 2021-10-20

Abstract:
This review adds
the bilin-binding phytochromes to the Chemical Reviews thematic issue “Optogenetics and
Photopharmacology”. The work is structured into two parts.
We first outline the photochemistry of the covalently bound tetrapyrrole
chromophore and summarize relevant spectroscopic, kinetic, biochemical,
and physiological properties of the different families of phytochromes.
Based on this knowledge, we then describe the engineering of phytochromes
to further improve these chromoproteins as photoswitches and review
their employment in an ever-growing number of different optogenetic
applications. Most applications rely on the light-controlled complex
formation between the plant photoreceptor PhyB and phytochrome-interacting
factors (PIFs) or C-terminal light-regulated domains with enzymatic
functions present in many bacterial and algal phytochromes. Phytochrome-based
optogenetic tools are currently implemented in bacteria, yeast, plants,
and animals to achieve light control of a wide range of biological
activities. These cover the regulation of gene expression, protein
transport into cell organelles, and the recruitment of phytochrome-
or PIF-tagged proteins to membranes and other cellular compartments.
This compilation illustrates the intrinsic advantages of phytochromes
compared to other photoreceptor classes, e.g., their bidirectional
dual-wavelength control enabling instant ON and OFF regulation. In
particular, the long wavelength range of absorption and fluorescence
within the “transparent window” makes phytochromes attractive
for complex applications requiring deep tissue penetration or dual-wavelength
control in combination with blue and UV light-sensing photoreceptors.
In addition to the wide variability of applications employing natural
and engineered phytochromes, we also discuss recent progress in the
development of bilin-based fluorescent proteins.

Abstract:
Engineered DNA will slow the growth of a host cell if it redirects limiting resources or otherwise interferes with homeostasis. Populations of engineered cells can rapidly become dominated by “escape mutants” that evolve to alleviate this burden by inactivating the intended function. Synthetic biologists working with bacteria rely on genetic parts and devices encoded on plasmids, but the burden of different engineered DNA sequences is rarely characterized. We measured how 301 BioBricks on high-copy plasmids affected the growth rate of Escherichia coli . Of these, 59 (19.6%) negatively impacted growth. The burden imposed by engineered DNA is commonly associated with diverting ribosomes or other gene expression factors away from producing endogenous genes that are essential for cellular replication. In line with this expectation, BioBricks exhibiting burden were more likely to contain highly active constitutive promoters and strong ribosome binding sites. By monitoring how much each BioBrick reduced expression of a chromosomal GFP reporter, we found that the burden of most, but not all, BioBricks could be wholly explained by diversion of gene expression resources. Overall, no BioBricks reduced the growth rate of E. coli by >45%, which agreed with a population genetic model that predicts such plasmids should be “unclonable” because escape mutants will take over during growth of a bacterial colony or small laboratory culture from a transformed cell. We made this model available as an interactive web tool for synthetic biology education and added our burden measurements to the iGEM Registry descriptions of each BioBrick.

Title: Predictive design of sigma factor-specific promoters
Authors: Maarten Van Brempt, Jim Clauwaert, Friederike Mey, Michiel Stock, Jo Maertens, Willem Waegeman, Marjan De Mey
Date: 2020-11-16

Abstract:
To engineer synthetic gene circuits, molecular building blocks are developed which can modulate gene expression without interference, mutually or with the host’s cell machinery. As the complexity of gene circuits increases, automated design tools and tailored building blocks to ensure perfect tuning of all components in the network are required. Despite the efforts to develop prediction tools that allow forward engineering of promoter transcription initiation frequency (TIF), such a tool is still lacking. Here, we use promoter libraries of E. coli sigma factor 70 (σ 70 )- and B. subtilis σ B -, σ F - and σ W -dependent promoters to construct prediction models, capable of both predicting promoter TIF and orthogonality of the σ-specific promoters. This is achieved by training a convolutional neural network with high-throughput DNA sequencing data from fluorescence-activated cell sorted promoter libraries. This model functions as the base of the online promoter design tool (ProD), providing tailored promoters for tailored genetic systems.

Title: Synthetic protein-binding DNA sponge as a tool to tune gene expression and mitigate protein toxicity
Authors: Xinyi Wan, Filipe Pinto, Luyang Yu, Baojun Wang
Date: 2020-11-24

Abstract:
Versatile tools for gene expression regulation are vital for engineering gene networks of increasing scales and complexity with bespoke responses. Here, we investigate and repurpose a ubiquitous, indirect gene regulation mechanism from nature, which uses decoy protein-binding DNA sites, named DNA sponge, to modulate target gene expression in Escherichia coli . We show that synthetic DNA sponges can be designed to reshape the response profiles of gene circuits, lending multifaceted tuning capacities including reducing basal leakage by >20-fold, increasing system output amplitude by >130-fold and dynamic range by >70-fold, and mitigating host growth inhibition by >20%. Further, multi-layer DNA sponges for decoying multiple regulatory proteins provide an additive tuning effect on the responses of layered circuits compared to single-layer sponges. Our work shows synthetic DNA sponges offer a simple yet generalizable route to systematically engineer the performance of synthetic gene circuits, expanding the current toolkit for gene regulation with broad potential applications.

Abstract:
Cell-free gene expression (CFE) systems empower synthetic
biologists
to build biological molecules and processes outside of living intact
cells. The foundational principle is that precise, complex biomolecular
transformations can be conducted in purified enzyme or crude cell
lysate systems. This concept circumvents mechanisms that have evolved
to facilitate species survival, bypasses limitations on molecular
transport across the cell wall, and provides a significant departure
from traditional, cell-based processes that rely on microscopic cellular
“reactors.” In addition, cell-free systems are inherently
distributable through freeze-drying, which allows simple distribution
before rehydration at the point-of-use. Furthermore, as cell-free
systems are nonliving, they provide built-in safeguards for biocontainment
without the constraints attendant on genetically modified organisms.
These features have led to a significant increase in the development
and use of CFE systems over the past two decades. Here, we discuss
recent advances in CFE systems and highlight how they are transforming
efforts to build cells, control genetic networks, and manufacture
biobased products.

Abstract:
Advances in molecular and synthetic biology are enabling the engineering of gene drives in insects for disease vector/pest control. Engineered gene drives (that bias their own inheritance) can be designed either to suppress interbreeding target populations or modify them with a new genotype. Depending on the engineered gene drive system, theoretically, a genetic modification of interest could spread through target populations and persist indefinitely, or be restricted in its spread or persistence. While research on engineered gene drives and their applications in insects is advancing at a fast pace, it will take several years for technological developments to move to practical applications for deliberate release into the environment. Some gene drive modified insects ( GDMI s) have been tested experimentally in the laboratory, but none has been assessed in small‐scale confined field trials or in open release trials as yet. There is concern that the deliberate release of GDMI s in the environment may have possible irreversible and unintended consequences. As a proactive measure, the European Food Safety Authority ( EFSA ) has been requested by the European Commission to review whether its previously published guidelines for the risk assessment of genetically modified animals ( EFSA , 2012 and 2013), including insects ( GMI s), are adequate and sufficient for GDMI s, primarily disease vectors, agricultural pests and invasive species, for deliberate release into the environment. Under this mandate, EFSA was not requested to develop risk assessment guidelines for GDMI s. In this Scientific Opinion, the Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms ( GMO ) concludes that EFSA 's guidelines are adequate, but insufficient for the molecular characterisation ( MC ), environmental risk assessment ( ERA ) and post‐market environmental monitoring ( PMEM ) of GDMI s. While the MC , ERA and PMEM of GDMI s can build on the existing risk assessment framework for GMI s that do not contain engineered gene drives, there are specific areas where further guidance is needed for GDMI s.

Date: 2020-02-07

Abstract:
Engineering mammalian cells to carry out sophisticated and customizable genetic programs requires a toolkit of multiple orthogonal and well-characterized transcription factors (TFs). To address this need, we develop the COmposable Mammalian Elements of Transcription (COMET)—an ensemble of TFs and promoters that enable the design and tuning of gene expression to an extent not, to the best of our knowledge, previously possible. COMET currently comprises 44 activating and 12 inhibitory zinc-finger TFs and 83 cognate promoters, combined in a framework that readily accommodates new parts. This system can tune gene expression over three orders of magnitude, provides chemically inducible control of TF activity, and enables single-layer Boolean logic. We also develop a mathematical model that provides mechanistic insights into COMET performance characteristics. Altogether, COMET enables the design and construction of customizable genetic programs in mammalian cells.

Title: Rvb1/Rvb2 proteins couple transcription and translation during glucose starvation
Authors: Yang S Chen, Wanfu Hou, Sharon Tracy, Alex T Harvey, Vince Harjono, Fan Xu, James J Moresco, John R Yates, Brian M Zid, Alan G Hinnebusch
Date: 2022-09-15

Abstract:
During times of unpredictable stress, organisms must adapt their gene expression to maximize survival. Along with changes in transcription, one conserved means of gene regulation during conditions that quickly repress translation is the formation of cytoplasmic phase-separated mRNP granules such as P-bodies and stress granules. Previously, we identified that distinct steps in gene expression can be coupled during glucose starvation as promoter sequences in the nucleus are able to direct the subcellular localization and translatability of mRNAs in the cytosol. Here, we report that Rvb1 and Rvb2, conserved ATPase proteins implicated as protein assembly chaperones and chromatin remodelers, were enriched at the promoters and mRNAs of genes involved in alternative glucose metabolism pathways that we previously found to be transcriptionally upregulated but translationally downregulated during glucose starvation in yeast. Engineered Rvb1/Rvb2-binding on mRNAs was sufficient to sequester mRNAs into mRNP granules and repress their translation. Additionally, this Rvb tethering to the mRNA drove further transcriptional upregulation of the target genes. Further, we found that depletion of Rvb2 caused decreased alternative glucose metabolism gene mRNA induction, but upregulation of protein synthesis during glucose starvation. Overall, our results point to Rvb1/Rvb2 coupling transcription, mRNA granular localization, and translatability of mRNAs during glucose starvation. This Rvb-mediated rapid gene regulation could potentially serve as an efficient recovery plan for cells after stress removal.

Title: The Promoter Toolbox for Recombinant Gene Expression in Trichoderma reesei
Authors: Elisabeth Fitz, Franziska Wanka, Bernhard Seiboth
Date: 2018-10-11

Abstract:
The ascomycete Trichoderma reesei is one of the main fungal producers of cellulases and xylanases based on its high production capacity. Its enzymes are applied in food, feed, and textile industry or in lignocellulose hydrolysis in biofuel and biorefinery industry. Over the last years, the demand to expand the molecular toolbox for T. reesei to facilitate genetic engineering and improve the production of heterologous proteins grew. An important instrument to modify the expression of key genes are promoters to initiate and control their transcription. To date, the most commonly used promoter for T. reesei is the strong inducible promoter of the main cellobiohydrolase cel7a . Beside this one, there is a number of alternative inducible promoters derived from other cellulase- and xylanase encoding genes and a few constitutive promoters. With the advances in genomics and transcriptomics the identification of new constitutive and tunable promoters with different expression strength was simplified. In this review, we will discuss new developments in the field of promoters and compare their advantages and disadvantages. Synthetic expression systems constitute a new option to control gene expression and build up complex gene circuits. Therefore, we will address common structural features of promoters and describe options for promoter engineering and synthetic design of promoters. The availability of well-characterized gene expression control tools is essential for the analysis of gene function, detection of bottlenecks in gene networks and yield increase for biotechnology applications.

Title: A coarse-grained bacterial cell model for resource-aware analysis and design of synthetic gene circuits
Authors: Kirill Sechkar, Harrison Steel, Giansimone Perrino, Guy-Bart Stan
Date: 2024-03-04

Abstract:
Within a cell, synthetic and native genes compete for expression machinery, influencing cellular process dynamics through resource couplings. Models that simplify competitive resource binding kinetics can guide the design of strategies for countering these couplings. However, in bacteria resource availability and cell growth rate are interlinked, which complicates resource-aware biocircuit design. Capturing this interdependence requires coarse-grained bacterial cell models that balance accurate representation of metabolic regulation against simplicity and interpretability. We propose a coarse-grained E. coli cell model that combines the ease of simplified resource coupling analysis with appreciation of bacterial growth regulation mechanisms and the processes relevant for biocircuit design. Reliably capturing known growth phenomena, it provides a unifying explanation to disparate empirical relations between growth and synthetic gene expression. Considering a biomolecular controller that makes cell-wide ribosome availability robust to perturbations, we showcase our model’s usefulness in numerically prototyping biocircuits and deriving analytical relations for design guidance.

Date: 2019-04-18

Abstract:
G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling is the primary method eukaryotes use to respond to specific cues in their environment. However, the relationship between stimulus and response for each GPCR is difficult to predict due to diversity in natural signal transduction architecture and expression. Using genome engineering in yeast, we constructed an insulated, modular GPCR signal transduction system to study how the response to stimuli can be predictably tuned using synthetic tools. We delineated the contributions of a minimal set of key components via computational and experimental refactoring, identifying simple design principles for rationally tuning the dose response. Using five different GPCRs, we demonstrate how this enables cells and consortia to be engineered to respond to desired concentrations of peptides, metabolites, and hormones relevant to human health. This work enables rational tuning of cell sensing while providing a framework to guide reprogramming of GPCR-based signaling in other systems.

Title: A Synthetic Cumate-Inducible Promoter for Graded and Homogenous Gene Expression in Pseudomonas aeruginosa
Authors: Alexander Klotz, Andreas Kaczmarczyk, Urs Jenal
Date: 2023-05-18

Abstract:
Inducible gene expression systems are powerful genetic tools to study bacterial physiology, probing essential and toxic gene functions, gene dosage effects, and overexpression phenotypes. For the opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa , dedicated inducible gene expression systems are scarce. In the current study, we developed a minimal synthetic 4-isopropylbenzoic acid (cumate)-inducible promoter, called P QJ , that is tunable over several orders of magnitude. This was achieved by combining semirandomized housekeeping promoter libraries and control elements from the Pseudomonas putida strain F1 cym / cmt system with powerful fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to select functionally optimized variants. Using flow cytometry and live-cell fluorescence microscopy, we demonstrate that P QJ responds rapidly and homogenously to the inducer cumate in a graded manner at the single-cell level. P QJ and cumate are orthogonal to the frequently used isopropyl β- d -thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)-regulated lacI q -P tac expression system. The modular design of the cumate-inducible expression cassette together with the FACS-based enrichment strategy presented here facilitates portability, thus serving as a blueprint for the development of tailored gene expression systems for a wide range of bacteria. IMPORTANCE Reverse genetics is a powerful approach to study bacterial physiology and behavior by relying on well-developed genetic tools, such as inducible promoters. For the human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa , well-characterized inducible promoters are scarce. In the current work, we used a synthetic biology-based approach to develop a cumate-inducible promoter for P. aeruginosa , termed P QJ , that shows excellent induction properties at the single-cell level. This genetic tool provides the means for qualitative and quantitative gene function studies describing P. aeruginosa ’s physiology and virulence in vitro and in vivo . Because this synthetic approach to constructing species-specific inducible promoters is portable, it can serve as a blueprint for similar tailored gene expression systems in bacteria largely lacking such tools, including, for example, representatives of the human microbiota.

Title: Harnessing the central dogma for stringent multi-level control of gene expression
Authors: F. Veronica Greco, Amir Pandi, Tobias J. Erb, Claire S. Grierson, Thomas E. Gorochowski
Date: 2021-03-19

Abstract:
Strictly controlled inducible gene expression is crucial when engineering biological systems where even tiny amounts of a protein have a large impact on function or host cell viability. In these cases, leaky protein production must be avoided, but without affecting the achievable range of expression. Here, we demonstrate how the central dogma offers a simple solution to this challenge. By simultaneously regulating transcription and translation, we show how basal expression of an inducible system can be reduced, with little impact on the maximum expression rate. Using this approach, we create several stringent expression systems displaying >1000-fold change in their output after induction and show how multi-level regulation can suppress transcriptional noise and create digital-like switches between ‘on’ and ‘off’ states. These tools will aid those working with toxic genes or requiring precise regulation and propagation of cellular signals, plus illustrate the value of more diverse regulatory designs for synthetic biology.

Title: Sense-and-Respond Payload Delivery Using a Novel Antigen-Inducible
Promoter Improves Suboptimal CAR-T Activation
Authors: Tingxi Guo, Dacheng Ma, Timothy K. Lu
Date: 2022-03-22

Abstract:
Chimeric antigen
receptor (CAR)-T cell therapies demonstrate the
clinical potential of lymphocytes engineered with synthetic properties.
However, CAR-T cells are ineffective in most solid tumors, partly
due to inadequate activation of the infused lymphocytes at the site
of malignancy. To selectively enhance antitumor efficacy without exacerbating
off-target toxicities, CAR-T cells can be engineered to preferentially
deliver immunostimulatory payloads in tumors. Here, we report a novel
antigen-inducible promoter for conditional payload expression in primary
human T cells. In therapeutic T cell models, the novel NR4A-based
promoter induced higher reporter gene expression than the conventional
NFAT-based promoter under weakly immunogenic conditions, where payload
expression is most needed. Minimal activity was detected from the
inducible promoters in the absence of antigen and after withdrawal
of stimulation. As a functional proof-of-concept, we used the NR4A-based
promoter to express cytokines in an antimesothelin CAR-T model with
suboptimal stimulation and observed improved proliferation compared
to T cells engineered with the conventional NFAT promoter or CAR alone.
Our system achieves CAR-directed payload expression under weakly immunogenic
conditions and could enable the next generation of cell therapies
with enhanced antitumor efficacy.

Title: Engineered Phage Enables Efficient Control of Gene Expression upon Infection of the Host Cell
Authors: Ting Wei, Wangsheng Lai, Qian Chen, Chenjian Sun
Date: 2024-12-30

Abstract:
Recently, we developed a spatial phage-assisted continuous evolution (SPACE) system. This system utilizes chemotaxis coupled with the growth of motile bacteria during their spatial range expansion in soft agar to provide fresh host cells for iterative phage infection and selection pressure for preserving evolved genes of interest carried by phage mutants. Controllable mutagenesis activated only in a subpopulation of the migrating cells is essential in this system to efficiently generate mutated progeny phages from which desired individuals are selected during the directed evolution process. But, the widely adopted small molecule-dependent inducible system could hardly fulfill this purpose because it always affects all cells homogeneously. In this study, we developed a phage infection-induced gene expression system using modified Escherichia coli ( E. coli ) phage shock protein operon or sigma factors from Bacillus subtilis . Results showed that this system enabled efficient control of gene expression upon phage infection with dynamic output ranges from small to large using combinations of different engineered phages and corresponding promoters. This system was incorporated into SPACE to function as a phage infection-induced mutagenesis module and successfully facilitated the evolution of T7 RNA polymerase, which generated diverse mutants with altered promoter recognition specificity. We expect that phage infection-induced gene expression system could be further extended to more applications involving partial induction in a portion of a population and targeted induction in specific strains among a mixed bacterial community, which provides an important complement to small molecule-dependent inducible systems.

Title: Engineering a synthetic gene circuit for high-performance inducible expression in mammalian systems
Authors: Giuliano De Carluccio, Virginia Fusco, Diego di Bernardo
Date: 2024-04-17

Abstract:
Inducible gene expression systems can be used to control the expression of a gene of interest by means of a small-molecule. One of the most common designs involves engineering a small-molecule responsive transcription factor (TF) and its cognate promoter, which often results in a compromise between minimal uninduced background expression (leakiness) and maximal induced expression. Here, we focus on an alternative strategy using quantitative synthetic biology to mitigate leakiness while maintaining high expression, without modifying neither the TF nor the promoter. Through mathematical modelling and experimental validations, we design the CASwitch, a mammalian synthetic gene circuit based on combining two well-known network motifs: the Coherent Feed-Forward Loop (CFFL) and the Mutual Inhibition (MI). The CASwitch combines the CRISPR-Cas endoribonuclease CasRx with the state-of-the-art Tet-On3G inducible gene system to achieve high performances. To demonstrate the potentialities of the CASwitch, we apply it to three different scenarios: enhancing a whole-cell biosensor, controlling expression of a toxic gene and inducible production of Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV) vectors.

Title: Generating dynamic gene expression patterns without the need for regulatory circuits
Authors: Sahil B. Shah, Alexis M. Hill, Claus O. Wilke, Adam J. Hockenberry, William Ott, William Ott, William Ott
Date: 2022

Abstract:
Synthetic biology has successfully advanced our ability to design and implement complex, time-varying genetic circuits to control the expression of recombinant proteins. However, these circuits typically require the production of regulatory genes whose only purpose is to coordinate expression of other genes. When designing very small genetic constructs, such as viral genomes, we may want to avoid introducing such auxiliary gene products while nevertheless encoding complex expression dynamics. To this end, here we demonstrate that varying only the placement and strengths of promoters, terminators, and RNase cleavage sites in a computational model of a bacteriophage genome is sufficient to achieve solutions to a variety of basic gene expression patterns. We discover these genetic solutions by computationally evolving genomes to reproduce desired gene expression time-course data. Our approach shows that non-trivial patterns can be evolved, including patterns where the relative ordering of genes by abundance changes over time. We find that some patterns are easier to evolve than others, and comparable expression patterns can be achieved via different genetic architectures. Our work opens up a novel avenue to genome engineering via fine-tuning the balance of gene expression and gene degradation rates.

Authors: Bingyin Peng, Naga Chandra Bandari, Zeyu Lu, Christopher B. Howard, Colin Scott, Matt Trau, Geoff Dumsday, Claudia E. Vickers
Date: 2022-02-16

Abstract:
Temporal control of heterologous pathway expression is critical to achieve optimal efficiency in microbial metabolic engineering. The broadly-used GAL promoter system for engineered yeast ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae ) suffers from several drawbacks; specifically, unintended induction during laboratory development, and unintended repression in industrial production applications, which decreases overall production capacity. Eukaryotic synthetic circuits have not been well examined to address these problems. Here, we explore a modularised engineering method to deploy new genetic circuits applicable for expanding the control of GAL promoter-driven heterologous pathways in S. cerevisiae . Trans - and cis - modules, including eukaryotic trans -activating-and-repressing mechanisms, were characterised to provide new and better tools for circuit design. A eukaryote-like tetracycline-mediated circuit that delivers stringent repression was engineered to minimise metabolic burden during strain development and maintenance. This was combined with a novel 37 °C induction circuit to relief glucose-mediated repression on the GAL promoter during the bioprocess. This delivered a 44% increase in production of the terpenoid nerolidol, to 2.54 g L −1 in flask cultivation. These negative/positive transcriptional regulatory circuits expand global strategies of metabolic control to facilitate laboratory maintenance and for industry applications.

Abstract:
The human microbiome is composed of a collection of dynamic
microbial
communities that inhabit various anatomical locations in the body.
Accordingly, the coevolution of the microbiome with the host has resulted
in these communities playing a profound role in promoting human health.
Consequently, perturbations in the human microbiome can cause or exacerbate
several diseases. In this Review, we present our current understanding
of the relationship between human health and disease development,
focusing on the microbiomes found across the digestive, respiratory,
urinary, and reproductive systems as well as the skin. We further
discuss various strategies by which the composition and function of
the human microbiome can be modulated to exert a therapeutic effect
on the host. Finally, we examine technologies such as multiomics approaches
and cellular reprogramming of microbes that can enable significant
advancements in microbiome research and engineering.

Date: 2022-05-26

Abstract:
The emerging plant synthetic metabolic engineering has been exhibiting great promise to produce either value-added metabolites or therapeutic proteins. However, promoters for plant pathway engineering are generally selected empirically. The quantitative characterization of plant-based promoters is essential for optimal control of gene expression in plant chassis. Here, we used N. benthamiana leaves and BY2 suspension cells to quantitatively characterize a library of plant promoters by transient expression of firefly/ Renilla luciferase. We validated the dual-luciferase reporter system by examining the correlation between reporter protein and mRNA levels. In addition, we investigated the effects of terminator–promoter combinations on gene expression and found that the combinations of promoters and terminators resulted in a 326-fold difference between the strongest and weakest performance, as reflected in reporter gene expression. As a proof of concept, we used the quantitatively characterized promoters to engineer the betalain pathway in N. benthamiana . Seven selected plant promoters with different expression strengths were used orthogonally to express CYP76AD1 and DODA, resulting in a final betalain production range of 6.0–362.4 μ g/g fresh weight. Our systematic approach not only demonstrates the various intensities of multiple promoter sequences in N. benthamiana and BY2 cells but also adds to the toolbox of plant promoters for plant engineering.

Abstract:
Synthetic biology seeks to redesign biological systems to perform novel functions in a predictable manner. Recent advances in bacterial and mammalian cell engineering include the development of cells that function in biological samples or within the body as minimally invasive diagnostics or theranostics for the real-time regulation of complex diseased states. Ex vivo and in vivo cell-based biosensors and therapeutics have been developed to target a wide range of diseases including cancer, microbiome dysbiosis and autoimmune and metabolic diseases. While probiotic therapies have advanced to clinical trials, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies have received regulatory approval, exemplifying the clinical potential of cellular therapies. This Review discusses preclinical and clinical applications of bacterial and mammalian sensing and drug delivery platforms as well as the underlying biological designs that could enable new classes of cell diagnostics and therapeutics. Additionally, we describe challenges that must be overcome for more rapid and safer clinical use of engineered systems.

Date: 2023-02-11

Abstract:
Cyanobacteria are photosynthetic microorganisms capable of using solar energy to convert CO 2 and H 2 O into O 2 and energy-rich organic compounds, thus enabling sustainable production of a wide range of bio-products. More and more strains of cyanobacteria are identified that show great promise as cell platforms for the generation of bioproducts. However, strain development is still required to optimize their biosynthesis and increase titers for industrial applications. This review describes the most well-known, newest and most promising strains available to the community and gives an overview of current cyanobacterial biotechnology and the latest innovative strategies used for engineering cyanobacteria. We summarize advanced synthetic biology tools for modulating gene expression and their use in metabolic pathway engineering to increase the production of value-added compounds, such as terpenoids, fatty acids and sugars, to provide a go-to source for scientists starting research in cyanobacterial metabolic engineering.

Title: Surveying the Genetic Design Space for Transcription Factor-Based Metabolite Biosensors: Synthetic Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid and Propionate Biosensors in E. coli Nissle 1917
Authors: Matthew Lebovich, Lauren B. Andrews
Date: 2022-08-25

Abstract:
Engineered probiotic bacteria have been proposed as a next-generation strategy for noninvasively detecting biomarkers in the gastrointestinal tract and interrogating the gut-brain axis. A major challenge impeding the implementation of this strategy has been the difficulty to engineer the necessary whole-cell biosensors. Creation of transcription factor-based biosensors in a clinically-relevant strain often requires significant tuning of the genetic parts and gene expression to achieve the dynamic range and sensitivity required. Here, we propose an approach to efficiently engineer transcription-factor based metabolite biosensors that uses a design prototyping construct to quickly assay the gene expression design space and identify an optimal genetic design. We demonstrate this approach using the probiotic bacterium Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) and two neuroactive gut metabolites: the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and the short-chain fatty acid propionate. The EcN propionate sensor, utilizing the PrpR transcriptional activator from E. coli , has a large 59-fold dynamic range and >500-fold increased sensitivity that matches biologically-relevant concentrations . Our EcN GABA biosensor uses the GabR transcriptional repressor from Bacillus subtilis and a synthetic GabR-regulated promoter created in this study. This work reports the first known synthetic microbial whole-cell biosensor for GABA, which has an observed 138-fold activation in EcN at biologically-relevant concentrations. Using this rapid design prototyping approach, we engineer highly functional biosensors for specified in vivo metabolite concentrations that achieve a large dynamic range and high output promoter activity upon activation. This strategy may be broadly useful for accelerating the engineering of metabolite biosensors for living diagnostics and therapeutics.

Abstract:
The expression of genes of interest (GOI) can be initiated by providing external stimuli such as temperature shifts and light irradiation. The application of thermal or light stimuli triggers structural changes in stimuli-sensitive biomolecules within the cell, thereby inducing or repressing gene expression. Over the past two decades, several groups have reported genetic circuits that use natural or engineered stimuli-sensitive modules to manipulate gene expression. Here, we summarize versatile strategies of thermosensors and light-driven systems for the conditional expression of GOI in bacterial hosts.

Authors: Jefferson M. Smith, Denis Hartmann, Michael J. Booth
Date: 2023-07-06

Abstract:
Gene-expressing compartments assembled from simple, modular parts, are a versatile platform for creating minimal synthetic cells with life-like functions. By incorporating gene regulatory motifs into their encapsulated DNA templates, in situ gene expression and, thereby, synthetic cell function can be controlled according to specific stimuli. In this work, cell-free protein synthesis within synthetic cells was controlled using light by encoding genes of interest on light-activated DNA templates. Light-activated DNA contained a photocleavable blockade within the T7 promoter region that tightly repressed transcription until the blocking groups were removed with ultraviolet light. In this way, synthetic cells were activated remotely, in a spatiotemporally controlled manner. By applying this strategy to the expression of an acyl homoserine lactone synthase, BjaI, quorum-sensing-based communication between synthetic cells and bacteria was controlled with light. This work provides a framework for the remote-controlled production and delivery of small molecules from nonliving matter to living matter, with applications in biology and medicine.

Abstract:
Predicting the evolution of engineered cell populations is a highly sought-after goal in biotechnology. While models of evolutionary dynamics are far from new, their application to synthetic systems is scarce where the vast combination of genetic parts and regulatory elements creates a unique challenge. To address this gap, we here-in present a framework that allows one to connect the DNA design of varied genetic devices with mutation spread in a growing cell population. Users can specify the functional parts of their system and the degree of mutation heterogeneity to explore, after which our model generates host-aware transition dynamics between different mutation phenotypes over time. We show how our framework can be used to generate insightful hypotheses across broad applications, from how a device’s components can be tweaked to optimise long-term protein yield and genetic shelf life, to generating new design paradigms for gene regulatory networks that improve their functionality.

Title: Engineered CRISPRa enables programmable eukaryote-like gene activation in bacteria
Authors: Yang Liu, Xinyi Wan, Baojun Wang
Date: 2019-08-26

Abstract:
Transcriptional regulation by nuclease-deficient CRISPR/Cas is a popular and valuable tool for routine control of gene expression. CRISPR interference in bacteria can be reliably achieved with high efficiencies. Yet, options for CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) remained limited in flexibility and activity because they relied on σ 70 promoters. Here we report a eukaryote-like bacterial CRISPRa system based on σ 54 -dependent promoters, which supports long distance, and hence multi-input regulation with high dynamic ranges. Our CRISPRa device can activate σ 54 -dependent promoters with biotechnology relevance in non-model bacteria. It also supports orthogonal gene regulation on multiple levels. Combining our CRISPRa with dxCas9 further expands flexibility in DNA targeting, and boosts dynamic ranges into regimes that enable construction of cascaded CRISPRa circuits. Application-wise, we construct a reusable scanning platform for readily optimizing metabolic pathways without library reconstructions. This eukaryote-like CRISPRa system is therefore a powerful and versatile synthetic biology tool for diverse research and industrial applications.

Title: CRISPR/Cas9-Mediated Multi-Locus Promoter Engineering in ery Cluster to Improve Erythromycin Production in Saccharopolyspora erythraea
Authors: Xuemei Zhang, Yan Wang, Yue Zhang, Meng Wang
Date: 2023-02-28

Abstract:
Erythromycins are a group of macrolide antibiotics produced by Saccharopolyspora erythraea . Erythromycin biosynthesis, which is a long pathway composed of a series of biochemical reactions, is precisely controlled by the type I polyketide synthases and accessary tailoring enzymes encoded by ery cluster. In the previous work, we have characterized that six genes representing extremely low transcription levels, SACE_0716 - SACE_0720 and SACE_0731 , played important roles in limiting erythromycin biosynthesis in the wild-type strain S. erythraea NRRL 23338. In this study, to relieve the potential bottlenecks of erythromycin biosynthesis, we fine-tuned the expression of each key limiting ery gene by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated multi-locus promoter engineering. The native promoters were replaced with different heterologous ones of various strengths, generating ten engineered strains, whose erythromycin productions were 2.8- to 6.0-fold improved compared with that of the wild-type strain. Additionally, the optimal expression pattern of multiple rate-limiting genes and preferred engineering strategies of each locus for maximizing erythromycin yield were also summarized. Collectively, our work lays a foundation for the overall engineering of ery cluster to further improve erythromycin production. The experience of balancing multiple rate-limiting factors within a cluster is also promising to be applied in other actinomycetes to efficiently produce value-added natural products.

Title: Toward Tightly Tuned Gene Expression Following Lentiviral Vector Transduction
Authors: Audrey Page, Floriane Fusil, François-Loïc Cosset
Date: 2020-12-11

Abstract:
Lentiviral vectors are versatile tools for gene delivery purposes. While in the earlier versions of retroviral vectors, transgene expression was controlled by the long terminal repeats (LTRs), the latter generations of vectors, including those derived from lentiviruses, incorporate internal constitutive or regulated promoters in order to regulate transgene expression. This allows to temporally and/or quantitatively control transgene expression, which is required for many applications such as for clinical applications, when transgene expression is required in specific tissues and at a specific timing. Here we review the main systems that have been developed for transgene regulated expression following lentiviral gene transfer. First, the induction of gene expression can be triggered either by external or by internal cues. Indeed, these regulated vector systems may harbor promoters inducible by exogenous stimuli, such as small molecules (e.g., antibiotics) or temperature variations, offering the possibility to tune rapidly transgene expression in case of adverse events. Second, expression can be indirectly adjusted by playing on inserted sequence copies, for instance by gene excision. Finally, synthetic networks can be developed to sense specific endogenous signals and trigger defined responses after information processing. Regulatable lentiviral vectors (LV)-mediated transgene expression systems have been widely used in basic research to uncover gene functions or to temporally reprogram cells. Clinical applications are also under development to induce therapeutic molecule secretion or to implement safety switches. Such regulatable approaches are currently focusing much attention and will benefit from the development of other technologies in order to launch autonomously controlled systems.

Abstract:
Most of the gene expression systems available for Gram‐negative bacteria are afflicted by relatively high levels of basal (i.e. leaky) expression of the target gene(s). This occurrence affects the system dynamics, ultimately reducing the output and productivity of engineered pathways and synthetic circuits. In order to circumvent this problem, we have designed a novel expression system based on the well‐known XylS/ Pm transcriptional regulator/promoter pair from the soil bacterium Pseudomonas putida mt‐2, in which the key functional elements are physically decoupled. By integrating the xylS gene into the chromosome of the platform strain KT2440, while placing the Pm promoter into a set of standard plasmid vectors, the inducibility of the system (i.e. the output difference between the induced and uninduced state) improved up to 170‐fold. We further combined this modular system with an extra layer of post‐translational control by means of conditional proteolysis. In this setup, the target gene is tagged with a synthetic motif dictating protein degradation. When the system features were characterized using the monomeric superfolder GFP as a model protein, the basal levels of fluorescence were brought down to zero (i.e. below the limit of detection). In all, these novel expression systems constitute an alternative tool to altogether suppress leaky gene expression, and they can be easily adapted to other vector formats and plugged‐in into different Gram‐negative bacterial species at the user's will.

Abstract:
Synthetic gene networks in mammalian cells are currently limited to either protein-based transcription factors or RNA-based regulators. Here, we demonstrate a regulatory approach based on circular single-stranded DNA (Css DNA), which can be used as an efficient expression vector with switchable activity, enabling gene regulation in mammalian cells. The Css DNA is transformed into its double-stranded form via DNA replication and used as vectors encoding a variety of different proteins in a wide range of cell lines as well as in mice. The rich repository of DNA nanotechnology allows to use sort single-stranded DNA effectors to fold Css DNA into DNA nanostructures of different complexity, leading the gene expression to programmable inhibition and subsequently re-activation via toehold-mediated strand displacement. The regulatory strategy from Css DNA can thus expand the molecular toolbox for the realization of synthetic regulatory networks with potential applications in genetic diagnosis and gene therapy.

Title: Toolbox of Characterized Genetic Parts for Staphylococcus aureus
Authors: Stephen

Date: 2023-12-08

Abstract:
Staphylococcus
aureus is an important
clinical bacterium prevalent in human-associated microbiomes and the
cause of many diseases. However, S. aureus has been intractable to synthetic biology approaches due to limited
characterized genetic parts for this nonmodel Gram-positive bacterium.
Moreover, genetic manipulation of S. aureus has relied on cumbersome and inefficient cloning strategies. Here,
we report the first standardized genetic parts toolbox for S. aureus , which includes characterized promoters,
ribosome binding sites, terminators, and plasmid replicons from a
variety of bacteria for precise control of gene expression. We established
a standard relative expression unit (REU) for S. aureus using a plasmid reference and characterized genetic parts in standardized
REUs using S. aureus ATCC 12600. We
constructed promoter and terminator part plasmids that are compatible
with an efficient Type IIS DNA assembly strategy to effectively build
multipart DNA constructs. A library of 24 constitutive promoters was
built and characterized in S. aureus , which showed a 380-fold activity range. This promoter library was
also assayed in Bacillus subtilis (122-fold
activity range) to demonstrate the transferability of the constitutive
promoters between these Gram-positive bacteria. By applying an iterative
design-build-test-learn cycle, we demonstrated the use of our toolbox
for the rational design and engineering of a tetracycline sensor in S. aureus using the P Xyl-TetO aTc-inducible
promoter that achieved 25.8-fold induction. This toolbox greatly expands
the growing number of genetic parts for Gram-positive bacteria and
will allow researchers to leverage synthetic biology approaches to
study and engineer cellular processes in S. aureus .

Authors: Inbal Vaknin, Or Willinger, Jonathan Mandl, Hadar Heuberger, Dan Ben-Ami, Yi Zeng, Sarah Goldberg, Yaron Orenstein, Roee Amit
Date: 2024-03-16

Abstract:
We demonstrate a transcriptional regulatory design algorithm that can boost expression in yeast and mammalian cell lines. The system consists of a simplified transcriptional architecture composed of a minimal core promoter and a synthetic upstream regulatory region (sURS) composed of up to three motifs selected from a list of 41 motifs conserved in the eukaryotic lineage. The sURS system was first characterized using an oligo-library containing 189,990 variants. We validate the resultant expression model using a set of 43 unseen sURS designs. The validation sURS experiments indicate that a generic set of grammar rules for boosting and attenuation may exist in yeast cells. Finally, we demonstrate that this generic set of grammar rules functions similarly in mammalian CHO-K1 and HeLa cells. Consequently, our work provides a design algorithm for boosting the expression of promoters used for expressing industrially relevant proteins in yeast and mammalian cell lines.

Date: 2024-08-27

Abstract:
Therapeutic protein engineering has revolutionized medicine by enabling the development of highly specific and potent treatments for a wide range of diseases. This review examines recent advances in computational and experimental approaches for engineering improved protein therapeutics. Key areas of focus include antibody engineering, enzyme replacement therapies, and cytokine-based drugs. Computational methods like structure-based design, machine learning integration, and protein language models have dramatically enhanced our ability to predict protein properties and guide engineering efforts. Experimental techniques such as directed evolution and rational design approaches continue to evolve, with high-throughput methods accelerating the discovery process. Applications of these methods have led to breakthroughs in affinity maturation, bispecific antibodies, enzyme stability enhancement, and the development of conditionally active cytokines. Emerging approaches like intracellular protein delivery, stimulus-responsive proteins, and de novo designed therapeutic proteins offer exciting new possibilities. However, challenges remain in predicting in vivo behavior, scalable manufacturing, immunogenicity mitigation, and targeted delivery. Addressing these challenges will require continued integration of computational and experimental methods, as well as a deeper understanding of protein behavior in complex physiological environments. As the field advances, we can anticipate increasingly sophisticated and effective protein therapeutics for treating human diseases.

Title: Intelligent host engineering for metabolic flux optimisation in biotechnology
Authors: Lachlan J. Munro, Douglas B. Kell
Date: 2021-10-29

Abstract:
Optimising the function of a protein of length N amino acids by directed evolution involves navigating a ‘search space’ of possible sequences of some 20 N . Optimising the expression levels of P proteins that materially affect host performance, each of which might also take 20 (logarithmically spaced) values, implies a similar search space of 20 P . In this combinatorial sense, then, the problems of directed protein evolution and of host engineering are broadly equivalent. In practice, however, they have different means for avoiding the inevitable difficulties of implementation. The spare capacity exhibited in metabolic networks implies that host engineering may admit substantial increases in flux to targets of interest. Thus, we rehearse the relevant issues for those wishing to understand and exploit those modern genome-wide host engineering tools and thinking that have been designed and developed to optimise fluxes towards desirable products in biotechnological processes, with a focus on microbial systems. The aim throughput is ‘making such biology predictable’. Strategies have been aimed at both transcription and translation, especially for regulatory processes that can affect multiple targets. However, because there is a limit on how much protein a cell can produce, increasing k cat in selected targets may be a better strategy than increasing protein expression levels for optimal host engineering.

Title: Unraveling the start element and regulatory divergence of core promoters across the domain bacteria
Authors: Syue-Ting Kuo, Joshua Kevin Chang, Clara Chang, Wei-Yi Shen, Christine Hsu, Sheng-Wen Lai, Hsin-Hung David Chou
Date: 2025-11-26

Abstract:
Core promoters comprise multiple elements whose interaction with RNA polymerase initiates transcription. Despite decades of research, substantial sequence and length variation of promoter elements has hindered efforts to elucidate their function and the evolutionary diversity of transcriptional regulation. Combining massively parallel assays, biophysical modeling, and functional validation, we systematically dissected the promoter architecture upstream of experimentally determined transcription start sites in 49 phylogenetically diverse bacterial genomes (GC content: 27.8%–72.1%). We identified a conserved 3-bp promoter element, termed “start,” which dictates transcription start site selection and enhances transcription. We uncovered a four-region organization within the variable spacer element, whose sequence composition modulates transcription by up to 600-fold. We showed that the discriminator element is conserved in Terrabacteria but diverse in Gracilicutes, the two major bacterial clades. High discriminator sequence diversity in Gracilicutes likely reflects diversifying evolution, enabling promoter-encoded regulation to orchestrate global gene expression in response to growth rate changes. Together, our findings reveal broad conservation of bacterial promoter organization while highlighting regulatory divergence of promoter elements and RNA polymerase between Terrabacteria and Gracilicutes. Sequence and functional similarities between bacterial promoter elements and their archaeal and eukaryotic counterparts further suggest a shared evolutionary origin of promoter architecture.

Title: Directed evolution of colE1 plasmid replication compatibility: a fast tractable tunable model for investigating biological orthogonality
Authors: Santiago Chaillou, Pinelopi-Eleftheria Stamou, Leticia L Torres, Ana B Riesco, Warren Hazelton, Vitor B Pinheiro
Date: 2022-09-09

Abstract:
Plasmids of the ColE1 family are among the most frequently used in molecular biology. They were adopted early for many biotechnology applications, and as models to study plasmid biology. Their mechanism of replication is well understood, involving specific interactions between a plasmid encoded sense-antisense gene pair (RNAI and RNAII). Due to such mechanism, two plasmids with the same origin cannot be stably maintained in cells—a process known as incompatibility. While mutations in RNAI and RNAII can make colE1 more compatible, there has been no systematic effort to engineer new compatible colE1 origins, which could bypass technical design constraints for multi-plasmid applications. Here, we show that by diversifying loop regions in RNAI (and RNAII), it is possible to select new viable colE1 origins compatible with the wild-type one. We demonstrate that sequence divergence is not sufficient to enable compatibility and pairwise interactions are not an accurate guide for higher order interactions. We identify potential principles to engineer plasmid copy number independently from other regulatory strategies and we propose plasmid compatibility as a tractable model to study biological orthogonality.

Title: A Generative Neural Network for Maximizing Fitness and Diversity of Synthetic DNA and Protein Sequences
Authors: Johannes Linder, Nicholas Bogard, Alexander B. Rosenberg, Georg Seelig
Date: 2020-06-25

Abstract:
Engineering gene and protein sequences with defined functional properties is a major goal of synthetic biology. Deep neural network models, together with gradient ascent-style optimization, show promise for sequence design. The generated sequences can however get stuck in local minima and often have low diversity. Here, we develop deep exploration networks (DENs), a class of activation-maximizing generative models, which minimize the cost of a neural network fitness predictor by gradient descent. By penalizing any two generated patterns on the basis of a similarity metric, DENs explicitly maximize sequence diversity. To avoid drifting into low-confidence regions of the predictor, we incorporate variational autoencoders to maintain the likelihood ratio of generated sequences. Using DENs, we engineered polyadenylation signals with more than 10-fold higher selection odds than the best gradient ascent-generated patterns, identified splice regulatory sequences predicted to result in highly differential splicing between cell lines, and improved on state-of-the-art results for protein design tasks.

Authors: Douglas McCloskey, Sibei Xu, Troy E. Sandberg, Elizabeth Brunk, Ying Hefner, Richard Szubin, Adam M. Feist, Bernhard O. Palsson
Date: 2018-09-18

Abstract:
Biological regulatory network architectures are multi-scale in their function and can adaptively acquire new functions. Gene knockout (KO) experiments provide an established experimental approach not just for studying gene function, but also for unraveling regulatory networks in which a gene and its gene product are involved. Here we study the regulatory architecture of Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 by applying adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) to metabolic gene KO strains. Multi-omic analysis reveal a common overall schema describing the process of adaptation whereby perturbations in metabolite concentrations lead regulatory networks to produce suboptimal states, whose function is subsequently altered and re-optimized through acquisition of mutations during ALE. These results indicate that metabolite levels, through metabolite-transcription factor interactions, have a dominant role in determining the function of a multi-scale regulatory architecture that has been molded by evolution.

Abstract:
Messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines offer an adaptable and scalable platform for cancer immunotherapy, requiring optimal design to elicit a robust and targeted immune response. Recent advancements in bioinformatics and artificial intelligence (AI) have significantly enhanced the design, prediction, and optimization of mRNA vaccines. This paper reviews technologies that streamline mRNA vaccine development, from genomic sequencing to lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulation. We discuss how accurate predictions of neoantigen structures guide the design of mRNA sequences that effectively target immune and cancer cells. Furthermore, we examine AI-driven approaches that optimize mRNA-LNP formulations, enhancing delivery and stability. These technological innovations not only improve vaccine design but also enhance pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, offering promising avenues for personalized cancer immunotherapy.

Abstract:
A consistent area of interest since the beginning of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has been the sequence composition of the virus and how it has changed over time. Many resources have been developed for the storage and analysis of SARS-CoV-2 data, such as GISAID (Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data), NCBI, Nextstrain, and outbreak.info. However, relatively little has been done to compile codon usage data, codon-level mutation data, and secondary structure data into a single database. Here, we assemble the aforementioned data and many additional virus attributes in a new database entitled SARS-CoV-2 CoCoPUTs. We begin with an overview of the composition and overlap between two of the largest sources of SARS-CoV-2 sequence data: GISAID and NCBI Virus (GenBank). We then evaluate different types of sequence curation strategies to reduce the dataset of millions of sequences to only one sequence per Pango lineage variant. We then performed specific analyses on the coding sequences (CDSs), including calculating codon usage, codon pair usage, dinucleotides, junction dinucleotides, mutations, GC content, effective number of codons (ENCs), and effective number of codon pairs (ENCPs). We have also performed whole-genome secondary RNA structure prediction calculations for each variant, using the LinearPartition software and modified selective 2ʹ-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension (SHAPE) data that are available online. Finally, we compiled all the data into our resource, SARS-CoV-2 CoCoPUTs, and paired many of the resulting statistics with variant proportion data over time in order to derive trends in viral evolution. Although the overall codon usage of SARS-CoV-2 did not change drastically, in line with the previous literature on this subject, we did observe that while overall GC% content decreased, GC% of the third position in the codon was more positive relative to overall GC% content between February 2021 and July 2023. Over the same interval, we noted that both synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations increased in number, with nonsynonymous mutations outpacing synonymous mutations at a rate of 3:1. We noted that the predicted whole-genome secondary structures nearly all contained the previously described virus-activated inhibitor of translation (VAIT) stem loops, validating for the first time their existence in a whole-genome secondary structure prediction for many SARS-CoV-2 variants (as opposed to previous local secondary structure predictions). We also separately produced a synonymous mutation-deprived set of SARS-CoV-2 variant sequences and repeated the secondary structure calculations on this set. This revealed an interesting trend of reduced ensemble free energy compared to the unaltered variant structures, indicating that synonymous mutations play a role in increasing the free energy of viral RNA molecules. These data both validate previous studies describing increases in viral free energy in human viruses over time and indicate a possible role for synonymous mutations in viral biology.

Abstract:
Antibodies play a crucial role in our immune system. Their ability to bind to and neutralize pathogens opens opportunities to develop antibodies for therapeutic and diagnostic use. Computational methods capable of designing antibodies for a target antigen can revolutionize drug discovery, reducing the time and cost required for drug development. Artificial intelligence (AI) methods have recently achieved remarkable advancements in the design of protein sequences and structures, including the ability to generate scaffolds for a given motif and binders for a specific target. These generative methods have been applied to antigen-conditioned antibody design, with experimental binding confirmed for de novo-designed antibodies. This review surveys current AI methods used in antibody development, focusing on those for antigen-conditioned antibody design. The results obtained by AI-based methodologies in antibody and protein research suggest a promising direction for generating de novo binders for various target antigens.

Title: Darwin’s agential materials: evolutionary implications of multiscale competency in developmental biology
Authors: Michael Levin
Date: 2023-05-08

Abstract:
A critical aspect of evolution is the layer of developmental physiology that operates between the genotype and the anatomical phenotype. While much work has addressed the evolution of developmental mechanisms and the evolvability of specific genetic architectures with emergent complexity, one aspect has not been sufficiently explored: the implications of morphogenetic problem-solving competencies for the evolutionary process itself. The cells that evolution works with are not passive components: rather, they have numerous capabilities for behavior because they derive from ancestral unicellular organisms with rich repertoires. In multicellular organisms, these capabilities must be tamed, and can be exploited, by the evolutionary process. Specifically, biological structures have a multiscale competency architecture where cells, tissues, and organs exhibit regulative plasticity—the ability to adjust to perturbations such as external injury or internal modifications and still accomplish specific adaptive tasks across metabolic, transcriptional, physiological, and anatomical problem spaces. Here, I review examples illustrating how physiological circuits guiding cellular collective behavior impart computational properties to the agential material that serves as substrate for the evolutionary process. I then explore the ways in which the collective intelligence of cells during morphogenesis affect evolution, providing a new perspective on the evolutionary search process. This key feature of the physiological software of life helps explain the remarkable speed and robustness of biological evolution, and sheds new light on the relationship between genomes and functional anatomical phenotypes.

Title: Recent progress in adaptive laboratory evolution of industrial microorganisms
Authors: Guanglu Wang, Qian Li, Zhan Zhang, Xianzhong Yin, Bingyang Wang, Xuepeng Yang
Date: 2023

Abstract:
Adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) is a technique for the selection of strains with better phenotypes by long-term culture under a specific selection pressure or growth environment. Because ALE does not require detailed knowledge of a variety of complex and interactive metabolic networks, and only needs to simulate natural environmental conditions in the laboratory to design a selection pressure, it has the advantages of broad adaptability, strong practicability, and more convenient transformation of strains. In addition, ALE provides a powerful method for studying the evolutionary forces that change the phenotype, performance, and stability of strains, resulting in more productive industrial strains with beneficial mutations. In recent years, ALE has been widely used in the activation of specific microbial metabolic pathways and phenotypic optimization, the efficient utilization of specific substrates, the optimization of tolerance to toxic substance, and the biosynthesis of target products, which is more conducive to the production of industrial strains with excellent phenotypic characteristics. In this paper, typical examples of ALE applications in the development of industrial strains and the research progress of this technology are reviewed, followed by a discussion of its development prospects.

Title: Directed Evolution of RecA Variants with Enhanced Capacity for Conjugational Recombination
Authors: Taejin Kim, Sindhu Chitteni-Pattu, Benjamin L. Cox, Elizabeth A. Wood, Steven J. Sandler, Michael M. Cox
Date: 2015-06-05

Abstract:
The recombination activity of Escherichia coli ( E . coli ) RecA protein reflects an evolutionary balance between the positive and potentially deleterious effects of recombination. We have perturbed that balance, generating RecA variants exhibiting improved recombination functionality via random mutagenesis followed by directed evolution for enhanced function in conjugation. A recA gene segment encoding a 59 residue segment of the protein (Val79-Ala137), encompassing an extensive subunit-subunit interface region, was subjected to degenerate oligonucleotide-mediated mutagenesis. An iterative selection process generated at least 18 recA gene variants capable of producing a higher yield of transconjugants. Three of the variant proteins, RecA I102L, RecA V79L and RecA E86G/C90G were characterized based on their prominence. Relative to wild type RecA, the selected RecA variants exhibited faster rates of ATP hydrolysis, more rapid displacement of SSB, decreased inhibition by the RecX regulator protein, and in general displayed a greater persistence on DNA. The enhancement in conjugational function comes at the price of a measurable RecA-mediated cellular growth deficiency. Persistent DNA binding represents a barrier to other processes of DNA metabolism in vivo . The growth deficiency is alleviated by expression of the functionally robust RecX protein from Neisseria gonorrhoeae . RecA filaments can be a barrier to processes like replication and transcription. RecA regulation by RecX protein is important in maintaining an optimal balance between recombination and other aspects of DNA metabolism.

Title: Research progress of pathway and genome evolution in microbes
Authors: Chaoqun Huang, Chang Wang, Yunzi Luo
Date: 2022-03

Abstract:
Microbes can produce valuable natural products widely applied in medicine, food and other important fields. Nevertheless, it is usually challenging to achieve ideal industrial yields due to low production rate and poor toxicity tolerance. Evolution is a constant mutation and adaptation process used to improve strain performance. Generally speaking, the synthesis of natural products in microbes is often intricate, involving multiple enzymes or multiple pathways. Individual evolution of a certain enzyme often fails to achieve the desired results, and may lead to new rate-limiting nodes that affect the growth of microbes. Therefore, it is inevitable to evolve the biosynthetic pathways or the whole genome. Here, we reviewed the pathway-level evolution including multi-enzyme evolution, regulatory elements engineering, and computer-aided engineering, as well as the genome-level evolution based on several tools, such as genome shuffling and CRISPR/Cas systems. Finally, we also discussed the major challenges faced by in vivo evolution strategies and proposed some potential solutions.

Title: Experimental evolution of diverse Escherichia coli metabolic mutants identifies genetic loci for convergent adaptation of growth rate
Authors: Thomas P. Wytock, Aretha Fiebig, Jonathan W. Willett, Julien Herrou, Aleksandra Fergin, Adilson E. Motter, Sean Crosson
Date: 2018-03-27

Abstract:
Cell growth is determined by substrate availability and the cell’s metabolic capacity to assimilate substrates into building blocks. Metabolic genes that determine growth rate may interact synergistically or antagonistically, and can accelerate or slow growth, depending on genetic background and environmental conditions. We evolved a diverse set of Escherichia coli single-gene deletion mutants with a spectrum of growth rates and identified mutations that generally increase growth rate. Despite the metabolic differences between parent strains, mutations that enhanced growth largely mapped to core transcription machinery, including the β and β’ subunits of RNA polymerase (RNAP) and the transcription elongation factor, NusA. The structural segments of RNAP that determine enhanced growth have been previously implicated in antibiotic resistance and in the control of transcription elongation and pausing. We further developed a computational framework to characterize how the transcriptional changes that occur upon acquisition of these mutations affect growth rate across strains. Our experimental and computational results provide evidence for cases in which RNAP mutations shift the competitive balance between active transcription and gene silencing. This study demonstrates that mutations in specific regions of RNAP are a convergent adaptive solution that can enhance the growth rate of cells from distinct metabolic states.

Title: Dissecting the sequence and structural determinants guiding m6A deposition and evolution via inter- and intra-species hybrids
Authors: Ran Shachar, David Dierks, Miguel Angel Garcia-Campos, Anna Uzonyi, Ursula Toth, Walter Rossmanith, Schraga Schwartz
Date: 2024-02-15

Abstract:
N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant mRNA modification, and controls mRNA stability. m6A distribution varies considerably between and within species. Yet, it is unclear to what extent this variability is driven by changes in genetic sequences (‘cis’) or cellular environments (‘trans’) and via which mechanisms. Here we dissect the determinants governing RNA methylation via interspecies and intraspecies hybrids in yeast and mammalian systems, coupled with massively parallel reporter assays and m6A-QTL reanalysis. We find that m6A evolution and variability is driven primarily in ‘cis’, via two mechanisms: (1) variations altering m6A consensus motifs, and (2) variation impacting mRNA secondary structure. We establish that mutations impacting RNA structure - even when distant from an m6A consensus motif - causally dictate methylation propensity. Finally, we demonstrate that allele-specific differences in m6A levels lead to allele-specific changes in gene expression. Our findings define the determinants governing m6A evolution and diversity and characterize the consequences thereof on gene expression regulation.

Title: When Paul Berg meets Donald Crothers: an achiral connection through protein biosynthesis
Authors: Pradeep Kumar, Rajan Sankaranarayanan
Date: 2024-03-21

Abstract:
Outliers in scientific observations are often ignored and mostly remain unreported. However, presenting them is always beneficial since they could reflect the actual anomalies that might open new avenues. Here, we describe two examples of the above that came out of the laboratories of two of the pioneers of nucleic acid research in the area of protein biosynthesis, Paul Berg and Donald Crothers. Their work on the identification of D-aminoacyl-tRNA deacylase (DTD) and ‘Discriminator hypothesis’, respectively, were hugely ahead of their time and were partly against the general paradigm at that time. In both of the above works, the smallest and the only achiral amino acid turned out to be an outlier as DTD can act weakly on glycine charged tRNAs with a unique discriminator base of ‘Uracil’. This peculiar nature of glycine remained an enigma for nearly half a century. With a load of available information on the subject by the turn of the century, our work on ‘chiral proofreading’ mechanisms during protein biosynthesis serendipitously led us to revisit these findings. Here, we describe how we uncovered an unexpected connection between them that has implications for evolution of different eukaryotic life forms.

Abstract:
Building a genotype-phenotype-fitness map of adaptation is a central goal in evolutionary biology. It is difficult even when adaptive mutations are known because it is hard to enumerate which phenotypes make these mutations adaptive. We address this problem by first quantifying how the fitness of hundreds of adaptive yeast mutants responds to subtle environmental shifts. We then model the number of phenotypes these mutations collectively influence by decomposing these patterns of fitness variation. We find that a small number of inferred phenotypes can predict fitness of the adaptive mutations near their original glucose-limited evolution condition. Importantly, inferred phenotypes that matter little to fitness at or near the evolution condition can matter strongly in distant environments. This suggests that adaptive mutations are locally modular — affecting a small number of phenotypes that matter to fitness in the environment where they evolved — yet globally pleiotropic — affecting additional phenotypes that may reduce or improve fitness in new environments.

Title: Grid-Based Path Planning of Agricultural Robots Driven by Multi-Strategy Collaborative Evolution Honey Badger Algorithm
Authors: Yunyu Hu, Peng Shao
Date: 2025-08-14

Abstract:
To address the limitations of mobile robots in path planning within farmland-specific environments, this paper proposes a biomimetic model: Multi-strategy Collaborative Evolution Honey Badger Algorithm (MCEHBA), MCEHBA achieves improvements through the following strategies: firstly, integrating a sinusoidal function-based nonlinear convergence factor to dynamically balance global exploration and local exploitation; secondly, combining the differential evolution strategy to enhance population diversity, and utilizing gravity-centred opposition-based learning to improve solution space search efficiency; finally, constructing good point set initialization and decentralized boundary constraint handling strategy to further increase convergence accuracy and speed. This paper validates the effectiveness of the optimization strategy and the performance of MCEHBA through the CEC2017 benchmark function set, and assesses the statistical significance of the results using the Friedman test and Nemenyi test. The findings demonstrate that MCEHBA exhibits excellent optimization capabilities. Additionally, this study applied MCEHBA to solve three engineering application problems and compared its results with six other algorithms, showing that MCEHBA achieved the minimum objective function values in all three cases. Finally, simulation experiments were conducted in three farmland scenarios of varying scales, with comparative tests against three state-of-the-art algorithms. The results indicate that MCEHBA generates paths with minimized total costs, demonstrating superior global convergence and engineering applicability.

Title: Theoretical Improvements in Enzyme Efficiency Associated with Noisy Rate Constants and Increased Dissipation
Authors: Davor Juretić, Željana Bonačić Lošić
Date: 2024-02-09

Abstract:
Previous studies have revealed the extraordinarily large catalytic efficiency of some enzymes. High catalytic proficiency is an essential accomplishment of biological evolution. Natural selection led to the increased turnover number, k cat , and enzyme efficiency, k cat /K M , of uni–uni enzymes, which convert a single substrate into a single product. We added or multiplied random noise with chosen rate constants to explore the correlation between dissipation and catalytic efficiency for ten enzymes: beta-galactosidase, glucose isomerase, β-lactamases from three bacterial strains, ketosteroid isomerase, triosephosphate isomerase, and carbonic anhydrase I, II, and T200H. Our results highlight the role of biological evolution in accelerating thermodynamic evolution. The catalytic performance of these enzymes is proportional to overall entropy production—the main parameter from irreversible thermodynamics. That parameter is also proportional to the evolutionary distance of β-lactamases PC1, RTEM, and Lac-1 when natural or artificial evolution produces the optimal or maximal possible catalytic efficiency. De novo enzyme design and attempts to speed up the rate-limiting catalytic steps may profit from the described connection between kinetics and thermodynamics.

Abstract:
Motivation: RNA sequence design is studied at least as long as the classical folding problem. Although for the latter the functional fold of an RNA molecule is to be found , inverse folding tries to identify RNA sequences that fold into a function-specific target structure. In combination with RNA-based biotechnology and synthetic biology , reliable RNA sequence design becomes a crucial step to generate novel biochemical components. Results: In this article , the computational tool antaRNA is presented. It is capable of compiling RNA sequences for a given structure that comply in addition with an adjustable full range objective GC-content distribution , specific sequence constraints and additional fuzzy structure constraints. antaRNA applies ant colony optimization meta-heuristics and its superior performance is shown on a biological datasets.

Abstract:
Cellular function is controlled through intricate networks
of signals,
which lead to the myriad pathways governing cell fate. Fluorescent
biosensors have enabled the study of these signaling pathways in living
systems across temporal and spatial scales. Over the years there has
been an explosion in the number of fluorescent biosensors, as they
have become available for numerous targets, utilized across spectral
space, and suited for various imaging techniques. To guide users through
this extensive biosensor landscape, we discuss critical aspects of
fluorescent proteins for consideration in biosensor development, smart
tagging strategies, and the historical and recent biosensors of various
types, grouped by target, and with a focus on the design and recent
applications of these sensors in living systems.

Title: Strategies for improving the genome-editing efficiency of class 2 CRISPR/Cas system
Authors: Linli Wang, Hongbing Han
Date: 2024-10-15

Abstract:
Since its advent, gene-editing technology has been widely used in microorganisms, animals, plants, and other species. This technology shows remarkable application prospects, giving rise to a new biotechnological industry. In particular, third-generation gene editing technology, represented by the CRISPR/Cas9 system, has become the mainstream gene editing technology owing to its advantages of high efficiency, simple operation, and low cost. These systems can be widely used because they have been modified and optimized, leading to notable improvements in the efficiency of gene editing. This review introduces the characteristics of popular CRISPR/Cas systems and optimization methods aimed at improving the editing efficiency of class 2 CRISPR/Cas systems, providing a reference for the development of superior gene editing systems. Additionally, the review discusses the development and optimization of base editors, primer editors, gene activation and repression tools, as well as the advancement and refinement of compact systems such as IscB, TnpB, Fanzor, and Cas12f.

in Prokaryotes and Eukaryotes to Harness the Power of Noncanonical
Amino Acids
Authors: Cosimo Jann, Sabrina Giofré, Rajanya Bhattacharjee, Edward A. Lemke
Date: 2024-08-09

Abstract:
Over 500 natural
and synthetic amino acids have been genetically
encoded in the last two decades. Incorporating these noncanonical
amino acids into proteins enables many powerful applications, ranging
from basic research to biotechnology, materials science, and medicine.
However, major challenges remain to unleash the full potential of
genetic code expansion across disciplines. Here, we provide an overview
of diverse genetic code expansion methodologies and systems and their
final applications in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, represented by Escherichia coli and mammalian cells as the main
workhorse model systems. We highlight the power of how new technologies
can be first established in simple and then transferred to more complex
systems. For example, whole-genome engineering provides an excellent
platform in bacteria for enabling transcript-specific genetic code
expansion without off-targets in the transcriptome. In contrast, the
complexity of a eukaryotic cell poses challenges that require entirely
new approaches, such as striving toward establishing novel base pairs
or generating orthogonally translating organelles within living cells.
We connect the milestones in expanding the genetic code of living
cells for encoding novel chemical functionalities to the most recent
scientific discoveries, from optimizing the physicochemical properties
of noncanonical amino acids to the technological advancements for
their in vivo incorporation. This journey offers
a glimpse into the promising developments in the years to come.

Abstract:
Although the therapeutic efficacy and commercial success of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are tremendous, the design and discovery of new candidates remain a time and cost-intensive endeavor. In this regard, progress in the generation of data describing antigen binding and developability, computational methodology, and artificial intelligence may pave the way for a new era of in silico on-demand immunotherapeutics design and discovery. Here, we argue that the main necessary machine learning (ML) components for an in silico mAb sequence generator are: understanding of the rules of mAb-antigen binding, capacity to modularly combine mAb design parameters, and algorithms for unconstrained parameter-driven in silico mAb sequence synthesis. We review the current progress toward the realization of these necessary components and discuss the challenges that must be overcome to allow the on-demand ML-based discovery and design of fit-for-purpose mAb therapeutic candidates.

Title: Aptamer Sequence Optimization and Its Application in Food Safety Analysis
Authors: Xinna Qin, Lina Zhao, Yang Zhang, Jiyong Shi, Haroon Elrasheid Tahir, Xuechao Xu, Kaiyi Zheng, Xiaobo Zou
Date: 2025-07-26

Abstract:
Aptamers are single-stranded DNA or RNA oligonucleotides screened by systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) methods, which are widely used in food analysis. Aptamers have the advantages of low molecular weight, ease of preparation, simplicity of chemical modification, and structural stability. Aptamers generated by SELEX are typically 80–100 bases in length, and the affinity of the aptamer can be improved by sequence optimization. Methods of aptamer optimization commonly include truncation, mutation, and chemical modification, and molecular docking, molecular dynamics, circular dichroism, and isothermal titration to assess often the binding performance of the aptamer to the target. Optimized aptamers usually enhance the affinity of the aptamer for the target and increase its sensitivity in the detection of pesticides, heavy metals, fungal toxins, pathogenic bacteria, and other objects. This paper focuses on truncation, mutation, chemical modification, the introduction of rare nucleotides, and computer-aided design. It provides an overview of non-immobilized optimization metrics.

Abstract:
Directed evolution is a powerful method to optimize proteins and metabolic reactions towards user‐defined goals. It usually involves subjecting genes or pathways to iterative rounds of mutagenesis, selection and amplification. While powerful, systematic searches through large sequence‐spaces is a labour‐intensive task, and can be further limited by a priori knowledge about the optimal initial search space, and/or limits in terms of screening throughput. Here, we demonstrate an integrated directed evolution workflow for metabolic pathway enzymes that continuously generate enzyme variants using the recently developed orthogonal replication system, OrthoRep and screens for optimal performance in high‐throughput using a transcription factor‐based biosensor. We demonstrate the strengths of this workflow by evolving a rate‐limiting enzymatic reaction of the biosynthetic pathway for cis,cis ‐muconic acid (CCM), a precursor used for bioplastic and coatings, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae . After two weeks of simply iterating between passaging of cells to generate variant enzymes via OrthoRep and high‐throughput sorting of best‐performing variants using a transcription factor‐based biosensor for CCM, we ultimately identified variant enzymes improving CCM titers > 13‐fold compared with reference enzymes. Taken together, the combination of synthetic biology tools as adopted in this study is an efficient approach to debottleneck repetitive workflows associated with directed evolution of metabolic enzymes.

Abstract:
The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is commonly used to interrogate and screen protein variants and
to perform directed evolution studies to develop proteins with enhanced
features. While several techniques have been described that help enable
the use of yeast for directed evolution, there remains a need to increase
their speed and ease of use. Here we present yDBE, a yeast diversifying
base editor that functions in vivo and employs a
CRISPR-dCas9-directed cytidine deaminase base editor to diversify
DNA in a targeted, rapid, and high-breadth manner. To develop yDBE,
we enhanced the mutation rate of an initial base editor by employing
improved deaminase variants and characterizing several scaffolded
guide constructs. We then demonstrate the ability of the yDBE platform
to improve the affinity of a displayed antibody scFv, rapidly generating
diversified libraries and isolating improved binders via cell sorting.
By performing high-throughput sequencing analysis of the high-activity
yDBE, we show that it enables a mutation rate of 2.13 × 10 –4 substitutions/bp/generation over a window of 100
bp. As yDBE functions entirely in vivo and can be
easily programmed to diversify nearly any such window of DNA, we posit
that it can be a powerful tool for facilitating a variety of directed
evolution experiments.

Abstract:
Biological organisms experience constantly changing environments, from sudden changes in physiology brought about by feeding, to the regular rising and setting of the Sun, to ecological changes over evolutionary timescales. Living organisms have evolved to thrive in this changing world but the general principles by which organisms shape and are shaped by time varying environments remain elusive. Our understanding is particularly poor in the intermediate regime with no separation of timescales, where the environment changes on the same timescale as the physiological or evolutionary response. Experiments to systematically characterize the response to dynamic environments are challenging since such environments are inherently high dimensional. This roadmap deals with the unique role played by time varying environments in biological phenomena across scales, from physiology to evolution, seeking to emphasize the commonalities and the challenges faced in this emerging area of research.

Abstract:
The concept of genetic code expansion (GCE) has revolutionized
the field of chemical and synthetic biology, enabling the site-specific
incorporation of noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) into proteins, thus
opening new avenues in research and applications across biology and
medicine. In this review, we cover the principles of GCE, including
the optimization of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS)/tRNA system
and the advancements in translation system engineering. Notable developments
include the refinement of aaRS/tRNA pairs, enhancements in screening
methods, and the biosynthesis of noncanonical amino acids. The applications
of GCE technology span from synthetic biology, where it facilitates
gene expression regulation and protein engineering, to medicine, with
promising approaches in drug development, vaccine production, and
gene editing. The review concludes with a perspective on the future
of GCE, underscoring its potential to further expand the toolkit of
biology and medicine. Through this comprehensive review, we aim to
provide a detailed overview of the current state of GCE technology,
its challenges, opportunities, and the frontier it represents in the
expansion of the genetic code for novel biological research and therapeutic
applications.

Title: Systems protobiology: origin of life in lipid catalytic networks
Authors: Doron Lancet, Raphael Zidovetzki, Omer Markovitch
Date: 2018-07

Abstract:
Life is that which replicates and evolves, but there is no consensus on how life emerged. We advocate a systems protobiology view, whereby the first replicators were assemblies of spontaneously accreting, heterogeneous and mostly non-canonical amphiphiles. This view is substantiated by rigorous chemical kinetics simulations of the graded autocatalysis replication domain (GARD) model, based on the notion that the replication or reproduction of compositional information predated that of sequence information. GARD reveals the emergence of privileged non-equilibrium assemblies (composomes), which portray catalysis-based homeostatic (concentration-preserving) growth. Such a process, along with occasional assembly fission, embodies cell-like reproduction. GARD pre-RNA evolution is evidenced in the selection of different composomes within a sparse fitness landscape, in response to environmental chemical changes. These observations refute claims that GARD assemblies (or other mutually catalytic networks in the metabolism first scenario) cannot evolve. Composomes represent both a genotype and a selectable phenotype, anteceding present-day biology in which the two are mostly separated. Detailed GARD analyses show attractor-like transitions from random assemblies to self-organized composomes, with negative entropy change, thus establishing composomes as dissipative systems—hallmarks of life. We show a preliminary new version of our model, metabolic GARD (M-GARD), in which lipid covalent modifications are orchestrated by non-enzymatic lipid catalysts, themselves compositionally reproduced. M-GARD fills the gap of the lack of true metabolism in basic GARD, and is rewardingly supported by a published experimental instance of a lipid-based mutually catalytic network. Anticipating near-future far-reaching progress of molecular dynamics, M-GARD is slated to quantitatively depict elaborate protocells, with orchestrated reproduction of both lipid bilayer and lumenal content. Finally, a GARD analysis in a whole-planet context offers the potential for estimating the probability of life's emergence. The invigorated GARD scrutiny presented in this review enhances the validity of autocatalytic sets as a bona fide early evolution scenario and provides essential infrastructure for a paradigm shift towards a systems protobiology view of life's origin.

Title: Base and Prime Editing for Inherited Retinal Diseases: Delivery Platforms, Safety, Efficacy, and Translational Perspectives
Authors: Haoliang Zhang, Yuxuan Li, Jiajie Li, Xiaosa Li, Tong Li
Date: 2025-10-30

Abstract:
Inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) are a clinically and genetically heterogeneous spectrum of disorders that lead to progressive and irreversible vision loss. Gene therapy is the most promising emerging treatment for IRDs. While gene augmentation strategies have demonstrated clinical benefit and results within the first approved ocular gene therapy, their application is restricted by adeno-associated virus (AAV) packaging capacity and limited efficacy for dominant mutations. Recent breakthroughs in precision genome editing, particularly base editing (BE) and prime editing (PE), have provided alternatives capable of directly correcting pathogenic variants. BE enables targeted single-nucleotide conversions, whereas PE further allows for precise insertions and deletions, both circumventing the double-strand DNA cleavage or repair processes typically induced by conventional CRISPR–Cas editing systems, thereby offering advantages in post-mitotic retinal cells. Preclinical investigations across murine and non-human primate models have demonstrated the feasibility, molecular accuracy, and preliminary safety profiles of these platforms in targeting IRD-associated mutations. However, critical challenges remain before clinical application can be realized, including limited editing efficiency in photoreceptors, interspecies variability in therapeutic response, potential risks of off-target effects, and barriers in large-scale vector manufacturing. Moreover, the delivery of genome editors to the outer retina remains suboptimal, prompting intensive efforts in capsid engineering and the development of non-viral delivery systems. This review synthesizes the current progress in BE and PE optimization, highlights innovations in delivery platforms that encompass viral and emerging non-viral systems and summarizes the major barriers to clinical translation. We further discuss AI-driven strategies for the rational design of BE/PE systems, thereby outlining their future potential and perspectives in the treatment of IRDs.

Title: Towards the genomic sequence code of DNA fragility for machine learning
Authors: Patrick Pflughaupt, Adib A Abdullah, Kairi Masuda, Aleksandr B Sahakyan
Date: 2024-11-27

Abstract:
Genomic DNA breakages and the subsequent insertion and deletion mutations are important contributors to genome instability and linked diseases. Unlike the research in point mutations, the relationship between DNA sequence context and the propensity for strand breaks remains elusive. Here, by analyzing the differences and commonalities across myriads of genomic breakage datasets, we extract the sequence-linked rules and patterns behind DNA fragility. We show the overall deconvolution of the sequence influence into short-, mid- and long-range effects, and the stressor-dependent differences in defining the range and compositional effects on DNA fragility. We summarize and release our feature compendium as a library that can be seamlessly incorporated into genomic machine learning procedures, where DNA fragility is of concern, and train a generalized DNA fragility model on cancer-associated breakages. Structural variants (SVs) tend to stabilize regions in which they emerge, with the effect most pronounced for pathogenic SVs. In contrast, the effects of chromothripsis are seen across regions less prone to breakages. We find that viral integration may bring genome fragility, particularly for cancer-associated viruses. Overall, this work offers novel insights into the genomic sequence basis of DNA fragility and presents a powerful machine learning resource to further enhance our understanding of genome (in)stability and evolution.

Date: 2023-08

Abstract:
Genetic regulatory networks (GRNs) regulate the flow of genetic information from the genome to expressed messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and thus are critical to controlling the phenotypic characteristics of cells. Numerous methods exist for profiling mRNA transcript levels and identifying protein-DNA binding interactions at the genome-wide scale. These enable researchers to determine the structure and output of transcriptional regulatory networks, but uncovering the complete structure and regulatory logic of GRNs remains a challenge. The field of GRN inference aims to meet this challenge using computational modeling to derive the structure and logic of GRNs from experimental data and to encode this knowledge in Boolean networks, Bayesian networks, ordinary differential equation (ODE) models, or other modeling frameworks. However, most existing models do not incorporate dynamic transcriptional data since it has historically been less widely available in comparison to “static” transcriptional data. We report the development of an evolutionary algorithm-based ODE modeling approach (named EA) that integrates kinetic transcription data and the theory of attractor matching to infer GRN architecture and regulatory logic. Our method outperformed six leading GRN inference methods, none of which incorporate kinetic transcriptional data, in predicting regulatory connections among TFs when applied to a small-scale engineered synthetic GRN in Saccharomyces cerevisiae . Moreover, we demonstrate the potential of our method to predict unknown transcriptional profiles that would be produced upon genetic perturbation of the GRN governing a two-state cellular phenotypic switch in Candida albicans . We established an iterative refinement strategy to facilitate candidate selection for experimentation; the experimental results in turn provide validation or improvement for the model. In this way, our GRN inference approach can expedite the development of a sophisticated mathematical model that can accurately describe the structure and dynamics of the in vivo GRN.

Title: The evolving art of creating genetic diversity: From directed evolution to synthetic biology
Authors: Andrew Currin, Steven Parker, Christopher J. Robinson, Eriko Takano, Nigel S. Scrutton, Rainer Breitling
Date: 2021

Abstract:
The ability to engineer biological systems, whether to introduce novel functionality or improved performance, is a cornerstone of biotechnology and synthetic biology. Typically, this requires the generation of genetic diversity to explore variations in phenotype, a process that can be performed at many levels, from single molecule targets ( i.e. , in directed evolution of enzymes) to whole organisms ( e.g. , in chassis engineering). Recent advances in DNA synthesis technology and automation have enhanced our ability to create variant libraries with greater control and throughput. This review highlights the latest developments in approaches to create such a hierarchy of diversity from the enzyme level to entire pathways in vitro , with a focus on the creation of combinatorial libraries that are required to navigate a target's vast design space successfully to uncover significant improvements in function.

Date: 2024-09-30

Abstract:
Fc gamma receptors (FcγRs) are a family of receptors that bind IgG antibodies and interface at the junction of humoral and innate immunity. Precise regulation of receptor expression provides the necessary balance to achieve healthy immune homeostasis by establishing an appropriate immune threshold to limit autoimmunity but respond effectively to infection. The underlying genetics of the FCGR gene family are central to achieving this immune threshold by regulating affinity for IgG, signaling efficacy, and receptor expression. The FCGR gene locus was duplicated during evolution, retaining very high homology and resulting in a genomic region that is technically difficult to study. Here, we review the recent evolution of the gene family in mammals, its complexity and variation through copy number variation and single‐nucleotide polymorphism, and impact of these on disease incidence, resolution, and therapeutic antibody efficacy. We also discuss the progress and limitations of current approaches to study the region and emphasize how new genomics technologies will likely resolve much of the current confusion in the field. This will lead to definitive conclusions on the impact of genetic variation within the FCGR gene locus on immune function and disease.

Title: Harnessing the analog computing power of regulatory networks with the Regulatory Network Machine
Authors: Alexis Pietak, Michael Levin
Date: 2025-06-20

Abstract:
Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) are critically important for efforts in biomedicine and biotechnology. Here, we introduce the Regulatory Network Machine (RNM) framework, demonstrating how GRNs behave as analog computers capable of sophisticated information processing. Our RNM framework encapsulates: (1) a dissipative dynamic system with a focus on GRNs, (2) a set of inputs to the system, (3) system output states with identifiable relevance to biotechnological or biomedical objectives, and (4) Network Finite State Machines (NFSMs), which are maps detailing how the system changes equilibrium state in response to patterns of applied inputs. As an extension to attractor landscape analysis, the NFSMs map the sequential logic inherent in the GRN and, therefore, embody the “software-like” nature of the system, providing easy identification of specific applied interventions necessary to achieve desired, stable biological outcomes. We illustrate the use of our RNM framework in important biological examples, including in cancer renormalization.

Date: 2024-08-30

Abstract:
Gene expression can be highly plastic in response to environmental variation. However, we know little about how expression plasticity is shaped by natural selection and evolves in wild and domesticated species. We used genotypic selection analysis to characterize selection on drought‐induced plasticity of over 7,500 leaf transcripts of 118 rice accessions (genotypes) from different environmental conditions grown in a field experiment. Gene expression plasticity was neutral for most gradually plastic transcripts, but transcripts with discrete patterns of expression showed stronger selection on expression plasticity. Whether plasticity was adaptive and co‐gradient or maladaptive and counter‐gradient varied among varietal groups. No transcripts that experienced selection for plasticity across environments showed selection against plasticity within environments, indicating a lack of evidence for costs of adaptive plasticity that may constrain its evolution. Selection on expression plasticity was influenced by degree of plasticity, transcript length and gene body methylation. We observed positive selection on plasticity of co‐expression modules containing transcripts involved in photosynthesis, translation and responsiveness to abiotic stress. Taken together, these results indicate that patterns of selection on expression plasticity were context‐dependent and likely associated with environmental conditions of varietal groups, but that the evolution of adaptive plasticity would likely not be constrained by opposing patterns of selection on plasticity within compared to across environments. These results offer a genome‐wide view of patterns of selection and ecological constraints on gene expression plasticity and provide insights into the interplay between plastic and evolutionary responses to drought at the molecular level.

Title: Versatile selective evolutionary pressure using synthetic defect in universal metabolism
Authors: Lara Sellés Vidal, James W. Murray, John T. Heap
Date: 2021-11-25

Abstract:
The non-natural needs of industrial applications often require new or improved enzymes. The structures and properties of enzymes are difficult to predict or design de novo . Instead, semi-rational approaches mimicking evolution entail diversification of parent enzymes followed by evaluation of isolated variants. Artificial selection pressures coupling desired enzyme properties to cell growth could overcome this key bottleneck, but are usually narrow in scope. Here we show diverse enzymes using the ubiquitous cofactors nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) can substitute for defective NAD regeneration, representing a very broadly-applicable artificial selection. Inactivation of Escherichia coli genes required for anaerobic NAD regeneration causes a conditional growth defect. Cells are rescued by foreign enzymes connected to the metabolic network only via NAD or NADP, but only when their substrates are supplied. Using this principle, alcohol dehydrogenase, imine reductase and nitroreductase variants with desired selectivity modifications, and a high-performing isopropanol metabolic pathway, are isolated from libraries of millions of variants in single-round experiments with typical limited information to guide design.

Abstract:
Identifying regions of the genome that act as barriers to gene flow between recently diverged taxa has remained challenging given the many evolutionary forces that generate variation in genetic diversity and divergence along the genome, and the stochastic nature of this variation. Progress has been impeded by a conceptual and methodological divide between analyses that infer the demographic history of speciation and genome scans aimed at identifying locally maladaptive alleles i.e. genomic barriers to gene flow. Here we implement genomewide IM blockwise likelihood estimation ( gIMble ), a composite likelihood approach for the quantification of barriers, that bridges this divide. This analytic framework captures background selection and selection against barriers in a model of isolation with migration (IM) as heterogeneity in effective population size ( N e ) and effective migration rate ( m e ), respectively. Variation in both effective demographic parameters is estimated in sliding windows via pre-computed likelihood grids. gIMble includes modules for pre-processing/filtering of genomic data and performing parametric bootstraps using coalescent simulations. To demonstrate the new approach, we analyse data from a well-studied pair of sister species of tropical butterflies with a known history of post-divergence gene flow: Heliconius melpomene and H. cydno . Our analyses uncover both large-effect barrier loci (including well-known wing-pattern genes) and a genome-wide signal of a polygenic barrier architecture.

Title: Engineering and Expression Strategies for Optimization of L-Asparaginase Development and Production
Authors: Anastasiya N. Shishparenok, Yulia A. Gladilina, Dmitry D. Zhdanov
Date: 2023-10-16

Abstract:
Genetic engineering for heterologous expression has advanced in recent years. Model systems such as Escherichia coli , Bacillus subtilis and Pichia pastoris are often used as host microorganisms for the enzymatic production of L-asparaginase, an enzyme widely used in the clinic for the treatment of leukemia and in bakeries for the reduction of acrylamide. Newly developed recombinant L-asparaginase (L-ASNase) may have a low affinity for asparagine, reduced catalytic activity, low stability, and increased glutaminase activity or immunogenicity. Some successful commercial preparations of L-ASNase are now available. Therefore, obtaining novel L-ASNases with improved properties suitable for food or clinical applications remains a challenge. The combination of rational design and/or directed evolution and heterologous expression has been used to create enzymes with desired characteristics. Computer design, combined with other methods, could make it possible to generate mutant libraries of novel L-ASNases without costly and time-consuming efforts. In this review, we summarize the strategies and approaches for obtaining and developing L-ASNase with improved properties.

Authors: Syue-Ting Kuo, Ruey-Lin Jahn, Yuan-Ju Cheng, Yi-Lan Chen, Yun-Ju Lee, Florian Hollfelder, Jin-Der Wen, Hsin-Hung David Chou
Date: 2020-05

Abstract:
Shine-Dalgarno sequences (SD) in prokaryotic mRNA facilitate protein translation by pairing with rRNA in ribosomes. Although conventionally defined as AG-rich motifs, recent genomic surveys reveal great sequence diversity, questioning how SD functions. Here, we determined the molecular fitness (i.e., translation efficiency) of 4 9 synthetic 9-nt SD genotypes in three distinct mRNA contexts in Escherichia coli . We uncovered generic principles governing the SD fitness landscapes: (1) Guanine contents, rather than canonical SD motifs, best predict the fitness of both synthetic and endogenous SD; (2) the genotype-fitness correlation of SD promotes its evolvability by steadily supplying beneficial mutations across fitness landscapes; and (3) the frequency and magnitude of deleterious mutations increase with background fitness, and adjacent nucleotides in SD show stronger epistasis. Epistasis results from disruption of the continuous base pairing between SD and rRNA. This “chain-breaking” epistasis creates sinkholes in SD fitness landscapes and may profoundly impact the evolution and function of prokaryotic translation initiation and other RNA-mediated processes. Collectively, our work yields functional insights into the SD sequence variation in prokaryotic genomes, identifies a simple design principle to guide bioengineering and bioinformatic analysis of SD, and illuminates the fundamentals of fitness landscapes and molecular evolution.

Abstract:
With both catalytic and genetic functions,
ribonucleic acid (RNA)
is perhaps the most pluripotent chemical species in molecular biology,
and its functions are intimately linked to its structure and dynamics.
Computer simulations, and in particular atomistic molecular dynamics
(MD), allow structural dynamics of biomolecular systems to be investigated
with unprecedented temporal and spatial resolution. We here provide
a comprehensive overview of the fast-developing field of MD simulations
of RNA molecules. We begin with an in-depth, evaluatory coverage of
the most fundamental methodological challenges that set the basis
for the future development of the field, in particular, the current
developments and inherent physical limitations of the atomistic force
fields and the recent advances in a broad spectrum of enhanced sampling
methods. We also survey the closely related field of coarse-grained
modeling of RNA systems. After dealing with the methodological aspects,
we provide an exhaustive overview of the available RNA simulation
literature, ranging from studies of the smallest RNA oligonucleotides
to investigations of the entire ribosome. Our review encompasses tetranucleotides,
tetraloops, a number of small RNA motifs, A-helix RNA, kissing-loop
complexes, the TAR RNA element, the decoding center and other important
regions of the ribosome, as well as assorted others systems. Extended
sections are devoted to RNA–ion interactions, ribozymes, riboswitches,
and protein/RNA complexes. Our overview is written for as broad of
an audience as possible, aiming to provide a much-needed interdisciplinary
bridge between computation and experiment, together with a perspective
on the future of the field.

Title: A review of large language models and autonomous agents in chemistry
Authors: Mayk Caldas Ramos, Christopher J. Collison, Andrew D. White
Date: 2024-12-09

Abstract:
Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools in chemistry, significantly impacting molecule design, property prediction, and synthesis optimization. This review highlights LLM capabilities in these domains and their potential to accelerate scientific discovery through automation. We also review LLM-based autonomous agents: LLMs with a broader set of tools to interact with their surrounding environment. These agents perform diverse tasks such as paper scraping, interfacing with automated laboratories, and synthesis planning. As agents are an emerging topic, we extend the scope of our review of agents beyond chemistry and discuss across any scientific domains. This review covers the recent history, current capabilities, and design of LLMs and autonomous agents, addressing specific challenges, opportunities, and future directions in chemistry. Key challenges include data quality and integration, model interpretability, and the need for standard benchmarks, while future directions point towards more sophisticated multi-modal agents and enhanced collaboration between agents and experimental methods. Due to the quick pace of this field, a repository has been built to keep track of the latest studies: https://github.com/ur-whitelab/LLMs-in-science .

Title: Adaptive laboratory evolution – principles and applications for biotechnology
Authors: Martin Dragosits, Diethard Mattanovich
Date: 2013

Abstract:
Adaptive laboratory evolution is a frequent method in biological studies to gain insights into the basic mechanisms of molecular evolution and adaptive changes that accumulate in microbial populations during long term selection under specified growth conditions. Although regularly performed for more than 25 years, the advent of transcript and cheap next-generation sequencing technologies has resulted in many recent studies, which successfully applied this technique in order to engineer microbial cells for biotechnological applications. Adaptive laboratory evolution has some major benefits as compared with classical genetic engineering but also some inherent limitations. However, recent studies show how some of the limitations may be overcome in order to successfully incorporate adaptive laboratory evolution in microbial cell factory design. Over the last two decades important insights into nutrient and stress metabolism of relevant model species were acquired, whereas some other aspects such as niche-specific differences of non-conventional cell factories are not completely understood. Altogether the current status and its future perspectives highlight the importance and potential of adaptive laboratory evolution as approach in biotechnological engineering.

Title: Development of a novel strategy for robust synthetic bacterial promoters based on a stepwise evolution targeting the spacer region of the core promoter in Bacillus subtilis
Authors: Laichuang Han, Wenjing Cui, Feiya Suo, Shengnan Miao, Wenliang Hao, Qiaoqing Chen, Junling Guo, Zhongmei Liu, Li Zhou, Zhemin Zhou

Abstract:
Promoter evolution by synthetic promoter library (SPL) is a powerful approach to development of functional synthetic promoters to synthetic biology. However, it requires much tedious and time-consuming screenings because of the plethora of different variants in SPL. Actually, a large proportion of mutants in the SPL are significantly lower in strength, which contributes only to fabrication of a promoter library with a continuum of strength. Thus, to effectively obtain the evolved synthetic promoter exhibiting higher strength, it is essential to develop novel strategies to construct mutant library targeting the pivotal region rather than the arbitrary region of the template promoter. In this study, a strategy termed stepwise evolution targeting the spacer of core promoter (SETarSCoP) was established in Bacillus subtilis to effectively evolve the strength of bacterial promoter. The native promoter, P srfA , from B. subtilis , which exhibits higher strength than the strong promoter P43, was set as the parental template. According to the comparison of conservation of the spacer sequences between − 35 box and − 10 box among a set of strong and weak native promoter, it revealed that 7-bp sequence immediately upstream of the − 10 box featured in the regulation of promoter strength. Based on the conservative feature, two rounds of consecutive evolution were performed targeting the hot region of P srfA . In the first round, a primary promoter mutation library (pPML) was constructed by mutagenesis targeting the 3-bp sequence immediately upstream of the − 10 box of the P srfA . Subsequently, four evolved mutants from pPML were selected to construction of four secondary promoter mutation libraries (sPMLs) based on mutagenesis of the 4-bp sequence upstream of the first-round target. After the consecutive two-step evolution, the mutant P BH4 was identified and verified to be a highly evolved synthetic promoter. The strength of P BH4 was higher than P srfA by approximately 3 times. Moreover, P BH4 also exhibited broad suitability for different cargo proteins, such as β-glucuronidase and nattokinase. The proof-of-principle test showed that SETarSCoP successfully evolved both constitutive and inducible promoters. Comparing with the commonly used SPL strategy, SETarSCoP facilitates the evolution process to obtain strength-evolved synthetic bacterial promoter through fabrication and screening of small-scale mutation libraries. This strategy will be a promising method to evolve diverse bacterial promoters to expand the toolbox for synthetic biology.

Title: The Evolutionary Origins of Hierarchy
Authors: Henok Mengistu, Joost Huizinga, Jean-Baptiste Mouret, Jeff Clune
Date: 2016-06

Abstract:
Hierarchical organization—the recursive composition of sub-modules—is ubiquitous in biological networks, including neural, metabolic, ecological, and genetic regulatory networks, and in human-made systems, such as large organizations and the Internet. To date, most research on hierarchy in networks has been limited to quantifying this property. However, an open, important question in evolutionary biology is why hierarchical organization evolves in the first place. It has recently been shown that modularity evolves because of the presence of a cost for network connections. Here we investigate whether such connection costs also tend to cause a hierarchical organization of such modules. In computational simulations, we find that networks without a connection cost do not evolve to be hierarchical, even when the task has a hierarchical structure. However, with a connection cost, networks evolve to be both modular and hierarchical, and these networks exhibit higher overall performance and evolvability (i.e. faster adaptation to new environments). Additional analyses confirm that hierarchy independently improves adaptability after controlling for modularity. Overall, our results suggest that the same force–the cost of connections–promotes the evolution of both hierarchy and modularity, and that these properties are important drivers of network performance and adaptability. In addition to shedding light on the emergence of hierarchy across the many domains in which it appears, these findings will also accelerate future research into evolving more complex, intelligent computational brains in the fields of artificial intelligence and robotics.

Abstract:
As antimicrobial resistance rises, new antibacterial candidates are urgently needed. Using sequence space information from over 14,743 functional antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), we improved the antimicrobial properties of citropin 1.1, an AMP with weak antimethicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) activity, producing a short and potent antistaphylococcal peptide, CIT-8 (13 residues). At 40 μg/mL, CIT-8 eradicated 1 × 10 8 drug-resistant MRSA and vancomycin resistant S . aureus (VRSA) persister cells within 30 minutes of exposure and reduced the number of viable biofilm cells of MRSA and VRSA by 3 log 10 and 4 log 10 in established biofilms, respectively. CIT-8 (at 32 μg/mL) depolarized and permeated the S . aureus MW2 membrane. In a mouse model of MRSA skin infection, CIT-8 (2% w/w in petroleum jelly) significantly reduced the bacterial burden by 2.3 log 10 ( P < 0.0001). Our methodology accelerated AMP design by combining traditional peptide design strategies, such as truncation, substitution, and structure-guided alteration, with machine learning–backed sequence optimization.

Title: AI-directed gene fusing prolongs the evolutionary half-life of synthetic gene circuits
Authors: Itamar Menuhin-Gruman, Matan Arbel-Groissman, Doron Naki, Shaked Bergman, Tamir Tuller
Date: 2025-10-03

Abstract:
Evolutionary instability is a persistent challenge in synthetic biology, often leading to the loss of heterologous gene expression over time. Here, we present STABLES, a gene fusion strategy that links a gene of interest (GOI) to an essential endogenous gene (EG), with a “leaky” stop codon in between. This ensures both selective pressure against deleterious mutations and the high expression of the GOI. By leveraging a machine learning framework, we predict optimal GOI-EG pairs on the basis of bioinformatic and biophysical features, identify linkers likely to minimize protein misfolding, and optimize DNA sequences for stability and expression. Experimental validation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae demonstrated substantial improvements in stability and productivity for fluorescent proteins and human proinsulin. The results highlight a scalable, adaptable, and organism-agnostic method to enhance the evolutionary stability of engineered strains, with broad implications for industrial biotechnology and synthetic biology.

Title: Evolutionary conservation of RNA sequence and structure
Authors: Elena Rivas
Date: 2021-03-22

Abstract:
An RNA structure prediction from a single‐sequence RNA folding program is not evidence for an RNA whose structure is important for function. Random sequences have plausible and complex predicted structures not easily distinguishable from those of structural RNAs. How to tell when an RNA has a conserved structure is a question that requires looking at the evolutionary signature left by the conserved RNA. This question is important not just for long noncoding RNAs which usually lack an identified function, but also for RNA binding protein motifs which can be single stranded RNAs or structures. Here we review recent advances using sequence and structural analysis to determine when RNA structure is conserved or not. Although covariation measures assess structural RNA conservation, one must distinguish covariation due to RNA structure from covariation due to independent phylogenetic substitutions. We review a statistical test to measure false positives expected under the null hypothesis of phylogenetic covariation alone (specificity). We also review a complementary test that measures power, that is, expected covariation derived from sequence variation alone (sensitivity). Power in the absence of covariation signals the absence of a conserved RNA structure. We analyze artifacts that falsely identify conserved RNA structure such as the misuse of programs that do not assess significance, the use of inappropriate statistics confounded by signals other than covariation, or misalignments that induce spurious covariation. Among artifacts that obscure the signal of a conserved RNA structure, we discuss the inclusion of pseudogenes in alignments which increase power but destroy covariation.

Date: 2020-01-24

Abstract:
Domain recombination is a key principle in protein evolution and protein engineering, but inserting a donor domain into every position of a target protein is not easily experimentally accessible. Most contemporary domain insertion profiling approaches rely on DNA transposons, which are constrained by sequence bias. Here, we establish S aturated P rogrammable In sertion E ngineering (SPINE), an unbiased, comprehensive, and targeted domain insertion library generation technique using oligo library synthesis and multi-step Golden Gate cloning. Through benchmarking to MuA transposon-mediated library generation on four ion channel genes, we demonstrate that SPINE-generated libraries are enriched for in-frame insertions, have drastically reduced sequence bias as well as near-complete and highly-redundant coverage. Unlike transposon-mediated domain insertion that was severely biased and sparse for some genes, SPINE generated high-quality libraries for all genes tested. Using the Inward Rectifier K + channel Kir2.1, we validate the practical utility of SPINE by constructing and comparing domain insertion permissibility maps. SPINE is the first technology to enable saturated domain insertion profiling. SPINE could help explore the relationship between domain insertions and protein function, and how this relationship is shaped by evolutionary forces and can be engineered for biomedical applications.

Title: Underlying Principles of Natural Selection in Network Evolution: Systems Biology Approach
Authors: Bor-Sen Chen, Wei-Sheng Wu
Date: 2007

Abstract:
Systems biology is a rapidly expanding field that integrates diverse areas of science such as physics, engineering, computer science, mathematics, and biology toward the goal of elucidating the underlying principles of hierarchical metabolic and regulatory systems in the cell, and ultimately leading to predictive understanding of cellular response to perturbations. Because post-genomics research is taking place throughout the tree of life, comparative approaches offer a way for combining data from many organisms to shed light on the evolution and function of biological networks from the gene to the organismal level. Therefore, systems biology can build on decades of theoretical work in evolutionary biology, and at the same time evolutionary biology can use the systems biology approach to go in new uncharted directions. In this study, we present a review of how the post-genomics era is adopting comparative approaches and dynamic system methods to understand the underlying design principles of network evolution and to shape the nascent field of evolutionary systems biology. Finally, the application of evolutionary systems biology to robust biological network designs is also discussed from the synthetic biology perspective.

Authors: Carlos Martí-Gómez, Juannan Zhou, Wei-Chia Chen, Arlin Stoltzfus, Justin B. Kinney, David M. McCandlish
Date: 2025-08-26

Abstract:
Understanding how biological sequences give rise to observable traits, that is, how genotype maps to phenotype, is a central goal in biology. Yet our knowledge of genotype-phenotype maps in natural systems is limited due to the high dimensionality of sequence space and the context-dependent effects of mutations. The emergence of Multiplex assays of variant effect (MAVEs), along with large collections of natural sequences, offer new opportunities to empirically characterize these maps at an unprecedented scale. However, tools for statistical and exploratory analysis of these high-dimensional data are still needed. To address this gap, we developed gpmap-tools ( https://github.com/cmarti/gpmap-tools ), a python library that integrates a series of models for inference, phenotypic imputation, and error estimation from MAVE data or collections of natural sequences in the presence of genetic interactions of every possible order. gpmap-tools also provides methods for summarizing patterns of epistasis and visualization of genotype-phenotype maps containing up to millions of genotypes. To demonstrate its utility, we used gpmap-tools to infer genotype-phenotype maps containing 262,144 variants of the Shine-Dalgarno sequence from both genomic 5’UTR sequences and experimental MAVE data. Visualization of the inferred landscapes consistently revealed high-fitness ridges that link core motifs at different distances from the start codon. In summary, gpmap-tools provides a flexible, interpretable framework for studying complex genotype-phenotype maps, opening new avenues for understanding the architecture of genetic interactions and their evolutionary consequences.

Abstract:
Inspired by Richard
Feynman’s 1959 lecture and the 1966
film Fantastic Voyage , the field of micro/nanorobots
has evolved from science fiction to reality, with significant advancements
in biomedical and environmental applications. Despite the rapid progress,
the deployment of functional micro/nanorobots remains limited. This
review of the technology roadmap identifies key challenges hindering
their widespread use, focusing on propulsion mechanisms, fundamental
theoretical aspects, collective behavior, material design, and embodied
intelligence. We explore the current state of micro/nanorobot technology,
with an emphasis on applications in biomedicine, environmental remediation,
analytical sensing, and other industrial technological aspects. Additionally,
we analyze issues related to scaling up production, commercialization,
and regulatory frameworks that are crucial for transitioning from
research to practical applications. We also emphasize the need for
interdisciplinary collaboration to address both technical and nontechnical
challenges, such as sustainability, ethics, and business considerations.
Finally, we propose a roadmap for future research to accelerate the
development of micro/nanorobots, positioning them as essential tools
for addressing grand challenges and enhancing the quality of life.

Pyrrolysine Systems for Genetic Code Expansion
and Reprogramming
Authors: Daniel L. Dunkelmann, Jason W. Chin
Date: 2024-09-05

Abstract:
Over the past 16 years, genetic code expansion and reprogramming
in living organisms has been transformed by advances that leverage
the unique properties of pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase (PylRS)/tRNA Pyl pairs. Here we summarize the discovery of the pyrrolysine
system and describe the unique properties of PylRS/tRNA Pyl pairs that provide a foundation for their transformational role
in genetic code expansion and reprogramming. We describe the development
of genetic code expansion, from E. coli to all domains
of life, using PylRS/tRNA Pyl pairs, and the development
of systems that biosynthesize and incorporate ncAAs using pyl systems.
We review applications that have been uniquely enabled by the development
of PylRS/tRNA Pyl pairs for incorporating new noncanonical
amino acids (ncAAs), and strategies for engineering PylRS/tRNA Pyl pairs to add noncanonical monomers, beyond α- L -amino acids, to the genetic code of living organisms.
We review rapid progress in the discovery and scalable generation
of mutually orthogonal PylRS/tRNA Pyl pairs that can be
directed to incorporate diverse ncAAs in response to diverse codons,
and we review strategies for incorporating multiple distinct ncAAs
into proteins using mutually orthogonal PylRS/tRNA Pyl pairs.
Finally, we review recent advances in the encoded cellular synthesis
of noncanonical polymers and macrocycles and discuss future developments
for PylRS/tRNA Pyl pairs.

Abstract:
Directed evolution in bacterial or yeast display systems has been successfully used to improve stability and expression of G protein-coupled receptors for structural and biophysical studies. Yet, several receptors cannot be tackled in microbial systems due to their complex molecular composition or unfavorable ligand properties. Here, we report an approach to evolve G protein-coupled receptors in mammalian cells. To achieve clonality and uniform expression, we develop a viral transduction system based on Vaccinia virus. By rational design of synthetic DNA libraries, we first evolve neurotensin receptor 1 for high stability and expression. Second, we demonstrate that receptors with complex molecular architectures and large ligands, such as the parathyroid hormone 1 receptor, can be readily evolved. Importantly, functional receptor properties can now be evolved in the presence of the mammalian signaling environment, resulting in receptor variants exhibiting increased allosteric coupling between the ligand binding site and the G protein interface. Our approach thus provides insights into the intricate molecular interplay required for GPCR activation.

Abstract:
An ever-increasing demand for novel antimicrobials to treat life-threatening infections caused by the global spread of multidrug-resistant bacterial pathogens stands in stark contrast to the current level of investment in their development, particularly in the fields of natural-product-derived and synthetic small molecules. New agents displaying innovative chemistry and modes of action are desperately needed worldwide to tackle the public health menace posed by antimicrobial resistance. Here, our consortium presents a strategic blueprint to substantially improve our ability to discover and develop new antibiotics. We propose both short-term and long-term solutions to overcome the most urgent limitations in the various sectors of research and funding, aiming to bridge the gap between academic, industrial and political stakeholders, and to unite interdisciplinary expertise in order to efficiently fuel the translational pipeline for the benefit of future generations.

Title: Fundamental constraints to the logic of living systems

Abstract:
It has been argued that the historical nature of evolution makes it a highly path-dependent process. Under this view, the outcome of evolutionary dynamics could have resulted in organisms with different forms and functions. At the same time, there is ample evidence that convergence and constraints strongly limit the domain of the potential design principles that evolution can achieve. Are these limitations relevant in shaping the fabric of the possible? Here, we argue that fundamental constraints are associated with the logic of living matter. We illustrate this idea by considering the thermodynamic properties of living systems, the linear nature of molecular information, the cellular nature of the building blocks of life, multicellularity and development, the threshold nature of computations in cognitive systems and the discrete nature of the architecture of ecosystems. In all these examples, we present available evidence and suggest potential avenues towards a well-defined theoretical formulation.

Abstract:
Current use of microbes for metabolic engineering suffers from loss of metabolic output due to natural selection. Rather than combat the evolution of bacterial populations, we chose to embrace what makes biological engineering unique among engineering fields – evolving materials. We harnessed bacteria to compute solutions to the biological problem of metabolic pathway optimization. Our approach is called Programmed Evolution to capture two concepts. First, a population of cells is programmed with DNA code to enable it to compute solutions to a chosen optimization problem. As analog computers, bacteria process known and unknown inputs and direct the output of their biochemical hardware. Second, the system employs the evolution of bacteria toward an optimal metabolic solution by imposing fitness defined by metabolic output. The current study is a proof-of-concept for Programmed Evolution applied to the optimization of a metabolic pathway for the conversion of caffeine to theophylline in E. coli . Introduced genotype variations included strength of the promoter and ribosome binding site, plasmid copy number, and chaperone proteins. We constructed 24 strains using all combinations of the genetic variables. We used a theophylline riboswitch and a tetracycline resistance gene to link theophylline production to fitness. After subjecting the mixed population to selection, we measured a change in the distribution of genotypes in the population and an increased conversion of caffeine to theophylline among the most fit strains, demonstrating Programmed Evolution. Programmed Evolution inverts the standard paradigm in metabolic engineering by harnessing evolution instead of fighting it. Our modular system enables researchers to program bacteria and use evolution to determine the combination of genetic control elements that optimizes catabolic or anabolic output and to maintain it in a population of cells. Programmed Evolution could be used for applications in energy, pharmaceuticals, chemical commodities, biomining, and bioremediation.

Title: The Role of AI-Driven De Novo Protein Design in the Exploration of the Protein Functional Universe
Authors: Guohao Zhang, Chuanyang Liu, Jiajie Lu, Shaowei Zhang, Lingyun Zhu
Date: 2025-09-15

Abstract:
Proteins are the molecular machines of life, essential for countless processes from building cellular structures to fighting disease. Nature has created a stunning array of these molecules, but this diversity is merely a glimpse of what is theoretically possible. This vast, untapped potential holds promise for solutions to some of our biggest challenges, such as cleaning up pollution, curing diseases, and creating new materials. Exploring these possibilities by experiments alone is impossibly slow and expensive. This review explains how artificial intelligence (AI) is changing the game. AI now allows us to design entirely new proteins de novo on a computer, predicting how they will fold and function. This powerful approach is yielding breakthroughs across biotechnology at an unprecedented pace. As AI continues to evolve, it promises to unlock a new era of biological engineering, providing custom-made protein tools for advances in medicine, agriculture, and green technology.

Title: Designing synthetic RNAs to determine the relevance of structural motifs in picornavirus IRES elements
Authors: Javier Fernandez-Chamorro, Gloria Lozano, Juan Antonio Garcia-Martin, Jorge Ramajo, Ivan Dotu, Peter Clote, Encarnacion Martinez-Salas
Date: 2016-04-07

Abstract:
The function of Internal Ribosome Entry Site (IRES) elements is intimately linked to their RNA structure. Viral IRES elements are organized in modular domains consisting of one or more stem-loops that harbor conserved RNA motifs critical for internal initiation of translation. A conserved motif is the pyrimidine-tract located upstream of the functional initiation codon in type I and II picornavirus IRES. By computationally designing synthetic RNAs to fold into a structure that sequesters the polypyrimidine tract in a hairpin, we establish a correlation between predicted inaccessibility of the pyrimidine tract and IRES activity, as determined in both in vitro and in vivo systems. Our data supports the hypothesis that structural sequestration of the pyrimidine-tract within a stable hairpin inactivates IRES activity, since the stronger the stability of the hairpin the higher the inhibition of protein synthesis. Destabilization of the stem-loop immediately upstream of the pyrimidine-tract also decreases IRES activity. Our work introduces a hybrid computational/experimental method to determine the importance of structural motifs for biological function. Specifically, we show the feasibility of using the software RNAiFold to design synthetic RNAs with particular sequence and structural motifs that permit subsequent experimental determination of the importance of such motifs for biological function.

Title: Are There Biomimetic Lessons from Genetic Regulatory Networks for Developing a Lunar Industrial Ecology?
Authors: Alex Ellery
Date: 2021-08-09

Abstract:
We examine the prospect for employing a bio-inspired architecture for a lunar industrial ecology based on genetic regulatory networks. The lunar industrial ecology resembles a metabolic system in that it comprises multiple chemical processes interlinked through waste recycling. Initially, we examine lessons from factory organisation which have evolved into a bio-inspired concept, the reconfigurable holonic architecture. We then examine genetic regulatory networks and their application in the biological cell cycle. There are numerous subtleties that would be challenging to implement in a lunar industrial ecology but much of the essence of biological circuitry (as implemented in synthetic biology, for example) is captured by traditional electrical engineering design with emphasis on feedforward and feedback loops to implement robustness.

Title: Macrobiont: Cradle for the Origin of Life and Creation of a Biosphere
Authors: Benton C. Clark, Vera M. Kolb
Date: 2020-11-12

Abstract:
Although the cellular microorganism is the fundamental unit of biology, the origin of life (OoL) itself is unlikely to have occurred in a microscale environment. The macrobiont (MB) is the macro-scale setting where life originated. Guided by the methodologies of Systems Analysis, we focus on subaerial ponds of scale 3 to 300 m diameter. Within such ponds, there can be substantial heterogeneity, on the vertical, horizontal, and temporal scales, which enable multi-pot prebiotic chemical evolution. Pond size-sensitivities for several figures of merit are mathematically formulated, leading to the expectation that the optimum pond size for the OoL is intermediate, but biased toward smaller sizes. Sensitivities include relative access to nutrients, energy sources, and catalysts, as sourced from geological, atmospheric, hydrospheric, and astronomical contributors. Foreshores, especially with mudcracks, are identified as a favorable component for the success of the macrobiont. To bridge the gap between inanimate matter and a planetary-scale biosphere, five stages of evolution within the macrobiont are hypothesized: prebiotic chemistry → molecular replicator → protocell → macrobiont cell → colonizer cell. Comparison of ponds with other macrobionts, including hydrothermal and meteorite settings, allows a conclusion that more than one possible macrobiont locale could enable an OoL.

Abstract:
Proteomics is the large scale study of protein structure
and function
from biological systems through protein identification and quantification.
“Shotgun proteomics” or “bottom-up proteomics”
is the prevailing strategy, in which proteins are hydrolyzed into
peptides that are analyzed by mass spectrometry. Proteomics studies
can be applied to diverse studies ranging from simple protein identification
to studies of proteoforms, protein-protein interactions, protein structural
alterations, absolute and relative protein quantification, post-translational
modifications, and protein stability. To enable this range of different
experiments, there are diverse strategies for proteome analysis. The
nuances of how proteomic workflows differ may be challenging to understand
for new practitioners. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of
different proteomics methods. We cover from biochemistry basics and
protein extraction to biological interpretation and orthogonal validation.
We expect this Review will serve as a handbook for researchers who
are new to the field of bottom-up proteomics.

Abstract:
Despite
tremendous
efforts in the past two years, our understanding
of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), virus–host
interactions, immune response, virulence, transmission, and evolution
is still very limited. This limitation calls for further in-depth
investigation. Computational studies have become an indispensable
component in combating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to
their low cost, their efficiency, and the fact that they are free
from safety and ethical constraints. Additionally, the mechanism that
governs the global evolution and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 cannot
be revealed from individual experiments and was discovered by integrating
genotyping of massive viral sequences, biophysical modeling of protein–protein
interactions, deep mutational data, deep learning, and advanced mathematics.
There exists a tsunami of literature on the molecular modeling, simulations,
and predictions of SARS-CoV-2 and related developments of drugs, vaccines,
antibodies, and diagnostics. To provide readers with a quick update
about this literature, we present a comprehensive and systematic methodology-centered
review. Aspects such as molecular biophysics, bioinformatics, cheminformatics,
machine learning, and mathematics are discussed. This review will
be beneficial to researchers who are looking for ways to contribute
to SARS-CoV-2 studies and those who are interested in the status of
the field.

Title: Full Design Automation of Multi-State RNA Devices to Program Gene Expression Using Energy-Based Optimization
Authors: Guillermo Rodrigo, Thomas E. Landrain, Eszter Majer, José-Antonio Daròs, Alfonso Jaramillo
Date: 2013-08

Abstract:
Small RNAs (sRNAs) can operate as regulatory agents to control protein expression by interaction with the 5′ untranslated region of the mRNA. We have developed a physicochemical framework, relying on base pair interaction energies, to design multi-state sRNA devices by solving an optimization problem with an objective function accounting for the stability of the transition and final intermolecular states. Contrary to the analysis of the reaction kinetics of an ensemble of sRNAs, we solve the inverse problem of finding sequences satisfying targeted reactions. We show here that our objective function correlates well with measured riboregulatory activity of a set of mutants. This has enabled the application of the methodology for an extended design of RNA devices with specified behavior, assuming different molecular interaction models based on Watson-Crick interaction. We designed several YES, NOT, AND, and OR logic gates, including the design of combinatorial riboregulators. In sum, our de novo approach provides a new paradigm in synthetic biology to design molecular interaction mechanisms facilitating future high-throughput functional sRNA design.

Title: Evolution of Pyrrolysyl-tRNA Synthetase: From Methanogenesis
to Genetic Code Expansion
Authors: Nikolaj G. Koch, Nediljko Budisa
Date: 2024-07-02

Abstract:
Over 20 years ago,
the pyrrolysine encoding translation system
was discovered in specific archaea. Our Review provides an overview
of how the once obscure pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase (PylRS) tRNA pair,
originally responsible for accurately translating enzymes crucial
in methanogenic metabolic pathways, laid the foundation for the burgeoning
field of genetic code expansion. Our primary focus is the discussion
of how to successfully engineer the PylRS to recognize new substrates
and exhibit higher in vivo activity. We have compiled
a comprehensive list of ncAAs incorporable with the PylRS system.
Additionally, we also summarize recent successful applications of
the PylRS system in creating innovative therapeutic solutions, such
as new antibody–drug conjugates, advancements in vaccine modalities,
and the potential production of new antimicrobials.

Abstract:
Genome editing for therapeutic applications often requires cleavage within a narrow sequence window. Here, to enable such high-precision targeting with zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs), we have developed an expanded set of architectures that collectively increase the configurational options available for design by a factor of 64. These new architectures feature the functional attachment of the FokI cleavage domain to the amino terminus of one or both zinc-finger proteins (ZFPs) in the ZFN dimer, as well as the option to skip bases between the target triplets of otherwise adjacent fingers in each zinc-finger array. Using our new architectures, we demonstrate targeting of an arbitrarily chosen 28 bp genomic locus at a density that approaches 1.0 (i.e., efficient ZFNs available for targeting almost every base step). We show that these new architectures may be used for targeting three loci of therapeutic significance with a high degree of precision, efficiency, and specificity.

Title: antaRNA – Multi-objective inverse folding of pseudoknot RNA using ant-colony optimization
Authors: Robert Kleinkauf, Torsten Houwaart, Rolf Backofen, Martin Mann
Date: 2015-11-18

Abstract:
Many functional RNA molecules fold into pseudoknot structures, which are often essential for the formation of an RNA’s 3D structure. Currently the design of RNA molecules, which fold into a specific structure (known as RNA inverse folding) within biotechnological applications, is lacking the feature of incorporating pseudoknot structures into the design. Hairpin-(H)- and kissing hairpin-(K)-type pseudoknots cover a wide range of biologically functional pseudoknots and can be represented on a secondary structure level. The RNA inverse folding program antaRNA, which takes secondary structure, target GC-content and sequence constraints as input, is extended to provide solutions for such H- and K-type pseudoknotted secondary structure constraint. We demonstrate the easy and flexible interchangeability of modules within the antaRNA framework by incorporating pKiss as structure prediction tool capable of predicting the mentioned pseudoknot types. The performance of the approach is demonstrated on a subset of the Pseudobase ++ dataset. This new service is available via a standalone version and is also part of the Freiburg RNA Tools webservice. Furthermore, antaRNA is available in Galaxy and is part of the RNA-workbench Docker image.

Title: Unveiling the role of inorganic nanoparticles in Earth’s biochemical evolution through electron transfer dynamics
Authors: Xiao-Lan Huang
Date: 2024-05-17

Abstract:
This article explores the intricate interplay between inorganic nanoparticles and Earth’s biochemical history, with a focus on their electron transfer properties. It reveals how iron oxide and sulfide nanoparticles, as examples of inorganic nanoparticles, exhibit oxidoreductase activity similar to proteins. Termed “life fossil oxidoreductases," these inorganic enzymes influence redox reactions, detoxification processes, and nutrient cycling in early Earth environments. By emphasizing the structural configuration of nanoparticles and their electron conformation, including oxygen defects and metal vacancies, especially electron hopping, the article provides a foundation for understanding inorganic enzyme mechanisms. This approach, rooted in physics, underscores that life’s origin and evolution are governed by electron transfer principles within the framework of chemical equilibrium. Today, these nanoparticles serve as vital biocatalysts in natural ecosystems, participating in critical reactions for ecosystem health. The research highlights their enduring impact on Earth’s history, shaping ecosystems and interacting with protein metal centers through shared electron transfer dynamics, offering insights into early life processes and adaptations.

Title: Stochastic tuning of gene expression enables cellular adaptation in the absence of pre-existing regulatory circuitry
Authors: Lydia Freddolino, Jamie Yang, Amir Momen-Roknabadi, Saeed Tavazoie
Date: 2018-04-05

Abstract:
Cells adapt to familiar changes in their environment by activating predefined regulatory programs that establish adaptive gene expression states. These hard-wired pathways, however, may be inadequate for adaptation to environments never encountered before. Here, we reveal evidence for an alternative mode of gene regulation that enables adaptation to adverse conditions without relying on external sensory information or genetically predetermined cis -regulation. Instead, individual genes achieve optimal expression levels through a stochastic search for improved fitness. By focusing on improving the overall health of the cell, the proposed stochastic tuning mechanism discovers global gene expression states that are fundamentally new and yet optimized for novel environments. We provide experimental evidence for stochastic tuning in the adaptation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to laboratory-engineered environments that are foreign to its native gene-regulatory network. Stochastic tuning operates locally at individual gene promoters, and its efficacy is modulated by perturbations to chromatin modification machinery.

Authors: Xiaomei Lyu, Yan Lyu, Hongwei Yu, WeiNing Chen, Lidan Ye, Ruijin Yang
Date: 2022-01-28

Abstract:
In current years, natural pigments are facing a fast-growing global market due to the increase of people’s awareness of health and the discovery of novel pharmacological effects of various natural pigments, e.g., carotenoids, flavonoids, and curcuminoids. However, the traditional production approaches are source-dependent and generally subject to the low contents of target pigment compounds. In order to scale-up industrial production, many efforts have been devoted to increasing pigment production from natural producers, via development of both in vitro plant cell/tissue culture systems, as well as optimization of microbial cultivation approaches. Moreover, synthetic biology has opened the door for heterologous biosynthesis of pigments via design and re-construction of novel biological modules as well as biological systems in bio-platforms. In this review, the innovative methods and strategies for optimization and engineering of both native and heterologous producers of natural pigments are comprehensively summarized. Current progress in the production of several representative high-value natural pigments is also presented; and the remaining challenges and future perspectives are discussed.

Date: 2023-03-02

Abstract:
It is unclear how gene order within the chromosome influences genome evolution. Bacteria cluster transcription and translation genes close to the replication origin ( oriC ). In Vibrio cholerae , relocation of s10-spc-α locus (S10), the major locus of ribosomal protein genes, to ectopic genomic positions shows that its relative distance to the oriC correlates to a reduction in growth rate, fitness, and infectivity. To test the long-term impact of this trait, we evolved 12 populations of V. cholerae strains bearing S10 at an oriC -proximal or an oriC -distal location for 1,000 generations. During the first 250 generations, positive selection was the main force driving mutation. After 1,000 generations, we observed more nonadaptative mutations and hypermutator genotypes. Populations fixed inactivating mutations at many genes linked to virulence: flagellum, chemotaxis, biofilm, and quorum sensing. Throughout the experiment, all populations increased their growth rates. However, those bearing S10 close to oriC remained the fittest, indicating that suppressor mutations cannot compensate for the genomic position of the main ribosomal protein locus. Selection and sequencing of the fastest-growing clones allowed us to characterize mutations inactivating, among other sites, flagellum master regulators. Reintroduction of these mutations into the wild-type context led to a ≈10% growth improvement. In conclusion, the genomic location of ribosomal protein genes conditions the evolutionary trajectory of V. cholerae . While genomic content is highly plastic in prokaryotes, gene order is an underestimated factor that conditions cellular physiology and evolution. A lack of suppression enables artificial gene relocation as a tool for genetic circuit reprogramming.

Title: Maximum Entropy Production Theorem for Transitions between Enzyme Functional States and Its Applications
Authors: Davor Juretić, Juraj Simunić, Željana Bonačić Lošić
Date: 2019-07-29

Abstract:
Transitions between enzyme functional states are often connected to conformational changes involving electron or proton transport and directional movements of a group of atoms. These microscopic fluxes, resulting in entropy production, are driven by non-equilibrium concentrations of substrates and products. Maximal entropy production exists for any chosen transition, but such a maximal transitional entropy production (MTEP) requirement does not ensure an increase of total entropy production, nor an increase in catalytic performance. We examine when total entropy production increases, together with an increase in the performance of an enzyme or bioenergetic system. The applications of the MTEP theorem for transitions between functional states are described for the triosephosphate isomerase, ATP synthase, for β-lactamases, and for the photochemical cycle of bacteriorhodopsin. The rate-limiting steps can be easily identified as those which are the most efficient in dissipating free-energy gradients and in performing catalysis. The last step in the catalytic cycle is usually associated with the highest free-energy dissipation involving proton nanocurents. This recovery rate-limiting step can be optimized for higher efficiency by using corresponding MTEP requirements. We conclude that biological evolution, leading to increased optimal catalytic efficiency, also accelerated the thermodynamic evolution, the synergistic relationship we named the evolution-coupling hypothesis.

Title: Molecular basis of genetic variation of viruses
Authors: Esteban Domingo
Date: 2020

Abstract:
Genetic variation is a necessity of all biological systems. Viruses use all known mechanisms of variation; mutation, several forms of recombination, and segment reassortment in the case of viruses with a segmented genome. These processes are intimately connected with the replicative machineries of viruses, as well as with fundamental physical-chemical properties of nucleotides when acting as template or substrate residues. Recombination has been viewed as a means to rescue viable genomes from unfit parents or to produce large modifications for the exploration of phenotypic novelty. All types of genetic variation can act conjointly as blind processes to provide the raw materials for adaptation to the changing environments in which viruses must replicate. A distinction is made between mechanistically unavoidable and evolutionarily relevant mutation and recombination.

Title: Protein Engineering Strategies to Expand CRISPR-Cas9 Applications
Authors: Lucas F. Ribeiro, Liliane F. C. Ribeiro, Matheus Q. Barreto, Richard J. Ward
Date: 2018

Abstract:
The development of precise and modulated methods for customized manipulation of DNA is an important objective for the study and engineering of biological processes and is essential for the optimization of gene therapy, metabolic flux, and synthetic gene networks. The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat- (CRISPR-) associated protein 9 is an RNA-guided site-specific DNA-binding complex that can be reprogrammed to specifically interact with a desired DNA sequence target. CRISPR-Cas9 has been used in a wide variety of applications ranging from basic science to the clinic, such as gene therapy, gene regulation, modifying epigenomes, and imaging chromosomes. Although Cas9 has been successfully used as a precise tool in all these applications, some limitations have also been reported, for instance (i) a strict dependence on a protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) sequence, (ii) aberrant off-target activity, (iii) the large size of Cas9 is problematic for CRISPR delivery, and (iv) lack of modulation of protein binding and endonuclease activity, which is crucial for precise spatiotemporal control of gene expression or genome editing. These obstacles hinder the use of CRISPR for disease treatment and in wider biotechnological applications. Protein-engineering approaches offer solutions to overcome the limitations of Cas9 and generate robust and efficient tools for customized DNA manipulation. Here, recent protein-engineering approaches for expanding the versatility of the Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9) is reviewed, with an emphasis on studies that improve or develop novel protein functions through domain fusion or splitting, rational design, and directed evolution.

Abstract:
Antibodies play a crucial role in defending the human body against diseases, including life-threatening conditions like cancer. They mediate immune responses against foreign antigens and, in some cases, self-antigens. Over time, antibody-based technologies have evolved from monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T cells), significantly impacting biotechnology, diagnostics, and therapeutics. Although these advancements have enhanced therapeutic interventions, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing antibody design and optimization. This review explores recent AI advancements, including large language models (LLMs), diffusion models, and generative AI-based applications, which have transformed antibody discovery by accelerating de novo generation, enhancing immune response precision, and optimizing therapeutic efficacy. Through advanced data analysis, AI enables the prediction and design of antibody sequences, 3D structures, complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), paratopes, epitopes, and antigen–antibody interactions. These AI-powered innovations address longstanding challenges in antibody development, significantly improving speed, specificity, and accuracy in therapeutic design. By integrating computational advancements with biomedical applications, AI is driving next-generation cancer therapies, transforming precision medicine, and enhancing patient outcomes.

Title: Analysis of Microsatellite Variation in Drosophila melanogaster with Population-Scale Genome Sequencing
Authors: John W. Fondon, Andy Martin, Stephen Richards, Richard A. Gibbs, David Mittelman
Date: 2012

Abstract:
Genome sequencing technologies promise to revolutionize our understanding of genetics, evolution, and disease by making it feasible to survey a broad spectrum of sequence variation on a population scale. However, this potential can only be realized to the extent that methods for extracting and interpreting distinct forms of variation can be established. The error profiles and read length limitations of early versions of next-generation sequencing technologies rendered them ineffective for some sequence variant types, particularly microsatellites and other tandem repeats, and fostered the general misconception that such variants are inherently inaccessible to these platforms. At the same time, tandem repeats have emerged as important sources of functional variation. Tandem repeats are often located in and around genes, and frequent mutations in their lengths exert quantitative effects on gene function and phenotype, rapidly degrading linkage disequilibrium between markers and traits. Sensitive identification of these variants in large-scale next-gen sequencing efforts will enable more comprehensive association studies capable of revealing previously invisible associations. We present a population-scale analysis of microsatellite repeats using whole-genome data from 158 inbred isolates from the Drosophila Genetics Reference Panel, a collection of over 200 extensively phenotypically characterized isolates from a single natural population, to uncover processes underlying repeat mutation and to enable associations with behavioral, morphological, and life-history traits. Analysis of repeat variation from next-generation sequence data will also enhance studies of genome stability and neurodegenerative diseases.

Abstract:
Allosteric transcription factors (aTFs) have proven widely applicable for biotechnology and synthetic biology as ligand-specific biosensors enabling real-time monitoring, selection and regulation of cellular metabolism. However, both the biosensor specificity and the correlation between ligand concentration and biosensor output signal, also known as the transfer function, often needs to be optimized before meeting application needs. Here, we present a versatile and high-throughput method to evolve prokaryotic aTF specificity and transfer functions in a eukaryote chassis, namely baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae . From a single round of mutagenesis of the effector-binding domain (EBD) coupled with various toggled selection regimes, we robustly select aTF variants of the cis,cis -muconic acid-inducible transcription factor BenM evolved for change in ligand specificity, increased dynamic output range, shifts in operational range, and a complete inversion-of-function from activation to repression. Importantly, by targeting only the EBD, the evolved biosensors display DNA-binding affinities similar to BenM, and are functional when ported back into a prokaryotic chassis. The developed platform technology thus leverages aTF evolvability for the development of new host-agnostic biosensors with user-defined small-molecule specificities and transfer functions.

Abstract:
Network biology is an interdisciplinary field bridging computational and biological sciences that has proved pivotal in advancing the understanding of cellular functions and diseases across biological systems and scales. Although the field has been around for two decades, it remains nascent. It has witnessed rapid evolution, accompanied by emerging challenges. These stem from various factors, notably the growing complexity and volume of data together with the increased diversity of data types describing different tiers of biological organization. We discuss prevailing research directions in network biology, focusing on molecular/cellular networks but also on other biological network types such as biomedical knowledge graphs, patient similarity networks, brain networks, and social/contact networks relevant to disease spread. In more detail, we highlight areas of inference and comparison of biological networks, multimodal data integration and heterogeneous networks, higher-order network analysis, machine learning on networks, and network-based personalized medicine. Following the overview of recent breakthroughs across these five areas, we offer a perspective on future directions of network biology. Additionally, we discuss scientific communities, educational initiatives, and the importance of fostering diversity within the field. This article establishes a roadmap for an immediate and long-term vision for network biology. Not applicable.

Title: More evolvable bacteriophages better suppress their host
Authors: Elijah K. Horwitz, Hannah M. Strobel, Jason Haiso, Justin R. Meyer
Date: 2024-07-04

Abstract:
The number of multidrug‐resistant strains of bacteria is increasing rapidly, while the number of new antibiotic discoveries has stagnated. This trend has caused a surge in interest in bacteriophages as anti‐bacterial therapeutics, in part because there is near limitless diversity of phages to harness. While this diversity provides an opportunity, it also creates the dilemma of having to decide which criteria to use to select phages. Here we test whether a phage's ability to coevolve with its host (evolvability) should be considered and how this property compares to two previously proposed criteria: fast reproduction and thermostability. To do this, we compared the suppressiveness of three phages that vary by a single amino acid yet differ in these traits such that each strain maximized two of three characteristics. Our studies revealed that both evolvability and reproductive rate are independently important. The phage most able to suppress bacterial populations was the strain with high evolvability and reproductive rate, yet this phage was unstable. Phages varied due to differences in the types of resistance evolved against them and their ability to counteract resistance. When conditions were shifted to exaggerate the importance of thermostability, one of the stable phages was most suppressive in the short‐term, but not over the long‐term. Our results demonstrate the utility of biological therapeutics' capacities to evolve and adjust in action to resolve complications like resistance evolution. Furthermore, evolvability is a property that can be engineered into phage therapeutics to enhance their effectiveness.

Title: History of antibiotic adaptation influences microbial evolutionary dynamics during subsequent treatment
Authors: Phillip Yen, Jason A. Papin
Date: 2017-08-08

Abstract:
Antibiotic regimens often include the sequential changing of drugs to limit the development and evolution of resistance of bacterial pathogens. It remains unclear how history of adaptation to one antibiotic can influence the resistance profiles when bacteria subsequently adapt to a different antibiotic. Here, we experimentally evolved Pseudomonas aeruginosa to six 2-drug sequences. We observed drug order–specific effects, whereby adaptation to the first drug can limit the rate of subsequent adaptation to the second drug, adaptation to the second drug can restore susceptibility to the first drug, or final resistance levels depend on the order of the 2-drug sequence. These findings demonstrate how resistance not only depends on the current drug regimen but also the history of past regimens. These order-specific effects may allow for rational forecasting of the evolutionary dynamics of bacteria given knowledge of past adaptations and provide support for the need to consider the history of past drug exposure when designing strategies to mitigate resistance and combat bacterial infections.

Title: Improving industrial yeast strains: exploiting natural and artificial diversity
Authors: Jan Steensels, Tim Snoek, Esther Meersman, Martina Picca Nicolino, Karin Voordeckers, Kevin J Verstrepen
Date: 2014-09

Abstract:
Yeasts have been used for thousands of years to make fermented foods and beverages, such as beer, wine, sake, and bread. However, the choice for a particular yeast strain or species for a specific industrial application is often based on historical, rather than scientific grounds. Moreover, new biotechnological yeast applications, such as the production of second-generation biofuels, confront yeast with environments and challenges that differ from those encountered in traditional food fermentations. Together, this implies that there are interesting opportunities to isolate or generate yeast variants that perform better than the currently used strains. Here, we discuss the different strategies of strain selection and improvement available for both conventional and nonconventional yeasts. Exploiting the existing natural diversity and using techniques such as mutagenesis, protoplast fusion, breeding, genome shuffling and directed evolution to generate artificial diversity, or the use of genetic modification strategies to alter traits in a more targeted way, have led to the selection of superior industrial yeasts. Furthermore, recent technological advances allowed the development of high-throughput techniques, such as ‘global transcription machinery engineering’ (gTME), to induce genetic variation, providing a new source of yeast genetic diversity.

Date: 2024-09-20

Abstract:
Isogenic disease models, such as genetically engineered organoids, provide insight into the impact of genetic variants on organ function. Here, we present a protocol to create isogenic disease models from adult stem cell-derived organoids using next-generation CRISPR tools. We describe steps for single guide RNA (sgRNA) design and cloning, electroporation, and selecting electroporated cells. We then detail procedures for clonal line generation. Next-generation CRISPR tools do not require double-stranded break (DSB) induction for their function, thus simplifying in vitro disease model generation. For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to Geurts et al. 1 , 2

Title: From paleness to albinism: Contribution of OCA2 exon 10 skipping to hypopigmentation

Abstract:
Pathogenic variants in the OCA2 gene result in oculocutaneous albinism. In humans and several other mammalian species, OCA2 is transcribed into two coding mRNAs, a major transcript that encodes the full-length protein and a minor transcript that skips in-frame exon 10 and has no identified function. By contrast, rodents and non-mammalian vertebrates only express the major transcript. Several rare variants of human OCA2 have been reported to be pathogenic due to increased exon 10 skipping. To understand the vulnerability of human OCA2 to exon 10 skipping and its impact on pigmentation, we first functionally tested a series of rare missense variants spread across exon 10. We found that each variant significantly influences the skipping ratio either positively or negatively. By combining human and murine sequences in functional assays, we found that the skipping ratio depends on particular exonic and intronic combinations. Next, we focused on the most frequent exonic single nucleotide variant of human OCA2 , rs1800404-T (c.1065G > A/p.Ala355=), located in exon 10. We show that this variant significantly promotes exon 10 skipping on its own and exhibits an additive effect in cis to previously identified splicing variants likely contributing to their pathogenicity. Association studies reveal that rs1800404-T is tightly associated with lighter skin and hair pigmentation in a representative European population, as has been observed in other populations around the world. Our structural models of the skipped transcript-derived protein support causality by predicting that it could exert a dominant-negative effect, which is consistent with a dose-dependent hypopigmentation response in both pathological and physiological contexts. Overall, the modulation of OCA2 exon 10 skipping by both benign and pathogenic variants provides a basis for improving the genetic diagnosis of albinism, and paves the way for research into the molecular and evolutionary mechanisms behind human pigmentation diversity.

Abstract:
The residue-specific incorporation of noncanonical amino
acids
in auxotrophic hosts allows the global exchange of a canonical amino
acid with its noncanonical analog. Noncanonical amino acids are not
encoded by the standard genetic code, but they carry unique side chain
chemistries, e.g., to perform bioorthogonal conjugation reactions
or to manipulate the physicochemical properties of a protein such
as folding and stability. The method was introduced nearly 70 years
ago and is still in widespread use because of its simplicity and robustness.
In our study, we review the trends in the field during the last two
decades. We give an overview of the application of the method for
artificial post-translational protein modifications and the selective
functionalization and directed immobilization of proteins. We highlight
the trends in the use of noncanonical amino acids for the analysis
of nascent proteomes and the engineering of enzymes and biomaterials,
and the progress in the biosynthesis of amino acid analogs. We also
discuss the challenges for the scale-up of the technique.

Title: An Efficient Minimum Free Energy Structure-Based Search Method for Riboswitch Identification Based on Inverse RNA Folding
Authors: Matan Drory Retwitzer, Ilona Kifer, Supratim Sengupta, Zohar Yakhini, Danny Barash
Date: 2015-07-31

Abstract:
Riboswitches are RNA genetic control elements that were originally discovered in bacteria and provide a unique mechanism of gene regulation. They work without the participation of proteins and are believed to represent ancient regulatory systems in the evolutionary timescale. One of the biggest challenges in riboswitch research is to find additional eukaryotic riboswitches since more than 20 riboswitch classes have been found in prokaryotes but only one class has been found in eukaryotes. Moreover, this single known class of eukaryotic riboswitch, namely the TPP riboswitch class, has been found in bacteria, archaea, fungi and plants but not in animals. The few examples of eukaryotic riboswitches were identified using sequence-based bioinformatics search methods such as a combination of BLAST and pattern matching techniques that incorporate base-pairing considerations. None of these approaches perform energy minimization structure predictions. There is a clear motivation to develop new bioinformatics methods, aside of the ongoing advances in covariance models, that will sample the sequence search space more flexibly using structural guidance while retaining the computational efficiency of sequence-based methods. We present a new energy minimization approach that transforms structure-based search into a sequence-based search, thereby enabling the utilization of well established sequence-based search utilities such as BLAST and FASTA. The transformation to sequence space is obtained by using an extended inverse RNA folding problem solver with sequence and structure constraints, available within RNAfbinv. Examples in applying the new method are presented for the purine and preQ1 riboswitches. The method is described in detail along with its findings in prokaryotes. Potential uses in finding novel eukaryotic riboswitches and optimizing pre-designed synthetic riboswitches based on ligand simulations are discussed. The method components are freely available for use.

Title: Programming human cell type-specific gene expression via an atlas of AI-designed enhancers
Authors: Sebastian M. Castillo-Hair, Christopher H. Yin, Leah VandenBosch, Timothy J. Cherry, Wouter Meuleman, Georg Seelig
Date: 2025-09-30

Abstract:
Differentially active enhancers are key drivers of cell type specific gene expression. Active enhancers are found in open chromatin, which can be mapped at genome scale across tissue and cell types. Though incompletely understood, the relationship between chromatin accessibility and enhancer activity has been exploited to identify, model, and even design functional enhancers for selected cell types, but to what extent this design strategy can generalize across human cell and tissue types remains unclear. Here, we trained deep neural networks on a large corpus of chromatin accessibility data from hundreds of human biosamples. We used these models to generate an atlas of tens of thousands of synthetic enhancers, targeting hundreds of cell lines, tissues, and differentiation states, aiming to maximize accessibility in target samples and minimize it in all off-target ones. Experimental testing of thousands of designs in a representative subset of ten human cell types and in mouse retina demonstrated their function as specific enhancers, not only in the case of one-versus-all objectives but also when targeting two or three cell types. An explainable AI analysis, enabled by our large-scale enhancer measurements, allowed us to identify similarities and differences between the sequence grammar underlying accessibility and enhancer activity. Our results show that model-guided design of enhancers can help us decipher the cis-regulatory code governing cell type specificity and generate novel tools for selective targeting of human cell states.

Title: LogicSR: prior-guided symbolic regression for gene regulatory network inference from single-cell transcriptomics data
Authors: Dezhen Zhang, Zhi-Ping Liu, Rui Gao
Date: 2025-11

Abstract:
Deciphering gene regulatory mechanisms from high-dimensional biology data remains a central challenge in modern systems biology, despite the growing availability of single-cell datasets. The difficulty stems partly from the sparsity and noise inherent in single-cell data and partly from the complexity of dynamic combinatorial regulation mediated by transcription factors. In this work, we introduce LogicSR, a computational framework that reconstructs gene regulatory networks from single-cell gene expression data with high accuracy by integrating the mechanistic interpretability of Boolean logical models with the equation-discovery capabilities of symbolic regression. It incorporates prior knowledge into a multi-objective Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) framework, leveraging it to ensure biological plausibility and accelerate the search for optimal governing equations. LogicSR outperforms existing methods on both synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets. When applied to a human embryonic stem cell dataset, it demonstrates superior performance in elucidating complex combinatorial TF–target gene regulations and identifying key regulators.

Title: Systematic analysis of intrinsic enhancer-promoter compatibility in the mouse genome
Authors: Miguel Martinez-Ara, Federico Comoglio, Joris van Arensbergen, Bas van Steensel
Date: 2022-07-07

Abstract:
Gene expression is in part controlled by cis -regulatory elements (CREs) such as enhancers and repressive elements. Anecdotal evidence has indicated that a CRE and a promoter need to be biochemically compatible for promoter regulation to occur, but this compatibility has remained poorly characterized in mammalian cells. We used high-throughput combinatorial reporter assays to test thousands of CRE-promoter pairs from three Mb-sized genomic regions in mouse cells. This revealed that CREs vary substantially in their promoter compatibility, ranging from striking specificity to broad promiscuity. More than half of the tested CREs exhibit significant promoter selectivity. Housekeeping promoters tend to have similar CRE preferences, but other promoters exhibit a wide diversity of compatibilities. Higher-order transcription factors (TF) motif combinations may account for compatibility. CRE-promoter selectivity does not correlate with looping interactions in the native genomic context, suggesting that chromatin folding and compatibility are two orthogonal mechanisms that confer specificity to gene regulation.

Title: Cell fate decisions, transcription factors and signaling during early retinal development
Authors: Raven Diacou, Prithviraj Nandigrami, Andras Fiser, Wei Liu, Ruth Ashery-Padan, Ales Cvekl
Date: 2022-11

Abstract:
The development of the vertebrate eyes is a complex process starting from anterior-posterior and dorso-ventral patterning of the anterior neural tube, resulting in the formation of the eye field. Symmetrical separation of the eye field at the anterior neural plate is followed by two symmetrical evaginations to generate a pair of optic vesicles. Next, reciprocal invagination of the optic vesicles with surface ectoderm-derived lens placodes generates double-layered optic cups. The inner and outer layers of the optic cups develop into the neural retina and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), respectively. In vitro produced retinal tissues, called retinal organoids, are formed from human pluripotent stem cells, mimicking major steps of retinal differentiation in vivo . This review article summarizes recent progress in our understanding of early eye development, focusing on the formation the eye field, optic vesicles, and early optic cups. Recent single-cell transcriptomic studies are integrated with classical in vivo genetic and functional studies to uncover a range of cellular mechanisms underlying early eye development. The functions of signal transduction pathways and lineage-specific DNA-binding transcription factors are dissected to explain cell-specific regulatory mechanisms underlying cell fate determination during early eye development. The functions of homeodomain (HD) transcription factors Otx2, Pax6, Lhx2, Six3 and Six6, which are required for early eye development, are discussed in detail. Comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms of early eye development provides insight into the molecular and cellular basis of developmental ocular anomalies, such as optic cup coloboma. Lastly, modeling human development and inherited retinal diseases using stem cell-derived retinal organoids generates opportunities to discover novel therapies for retinal diseases.

Title: GenoCAD for iGEM: a grammatical approach to the design of standard-compliant constructs
Authors: Yizhi Cai, Mandy L. Wilson, Jean Peccoud
Date: 2010-05

Abstract:
One of the foundations of synthetic biology is the project to develop libraries of standardized genetic parts that could be assembled quickly and cheaply into large systems. The limitations of the initial BioBrick standard have prompted the development of multiple new standards proposing different avenues to overcome these shortcomings. The lack of compatibility between standards, the compliance of parts with only some of the standards or even the type of constructs that each standard supports have significantly increased the complexity of assembling constructs from standardized parts. Here, we describe computer tools to facilitate the rigorous description of part compositions in the context of a rapidly changing landscape of physical construction methods and standards. A context-free grammar has been developed to model the structure of constructs compliant with six popular assembly standards. Its implementation in GenoCAD makes it possible for users to quickly assemble from a rich library of genetic parts, constructs compliant with any of six existing standards.

Title: Quantitative perturbation-based analysis of gene expression predicts enhancer activity in early Drosophila embryo
Authors: Rupinder Sayal, Jacqueline M Dresch, Irina Pushel, Benjamin R Taylor, David N Arnosti
Date: 2016-05-06

Abstract:
Enhancers constitute one of the major components of regulatory machinery of metazoans. Although several genome-wide studies have focused on finding and locating enhancers in the genomes, the fundamental principles governing their internal architecture and cis -regulatory grammar remain elusive. Here, we describe an extensive, quantitative perturbation analysis targeting the dorsal-ventral patterning gene regulatory network (GRN) controlled by Drosophila NF-κB homolog Dorsal. To understand transcription factor interactions on enhancers, we employed an ensemble of mathematical models, testing effects of cooperativity, repression, and factor potency. Models trained on the dataset correctly predict activity of evolutionarily divergent regulatory regions, providing insights into spatial relationships between repressor and activator binding sites. Importantly, the collective predictions of sets of models were effective at novel enhancer identification and characterization. Our study demonstrates how experimental dataset and modeling can be effectively combined to provide quantitative insights into cis -regulatory information on a genome-wide scale.

Abstract:
The transcription regulatory network inside a eukaryotic cell is defined by the combinatorial actions of transcription factors (TFs). However, TF binding studies in plants are too few in number to produce a general picture of this complex network. In this study, we use large-scale ChIP-seq to reconstruct it in the maize leaf, and train machine-learning models to predict TF binding and co-localization. The resulting network covers 77% of the expressed genes, and shows a scale-free topology and functional modularity like a real-world network. TF binding sequence preferences are conserved within family, while co-binding could be key for their binding specificity. Cross-species comparison shows that core network nodes at the top of the transmission of information being more conserved than those at the bottom. This study reveals the complex and redundant nature of the plant transcription regulatory network, and sheds light on its architecture, organizing principle and evolutionary trajectory.

Title: Grammar rules and exceptions for the language of transcriptional activation domains
Authors: David G. Cooper, Tamara Y. Erkina, Bradley K. Broyles, Caleb A. Class, Alexandre M. Erkine
Date: 2024-11-15

Abstract:
Transcriptional activation domains (ADs) of gene activators have remained enigmatic for decades as short, extremely variable, and structurally disordered sequences. Using a rational design and high throughput in vivo experimentation, we determine the grammar rules and exceptions for the language of ADs. According to identified rules, billions of highly active ADs can be composed of balanced amounts of acidic/aromatic amino acids, with either mixed composition of aromatic residues, or using only one aromatic residue mixed with acidic residues. However, equally active sequences can be composed of only aliphatic leucine and aspartic acid residues. The much rarer LD exceptions have a higher ratio of hydrophobic/acidic balance and display a specific LDL(L/D)DLL motif. For aromatic/acidic Ads, the intermixing of proline residues in context of amphipathic α-helix structures significantly increases the AD activity. The identified grammar rules and exceptions are interpreted in application to the biochemistry of AD function and eukaryotic gene expression.

Abstract:
Advancement of DNA‐synthesis technologies has greatly facilitated the development of synthetic biology tools. However, high‐complexity DNA sequences containing tandems of short repeats are still notoriously difficult to produce synthetically, with commercial DNA synthesis companies usually rejecting orders that exceed specific sequence complexity thresholds. To overcome this limitation, we developed a simple, single‐tube reaction method that enables the generation of DNA sequences containing multiple repetitive elements. Our strategy involves commercial synthesis and PCR amplification of padded sequences that contain the repeats of interest, along with random intervening sequence stuffers that include type IIS restriction enzyme sites. GoldenBraid molecular cloning technology is then employed to remove the stuffers, rejoin the repeats together in a predefined order, and subclone the tandem(s) in a vector using a single‐tube digestion–ligation reaction. In our hands, this new approach is much simpler, more versatile and efficient than previously developed solutions to this problem. As a proof of concept, two different phytohormone‐responsive, synthetic, repetitive proximal promoters were generated and tested in planta in the context of transcriptional reporters. Analysis of transgenic lines carrying the synthetic ethylene‐responsive promoter 10x2EBS‐S10 fused to the GUS reporter gene uncovered several developmentally regulated ethylene response maxima, indicating the utility of this reporter for monitoring the involvement of ethylene in a variety of physiologically relevant processes. These encouraging results suggest that this reporter system can be leveraged to investigate the ethylene response to biotic and abiotic factors with high spatial and temporal resolution.

Title: Efficient approximations of RNA kinetics landscape using non-redundant sampling
Authors: Juraj Michálik, Hélène Touzet, Yann Ponty
Date: 2017-07-15

Abstract:
Kinetics is key to understand many phenomena involving RNAs, such as co-transcriptional folding and riboswitches. Exact out-of-equilibrium studies induce extreme computational demands, leading state-of-the-art methods to rely on approximated kinetics landscapes, obtained using sampling strategies that strive to generate the key landmarks of the landscape topology. However, such methods are impeded by a large level of redundancy within sampled sets. Such a redundancy is uninformative, and obfuscates important intermediate states, leading to an incomplete vision of RNA dynamics. We introduce RNANR, a new set of algorithms for the exploration of RNA kinetics landscapes at the secondary structure level. RNANR considers locally optimal structures, a reduced set of RNA conformations, in order to focus its sampling on basins in the kinetic landscape. Along with an exhaustive enumeration, RNANR implements a novel non-redundant stochastic sampling, and offers a rich array of structural parameters. Our tests on both real and random RNAs reveal that RNANR allows to generate more unique structures in a given time than its competitors, and allows a deeper exploration of kinetics landscapes.

Title: DeviceEditor visual biological CAD canvas
Authors: Joanna Chen, Douglas Densmore, Timothy S Ham, Jay D Keasling, Nathan J Hillson
Date: 2012

Abstract:
Biological Computer Aided Design (bioCAD) assists the de novo design and selection of existing genetic components to achieve a desired biological activity, as part of an integrated design-build-test cycle. To meet the emerging needs of Synthetic Biology, bioCAD tools must address the increasing prevalence of combinatorial library design, design rule specification, and scar-less multi-part DNA assembly. We report the development and deployment of web-based bioCAD software, DeviceEditor, which provides a graphical design environment that mimics the intuitive visual whiteboard design process practiced in biological laboratories. The key innovations of DeviceEditor include visual combinatorial library design, direct integration with scar-less multi-part DNA assembly design automation, and a graphical user interface for the creation and modification of design specification rules. We demonstrate how biological designs are rendered on the DeviceEditor canvas, and we present effective visualizations of genetic component ordering and combinatorial variations within complex designs. DeviceEditor liberates researchers from DNA base-pair manipulation, and enables users to create successful prototypes using standardized, functional, and visual abstractions. Open and documented software interfaces support further integration of DeviceEditor with other bioCAD tools and software platforms. DeviceEditor saves researcher time and institutional resources through correct-by-construction design, the automation of tedious tasks, design reuse, and the minimization of DNA assembly costs.

Title: Finding the target sites of RNA-binding proteins
Authors: Xiao Li, Hilal Kazan, Howard D Lipshitz, Quaid D Morris
Date: 2014-01

Abstract:
RNA–protein interactions differ from DNA–protein interactions because of the central role of RNA secondary structure. Some RNA-binding domains (RBDs) recognize their target sites mainly by their shape and geometry and others are sequence-specific but are sensitive to secondary structure context. A number of small- and large-scale experimental approaches have been developed to measure RNAs associated in vitro and in vivo with RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Generalizing outside of the experimental conditions tested by these assays requires computational motif finding. Often RBP motif finding is done by adapting DNA motif finding methods; but modeling secondary structure context leads to better recovery of RBP-binding preferences. Genome-wide assessment of mRNA secondary structure has recently become possible, but these data must be combined with computational predictions of secondary structure before they add value in predicting in vivo binding. There are two main approaches to incorporating structural information into motif models: supplementing primary sequence motif models with preferred secondary structure contexts (e.g., MEMERIS and RNAcontext) and directly modeling secondary structure recognized by the RBP using stochastic context-free grammars (e.g., CMfinder and RNApromo). The former better reconstruct known binding preferences for sequence-specific RBPs but are not suitable for modeling RBPs that recognize shape and geometry of RNAs. Future work in RBP motif finding should incorporate interactions between multiple RBDs and multiple RBPs in binding to RNA. WIREs RNA 2014, 5:111–130. doi: 10.1002/wrna.1201

Abstract:
Messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines are being used to combat the spread of COVID-19 (refs. 1 – 3 ), but they still exhibit critical limitations caused by mRNA instability and degradation, which are major obstacles for the storage, distribution and efficacy of the vaccine products 4 . Increasing secondary structure lengthens mRNA half-life, which, together with optimal codons, improves protein expression 5 . Therefore, a principled mRNA design algorithm must optimize both structural stability and codon usage. However, owing to synonymous codons, the mRNA design space is prohibitively large—for example, there are around 2.4 × 10 632 candidate mRNA sequences for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. This poses insurmountable computational challenges. Here we provide a simple and unexpected solution using the classical concept of lattice parsing in computational linguistics, where finding the optimal mRNA sequence is analogous to identifying the most likely sentence among similar-sounding alternatives 6 . Our algorithm LinearDesign finds an optimal mRNA design for the spike protein in just 11 minutes, and can concurrently optimize stability and codon usage. LinearDesign substantially improves mRNA half-life and protein expression, and profoundly increases antibody titre by up to 128 times in mice compared to the codon-optimization benchmark on mRNA vaccines for COVID-19 and varicella-zoster virus. This result reveals the great potential of principled mRNA design and enables the exploration of previously unreachable but highly stable and efficient designs. Our work is a timely tool for vaccines and other mRNA-based medicines encoding therapeutic proteins such as monoclonal antibodies and anti-cancer drugs 7 , 8 .

mRNA therapeutics have revolutionized medicine, offering a versatile platform to address previously untreatable diseases. Recent advancements in biotechnology have enabled the efficient production of functional proteins, antibodies, and peptides via mRNA, providing rapid and adaptable solutions for vaccine development and therapeutic interventions. The success of mRNA vaccines, exemplified during the COVID-19 pandemic, underscores their potential for combating infectious diseases with unparalleled speed and scalability. This review explores the latest developments in mRNA technology, including innovations in design, delivery, and disease treatment; modulation of immune response; and the role of AI. Particular emphasis is placed on optimizing mRNA constructs to maximize therapeutic efficacy, new delivery vehicles for mRNA, and the modulations of immune response evoked by mRNA vaccines. The potential applications of mRNA therapeutics in genetic disorders, infectious diseases, and cancer are highlighted, alongside a discussion of existing challenges such as delivery efficiency and production scalability. By integrating molecular biology, RNA technology, and nanotechnology, mRNA therapeutics hold the promise of transforming precision medicine. These advancements offer hope for patients with complex or intractable conditions, paving the way for a new era in targeted therapies and personalized healthcare.

Title: A Biophysical Model for Analysis of Transcription Factor Interaction and Binding Site Arrangement from Genome-Wide Binding Data
Authors: Xin He, Chieh-Chun Chen, Feng Hong, Fang Fang, Saurabh Sinha, Huck-Hui Ng, Sheng Zhong
Date: 2009

Abstract:
How transcription factors (TFs) interact with cis -regulatory sequences and interact with each other is a fundamental, but not well understood, aspect of gene regulation. We present a computational method to address this question, relying on the established biophysical principles. This method, STAP (sequence to affinity prediction), takes into account all combinations and configurations of strong and weak binding sites to analyze large scale transcription factor (TF)-DNA binding data to discover cooperative interactions among TFs, infer sequence rules of interaction and predict TF target genes in new conditions with no TF-DNA binding data. The distinctions between STAP and other statistical approaches for analyzing cis -regulatory sequences include the utility of physical principles and the treatment of the DNA binding data as quantitative representation of binding strengths. Applying this method to the ChIP-seq data of 12 TFs in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells, we found that the strength of TF-DNA binding could be significantly modulated by cooperative interactions among TFs with adjacent binding sites. However, further analysis on five putatively interacting TF pairs suggests that such interactions may be relatively insensitive to the distance and orientation of binding sites. Testing a set of putative Nanog motifs, STAP showed that a novel Nanog motif could better explain the ChIP-seq data than previously published ones. We then experimentally tested and verified the new Nanog motif. A series of comparisons showed that STAP has more predictive power than several state-of-the-art methods for cis -regulatory sequence analysis. We took advantage of this power to study the evolution of TF-target relationship in Drosophila. By learning the TF-DNA interaction models from the ChIP-chip data of D. melanogaster (Mel) and applying them to the genome of D. pseudoobscura (Pse), we found that only about half of the sequences strongly bound by TFs in Mel have high binding affinities in Pse. We show that prediction of functional TF targets from ChIP-chip data can be improved by using the conservation of STAP predicted affinities as an additional filter. STAP is an effective method to analyze binding site arrangements, TF cooperativity, and TF target genes from genome-wide TF-DNA binding data.

Abstract:
The cancer genome has been exhaustively studied upon the advent of Next-Generation Sequencing technologies. Coding and non-coding sequences have been defined as hotspots of genomic variations that affect the naïve gene expression programs established in normal cells, thus working as endogenous drivers of carcinogenesis. In this review, we comprehensively summarize fundamental aspects of gene expression regulation, with emphasis on the impact of sequence and structural variations mapped across non-coding cis-acting elements of genes encoding for tumor-related transcription factors. Chromatin architecture, epigenome reprogramming, transcriptional enhancers and Super-enhancers, oncogene regulation, cutting-edge technologies, and pharmacological treatment are substantially highlighted. Non-coding segments of the human genome are enriched in cis -regulatory modules that constitute functional elements, such as transcriptional enhancers and Super-enhancers. A hallmark of cancer pathogenesis is the dramatic dysregulation of the “archetype” gene expression profiles of normal human cells. Genomic variations can promote such deficiencies when occurring across enhancers and Super-enhancers, since they affect their mechanistic principles, their functional capacity and specificity, and the epigenomic features of the chromatin microenvironment across which these regulatory elements reside. Here, we comprehensively describe: fundamental mechanisms of gene expression dysregulation in cancers that involve genomic abnormalities within enhancers’ and Super-enhancers’ (SEs) sequences, which alter the expression of oncogenic transcription factors (TFs); cutting-edge technologies applied for the analysis of variation-enriched hotspots of the cancer genome; and pharmacological approaches for the treatment of Super-enhancers’ aberrant function. Finally, we provide an intratumor meta-analysis, which highlights that genomic variations in transcription-factor-driven tumors are accompanied overexpression of genes, a portion of which encodes for additional cancer-related transcription factors.

Title: CORECLUST: identification of the conserved CRM grammar together with prediction of gene regulation
Authors: Anna A. Nikulova, Alexander V. Favorov, Roman A. Sutormin, Vsevolod J. Makeev, Andrey A. Mironov
Date: 2012-07

Abstract:
Identification of transcriptional regulatory regions and tracing their internal organization are important for understanding the eukaryotic cell machinery. Cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) of higher eukaryotes are believed to possess a regulatory ‘grammar’, or preferred arrangement of binding sites, that is crucial for proper regulation and thus tends to be evolutionarily conserved. Here, we present a method CORECLUST (COnservative REgulatory CLUster STructure) that predicts CRMs based on a set of positional weight matrices. Given regulatory regions of orthologous and/or co-regulated genes, CORECLUST constructs a CRM model by revealing the conserved rules that describe the relative location of binding sites. The constructed model may be consequently used for the genome-wide prediction of similar CRMs, and thus detection of co-regulated genes, and for the investigation of the regulatory grammar of the system. Compared with related methods, CORECLUST shows better performance at identification of CRMs conferring muscle-specific gene expression in vertebrates and early-developmental CRMs in Drosophila .

Title: Deciphering enhancer sequence using thermodynamics-based models and convolutional neural networks
Authors: Payam Dibaeinia, Saurabh Sinha
Date: 2021-10-11

Abstract:
Deciphering the sequence-function relationship encoded in enhancers holds the key to interpreting non-coding variants and understanding mechanisms of transcriptomic variation. Several quantitative models exist for predicting enhancer function and underlying mechanisms; however, there has been no systematic comparison of these models characterizing their relative strengths and shortcomings. Here, we interrogated a rich data set of neuroectodermal enhancers in Drosophila , representing cis - and trans - sources of expression variation, with a suite of biophysical and machine learning models. We performed rigorous comparisons of thermodynamics-based models implementing different mechanisms of activation, repression and cooperativity. Moreover, we developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) model, called CoNSEPT, that learns enhancer ‘grammar’ in an unbiased manner. CoNSEPT is the first general-purpose CNN tool for predicting enhancer function in varying conditions, such as different cell types and experimental conditions, and we show that such complex models can suggest interpretable mechanisms. We found model-based evidence for mechanisms previously established for the studied system, including cooperative activation and short-range repression. The data also favored one hypothesized activation mechanism over another and suggested an intriguing role for a direct, distance-independent repression mechanism. Our modeling shows that while fundamentally different models can yield similar fits to data, they vary in their utility for mechanistic inference.

Authors: SJ Gosai, RI Castro, N Fuentes, JC Butts, S Kales, RR Noche, K Mouri, PC Sabeti, SK Reilly, R Tewhey
Date: 2023-08-09

Abstract:
Cis -regulatory elements (CREs) control gene expression, orchestrating tissue identity, developmental timing, and stimulus responses, which collectively define the thousands of unique cell types in the body. While there is great potential for strategically incorporating CREs in therapeutic or biotechnology applications that require tissue specificity, there is no guarantee that an optimal CRE for an intended purpose has arisen naturally through evolution. Here, we present a platform to engineer and validate synthetic CREs capable of driving gene expression with programmed cell type specificity. We leverage innovations in deep neural network modeling of CRE activity across three cell types, efficient in silico optimization, and massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) to design and empirically test thousands of CREs. Through in vitro and in vivo validation, we show that synthetic sequences outperform natural sequences from the human genome in driving cell type-specific expression. Synthetic sequences leverage unique sequence syntax to promote activity in the on-target cell type and simultaneously reduce activity in off-target cells. Together, we provide a generalizable framework to prospectively engineer CREs and demonstrate the required literacy to write regulatory code that is fit-for-purpose in vivo across vertebrates.

Title: Modeling the Evolution of Regulatory Elements by Simultaneous Detection and Alignment with Phylogenetic Pair HMMs
Authors: William H. Majoros, Uwe Ohler
Date: 2010-12

Abstract:
The computational detection of regulatory elements in DNA is a difficult but important problem impacting our progress in understanding the complex nature of eukaryotic gene regulation. Attempts to utilize cross-species conservation for this task have been hampered both by evolutionary changes of functional sites and poor performance of general-purpose alignment programs when applied to non-coding sequence. We describe a new and flexible framework for modeling binding site evolution in multiple related genomes, based on phylogenetic pair hidden Markov models which explicitly model the gain and loss of binding sites along a phylogeny. We demonstrate the value of this framework for both the alignment of regulatory regions and the inference of precise binding-site locations within those regions. As the underlying formalism is a stochastic, generative model, it can also be used to simulate the evolution of regulatory elements. Our implementation is scalable in terms of numbers of species and sequence lengths and can produce alignments and binding-site predictions with accuracy rivaling or exceeding current systems that specialize in only alignment or only binding-site prediction. We demonstrate the validity and power of various model components on extensive simulations of realistic sequence data and apply a specific model to study Drosophila enhancers in as many as ten related genomes and in the presence of gain and loss of binding sites. Different models and modeling assumptions can be easily specified, thus providing an invaluable tool for the exploration of biological hypotheses that can drive improvements in our understanding of the mechanisms and evolution of gene regulation.

Title: Discovery of cell-type specific DNA motif grammar in cis-regulatory elements using random Forest
Authors: Xin Wang, Peijie Lin, Joshua W. K. Ho
Date: 2018-01-19

Abstract:
It has been observed that many transcription factors (TFs) can bind to different genomic loci depending on the cell type in which a TF is expressed in, even though the individual TF usually binds to the same core motif in different cell types. How a TF can bind to the genome in such a highly cell-type specific manner, is a critical research question. One hypothesis is that a TF requires co-binding of different TFs in different cell types. If this is the case, it may be possible to observe different combinations of TF motifs – a motif grammar – located at the TF binding sites in different cell types. In this study, we develop a bioinformatics method to systematically identify DNA motifs in TF binding sites across multiple cell types based on published ChIP-seq data, and address two questions: (1) can we build a machine learning classifier to predict cell-type specificity based on motif combinations alone, and (2) can we extract meaningful cell-type specific motif grammars from this classifier model. We present a Random Forest (RF) based approach to build a multi-class classifier to predict the cell-type specificity of a TF binding site given its motif content. We applied this RF classifier to two published ChIP-seq datasets of TF (TCF7L2 and MAX) across multiple cell types. Using cross-validation, we show that motif combinations alone are indeed predictive of cell types. Furthermore, we present a rule mining approach to extract the most discriminatory rules in the RF classifier, thus allowing us to discover the underlying cell-type specific motif grammar. Our bioinformatics analysis supports the hypothesis that combinatorial TF motif patterns are cell-type specific.

Date: 2020-11-23

Abstract:
From cellular activation to drug combinations, immunological responses are shaped by the action of multiple stimuli. Synergistic and antagonistic interactions between stimuli play major roles in shaping immune processes. To understand combinatorial regulation, we present the immune Synergistic/Antagonistic Interaction Learner (iSAIL). iSAIL includes a machine learning classifier to map and interpret interactions, a curated compendium of immunological combination treatment datasets, and their global integration into a landscape of ~30,000 interactions. The landscape is mined to reveal combinatorial control of interleukins, checkpoints, and other immune modulators. The resource helps elucidate the modulation of a stimulus by interactions with other cofactors, showing that TNF has strikingly different effects depending on co-stimulators. We discover new functional synergies between TNF and IFNβ controlling dendritic cell-T cell crosstalk. Analysis of laboratory or public combination treatment studies with this user-friendly web-based resource will help resolve the complex role of interaction effects on immune processes.

Title: The regulatory landscape of 5′ UTRs in translational control during zebrafish embryogenesis
Authors: Madalena M. Reimão-Pinto, Sebastian M. Castillo-Hair, Georg Seelig, Alex F. Schier
Date: 2023-11-23

Abstract:
The 5′ UTRs of mRNAs are critical for translation regulation, but their in vivo regulatory features are poorly characterized. Here, we report the regulatory landscape of 5′ UTRs during early zebrafish embryogenesis using a massively parallel reporter assay of 18,154 sequences coupled to polysome profiling. We found that the 5′ UTR is sufficient to confer temporal dynamics to translation initiation, and identified 86 motifs enriched in 5′ UTRs with distinct ribosome recruitment capabilities. A quantitative deep learning model, DaniO5P, revealed a combined role for 5′ UTR length, translation initiation site context, upstream AUGs and sequence motifs on in vivo ribosome recruitment. DaniO5P predicts the activities of 5′ UTR isoforms and indicates that modulating 5′ UTR length and motif grammar contributes to translation initiation dynamics. This study provides a first quantitative model of 5′ UTR-based translation regulation in early vertebrate development and lays the foundation for identifying the underlying molecular effectors.

Title: Modular combinatorial binding among human trans -acting factors reveals direct and indirect factor binding
Authors: Yuchun Guo, David K. Gifford
Date: 2017-01-06

Abstract:
The combinatorial binding of trans -acting factors (TFs) to the DNA is critical to the spatial and temporal specificity of gene regulation. For certain regulatory regions, more than one regulatory module (set of TFs that bind together) are combined to achieve context-specific gene regulation. However, previous approaches are limited to either pairwise TF co-association analysis or assuming that only one module is used in each regulatory region. We present a new computational approach that models the modular organization of TF combinatorial binding. Our method learns compact and coherent regulatory modules from in vivo binding data using a topic model. We found that the binding of 115 TFs in K562 cells can be organized into 49 interpretable modules. Furthermore, we found that tens of thousands of regulatory regions use multiple modules, a structure that cannot be observed with previous hard clustering based methods. The modules discovered recapitulate many published protein-protein physical interactions, have consistent functional annotations of chromatin states, and uncover context specific co-binding such as gene proximal binding of NFY + FOS + SP and distal binding of NFY + FOS + USF. For certain TFs, the co-binding partners of direct binding (motif present) differs from those of indirect binding (motif absent); the distinct set of co-binding partners can predict whether the TF binds directly or indirectly with up to 95% accuracy. Joint analysis across two cell types reveals both cell-type-specific and shared regulatory modules. Our results provide comprehensive cell-type-specific combinatorial binding maps and suggest a modular organization of combinatorial binding.

Date: 2024-12

Abstract:
Precise localization and dissection of gene promoters are key to understanding transcriptional gene regulation and to successful bioengineering applications. The core RNA polymerase II initiation machinery is highly conserved among eukaryotes, leading to a general expectation of equivalent underlying mechanisms. Still, less is known about promoters in the plant kingdom. In this study, we employed cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) at three embryonic developmental stages in barley to accurately map, annotate, and quantify transcription initiation events. Unsupervised discovery of de novo sequence clusters grouped promoters based on characteristic initiator and position-specific core-promoter motifs. This grouping was complemented by the annotation of transcription factor binding site (TFBS) motifs. Integration with genome-wide epigenomic data sets and gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis further delineated the chromatin environments and functional roles of genes associated with distinct promoter categories. The TATA-box presence governs all features explored, supporting the general model of two separate genomic regulatory environments. We describe the extent and implications of alternative transcription initiation events, including those that are specific to developmental stages, which can affect the protein sequence or the presence of regions that regulate translation. The generated promoterome dataset provides a valuable genomic resource for enhancing the functional annotation of the barley genome. It also offers insights into the transcriptional regulation of individual genes and presents opportunities for the informed manipulation of promoter architecture, with the aim of enhancing traits of agronomic importance.

Title: Quantifying the regulatory role of individual transcription factors in Escherichia coli
Authors: Sunil Guharajan, Shivani Chhabra, Vinuselvi Parisutham, Robert C. Brewster
Date: 2021-11-09

Abstract:
Gene regulation often results from the action of multiple transcription factors (TFs) acting at a promoter, obscuring the individual regulatory effect of each TF on RNA polymerase (RNAP). Here we measure the fundamental regulatory interactions of TFs in E. coli by designing synthetic target genes that isolate individual TFs’ regulatory effects. Using a thermodynamic model, each TF’s regulatory interactions are decoupled from TF occupancy and interpreted as acting through (de)stabilization of RNAP and (de)acceleration of transcription initiation. We find that the contribution of each mechanism depends on TF identity and binding location; regulation immediately downstream of the promoter is insensitive to TF identity, but the same TFs regulate by distinct mechanisms upstream of the promoter. These two mechanisms are uncoupled and can act coherently, to reinforce the observed regulatory role (activation/repression), or incoherently, wherein the TF regulates two distinct steps with opposing effects.

Abstract:
Long noncoding RNAs are thought to regulate gene expression by organizing protein complexes through unclear mechanisms. XIST controls the inactivation of an entire X chromosome in female placental mammals. Here we develop and integrate several orthogonal structure-interaction methods to demonstrate that XIST RNA-protein complex folds into an evolutionarily conserved modular architecture. Chimeric RNAs and clustered protein binding in fRIP and eCLIP experiments align with long-range RNA secondary structure, revealing discrete XIST domains that interact with distinct sets of effector proteins. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated permutation of the Xist A-repeat location shows that A-repeat serves as a nucleation center for multiple Xist-associated proteins and m 6 A modification. Thus modular architecture plays an essential role, in addition to sequence motifs, in determining the specificity of RBP binding and m 6 A modification. Together, this work builds a comprehensive structure-function model for the XIST RNA-protein complex, and suggests a general strategy for mechanistic studies of large ribonucleoprotein assemblies.

Title: Decrypting noncoding RNA interactions, structures, and functional networks
Authors: Muller Fabbri, Leonard Girnita, Gabriele Varani, George A. Calin
Date: 2019-09

Abstract:
The world of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) is composed of an enormous and growing number of transcripts, ranging in length from tens of bases to tens of kilobases, involved in all biological processes and altered in expression and/or function in many types of human disorders. The premise of this review is the concept that ncRNAs, like many large proteins, have a multidomain architecture that organizes them spatially and functionally. As ncRNAs are beginning to be imprecisely classified into functional families, we review here how their structural properties might inform their functions with focus on structural architecture–function relationships. We will describe the properties of “interactor elements” (IEs) involved in direct physical interaction with nucleic acids, proteins, or lipids and of “structural elements” (SEs) directing their wiring within the “ncRNA interactor networks” through the emergence of secondary and/or tertiary structures. We suggest that spectrums of “letters” (ncRNA elements) are assembled into “words” (ncRNA domains) that are further organized into “phrases” (complete ncRNA structures) with functional meaning (signaling output) through complex “sentences” (the ncRNA interactor networks). This semiotic analogy can guide the exploitation of ncRNAs as new therapeutic targets through the development of IE-blockers and/or SE-lockers that will change the interactor partners’ spectrum of proteins, RNAs, DNAs, or lipids and consequently influence disease phenotypes.

Abstract:
De novo drug design is a computational approach that generates novel molecular structures from atomic building blocks with no a priori relationships. Conventional methods include structure-based and ligand-based design, which depend on the properties of the active site of a biological target or its known active binders, respectively. Artificial intelligence, including ma-chine learning, is an emerging field that has positively impacted the drug discovery process. Deep reinforcement learning is a subdivision of machine learning that combines artificial neural networks with reinforcement-learning architectures. This method has successfully been em-ployed to develop novel de novo drug design approaches using a variety of artificial networks including recurrent neural networks, convolutional neural networks, generative adversarial networks, and autoencoders. This review article summarizes advances in de novo drug design, from conventional growth algorithms to advanced machine-learning methodologies and high-lights hot topics for further development.

Title: Hunchback is counter-repressed to regulate even-skipped stripe 2 expression in Drosophila embryos

Abstract:
Hunchback is a bifunctional transcription factor that can activate and repress gene expression in Drosophila development. We investigated the regulatory DNA sequence features that control Hunchback function by perturbing enhancers for one of its target genes, even-skipped (eve) . While Hunchback directly represses the eve stripe 3+7 enhancer, we found that in the eve stripe 2+7 enhancer, Hunchback repression is prevented by nearby sequences—this phenomenon is called counter-repression. We also found evidence that Caudal binding sites are responsible for counter-repression, and that this interaction may be a conserved feature of eve stripe 2 enhancers. Our results alter the textbook view of eve stripe 2 regulation wherein Hb is described as a direct activator. Instead, to generate stripe 2, Hunchback repression must be counteracted. We discuss how counter-repression may influence eve stripe 2 regulation and evolution.

Title: High Resolution Genome Wide Binding Event Finding and Motif Discovery Reveals Transcription Factor Spatial Binding Constraints
Authors: Yuchun Guo, Shaun Mahony, David K. Gifford
Date: 2012-08

Abstract:
An essential component of genome function is the syntax of genomic regulatory elements that determine how diverse transcription factors interact to orchestrate a program of regulatory control. A precise characterization of in vivo spacing constraints between key transcription factors would reveal key aspects of this genomic regulatory language. To discover novel transcription factor spatial binding constraints in vivo , we developed a new integrative computational method, genome wide event finding and motif discovery (GEM). GEM resolves ChIP data into explanatory motifs and binding events at high spatial resolution by linking binding event discovery and motif discovery with positional priors in the context of a generative probabilistic model of ChIP data and genome sequence. GEM analysis of 63 transcription factors in 214 ENCODE human ChIP-Seq experiments recovers more known factor motifs than other contemporary methods, and discovers six new motifs for factors with unknown binding specificity. GEM's adaptive learning of binding-event read distributions allows it to further improve upon previous methods for processing ChIP-Seq and ChIP-exo data to yield unsurpassed spatial resolution and discovery of closely spaced binding events of the same factor. In a systematic analysis of in vivo sequence-specific transcription factor binding using GEM, we have found hundreds of spatial binding constraints between factors. GEM found 37 examples of factor binding constraints in mouse ES cells, including strong distance-specific constraints between Klf4 and other key regulatory factors. In human ENCODE data, GEM found 390 examples of spatially constrained pair-wise binding, including such novel pairs as c-Fos:c-Jun/USF1, CTCF/Egr1, and HNF4A/FOXA1. The discovery of new factor-factor spatial constraints in ChIP data is significant because it proposes testable models for regulatory factor interactions that will help elucidate genome function and the implementation of combinatorial control.

Title: Can language models be used for real-world urban-delivery route optimization?
Authors: Yang Liu, Fanyou Wu, Zhiyuan Liu, Kai Wang, Feiyue Wang, Xiaobo Qu
Date: 2023-11-13

Abstract:
Language models have contributed to breakthroughs in interdisciplinary research, such as protein design and molecular dynamics understanding. In this study, we reveal that beyond language, representations of other entities, such as human behaviors, that are mappable to learnable sequences can be learned by language models. One compelling example is the real-world delivery route optimization problem. We here propose a novel approach based on the language model to optimize delivery routes on the basis of drivers’ historical experiences. Although a broad range of optimization-based approaches have been designed to optimize delivery routes, they do not capture the implicit knowledge of complex delivery operating environments. The model we propose integrates this knowledge in the route optimization process by learning from driving behaviors in experienced drivers. A real-world delivery route that preserves drivers’ implicit behavioral patterns is first analogized to a sentence in natural language. Through unsupervised learning, we then learn the vector representations of words and infer the drivers’ delivery chains on the basis of the tailored chain-reaction-based algorithm. We also provide insights into the fusion of language models and operations research methods. In our approach, language models are applied to learn drivers’ delivery behaviors and infer new deliveries at the delivery zone level, while the classic traveling salesman problem (TSP) model is embedded into the hybrid framework for intra-zone optimization. Numerical experiments performed on real-world data from Amazon’s delivery service demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms pure optimization, supporting the effectiveness, efficiency, and extensibility of our model. As a versatile approach, the proposed framework can easily be extended to various disciplines in which the data follow certain grammar rules. We anticipate that our work will serve as a stepping stone toward the understanding and application of language models in tackling interdisciplinary research problems.

Title: Formation of Regulatory Modules by Local Sequence Duplication
Authors: Armita Nourmohammad, Michael Lässig
Date: 2011-10

Abstract:
Turnover of regulatory sequence and function is an important part of molecular evolution. But what are the modes of sequence evolution leading to rapid formation and loss of regulatory sites? Here we show that a large fraction of neighboring transcription factor binding sites in the fly genome have formed from a common sequence origin by local duplications. This mode of evolution is found to produce regulatory information: duplications can seed new sites in the neighborhood of existing sites. Duplicate seeds evolve subsequently by point mutations, often towards binding a different factor than their ancestral neighbor sites. These results are based on a statistical analysis of 346 cis-regulatory modules in the Drosophila melanogaster genome, and a comparison set of intergenic regulatory sequence in Saccharomyces cerevisiae . In fly regulatory modules, pairs of binding sites show significantly enhanced sequence similarity up to distances of about 50 bp. We analyze these data in terms of an evolutionary model with two distinct modes of site formation: (i) evolution from independent sequence origin and (ii) divergent evolution following duplication of a common ancestor sequence. Our results suggest that pervasive formation of binding sites by local sequence duplications distinguishes the complex regulatory architecture of higher eukaryotes from the simpler architecture of unicellular organisms.

Title: Integrative approaches to study enhancer–promoter communication
Authors: Pia Mach, Luca Giorgetti
Date: 2023-06

Abstract:
The spatiotemporal control of gene expression in complex multicellular organisms relies on noncoding regulatory sequences such as enhancers, which activate transcription of target genes often over large genomic distances. Despite the advances in the identification and characterization of enhancers, the principles and mechanisms by which enhancers select and control their target genes remain largely unknown. Here, we review recent interdisciplinary and quantitative approaches based on emerging techniques that aim to address open questions in the field, notably how regulatory information is encoded in the DNA sequence, how this information is transferred from enhancers to promoters, and how these processes are regulated in time.

Date: 2021-12-03

Abstract:
Standardisation of
genetic parts has become a topic of increasing
interest over the last decades. The promise of simplifying molecular
cloning procedures, while at the same time making them more predictable
and reproducible has led to the design of several biological standards,
one of which is modular cloning (MoClo). The Yeast MoClo toolkit provides
a large library of characterised genetic parts combined with a comprehensive
and flexible assembly strategy. Here we aimed to (1) simplify the
adoption of the standard by providing a simple design tool for including
new parts in the MoClo library, (2) characterise the toolkit further
by demonstrating the impact of a BglII site in promoter parts on protein
expression, and (3) expand the toolkit to enable efficient construction
of gRNA arrays, marker-less integration cassettes and combinatorial
libraries. These additions make the toolkit more applicable for common
engineering tasks and will further promote its adoption in the yeast
biological engineering community.

Abstract:
RNA biology has risen to prominence after a remarkable discovery of diverse functions of noncoding RNA (ncRNA). Most untranslated transcripts often exert their regulatory functions into RNA–RNA complexes via base pairing with complementary sequences in other RNAs. An interplay between RNAs is essential, as it possesses various functional roles in human cells, including genetic translation, RNA splicing, editing, ribosomal RNA maturation, RNA degradation and the regulation of metabolic pathways/riboswitches. Moreover, the pervasive transcription of the human genome allows for the discovery of novel genomic functions via RNA interactome investigation. The advancement of experimental procedures has resulted in an explosion of documented data, necessitating the development of efficient and precise computational tools and algorithms. This review provides an extensive update on RNA–RNA interaction (RRI) analysis via thermodynamic- and comparative-based RNA secondary structure prediction (RSP) and RNA–RNA interaction prediction (RIP) tools and their general functions. We also highlighted the current knowledge of RRIs and the limitations of RNA interactome mapping via experimental data. Then, the gap between RSP and RIP, the importance of RNA homologues, the relationship between pseudoknots, and RNA folding thermodynamics are discussed. It is hoped that these emerging prediction tools will deepen the understanding of RNA-associated interactions in human diseases and hasten treatment processes.

Date: 2022-06-14

Abstract:
Plant genomes encode a complex and evolutionary diverse regulatory grammar that forms the basis for most life on earth. A wealth of regulome and epigenome data have been generated in various plant species, but no common, standardized resource is available so far for biologists. Here, we present ChIP-Hub, an integrative web-based platform in the ENCODE standards that bundles >10,000 publicly available datasets reanalyzed from >40 plant species, allowing visualization and meta-analysis. We manually curate the datasets through assessing ~540 original publications and comprehensively evaluate their data quality. As a proof of concept, we extensively survey the co-association of different regulators and construct a hierarchical regulatory network under a broad developmental context. Furthermore, we show how our annotation allows to investigate the dynamic activity of tissue-specific regulatory elements (promoters and enhancers) and their underlying sequence grammar. Finally, we analyze the function and conservation of tissue-specific promoters, enhancers and chromatin states using comparative genomics approaches. Taken together, the ChIP-Hub platform and the analysis results provide rich resources for deep exploration of plant ENCODE. ChIP-Hub is available at https://biobigdata.nju.edu.cn/ChIPHub/ .

Yeast Cloning Toolkit for Molecular
and Synthetic Biology
Authors: Téo Hebra, Helena Smrčková, Büsra Elkatmis, Martin Převorovský, Tomáš Pluskal
Date: 2023-11-22

Abstract:
The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces
pombe is a popular model organism in molecular biology
and cell physiology.
With its ease of genetic manipulation and growth, supported by in-depth
functional annotations in the PomBase database and genome-wide metabolic
models, S. pombe is an attractive option
for synthetic biology applications. However, S. pombe currently lacks modular tools for generating genetic circuits with
more than 1 transcriptional unit. We developed a toolkit to address
this gap. Adapted from the MoClo-YTK plasmid kit for Saccharomyces cerevisiae and using the same modular
cloning grammar, our POMBOX toolkit is designed to facilitate fast,
efficient, and modular construction of genetic circuits in S. pombe . It allows for interoperability when working
with DNA sequences that are functional in both S. cerevisiae and S. pombe (e.g., protein tags,
antibiotic resistance cassettes, and coding sequences). Moreover,
POMBOX enables the modular assembly of multigene pathways and increases
the possible pathway length from 6 to 12 transcriptional units. We
also adapted the stable integration vector homology arms to Golden
Gate assembly and tested the genomic integration success rates depending
on different sequence sizes, from 4 to 24 kb. We included 14 S. pombe promoters that we characterized using two
fluorescent proteins, in both minimally defined (EMM2—Edinburgh
minimal media) and complex (YES—yeast extract with supplements)
media. Then, we examined the efficacy of 6 S. cerevisiae and 6 synthetic terminators in S. pombe . Finally, we used the POMBOX kit for a synthetic biology application
in metabolic engineering and expressed plant enzymes in S. pombe to produce specialized metabolite precursors,
namely, methylxanthine, amorpha-4,11-diene, and cinnamic acid from
the purine, mevalonate, and aromatic amino acid pathways.

Abstract:
The effects of transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) on the activity of a cis -regulatory element (CRE) depend on the local sequence context. In rod photoreceptors, binding sites for the transcription factor (TF) Cone-rod homeobox (CRX) occur in both enhancers and silencers, but the sequence context that determines whether CRX binding sites contribute to activation or repression of transcription is not understood. To investigate the context-dependent activity of CRX sites, we fit neural network-based models to the activities of synthetic CREs composed of photoreceptor TFBSs. The models revealed that CRX binding sites consistently make positive, independent contributions to CRE activity, while negative homotypic interactions between sites cause CREs composed of multiple CRX sites to function as silencers. The effects of negative homotypic interactions can be overcome by the presence of other TFBSs that either interact cooperatively with CRX sites or make independent positive contributions to activity. The context-dependent activity of CRX sites is thus determined by the balance between positive heterotypic interactions, independent contributions of TFBSs, and negative homotypic interactions. Our findings explain observed patterns of activity among genomic CRX-bound enhancers and silencers, and suggest that enhancers may require diverse TFBSs to overcome negative homotypic interactions between TFBSs.

Authors: Dana M King, Clarice Kit Yee Hong, James L Shepherdson, David M Granas, Brett B Maricque, Barak A Cohen
Date: 2020-02-11

Abstract:
In embryonic stem cells (ESCs), a core transcription factor (TF) network establishes the gene expression program necessary for pluripotency. To address how interactions between four key TFs contribute to cis- regulation in mouse ESCs, we assayed two massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) libraries composed of binding sites for SOX2, POU5F1 (OCT4), KLF4, and ESRRB. Comparisons between synthetic cis -regulatory elements and genomic sequences with comparable binding site configurations revealed some aspects of a regulatory grammar. The expression of synthetic elements is influenced by both the number and arrangement of binding sites. This grammar plays only a small role for genomic sequences, as the relative activities of genomic sequences are best explained by the predicted occupancy of binding sites, regardless of binding site identity and positioning. Our results suggest that the effects of transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) are influenced by the order and orientation of sites, but that in the genome the overall occupancy of TFs is the primary determinant of activity.

Title: Unexplored regions of the protein sequence-structure map revealed at scale by a library of foldtuned language models
Authors: Arjuna M. Subramanian, Zachary A. Martinez, Alec L. Lourenço, Sonia C. Yuan, Shichen Liu, Matt Thomson
Date: 2025-09-19

Abstract:
The combinatorial scale of amino-acid sequence-space has traditionally precluded substantive study of the full protein sequence-structure map. It remains unknown, for instance, how much of the vast uncharted landscape of far-from-natural sequences encodes the familiar ensemble of natural folds in a fashion consistent with the laws of biophysics but seemingly untouched by evolution on Earth. The scale of sequence perturbations required to access these spaces exceeds the reach of even gold-standard experimental approaches such as directed evolution. We surpass this limitation guided by the innate capacity of protein language models (PLMs) to explore sequences outside their natural training data through generation and self-feedback. We recast PLMs as probes that explore into regions of protein “deep space” that possess little-to-no detectable homology to natural examples, while enforcing core structural constraints, in a novel sequence design approach that we term “foldtuning.” We build a library of foldtuned PLMs for >700 natural folds in the SCOP database, covering numerous high-priority targets for synthetic biology, including GPCRs and small GTPases, composable cell-surface-receptor and DNA-binding domains, and small signaling/regulatory domains. Candidate proteins generated by foldtuned PLMs reflect distinctive new “rules of language” for sequence innovation beyond detectable homology to any known protein and sample subtle structural alterations in a manner reminiscent of natural structural evolution and diversification. Experimental validation of three markedly different fold targets; the tyrosine-kinase- and small-GTPase-regulating SH3 domain, the bacterial RNase inhibitor barstar, and the peptide hormone insulin demonstrates that foldtuning proposes protein variants that express and fold stably in vitro and function in vivo . Foldtuning reveals protein sequence-structure information at scale outside of the context of evolution and promises to push forward the redesign and reconstitution of novel-to-nature synthetic biological systems for applications in health and catalysis.

Title: Prediction accuracy of regulatory elements from sequence varies by functional sequencing technique
Authors: Ronald J. Nowling, Kimani Njoya, John G. Peters, Michelle M. Riehle
Date: 2023-08-02

Abstract:
Various sequencing based approaches are used to identify and characterize the activities of cis -regulatory elements in a genome-wide fashion. Some of these techniques rely on indirect markers such as histone modifications (ChIP-seq with histone antibodies) or chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq, DNase-seq, FAIRE-seq), while other techniques use direct measures such as episomal assays measuring the enhancer properties of DNA sequences (STARR-seq) and direct measurement of the binding of transcription factors (ChIP-seq with transcription factor-specific antibodies). The activities of cis -regulatory elements such as enhancers, promoters, and repressors are determined by their sequence and secondary processes such as chromatin accessibility, DNA methylation, and bound histone markers. Here, machine learning models are employed to evaluate the accuracy with which cis -regulatory elements identified by various commonly used sequencing techniques can be predicted by their underlying sequence alone to distinguish between cis -regulatory activity that is reflective of sequence content versus secondary processes. Models trained and evaluated on D. melanogaster sequences identified through DNase-seq and STARR-seq are significantly more accurate than models trained on sequences identified by H3K4me1, H3K4me3, and H3K27ac ChIP-seq, FAIRE-seq, and ATAC-seq. These results suggest that the activity detected by DNase-seq and STARR-seq can be largely explained by underlying DNA sequence, independent of secondary processes. Experimentally, a subset of DNase-seq and H3K4me1 ChIP-seq sequences were tested for enhancer activity using luciferase assays and compared with previous tests performed on STARR-seq sequences. The experimental data indicated that STARR-seq sequences are substantially enriched for enhancer-specific activity, while the DNase-seq and H3K4me1 ChIP-seq sequences are not. Taken together, these results indicate that the DNase-seq approach identifies a broad class of regulatory elements of which enhancers are a subset and the associated data are appropriate for training models for detecting regulatory activity from sequence alone, STARR-seq data are best for training enhancer-specific sequence models, and H3K4me1 ChIP-seq data are not well suited for training and evaluating sequence-based models for cis -regulatory element prediction.

Title: Modeling Structure-Function Relationships in Synthetic DNA Sequences using Attribute Grammars
Authors: Yizhi Cai, Matthew W. Lux, Laura Adam, Jean Peccoud
Date: 2009-10

Abstract:
Recognizing that certain biological functions can be associated with specific DNA sequences has led various fields of biology to adopt the notion of the genetic part. This concept provides a finer level of granularity than the traditional notion of the gene. However, a method of formally relating how a set of parts relates to a function has not yet emerged. Synthetic biology both demands such a formalism and provides an ideal setting for testing hypotheses about relationships between DNA sequences and phenotypes beyond the gene-centric methods used in genetics. Attribute grammars are used in computer science to translate the text of a program source code into the computational operations it represents. By associating attributes with parts, modifying the value of these attributes using rules that describe the structure of DNA sequences, and using a multi-pass compilation process, it is possible to translate DNA sequences into molecular interaction network models. These capabilities are illustrated by simple example grammars expressing how gene expression rates are dependent upon single or multiple parts. The translation process is validated by systematically generating, translating, and simulating the phenotype of all the sequences in the design space generated by a small library of genetic parts. Attribute grammars represent a flexible framework connecting parts with models of biological function. They will be instrumental for building mathematical models of libraries of genetic constructs synthesized to characterize the function of genetic parts. This formalism is also expected to provide a solid foundation for the development of computer assisted design applications for synthetic biology.

Title: Crosstalk between codon optimality and cis -regulatory elements dictates mRNA stability
Authors: Santiago Gerardo Medina-Muñoz, Gopal Kushawah, Luciana Andrea Castellano, Michay Diez, Michelle Lynn DeVore, María José Blanco Salazar, Ariel Alejandro Bazzini
Date: 2021-01-05

Abstract:
The regulation of messenger RNA (mRNA) stability has a profound impact on gene expression dynamics during embryogenesis. For example, in animals, maternally deposited mRNAs are degraded after fertilization to enable new developmental trajectories. Regulatory sequences in 3′ untranslated regions (3′UTRs) have long been considered the central determinants of mRNA stability. However, recent work indicates that the coding sequence also possesses regulatory information. Specifically, translation in cis impacts mRNA stability in a codon-dependent manner. However, the strength of this mechanism during embryogenesis, as well as its relationship with other known regulatory elements, such as microRNA, remains unclear. Here, we show that codon composition is a major predictor of mRNA stability in the early embryo. We show that this mechanism works in combination with other cis -regulatory elements to dictate mRNA stability in zebrafish and Xenopus embryos as well as in mouse and human cells. Furthermore, we show that microRNA targeting efficacy can be affected by substantial enrichment of optimal (stabilizing) or non-optimal (destabilizing) codons. Lastly, we find that one microRNA, miR-430, antagonizes the stabilizing effect of optimal codons during early embryogenesis in zebrafish. By integrating the contributions of different regulatory mechanisms, our work provides a framework for understanding how combinatorial control of mRNA stability shapes the gene expression landscape.

Title: A Composite Method Based on Formal Grammar and DNA Structural Features in Detecting Human Polymerase II Promoter Region
Authors: Sutapa Datta, Subhasis Mukhopadhyay
Date: 2013

Abstract:
An important step in understanding gene regulation is to identify the promoter regions where the transcription factor binding takes place. Predicting a promoter region de novo has been a theoretical goal for many researchers for a long time. There exists a number of in silico methods to predict the promoter region de novo but most of these methods are still suffering from various shortcomings, a major one being the selection of appropriate features of promoter region distinguishing them from non-promoters. In this communication, we have proposed a new composite method that predicts promoter sequences based on the interrelationship between structural profiles of DNA and primary sequence elements of the promoter regions. We have shown that a Context Free Grammar (CFG) can formalize the relationships between different primary sequence features and by utilizing the CFG, we demonstrate that an efficient parser can be constructed for extracting these relationships from DNA sequences to distinguish the true promoter sequences from non-promoter sequences. Along with CFG, we have extracted the structural features of the promoter region to improve upon the efficiency of our prediction system. Extensive experiments performed on different datasets reveals that our method is effective in predicting promoter sequences on a genome-wide scale and performs satisfactorily as compared to other promoter prediction techniques.

Abstract:
Recent discoveries of extreme cellular diversity in the brain warrant rapid development of technologies to access specific cell populations within heterogeneous tissue. Available approaches for engineering-targeted technologies for new neuron subtypes are low yield, involving intensive transgenic strain or virus screening. Here, we present Specific Nuclear-Anchored Independent Labeling (SNAIL), an improved virus-based strategy for cell labeling and nuclear isolation from heterogeneous tissue. SNAIL works by leveraging machine learning and other computational approaches to identify DNA sequence features that confer cell type-specific gene activation and then make a probe that drives an affinity purification-compatible reporter gene. As a proof of concept, we designed and validated two novel SNAIL probes that target parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) neurons. Nuclear isolation using SNAIL in wild-type mice is sufficient to capture characteristic open chromatin features of PV+ neurons in the cortex, striatum, and external globus pallidus. The SNAIL framework also has high utility for multispecies cell probe engineering; expression from a mouse PV+ SNAIL enhancer sequence was enriched in PV+ neurons of the macaque cortex. Expansion of this technology has broad applications in cell type-specific observation, manipulation, and therapeutics across species and disease models.

We combined a time-resolved, single-cell multi-omic atlas of human iPSC-derived cardiac organoids with deep learning models that predict chromatin accessibility from DNA sequence, enabling the discovery of the regulatory syntax underlying early heart development. This framework uncovered cell-state-specific rules of cardiogenesis, including context-dependent activities of TEAD, HAND, and TBX transcription factor families, and linked these motifs to their target genes. We identified distinct programs guiding lineage divergence, such as ventricular versus pacemaker cardiomyocytes, and validated predictions by perturbing Myocardin ( MYOCD ), establishing its essential role in ventricular specification. Integration of chromatin, transcriptional, and genetic data further highlighted regulatory regions and disease-associated variants that perturb differentiation state transitions, supporting evidence that suggests congenital heart disease emerges early in development. This work bridges developmental gene regulation with disease genetics, providing a foundation for mechanistic and therapeutic insights into congenital diseases.

Title: Rearrangements of 2.5 Kilobases of Noncoding DNA from the Drosophila even-skipped Locus Define Predictive Rules of Genomic cis -Regulatory Logic
Authors: Ah-Ram Kim, Carlos Martinez, John Ionides, Alexandre F. Ramos, Michael Z. Ludwig, Nobuo Ogawa, David H. Sharp, John Reinitz

Abstract:
Rearrangements of about 2.5 kilobases of regulatory DNA located 5′ of the transcription start site of the Drosophila even-skipped locus generate large-scale changes in the expression of even-skipped stripes 2, 3, and 7. The most radical effects are generated by juxtaposing the minimal stripe enhancers MSE2 and MSE3 for stripes 2 and 3 with and without small “spacer” segments less than 360 bp in length. We placed these fusion constructs in a targeted transformation site and obtained quantitative expression data for these transformants together with their controlling transcription factors at cellular resolution. These data demonstrated that the rearrangements can alter expression levels in stripe 2 and the 2–3 interstripe by a factor of more than 10. We reasoned that this behavior would place tight constraints on possible rules of genomic cis -regulatory logic. To find these constraints, we confronted our new expression data together with previously obtained data on other constructs with a computational model. The model contained representations of thermodynamic protein–DNA interactions including steric interference and cooperative binding, short-range repression, direct repression, activation, and coactivation. The model was highly constrained by the training data, which it described within the limits of experimental error. The model, so constrained, was able to correctly predict expression patterns driven by enhancers for other Drosophila genes; even-skipped enhancers not included in the training set; stripe 2, 3, and 7 enhancers from various Drosophilid and Sepsid species; and long segments of even-skipped regulatory DNA that contain multiple enhancers. The model further demonstrated that elevated expression driven by a fusion of MSE2 and MSE3 was a consequence of the recruitment of a portion of MSE3 to become a functional component of MSE2, demonstrating that cis -regulatory “elements” are not elementary objects.

Title: Learning and interpreting the gene regulatory grammar in a deep learning framework
Authors: Ling Chen, John A. Capra
Date: 2020-11-02

Abstract:
Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in identifying gene regulatory sequences, but they have provided limited insight into the biology of regulatory elements due to the difficulty of interpreting the complex features they learn. Several models of how combinatorial binding of transcription factors, i.e. the regulatory grammar, drives enhancer activity have been proposed, ranging from the flexible TF billboard model to the stringent enhanceosome model. However, there is limited knowledge of the prevalence of these (or other) sequence architectures across enhancers. Here we perform several hypothesis-driven analyses to explore the ability of DNNs to learn the regulatory grammar of enhancers. We created synthetic datasets based on existing hypotheses about combinatorial transcription factor binding site (TFBS) patterns, including homotypic clusters, heterotypic clusters, and enhanceosomes, from real TF binding motifs from diverse TF families. We then trained deep residual neural networks (ResNets) to model the sequences under a range of scenarios that reflect real-world multi-label regulatory sequence prediction tasks. We developed a gradient-based unsupervised clustering method to extract the patterns learned by the ResNet models. We demonstrated that simulated regulatory grammars are best learned in the penultimate layer of the ResNets, and the proposed method can accurately retrieve the regulatory grammar even when there is heterogeneity in the enhancer categories and a large fraction of TFBS outside of the regulatory grammar. However, we also identify common scenarios where ResNets fail to learn simulated regulatory grammars. Finally, we applied the proposed method to mouse developmental enhancers and were able to identify the components of a known heterotypic TF cluster. Our results provide a framework for interpreting the regulatory rules learned by ResNets, and they demonstrate that the ability and efficiency of ResNets in learning the regulatory grammar depends on the nature of the prediction task.

Title: Subtle Changes in Motif Positioning Cause Tissue-Specific Effects on Robustness of an Enhancer's Activity

Abstract:
Deciphering the specific contribution of individual motifs within cis -regulatory modules (CRMs) is crucial to understanding how gene expression is regulated and how this process is affected by sequence variation. But despite vast improvements in the ability to identify where transcription factors (TFs) bind throughout the genome, we are limited in our ability to relate information on motif occupancy to function from sequence alone. Here, we engineered 63 synthetic CRMs to systematically assess the relationship between variation in the content and spacing of motifs within CRMs to CRM activity during development using Drosophila transgenic embryos. In over half the cases, very simple elements containing only one or two types of TF binding motifs were capable of driving specific spatio-temporal patterns during development. Different motif organizations provide different degrees of robustness to enhancer activity, ranging from binary on-off responses to more subtle effects including embryo-to-embryo and within-embryo variation. By quantifying the effects of subtle changes in motif organization, we were able to model biophysical rules that explain CRM behavior and may contribute to the spatial positioning of CRM activity in vivo . For the same enhancer, the effects of small differences in motif positions varied in developmentally related tissues, suggesting that gene expression may be more susceptible to sequence variation in one tissue compared to another. This result has important implications for human eQTL studies in which many associated mutations are found in cis- regulatory regions, though the mechanism for how they affect tissue-specific gene expression is often not understood.

Date: 2019-12-02

Abstract:
How transcription factors (TFs) interpret cis -regulatory DNA sequence to control gene expression remains unclear, largely because past studies using native and engineered sequences had insufficient scale. Here, we measure the expression output of >100 million synthetic yeast promoter sequences that are fully random. These sequences yield diverse, reproducible expression levels that can be explained by their chance inclusion of functional TF binding sites. We use machine learning to build interpretable models of transcriptional regulation that predict ~94% of the expression driven from independent test promoters and ~89% of the expression driven from native yeast promoter fragments. These models allow us to characterize each TF’s specificity, activity, and interactions with chromatin. TF activity depends on binding-site strand, position, DNA helical face and chromatin context. Notably, expression level is influenced by weak regulatory interactions, which confound designed-sequence studies. Our analyses show that massive-throughput assays of fully random DNA can provide the big data necessary to develop complex, predictive models of gene regulation.

Title: Review of Different Sequence Motif Finding Algorithms
Authors: Fatma A. Hashim, Mai S. Mabrouk, Walid Al-Atabany
Date: 2019

Abstract:
The DNA motif discovery is a primary step in many systems for studying gene function. Motif discovery plays a vital role in identification of Transcription Factor Binding Sites (TFBSs) that help in learning the mechanisms for regulation of gene expression. Over the past decades, different algorithms were used to design fast and accurate motif discovery tools. These algorithms are generally classified into consensus or probabilistic approaches that many of them are time-consuming and easily trapped in a local optimum. Nature-inspired algorithms and many of combinatorial algorithms are recently proposed to overcome these problems. This paper presents a general classification of motif discovery algorithms with new sub-categories that facilitate building a successful motif discovery algorithm. It also presents a summary of comparison between them.

Abstract:
T-cell-mediated immunotherapy has generated much excitement after the success of therapeutic biologics targeting immune checkpoint molecules. Bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) that recognize two antigen targets are a fast-growing class of biologics offering promising clinical benefits for cancer immunotherapy. Due to the complexity of the molecule structure and the potential mechanism of action (MOA) that involves more than one signaling pathway, it is critical to develop appropriate bioassays for measuring potency and characterizing the biological properties of BsAbs. Here, we present a dual target, cell-based reporter bioassay for a BsAb that binds human CTLA-4 and PD-1 and targets two subsequent signaling pathways that negatively regulate T-cell activation. This reporter bioassay is capable of measuring the potency of both antigen target arms in one assay, which would not be achievable using two single target bioassays. This dual target reporter bioassay demonstrates good performance characteristics suitable for lot release, stability testing, critical quality attribute assessment, and biological properties characterization of the CTLA-4/PD-1 BsAb. Furthermore, this assay can capture the synergistic effect of anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 activity of the BsAb. Compared to single target assays, this dual target bioassay could better reflect the potential MOA of BsAbs and could be used for evaluation of other bispecific biologics, as well as antibody combination therapies.

Abstract:
Translation of mRNAs is a tightly regulated process in gene expression. In mRNA, the 5′ untranslated region (5′ UTR) controls ribosome recruitment and frequently contains structured elements that modulate translation efficacy. This study investigates stable structural motifs within the 5′ UTR of DDX23 mRNA, encoding a protein relevant for anticancer therapy, as potential regulators and targets for antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs). Despite bioinformatic predictions and transcriptomic validations suggesting RNA G-quadruplex (rG4) formation, comprehensive structural analysis using a light-up assay and CD, UV, and NMR spectroscopy revealed that most putative rG4-forming sequences do not fold into stable rG4 structures, although one of them exists in an equilibrium between rG4 and an alternative, likely hairpin, conformation. Reporter assays using a robust G4 stabilizer also argue against the significant regulatory role of rG4s in DDX23 mRNA translation. Instead, we identified and characterized a stable hairpin structure with potential regulatory function. Based on these findings, we designed fully locked nucleic acid (LNA)-modified ASOs to target this hairpin and regions flanking the upstream open reading frame (uORF) and start codon of the coding sequence. A reporter assay demonstrated that cap-proximal targeting achieved robust translation inhibition up to 80%. In contrast, targeting the efficiently translated uORF was ineffective, presumably due to steric hindrances from the ribosomal complex. The study yields crucial design principles for translation-regulating ASOs: avoid targeting regions shielded by efficient uORF translation and carefully tune ASO-RNA duplex stability to surpass endogenous structures without disrupting regulatory mechanisms. These findings provide insights into the regulation of DDX23 expression and establish a framework for developing ASO-based therapeutics with broad implications for mRNA targeting in anticancer applications.

Abstract:
TFEB and TFE3 belong to the MiT/TFE family of transcription factors that bind identical DNA responsive elements in the regulatory regions of target genes. They are involved in regulating lysosomal biogenesis, function, exocytosis, autophagy, and lipid catabolism. Precise control of TFEB and TFE3 activity is crucial for processes such as senescence, stress response, energy metabolism, and cellular catabolism. Dysregulation of these factors is implicated in various diseases, thus researchers have explored pharmacological approaches to modulate MiT/TFE activity, considering these transcription factors as potential therapeutic targets. However, the physiological complexity of their functions and the lack of suitable in vivo tools have limited the development of selective MiT/TFE modulating agents. Here, we have created a reporter-based biosensor, named CLEARoptimized, facilitating the pharmacological profiling of TFEB- and TFE3-mediated transcription. This innovative tool enables the measurement of TFEB and TFE3 activity in living cells and mice through imaging and biochemical techniques. CLEARoptimized consists of a promoter with six coordinated lysosomal expression and regulation motifs identified through an in-depth bioinformatic analysis of the promoters of 128 TFEB-target genes. The biosensor drives the expression of luciferase and tdTomato reporter genes, allowing the quantification of TFEB and TFE3 activity in cells and in animals through optical imaging and biochemical assays. The biosensor’s validity was confirmed by modulating MiT/TFE activity in both cell culture and reporter mice using physiological and pharmacological stimuli. Overall, this study introduces an innovative tool for studying autophagy and lysosomal pathway modulation at various biological levels, from individual cells to the entire organism. Abbreviations: CLEAR: coordinated lysosomal expression and regulation; MAR: matrix attachment regions; MiT: microphthalmia-associated transcription factor; ROI: region of interest; TBS: tris-buffered saline; TF: transcription factor; TFE3: transcription factor binding to IGHM enhancer 3; TFEB: transcription factor EB; TH: tyrosine hydroxylase; TK: thymidine kinase; TSS: transcription start site.

Abstract:
The functional consequences of genetic variants within 5’ untranslated regions (UTRs) on a genome-wide scale are poorly understood in disease. Here we develop a high-throughput multi-layer functional genomics method called PLUMAGE (Pooled full-length UTR Multiplex Assay on Gene Expression) to quantify the molecular consequences of somatic 5’ UTR mutations in human prostate cancer. We show that 5’ UTR mutations can control transcript levels and mRNA translation rates through the creation of DNA binding elements or RNA-based cis -regulatory motifs. We discover that point mutations can simultaneously impact transcript and translation levels of the same gene. We provide evidence that functional 5’ UTR mutations in the MAP kinase signaling pathway can upregulate pathway-specific gene expression and are associated with clinical outcomes. Our study reveals the diverse mechanisms by which the mutational landscape of 5’ UTRs can co-opt gene expression and demonstrates that single nucleotide alterations within 5’ UTRs are functional in cancer.

Title: Reporter-ChIP-nexus reveals strong contribution of the Drosophila initiator sequence to RNA polymerase pausing
Authors: Wanqing Shao, Sergio G-M Alcantara, Julia Zeitlinger
Date: 2019-04-25

Abstract:
RNA polymerase II (Pol II) pausing is a general regulatory step in transcription, yet the stability of paused Pol II varies widely between genes. Although paused Pol II stability correlates with core promoter elements, the contribution of individual sequences remains unclear, in part because no rapid assay is available for measuring the changes in Pol II pausing as a result of altered promoter sequences. Here, we overcome this hurdle by showing that ChIP-nexus captures the endogenous Pol II pausing on transfected plasmids. Using this reporter-ChIP-nexus assay in Drosophila cells, we show that the pausing stability is influenced by downstream promoter sequences, but that the strongest contribution to Pol II pausing comes from the initiator sequence, in which a single nucleotide, a G at the +2 position, is critical for stable Pol II pausing. These results establish reporter-ChIP-nexus as a valuable tool to analyze Pol II pausing.

Abstract:
Learning to read and write the transcriptional regulatory code is of central importance to progress in genetic analysis and engineering. Here, we describe a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) that enables systematic dissection of transcriptional regulatory elements by integrating microarray-based DNA synthesis and high-throughput tag sequencing. We apply MPRA to compare more than 27,000 distinct variants of two inducible enhancers in human cells: a synthetic cAMP-regulated enhancer and the virus-inducible interferon beta enhancer. We first show that the resulting data define accurate maps of functional transcription factor binding sites in both enhancers at single-nucleotide resolution. We then use the data to train quantitative sequence-activity models (QSAMs) of the two enhancers. We show that QSAMs from two cellular states can be combined to identify novel enhancer variants that optimize potentially conflicting objectives, such as maximizing induced activity while minimizing basal activity.

Date: 2023-09-01

Abstract:
Transposable elements (TE) are repetitive genomic elements that harbor binding sites for human transcription factors (TF). A regulatory role for TEs has been suggested in embryonal development and diseases such as cancer but systematic investigation of their functions has been limited by their widespread silencing in the genome. Here, we utilize unbiased massively parallel reporter assay data using a whole human genome library to identify TEs with functional enhancer activity in two human cancer types of endodermal lineage, colorectal and liver cancers. We show that the identified TE enhancers are characterized by genomic features associated with active enhancers, such as epigenetic marks and TF binding. Importantly, we identify distinct TE subfamilies that function as tissue-specific enhancers, namely MER11- and LTR12-elements in colon and liver cancers, respectively. These elements are bound by distinct TFs in each cell type, and they have predicted associations to differentially expressed genes. In conclusion, these data demonstrate how different cancer types can utilize distinct TEs as tissue-specific enhancers, paving the way for comprehensive understanding of the role of TEs as bona fide enhancers in the cancer genomes.

Date: 2024-08-12

Abstract:
The plethora of genome sequences produced in the postgenomic age has not resolved many of our most pressing biological questions. Correlating gene expression with an interrogatable and easily observable characteristic such as the surrogate phenotype conferred by a reporter gene is a valuable approach to gaining insight into gene function. Many reporters including lacZ , amdS, and the fluorescent proteins mRuby3 and mNeonGreen have been used across all manners of organisms. Described here is an investigation into the creation of a robust, synthetic, fusion reporter system for Cryptococcus neoformans that combines some of the most useful fluorophores available in this system with the versatility of the counter-selectable nature of amdS . The reporters generated include multiple composition and orientation variants, all of which were investigated for differences in expression. Evaluation of known promoters from the TEF1 and GAL7 genes was undertaken, elucidating novel expression tendencies of these biologically relevant C. neoformans regulators of transcription. Smaller than lacZ but providing multiple useful surrogate phenotypes for interrogation, the fusion ORF serves as a superior whole-cell assay compared to traditional systems. Ultimately, the work described here bolsters the array of relevant genetic tools that may be employed in furthering manipulation and understanding of the WHO fungal priority group pathogen C. neoformans .

Abstract:
The cis -regulatory elements encoded in an mRNA determine its stability and translational output. While there has been a considerable effort to understand the factors driving mRNA stability, the regulatory frameworks governing translational control remain more elusive. We have developed a novel massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to measure mRNA translation, named Nascent Peptide Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification (NaP-TRAP). NaP-TRAP measures translation in a frame-specific manner through the immunocapture of epitope tagged nascent peptides of reporter mRNAs. We benchmark NaP-TRAP to polysome profiling and use it to quantify Kozak strength and the regulatory landscapes of 5’ UTRs in the developing zebrafish embryo and in human cells. Through this approach we identified general and developmentally dynamic cis -regulatory elements, as well as potential trans -acting proteins. We find that U-rich motifs are general enhancers, and upstream ORFs and GC-rich motifs are global repressors of translation. We also observe a translational switch during the maternal-to-zygotic transition, where C-rich motifs shift from repressors to prominent activators of translation. Conversely, we show that microRNA sites in the 5’ UTR repress translation following the zygotic expression of miR-430. Together these results demonstrate that NaP-TRAP is a versatile, accessible, and powerful method to decode the regulatory functions of UTRs across different systems.

Abstract:
Transmembrane E3 ligases play crucial roles in homeostasis. Much protein and organelle quality control, and metabolic regulation, are determined by ER-resident MARCH6 E3 ligases, including Doa10 in yeast. Here, we present Doa10/MARCH6 structural analysis by cryo-EM and AlphaFold predictions, and a structure-based mutagenesis campaign. The majority of Doa10/MARCH6 adopts a unique circular structure within the membrane. This channel is established by a lipid-binding scaffold, and gated by a flexible helical bundle. The ubiquitylation active site is positioned over the channel by connections between the cytosolic E3 ligase RING domain and the membrane-spanning scaffold and gate. Here, by assaying 95 MARCH6 variants for effects on stability of the well-characterized substrate SQLE, which regulates cholesterol levels, we reveal crucial roles of the gated channel and RING domain consistent with AlphaFold-models of substrate-engaged and ubiquitylation complexes. SQLE degradation further depends on connections between the channel and RING domain, and lipid binding sites, revealing how interconnected Doa10/MARCH6 elements could orchestrate metabolic signals, substrate binding, and E3 ligase activity.

Title: A chimeric vector for dual use in cyanobacteria and Escherichia coli , tested with cystatin, a nonfluorescent reporter protein
Authors: Mojca Juteršek, Marko Dolinar
Date: 2021-11-03

Abstract:
Developing sustainable autotrophic cell factories depends heavily on the availability of robust and well-characterized biological parts. For cyanobacteria, these still lag behind the more advanced E. coli toolkit. In the course of previous protein expression experiments with cyanobacteria, we encountered inconveniences in working with currently available RSF1010-based shuttle plasmids, particularly due to their low biosafety and low yields of recombinant proteins. We also recognized some drawbacks of the commonly used fluorescent reporters, as quantification can be affected by the intrinsic fluorescence of cyanobacteria. To overcome these drawbacks, we envisioned a new chimeric vector and an alternative reporter that could be used in cyanobacterial synthetic biology and tested them in the model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. We designed the pMJc01 shuttle plasmid based on the broad host range RSFmob-I replicon. Standard cloning techniques were used for vector construction following the RFC10 synthetic biology standard. The behavior of pMJC01 was tested with selected regulatory elements in E. coli and Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 for the biosynthesis of the established GFP reporter and of a new reporter protein, cystatin. Cystatin activity was assayed using papain as a cognate target. With the new vector we observed a significantly higher GFP expression in E. coli and Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 compared to the commonly used RSF1010-based pPMQAK1. Cystatin, a cysteine protease inhibitor, was successfully expressed with the new vector in both E. coli and Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Its expression levels allowed quantification comparable to the standardly used fluorescent reporter GFPmut3b. An important advantage of the new vector is its improved biosafety due to the absence of plasmid regions encoding conjugative transfer components. The broadhost range vector pMJc01 could find application in synthetic biology and biotechnology of cyanobacteria due to its relatively small size, stability and ease of use. In addition, cystatin could be a useful reporter in all cell systems that do not contain papain-type proteases and inhibitors, such as cyanobacteria, and provides an alternative to fluorescent reporters or complements them.

Title: Effective design and inference for cell sorting and sequencing based massively parallel reporter assays

Date: 2023-05

Abstract:
The ability to measure the phenotype of millions of different genetic designs using Massively Parallel Reporter Assays (MPRAs) has revolutionized our understanding of genotype-to-phenotype relationships and opened avenues for data-centric approaches to biological design. However, our knowledge of how best to design these costly experiments and the effect that our choices have on the quality of the data produced is lacking. In this article, we tackle the issues of data quality and experimental design by developing FORECAST, a Python package that supports the accurate simulation of cell-sorting and sequencing-based MPRAs and robust maximum likelihood-based inference of genetic design function from MPRA data. We use FORECAST’s capabilities to reveal rules for MPRA experimental design that help ensure accurate genotype-to-phenotype links and show how the simulation of MPRA experiments can help us better understand the limits of prediction accuracy when this data are used for training deep learning-based classifiers. As the scale and scope of MPRAs grows, tools like FORECAST will help ensure we make informed decisions during their development and the most of the data produced. The FORECAST package is available at: https://gitlab.com/Pierre-Aurelien/forecast .

Title: A Set of Proximal Regulatory Elements Contribute to the Transcriptional Activity of the Human Lipoprotein Lipase Promoter

Date: 2024-11-18

Abstract:
Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is a multifunctional protein that catalyzes the hydrolysis of plasma triglycerides, releasing free fatty acids, which play critical roles in the metabolism and transport of lipids. The transcription of LPL in response to cell types and regulatory factors is a complex process that starts with its promoter. In previous studies, several proximal regulatory elements within the human LPL promoter were individually characterized. This study was designed to characterize the effect of 12 proximal regulatory elements as a combined unit on the transcriptional activity of the LPL promoter. The hypothesis was that these proximal regulatory elements collectively result in the optimal transcriptional activity of the human LPL promoter. Full and partial LPL promoter sequences, which contained and excluded the 12 regulatory elements, respectively, were cloned and inserted into a promoterless luciferase reporter vector. The functional activities of these constructs were tested in vitro using a dual-luciferase reporter assay. Our results showed that HEK-293 cells transfected with the full LPL promoter exhibited significantly greater luciferase activity than cells transfected with partial LPL promoters. Our results indicate that the proximal regulatory elements within the LPL promoter, including four TATA boxes, two Oct-1 sites, one CT element, two C/EBPα sites, one SP1 site, and two cis-acting regions (LP-α and LP-β), are essential for its transcriptional activity.

Title: Differentially Active and Conserved Neural Enhancers Define Two Forms of Adaptive Noncoding Evolution in Humans
Authors: Jason Pizzollo, Trisha M Zintel, Courtney C Babbitt
Date: 2022-08

Abstract:
The human and chimpanzee genomes are strikingly similar, but our neural phenotypes are very different. Many of these differences are likely driven by changes in gene expression, and some of those changes may have been adaptive during human evolution. Yet, the relative contributions of positive selection on regulatory regions or other functional regulatory changes are unclear. Where are these changes located throughout the human genome? Are functional regulatory changes near genes or are they in distal enhancer regions? In this study, we experimentally combined both human and chimpanzee cis -regulatory elements (CREs) that showed either (1) signs of accelerated evolution in humans or (2) that have been shown to be active in the human brain. Using a massively parallel reporter assay, we tested the ability of orthologous human and chimpanzee CREs to activate transcription in induced pluripotent stem-cell-derived neural progenitor cells and neurons. With this assay, we identified 179 CREs with differential activity between human and chimpanzee; in contrast, we found 722 CREs with signs of positive selection in humans. Selection and differentially expressed CREs strikingly differ in level of expression, size, and genomic location. We found a subset of 69 CREs in loci with genetic variants associated with neuropsychiatric diseases, which underscores the consequence of regulatory activity in these loci for proper neural development and function. By combining CREs that either experienced recent selection in humans or CREs that are functional brain enhancers, presents a novel way of studying the evolution of noncoding elements that contribute to human neural phenotypes.

Abstract:
The complex interaction
of cells with biomaterials (i.e., materiobiology)
plays an increasingly pivotal role in the development of novel implants,
biomedical devices, and tissue engineering scaffolds to treat diseases,
aid in the restoration of bodily functions, construct healthy tissues,
or regenerate diseased ones. However, the conventional approaches
are incapable of screening the huge amount of potential material parameter
combinations to identify the optimal cell responses and involve a
combination of serendipity and many series of trial-and-error experiments.
For advanced tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, highly
efficient and complex bioanalysis platforms are expected to explore
the complex interaction of cells with biomaterials using combinatorial
approaches that offer desired complex microenvironments during healing,
development, and homeostasis. In this review, we first introduce materiobiology
and its high-throughput screening (HTS). Then we present an in-depth
of the recent progress of 2D/3D HTS platforms (i.e., gradient and
microarray) in the principle, preparation, screening for materiobiology,
and combination with other advanced technologies. The Compendium for
Biomaterial Transcriptomics and high content imaging, computational
simulations, and their translation toward commercial and clinical
uses are highlighted. In the final section, current challenges and
future perspectives are discussed. High-throughput experimentation
within the field of materiobiology enables the elucidation of the
relationships between biomaterial properties and biological behavior
and thereby serves as a potential tool for accelerating the development
of high-performance biomaterials.

Authors: Annelien Verfaillie, Dmitry Svetlichnyy, Hana Imrichova, Kristofer Davie, Mark Fiers, Zeynep Kalender Atak, Gert Hulselmans, Valerie Christiaens, Stein Aerts
Date: 2016-07

Abstract:
Transcription factors regulate their target genes by binding to regulatory regions in the genome. Although the binding preferences of TP53 are known, it remains unclear what distinguishes functional enhancers from nonfunctional binding. In addition, the genome is scattered with recognition sequences that remain unoccupied. Using two complementary techniques of multiplex enhancer-reporter assays, we discovered that functional enhancers could be discriminated from nonfunctional binding events by the occurrence of a single TP53 canonical motif. By combining machine learning with a meta-analysis of TP53 ChIP-seq data sets, we identified a core set of more than 1000 responsive enhancers in the human genome. This TP53 cistrome is invariably used between cell types and experimental conditions, whereas differences among experiments can be attributed to indirect nonfunctional binding events. Our data suggest that TP53 enhancers represent a class of unsophisticated cell-autonomous enhancers containing a single TP53 binding site, distinct from complex developmental enhancers that integrate signals from multiple transcription factors.

Abstract:
A library of active genome regulatory elements (putative promoters and enhancers) from MIA PaCa-2 pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells was constructed using a specially designed lentiviral vector and a massive parallel reporter assay (ChIP-lentiMPRA). Chromatin immunoprecipitation of the cell genomic DNA by H3K27ac antibodies was used for primary enrichment of the library for regulatory elements. Totally, 11,264 unique genome regions, many of which are capable of enhancing the expression of the CopGFP reporter gene from the minimal CMV promoter, were identified. The regions tend to be located near promoters. Based on the proximity assay, we found an enrichment of highly expressed genes among those associated with three or more mapped distal regions (2 kb distant from the 5′-ends of genes). It was shown significant enrichment of genes related to carcinogenesis or Mia PaCa-2 cell identity genes in this group. In contrast, genes associated with 1–2 distal regions or only with proximal regions (within 2 kbp of the 5′-ends of genes) are more often related to housekeeping functions. Thus, ChIP-lentiMPRA is a useful strategy for creating libraries of regulatory elements for the study of tumor-specific gene transcription.

Abstract:
Engineered nanomaterials have been found to induce oxidative stress. Cellular oxidative stress, in turn, can result in the induction of antioxidant and detoxification enzymes which are controlled by the nuclear erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) transcription factor. Here, we present the results of a pre-validation study which was conducted within the frame of BIORIMA (“biomaterial risk management”) an EU-funded research and innovation project. For this we used an NRF2 specific chemically activated luciferase expression reporter gene assay derived from the human U2OS osteosarcoma cell line to screen for the induction of the NRF2 mediated gene expression following exposure to biomedically relevant nanobiomaterials. Specifically, we investigated Fe 3 O 4 -PEG-PLGA nanomaterials while Ag and TiO 2 “benchmark” nanomaterials from the Joint Research Center were used as reference materials. The viability of the cells was determined by using the Alamar blue assay. We performed an interlaboratory study involving seven different laboratories to assess the applicability of the NRF2 reporter gene assay for the screening of nanobiomaterials. The latter work was preceded by online tutorials to ensure that the procedures were harmonized across the different participating laboratories. Fe 3 O 4 -PEG-PLGA nanomaterials were found to induce very limited NRF2 mediated gene expression, whereas exposure to Ag nanomaterials induced NRF2 mediated gene expression. TiO 2 nanomaterials did not induce NRF2 mediated gene expression. The variability in the results obtained by the participating laboratories was small with mean intra-laboratory standard deviation of 0.16 and mean inter laboratory standard deviation of 0.28 across all NRF2 reporter gene assay results. We conclude that the NRF2 reporter gene assay is a suitable assay for the screening of nanobiomaterial-induced oxidative stress responses.

Authors: Adam J. Litterman, Robin Kageyama, Olivier Le Tonqueze, Wenxue Zhao, John D. Gagnon, Hani Goodarzi, David J. Erle, K. Mark Ansel
Date: 2019-06

Abstract:
Compared to coding sequences, untranslated regions of the transcriptome are not well conserved, and functional annotation of these sequences is challenging. Global relationships between nucleotide composition of 3′ UTR sequences and their sequence conservation have been appreciated since mammalian genomes were first sequenced, but the functional relevance of these patterns remain unknown. We systematically measured the effect on gene expression of the sequences of more than 25,000 RNA-binding protein (RBP) binding sites in primary mouse T cells using a massively parallel reporter assay. GC-rich sequences were destabilizing of reporter mRNAs and come from more rapidly evolving regions of the genome. These sequences were more likely to be folded in vivo and contain a number of structural motifs that reduced accumulation of a heterologous reporter protein. Comparison of full-length 3′ UTR sequences across vertebrate phylogeny revealed that strictly conserved 3′ UTRs were GC-poor and enriched in genes associated with organismal development. In contrast, rapidly evolving 3′ UTRs tended to be GC-rich and derived from genes involved in metabolism and immune responses. Cell-essential genes had lower GC content in their 3′ UTRs, suggesting a connection between unstructured mRNA noncoding sequences and optimal protein production. By reducing gene expression, GC-rich RBP-occupied sequences act as a rapidly evolving substrate for gene regulatory interactions.

Title: Retrograde BMP signaling activates neuronal gene expression through widespread deployment of a conserved BMP-responsive cis -regulatory activation element
Authors: Robin Vuilleumier, Tianshun Lian, Stephane Flibotte, Zaynah N Khan, Alisa Fuchs, George Pyrowolakis, Douglas W Allan
Date: 2019-01-25

Abstract:
Retrograde Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling in neurons is essential for the differentiation and synaptic function of many neuronal subtypes. BMP signaling regulates these processes via Smad transcription factor activity, yet the scope and nature of Smad-dependent gene regulation in neurons are mostly unknown. Here, we applied a computational approach to predict Smad-binding cis -regulatory BMP-Activating Element s ( BMP-AE s) in Drosophila , followed by transgenic in vivo reporter analysis to test their neuronal subtype enhancer activity in the larval central nervous system (CNS). We identified 34 BMP-AE -containing genomic fragments that are responsive to BMP signaling in neurons, and showed that the embedded BMP-AEs are required for this activity. RNA-seq analysis identified BMP-responsive genes in the CNS and revealed that BMP-AE s selectively enrich near BMP-activated genes. These data suggest that functional BMP-AE s control nearby BMP-activated genes, which we validated experimentally. Finally, we demonstrated that the BMP-AE motif mediates a conserved Smad-responsive function in the Drosophila and vertebrate CNS. Our results provide evidence that BMP signaling controls neuronal function by directly coordinating the expression of a battery of genes through widespread deployment of a conserved Smad-responsive cis -regulatory motif.

Title: A novel luciferase‐based reporter tool to monitor the dynamics of carbon catabolite repression in filamentous fungi
Authors: Marcel Rüllke, Franziska Meyer, Kevin Schmitz, Hannes Blase, Elisabeth Tamayo, J. Philipp Benz
Date: 2024-09-13

Abstract:
Filamentous fungi with their diverse inventory of carbohydrate‐active enzymes promise a holistic usage of lignocellulosic residues. A major challenge for application is the inherent repression of enzyme production by carbon catabolite repression (CCR). In the presence of preferred carbon sources, the transcription factor CreA/CRE‐1 binds to specific but conserved motifs in promoters of genes involved in sugar metabolism, but the status of CCR is notoriously difficult to quantify. To allow for a real‐time evaluation of CreA/CRE‐1‐mediated CCR at the transcriptional level, we developed a luciferase‐based construct, representing a dynamic, highly responsive reporter system that is inhibited by monosaccharides in a quantitative fashion. Using this tool, CreA/CRE‐1‐dependent CCR triggered by several monosaccharides could be measured in Neurospora crassa , Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus nidulans over the course of hours, demonstrating distinct and dynamic regulatory processes. Furthermore, we used the reporter to visualize the direct impacts of multiple CreA truncations on CCR induction. Our reporter thus offers a widely applicable quantitative approach to evaluate CreA/CRE‐1‐mediated CCR across diverse fungal species and will help to elucidate the multifaceted effects of CCR on fungal physiology for both basic research and industrial strain engineering endeavours.

Title: Characterization of a single reporter-gene potency assay for T-cell-dependent bispecific molecules
Authors: Ho Young Lee, Ames Register, Jeongsup Shim, Edward Contreras, Qiang Wu, Guoying Jiang
Date: 2019-10

Abstract:
T-cell-dependent bispecific antibodies (TDBs) are promising cancer immunotherapies that recruit patients’ T cells to kill cancer cells. There are many TDBs in clinical trials, demonstrating their widely recognized therapeutic potential. However, their complex, multi-step mechanism of action (MoA), which includes bispecific antigen binding, T-cell activation, and target-cell killing, presents unique challenges for biological characterization and potency assay selection. Here, we describe the development of a single reporter-gene potency assay for a TDB (TDB1) that is MoA reflective and sensitive to binding of both antigens. Our reporter-gene assay measures T-cell activation using Jurkat cells engineered to express luciferase under the control of an NFkB response element. The potencies of select samples were measured both by this assay and by a flow-cytometry-based cell-killing assay using human lymphocytes as effector cells. Correlating the two sets of potency results clearly establishes our reporter-gene assay as MoA reflective. Furthermore, correlating potencies for the same panel of samples against binding data measured by binding assays for each individual arm demonstrates that the reporter-gene potency assay reflects dual-antigen binding and can detect changes in affinity for either arm. This work demonstrates that one reporter-gene assay can be used to measure the potency of TDB1 while capturing key aspects of its MoA, thus serving as a useful case study of selection and justification of reporter-gene potency assays for TDBs. Furthermore, our strategy of correlating reporter-gene potency, target-cell killing, and antigen binding for each individual arm serves as a useful example of a thorough, holistic approach to biological characterization for TDBs that can be applied to other bispecific molecules.

Date: 2024-03-05

Abstract:
The environment animals face when young can affect how they function throughout life. Long-lasting changes in DNA methylation—a chemical mark deposited on DNA that can affect gene activity—have been hypothesized to contribute to early-life effects. But evidence for persistent, early environment-associated differences in DNA methylation is lacking in wild animals. Here, we show that early-life adversity in wild baboons predicts DNA methylation levels in adulthood, especially for animals born in low-resource environments and drought conditions. We also show that some of the changes we observe in DNA methylation have the capacity to influence gene activity levels. Together, our results support the idea that early experiences can become biologically embedded in the genomes of wild animals.

Abstract:
The solute carrier (SLC) superfamily represents the biggest family of transporters with important roles in health and disease. Despite being attractive and druggable targets, the majority of SLCs remains understudied. One major hurdle in research on SLCs is the lack of tools, such as cell-based assays to investigate their biological role and for drug discovery. Another challenge is the disperse and anecdotal information on assay strategies that are suitable for SLCs. This review provides a comprehensive overview of state-of-the-art cellular assay technologies for SLC research and discusses relevant SLC characteristics enabling the choice of an optimal assay technology. The Innovative Medicines Initiative consortium RESOLUTE intends to accelerate research on SLCs by providing the scientific community with high-quality reagents, assay technologies and data sets, and to ultimately unlock SLCs for drug discovery.

Title: Candidate silencer elements for the human and mouse genomes
Authors: Naresh Doni Jayavelu, Ajay Jajodia, Arpit Mishra, R. David Hawkins
Date: 2020-02-26

Abstract:
The study of gene regulation is dominated by a focus on the control of gene activation or increase in the level of expression. Just as critical is the process of gene repression or silencing. Chromatin signatures have identified enhancers, however, genome-wide identification of silencers by computational or experimental approaches are lacking. Here, we first define uncharacterized cis -regulatory elements likely containing silencers and find that 41.5% of ~7500 tested elements show silencer activity using massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA). We trained a support vector machine classifier based on MPRA data to predict candidate silencers in over 100 human and mouse cell or tissue types. The predicted candidate silencers exhibit characteristics expected of silencers. Leveraging promoter-capture HiC data, we find that over 50% of silencers are interacting with gene promoters having very low to no expression. Our results suggest a general strategy for genome-wide identification and characterization of silencer elements.

Abstract:
Multiplex assays of variant effect (MAVEs) are a family of methods that includes deep mutational scanning experiments on proteins and massively parallel reporter assays on gene regulatory sequences. Despite their increasing popularity, a general strategy for inferring quantitative models of genotype-phenotype maps from MAVE data is lacking. Here we introduce MAVE-NN, a neural-network-based Python package that implements a broadly applicable information-theoretic framework for learning genotype-phenotype maps—including biophysically interpretable models—from MAVE datasets. We demonstrate MAVE-NN in multiple biological contexts, and highlight the ability of our approach to deconvolve mutational effects from otherwise confounding experimental nonlinearities and noise.

Abstract:
Transcriptional regulatory elements (TREs) orchestrate gene expression programs fundamental to cellular identity and transitions between physiological and pathological states. Decoding the regulatory logic of human biology requires resolving where, when, and how these elements are transcriptionally engaged. Here, we profiled the active transcriptional regulatory landscape across all major organ systems and a broad spectrum of developmental and disease states using PRO-cap, a high-resolution method that captures nascent transcription start sites with unprecedented sensitivity and specificity. This atlas of active TREs highlights elements shaped by their cellular contexts and evolutionary constraints, sheds light on the genetic architecture of human traits and diseases, and reveals how patterns of transcription initiation and pausing encode regulatory logic. In cancer, nascent transcription enables the delineation of lineage-specific regulatory states, metastatic adaptations, and the co-option of pre-existing programs. Together, these findings establish nascent transcription as a core dimension of gene regulation, illuminating principles that govern development, physiology, and disease.

Title: Engineering and validation of a dual luciferase reporter system for quantitative and systematic assessment of regulatory sequences in Chinese hamster ovary cells
Authors: Yagmur Toktay, Bengisu Dayanc, Serif Senturk
Date: 2022-04-11

Abstract:
Ongoing research efforts to identify potent regulatory sequences that deliver robust and sustained transgene expression are critical for Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line development technologies to meet the growing demand for recombinant proteins. Here we report the engineering and validation of a highly customizable single vector toolkit that comprises an all-in-one dual luciferase reporter system for quantitative and systematic interrogation of transcriptional regulatory sequences in transient and stable transfectants of CHO cells. To model the execution of the reporter system, we implemented a battery of known constitutive promoters including human CMV-mIE, SV40, HSV-TK, mouse PGK, human EF1α, EF1α short (EFS), human UBC, synthetic CAG, and Chinese hamster EF1α (CHEF1α). Of the nine promoters, CMV-mIE yielded the highest transcriptional activity in transient transfection settings, while CHEF1α was the strongest among a select subset of promoters in stable transfectants of CHO-DG44 pools. Remodeling the vector toolkit to build a dual fluorescent reporter system featured an alternative to bioluminescence based reporters. We infer that the findings of this study may serve as a basis to establish new vectors with weak or strong constitutive promoters. Furthermore, the modular all-in-one architecture of the reporter system proved to be a viable tool for discovering novel regulatory sequences that ensure high levels of transient and stable transgene expression in CHO and perhaps other mammalian cell lines.

Abstract:
Most genetic loci linked to polygenic traits are in non-coding regions, with complex regulation and linkage disequilibrium (LD), complicating causal variant and gene prioritization. We used multiplexed single-cell CRISPR interference and activation perturbations to investigate cis -regulatory element (CRE) and gene expression relationships within tight LD in the endogenous chromatin context. We demonstrated the prevalence of multiple causality in perfect LD (pLD) for independent expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and uncovered fine-grained genetic effects on gene expression within pLD, which are difficult to decipher using traditional eQTL fine-mapping or existing computational methods. We found that over one-third of the causal CREs lack classical epigenetic markers prior to perturbation, and we functionally validated one of these hidden regulatory mechanisms. Leveraging Multiome single-cell epigenetic and sequence perturbations, we highlighted the regulatory plasticity of the human genome. Our study will guide the exploration of missing causal mechanisms underlying molecular trait regulation and disease development.

Title: Cell-Based Reporter System for High-Throughput Screening of MicroRNA Pathway Inhibitors and Its Limitations

Abstract:
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNAs repressing gene expression. They contribute to many physiological processes and pathologies. Consequently, strategies for manipulation of the miRNA pathway are of interest as they could provide tools for experimental or therapeutic interventions. One of such tools could be small chemical compounds identified through high-throughput screening (HTS) with reporter assays. While a number of chemical compounds have been identified in such high-throughput screens, their application potential remains elusive. Here, we report our experience with cell-based HTS of a library of 12,816 chemical compounds to identify miRNA pathway modulators. We used human HeLa and mouse NIH 3T3 cell lines with stably integrated or transiently expressed luciferase reporters repressed by endogenous miR-30 and let-7 miRNAs and identified 163 putative miRNA inhibitors. We report that compounds relieving miRNA-mediated repression via stress induction are infrequent; we have found only two compounds that reproducibly induced stress granules and relieved miRNA-targeted reporter repression. However, we have found that this assay type readily yields non-specific (miRNA-independent) stimulators of luciferase reporter activity. Furthermore, our data provide partial support for previously published miRNA pathway modulators; the most notable intersections were found among anthracyclines, dopamine derivatives, flavones, and stilbenes. Altogether, our results underscore the importance of appropriate negative controls in development of small compound inhibitors of the miRNA pathway. This particularly concerns validation strategies, which would greatly profit from assays that fundamentally differ from the routinely employed miRNA-targeted reporter assays.

and Biofluids

Date: 2022-01-07

Abstract:
Synthetic molecular
probes, chemosensors, and nanosensors used
in combination with innovative assay protocols hold great potential
for the development of robust, low-cost, and fast-responding sensors
that are applicable in biofluids (urine, blood, and saliva). Particularly,
the development of sensors for metabolites, neurotransmitters, drugs,
and inorganic ions is highly desirable due to a lack of suitable biosensors.
In addition, the monitoring and analysis of metabolic and signaling
networks in cells and organisms by optical probes and chemosensors
is becoming increasingly important in molecular biology and medicine.
Thus, new perspectives for personalized diagnostics, theranostics,
and biochemical/medical research will be unlocked when standing limitations
of artificial binders and receptors are overcome. In this review,
we survey synthetic sensing systems that have promising (future) application
potential for the detection of small molecules, cations, and anions
in aqueous media and biofluids. Special attention was given to sensing
systems that provide a readily measurable optical signal through dynamic
covalent chemistry, supramolecular host–guest interactions,
or nanoparticles featuring plasmonic effects. This review shall also
enable the reader to evaluate the current performance of molecular
probes, chemosensors, and nanosensors in terms of sensitivity and
selectivity with respect to practical requirement, and thereby inspiring
new ideas for the development of further advanced systems.

Abstract:
Reporter alleles are essential for advancing research with human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), notably in developmental biology and disease modeling. This study investigates the state-of-the-art gene-editing techniques tailored for generating reporter alleles in hiPSCs, emphasizing their effectiveness in investigating cellular dynamics and disease mechanisms. Various methodologies, including the application of CRISPR/Cas9 technology, are discussed for accurately integrating reporter genes into the specific genomic loci. The synthesis of findings from the studies utilizing these reporter alleles reveals insights into developmental processes, genetic disorder modeling, and therapeutic screening, consolidating the existing knowledge. These hiPSC-derived models demonstrate remarkable versatility in replicating human diseases and evaluating drug efficacy, thereby accelerating translational research. Furthermore, this review addresses challenges and future directions in refining the reporter allele design and application to bolster their reliability and relevance in biomedical research. Overall, this investigation offers a comprehensive perspective on the methodologies, applications, and implications of reporter alleles in hiPSC-based studies, underscoring their essential role in advancing both fundamental scientific understanding and clinical practice.

Title: Development, scrutiny, and modulation of transient reporter gene assays of the xenobiotic metabolism pathway in zebrafish hepatocytes
Authors: Sebastian Lungu-Mitea, Yuxin Han, Johan Lundqvist
Date: 2021-10-15

Abstract:
The “toxicology in the twenty-first century” paradigm shift demands the development of alternative in vitro test systems. Especially in the field of ecotoxicology, coverage of aquatic species-specific assays is relatively scarce. Transient reporter gene assays could be a quick, economical, and reliable bridging technology. However, the user should be aware of potential pitfalls that are influenced by reporter vector geometry. Here, we report the development of an AhR-responsive transient reporter-gene assay in the permanent zebrafish hepatocytes cell line (ZFL). Additionally, we disclose how viral, constitutive promoters within reporter-gene assay cassettes induce squelching of the primary signal. To counter this, we designed a novel normalization vector, bearing an endogenous zebrafish-derived genomic promoter (zfEF1aPro), which rescues the squelching-delimited system, thus, giving new insights into the modulation of transient reporter systems under xenobiotic stress. Finally, we uncovered how the ubiquitously used ligand BNF promiscuously activates multiple toxicity pathways of the xenobiotic metabolism and cellular stress response in an orchestral manner, presumably leading to a concentration-related inhibition of the AhR/ARNT/XRE-toxicity pathway and non-monotonous concentration–response curves. We named such a multi-level inhibitory mechanism that might mask effects as “maisonette squelching . ” A transient reporter gene assay in zebrafish cell lines utilizing endogenous regulatory gene elements shows increased in vitro toxicity testing performance. Synthetic and constitutive promotors interfere with signal transduction (“squelching”) and might increase cellular stress (cytotoxicity). The squelching phenomenon might occur on multiple levels (toxicity pathway crosstalk and normalization vector), leading to a complete silencing of the reporter signal.

Date: 2022-08-26

Abstract:
Correct pre-mRNA processing in higher eukaryotes vastly depends on splice site recognition. Beyond conserved 5′ss and 3′ss motifs, splicing regulatory elements (SREs) play a pivotal role in this recognition process. Here, we present in silico designed sequences with arbitrary a priori prescribed splicing regulatory HEXplorer properties that can be concatenated to arbitrary length without changing their regulatory properties. We experimentally validated in silico predictions in a massively parallel splicing reporter assay on more than 3000 sequences and exemplarily identified some SRE binding proteins. Aiming at a unified ‘functional splice site strength’ encompassing both U1 snRNA complementarity and impact from neighboring SREs, we developed a novel RNA-seq based 5′ss usage landscape, mapping the competition of pairs of high confidence 5′ss and neighboring exonic GT sites along HBond and HEXplorer score coordinate axes on human fibroblast and endothelium transcriptome datasets. These RNA-seq data served as basis for a logistic 5′ss usage prediction model, which greatly improved discrimination between strong but unused exonic GT sites and annotated highly used 5′ss. Our 5′ss usage landscape offers a unified view on 5′ss and SRE neighborhood impact on splice site recognition, and may contribute to improved mutation assessment in human genetics.

Title: Optimized reporters for multiplexed detection of transcription factor activity
Authors: Max Trauernicht, Teodora Filipovska, Chaitanya Rastogi, Bas van Steensel
Date: 2024-12-18

Abstract:
In any given cell type, dozens of transcription factors (TFs) act in concert to control the activity of the genome by binding to specific DNA sequences in regulatory elements. Despite their considerable importance, we currently lack simple tools to directly measure the activity of many TFs in parallel. Massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) allow the detection of TF activities in a multiplexed fashion; however, we lack basic understanding to rationally design sensitive reporters for many TFs. Here, we use an MPRA to systematically optimize transcriptional reporters for 86 TFs and evaluate the specificity of all reporters across a wide array of TF perturbation conditions. We thus identified critical TF reporter design features and obtained highly sensitive and specific reporters for 62 TFs, many of which outperform available reporters. The resulting collection of “prime” TF reporters can be used to uncover TF regulatory networks and to illuminate signaling pathways. A record of this paper’s transparent peer review process is included in the supplemental information .

Title: A transient in planta editing assay identifies specific binding of the splicing regulator PTB as a prerequisite for cassette exon inclusion
Authors: Jorinde Loeser, Julia Bauer, Kim Janßen, Kevin Rockenbach, Andreas Wachter
Date: 2024-03-05

Abstract:
The dynamic interaction of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) with their target RNAs contributes to the diversity of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes that are involved in a myriad of biological processes. Identifying the RNP components at high resolution and defining their interactions are key to understanding their regulation and function. Expressing fusions between an RBP of interest and an RNA editing enzyme can result in nucleobase changes in target RNAs, representing a recent addition to experimental approaches for profiling RBP/RNA interactions. Here, we have used the MS2 protein/RNA interaction to test four RNA editing proteins for their suitability to detect target RNAs of RBPs in planta . We have established a transient test system for fast and simple quantification of editing events and identified the hyperactive version of the catalytic domain of an adenosine deaminase (hADARcd) as the most suitable editing enzyme. Examining fusions between homologs of polypyrimidine tract binding proteins (PTBs) from Arabidopsis thaliana and hADARcd allowed determining target RNAs with high sensitivity and specificity. Moreover, almost complete editing of a splicing intermediate provided insight into the order of splicing reactions and PTB dependency of this particular splicing event. Addition of sequences for nuclear localisation of the fusion protein increased the editing efficiency, highlighting this approach’s potential to identify RBP targets in a compartment-specific manner. Our studies have established the editing-based analysis of interactions between RBPs and their RNA targets in a fast and straightforward assay, offering a new system to study the intricate composition and functions of plant RNPs in vivo.

Abstract:
Hormone-dependent promoters are very efficient in transgene expression. Plasmid-based reporter assays have identified regulatory sequences of the Ovalbumin promoter that are involved in response to estrogen and have shown that the deletion of the steroid-dependent regulatory element (SDRE) and negative regulatory element (NRE) leads to a steroid-independent expression of a reporter. However, the functional roles of these regulatory elements within the native genomic context of the Ovalbumin promoter have not been evaluated. In this study, we show that the negative effects of the NRE element on the Ovalbumin gene can be counteracted by CRISPR interference. We also show that the CRISPR-mediated deletion of SDRE and NRE promoter elements in a non-oviduct cell can lead to the significant expression of the Ovalbumin gene. In addition, the targeted knock-in of a transgene reporter in the Ovalbumin coding region and its expression confirms that the truncated promoter of the Ovalbumin gene can be efficiently used for an estrogen-independent expression of a foreign gene. The methodology applied in this paper allowed the study of promoter regulatory sequences in their native nuclear organization.

Title: Advancements in the application of reporter gene cell lines in bioactivity evaluation of biological products
Authors: Kaijuan Yi, Can Wang, Huili Lu
Date: 2025-09-24

Abstract:
The assessment of biological product activity is a key aspect of quality control. Currently, in vitro assays serve as the primarily method employed by both companies and regulatory agencies to evaluate biological activity. Reporter Gene Assay (RGA) is a technique that investigates gene expression regulation and cellular signal transduction pathway activation through easily detectable reporter genes. RGA is highly dependent on drug mechanisms, offering high accuracy and precision, and has gained increasing recognition. The utilization of alternative analytical methods based on RGA have emerged as a prevailing trend, with a growing number of antibody drugs adopting corresponding RGA-based quality control approaches. Establishing stable expressing cell lines is essential to ensure the stability, reliability, and consistency of assays across diverse conditions when employing RGA techniques. CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology mediated site-specific gene integration allows for rapid and precise insertion of exogenous genes into specific genomic loci and enables the efficient construction of stable RGA cell lines, which would significantly propel the advancement of biological activity evaluation methods.

Abstract:
Background: An effective vaccine against Nipah virus (NiV) is crucial due to its high fatality rate and recurrent outbreaks in South and Southeast Asia. Vaccine development is challenged by the lack of validated accessible neutralization assays, as virus culture requires BSL-4 facilities, restricting implementation in resource-limited settings. To address this, we standardized and validated a pseudotyped virus neutralization assay (PNA) for assessing NiV-neutralizing antibodies in BSL-2 laboratories. Methods: The NiV-PNA was validated following international regulatory standards, using a replication-defective recombinant Vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) backbone dependent pseudotyped virus. Assessments included sensitivity, specificity, dilutional linearity, relative accuracy, precision, and robustness. The assay was calibrated using the WHO International Standard for anti-NiV antibodies and characterized reference sera to ensure reliable performance. Findings: Preliminary evaluation of the developed NiV-PNA showed 100% sensitivity and specificity across 10 serum samples (5 positive, 5 negative), with a positive correlation to a calibrated reference assay (R 2 = 0.8461). Dilutional linearity (R 2 = 0.9940) and accuracy (98.18%) were confirmed across the analytical titer range of 11-1728 IU/mL. The assay also exhibited high precision, with intra-assay and intermediate precision geometric coefficients of variation of 6.66% and 15.63%, respectively. Robustness testing demonstrated minimal variation across different pseudotyped virus lots, incubation times, and cell counts. Conclusions : The validated NiV-PNA is a reproducible and scalable assay platform for quantifying NiV neutralizing antibodies, offering a safer alternative to virus culture. Its validation and integration into the CEPI Centralized Laboratory Network will enhance global capacity for vaccine evaluation and outbreak preparedness.

Abstract:
The capability of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) to self-renew and differentiate into any cell type has greatly contributed to the advancement of biomedicine. Reporter lines derived from hPSCs have played a crucial role in elucidating the mechanisms underlying human development and diseases by acting as an alternative reporter system that cannot be used in living humans. To bring hPSCs closer to clinical application in transplantation, scientists have generated reporter lines for isolating the desired cell populations, as well as improving graft quality and treatment outcomes. This review presents an overview of the applications of hPSC reporter lines and the important variables in designing a reporter system, including options for gene delivery and editing tools, design of reporter constructs, and selection of reporter genes. It also provides insights into the prospects of hPSC reporter lines and the challenges that must be overcome to maximize the potential of hPSC reporter lines.

Abstract:
Long regulatory elements (LREs), such as CpG islands, polydA:dT tracts or AU-rich elements, are thought to play key roles in gene regulation but, as opposed to conventional binding sites of transcription factors, few methods have been proposed to formally and automatically characterize them. We present here a computational approach named DExTER (Domain Exploration To Explain gene Regulation) dedicated to the identification of candidate LREs (cLREs) and apply it to the analysis of the genomes of P . falciparum and other eukaryotes. Our analyses show that all tested genomes contain several cLREs that are somewhat conserved along evolution, and that gene expression can be predicted with surprising accuracy on the basis of these long regions only. Regulation by cLREs exhibits very different behaviours depending on species and conditions. In P . falciparum and other Apicomplexan organisms as well as in Dictyostelium discoideum , the process appears highly dynamic, with different cLREs involved at different phases of the life cycle. For multicellular organisms, the same cLREs are involved in all tissues, but a dynamic behavior is observed along embryonic development stages. In P . falciparum , whose genome is known to be strongly depleted of transcription factors, cLREs are predictive of expression with an accuracy above 70%, and our analyses show that they are associated with both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation signals. Moreover, we assessed the biological relevance of one LRE discovered by DExTER in P . falciparum using an in vivo reporter assay. The source code (python) of DExTER is available at https://gite.lirmm.fr/menichelli/DExTER .

Abstract:
Gene expression governs cell fate, and is regulated via a complex interplay of transcription factors and molecules that change chromatin structure. Advances in sequencing-based assays have enabled investigation of these processes genome-wide, leading to large datasets that combine information on the dynamics of gene expression, transcription factor binding and chromatin structure as cells differentiate. While numerous studies focus on the effects of these features on broader gene regulation, less work has been done on the mechanisms of gene-specific transcriptional control. In this study, we have focussed on the latter by integrating gene expression data for the in vitro differentiation of murine ES cells to macrophages and cardiomyocytes, with dynamic data on chromatin structure, epigenetics and transcription factor binding. Combining a novel strategy to identify communities of related control elements with a penalized regression approach, we developed individual models to identify the potential control elements predictive of the expression of each gene. Our models were compared to an existing method and evaluated using the existing literature and new experimental data from embryonic stem cell differentiation reporter assays. Our method is able to identify transcriptional control elements in a gene specific manner that reflect known regulatory relationships and to generate useful hypotheses for further testing.

Abstract:
Annotation of newly sequenced genomes frequently includes genes, but rarely covers important non-coding genomic features such as the cis -regulatory modules—e.g., enhancers and silencers—that regulate gene expression. Here, we begin to remedy this situation by developing a workflow for rapid initial annotation of insect regulatory sequences, and provide a searchable database resource with enhancer predictions for 33 genomes. Using our previously developed SCRMshaw computational enhancer prediction method, we predict over 2.8 million regulatory sequences along with the tissues where they are expected to be active, in a set of insect species ranging over 360 million years of evolution. Extensive analysis and validation of the data provides several lines of evidence suggesting that we achieve a high true-positive rate for enhancer prediction. One, we show that our predictions target specific loci, rather than random genomic locations. Two, we predict enhancers in orthologous loci across a diverged set of species to a significantly higher degree than random expectation would allow. Three, we demonstrate that our predictions are highly enriched for regions of accessible chromatin. Four, we achieve a validation rate in excess of 70% using in vivo reporter gene assays. As we continue to annotate both new tissues and new species, our regulatory annotation resource will provide a rich source of data for the research community and will have utility for both small-scale (single gene, single species) and large-scale (many genes, many species) studies of gene regulation. In particular, the ability to search for functionally related regulatory elements in orthologous loci should greatly facilitate studies of enhancer evolution even among distantly related species.

Abstract:
Adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapy is often limited by pre-existing neutralizing antibodies (NAbs), yet current assays for NAb detection lack standardization and rarely quantify uncertainty, complicating cross-study comparisons. We present coreTIA (core Transduction Inhibition Assay), a comprehensive framework providing a modular experimental protocol and a statistically robust analysis pipeline. This integrated method delivers precise, reproducible NAb titers with quantified uncertainty for every result. coreTIA’s statistical framework enables robust estimation of neutralization even when dilution series are incomplete, helping to reduce repeat testing and minimizing sample volume requirements. Evaluation and refinement of key assay parameters support consistent performance across AAV serotypes. By providing a protocol and analysis suite as an open resource, coreTIA facilitates more consistent and transparent NAb measurement, potentially aiding assay harmonization and regulatory assessment, addressing a key barrier to progress in gene therapy research and development.

Abstract:
Cardiomyopathy (CMP) is a heritable disorder. Over 50% of cases are gene-elusive on clinical gene panel testing. The contribution of variants in non-coding DNA elements that result in cryptic splicing and regulate gene expression has not been explored. We analyzed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data in a discovery cohort of 209 pediatric CMP patients and 1953 independent replication genomes and exomes. We searched for protein-coding variants, and non-coding variants predicted to affect the function or expression of genes. Thirty-nine percent of cases harbored pathogenic coding variants in known CMP genes, and 5% harbored high-risk loss-of-function (LoF) variants in additional candidate CMP genes. Fifteen percent harbored high-risk regulatory variants in promoters and enhancers of CMP genes (odds ratio 2.25, p = 6.70 × 10 −7 versus controls). Genes involved in α-dystroglycan glycosylation ( FKTN , DTNA ) and desmosomal signaling ( DSC2 , DSG2 ) were most highly enriched for regulatory variants (odds ratio 6.7–58.1). Functional effects were confirmed in patient myocardium and reporter assays in human cardiomyocytes, and in zebrafish CRISPR knockouts. We provide strong evidence for the genomic contribution of functionally active variants in new genes and in regulatory elements of known CMP genes to early onset CMP.

Abstract:
CRISPR mutagenesis screens conducted with SpCas9 and other nucleases have identified certain cis -regulatory elements and genetic variants but at a limited resolution due to the absence of protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequences. Here, leveraging the broad targeting scope of the near-PAMless SpRY variant, we have demonstrated that saturated SpRY mutagenesis and base editing screens can faithfully identify functional regulatory elements and essential genetic variants for target gene expression at single-base resolution. We further extended this methodology to investigate a genome-wide association study (GWAS) locus at 10q22.1 associated with a red blood cell trait, where we identified potential enhancers regulating HK1 gene expression, despite not all of these enhancers exhibiting typical chromatin signatures. More importantly, our saturated base editing screens pinpoint multiple causal variants within this locus that would otherwise be missed by Bayesian statistical fine-mapping. Our approach is generally applicable to functional interrogation of all non-coding genomic elements while complementing other high-coverage CRISPR screens.

Abstract:
The formation of new blood vessels, or angiogenesis, is a complex process that plays important roles in growth and development, tissue and organ regeneration, as well as numerous pathological conditions. Angiogenesis undergoes multiple discrete steps that can be individually evaluated and quantified by a large number of bioassays. These independent assessments hold advantages but also have limitations. This article describes in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro bioassays that are available for the evaluation of angiogenesis and highlights critical aspects that are relevant for their execution and proper interpretation. As such, this collaborative work is the first edition of consensus guidelines on angiogenesis bioassays to serve for current and future reference.

Abstract:
Cells adopt highly polarized shapes and form distinct subcellular compartments in many cases due to the localization of many mRNAs to specific areas, where they are translated into proteins with local functions. This mRNA localization is mediated by specific cis -regulatory elements in mRNAs, commonly called ‘zipcodes’. Although there are hundreds of localized mRNAs, only a few zipcodes have been characterized. Here we describe a novel neuronal zipcode identification protocol (N-zip) that can identify zipcodes across hundreds of 3′ untranslated regions. This approach combines a method of separating the principal subcellular compartments of neurons—cell bodies and neurites—with a massively parallel reporter assay. N-zip identifies the let-7 binding site and (AU) n motif as de novo zipcodes in mouse primary cortical neurons. Our analysis also provides, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of an miRNA affecting mRNA localization and suggests a strategy for detecting many more zipcodes.

Abstract:
Gene therapies hold significant promise for treating previously incurable diseases. A number of gene therapies have already been approved for clinical use. Currently, gene therapies are mostly limited to the use of adeno-associated viruses and the herpes virus. Viral vectors, particularly those derived from human viruses, play a critical role in this therapeutic approach due to their ability to efficiently deliver genetic material to target cells. Despite their advantages, such as stable gene expression and efficient transduction, viral vectors face numerous limitations that hinder their broad application. These limitations include small cloning capacities, immune and inflammatory responses, and risks of insertional mutagenesis. This review explores the current landscape of viral vectors used in gene therapy, discussing the different types of DNA- and RNA-based viral vectors, their characteristics, limitations, and current medical and potential clinical applications. The review also highlights strategies to overcome existing challenges, including optimizing vector design, improving safety profiles, and enhancing transgene expression both using molecular techniques and nanotechnologies, as well as by approved drug formulations.

Date: 2025-07-19

Abstract:
Atherosclerosis is a complex disease characterized by pathological thickening of the arterial intima. The mechanisms underlying the induction and progression of atherosclerosis are convoluted and remain under active investigation, with key components such as lipid accumulation and local inflammation being identified. Several risk factors (e.g., metabolic disorders, genetic background, diet, infections) have been shown to exacerbate disease progression, but their roles as clinically relevant markers remain to be established. Despite the growing body of evidence on the molecular pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, there is no effective preventive treatment against the development of this disease. In this review, we focus on gene targets for gene therapy as a novel potential approach to cure and prevent atherosclerosis. We critically review recent research demonstrating the therapeutic potential of viral vector-based (adeno-associated virus (AAV) and lentivirus) gene therapy for the treatment of atherosclerosis. We also summarize alternative gene targets and approaches (e.g., non-coding RNA (ncRNA), micro RNA (miRNA), small interfering RNA (siRNA), antisense oligonucleotide (ASO), CRISPR/Cas9) that aim to limit disease progression. We highlight the importance of local inflammation in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and propose gene targets with anti-inflammatory activity to inhibit the pathological inflammatory response. In addition, we provide perspectives on the future development of gene therapeutics and their potential applications. We anticipate that recent advances in gene therapy will help to identify new and effective targets to prevent atherosclerosis.

Abstract:
Despite scientific discoveries in the field of gene and cell therapy, some diseases still have no effective treatment. Advances in genetic engineering methods have enabled the development of effective gene therapy methods for various diseases based on adeno-associated viruses (AAVs). Today, many AAV-based gene therapy medications are being investigated in preclinical and clinical trials, and new ones are appearing on the market. In this article, we present a review of AAV discovery, properties, different serotypes, and tropism, and a following detailed explanation of their uses in gene therapy for disease of different organs and systems.

Title: Clinical applications of gene therapy for rare diseases: A review
Authors: Ioannis Papaioannou, James S. Owen, Rafael J. Yáñez‐Muñoz
Date: 2023-05-13

Abstract:
Rare diseases collectively exact a high toll on society due to their sheer number and overall prevalence. Their heterogeneity, diversity, and nature pose daunting clinical challenges for both management and treatment. In this review, we discuss recent advances in clinical applications of gene therapy for rare diseases, focusing on a variety of viral and non‐viral strategies. The use of adeno‐associated virus (AAV) vectors is discussed in the context of Luxturna, licenced for the treatment of RPE65 deficiency in the retinal epithelium. Imlygic, a herpes virus vector licenced for the treatment of refractory metastatic melanoma, will be an example of oncolytic vectors developed against rare cancers. Yescarta and Kymriah will showcase the use of retrovirus and lentivirus vectors in the autologous ex vivo production of chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR‐T), licenced for the treatment of refractory leukaemias and lymphomas. Similar retroviral and lentiviral technology can be applied to autologous haematopoietic stem cells, exemplified by Strimvelis and Zynteglo, licenced treatments for adenosine deaminase‐severe combined immunodeficiency (ADA‐SCID) and β‐thalassaemia respectively. Antisense oligonucleotide technologies will be highlighted through Onpattro and Tegsedi, RNA interference drugs licenced for familial transthyretin (TTR) amyloidosis, and Spinraza, a splice‐switching treatment for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). An initial comparison of the effectiveness of AAV and oligonucleotide therapies in SMA is possible with Zolgensma, an AAV serotype 9 vector, and Spinraza. Through these examples of marketed gene therapies and gene cell therapies, we will discuss the expanding applications of such novel technologies to previously intractable rare diseases.

Abstract:
In the past decade, there has been substantive progress in gene therapy across disease indications. However, despite multiple gene therapies being approved for clinical use, none have a cardiovascular indication. Several reasons for this have inhibited or delayed progress in the cardiovascular field. First, developing cardiovascular gene therapeutics represents a substantial technical challenge, particularly relating to identifying and building effective delivery systems for therapeutic cargo that will be sufficient to gain meaningful efficacy with acceptable safety for the patient. Second, for genetic disease, gene editing therapy of pathogenic variants is at a relatively early stage of development. Third, since this is a field in development, the optimal design of clinical trials of cardiovascular gene therapies is also evolving and requires expert attention. Despite this, recent and current clinical trials are charting new ground, gaining valuable new patient-focused information that provides critical new learning and bench-to-bedside iterative development that has been so successful in other disease areas. While most clinical trials currently focus on cardiac gene therapy, vascular approaches are being developed, both genetic and common. We herein review the state-of-the-art in this rapidly progressing field of study. We consider gene therapy vector design, including transcriptional control, an area of incredible opportunity through engineering biology approaches to design, build, and test bespoke transcriptional units for expression of therapeutic cargo. Achieving progress in this exciting field will require close working between all stakeholders, including academic, clinical, industry, regulatory, and patient communities. Based on current progress, there is a 10-year horizon for bringing several cardiovascular gene therapies to licensing.

Authors: Carsten T. Charlesworth, Ian Hsu, Adam C. Wilkinson, Hiromitsu Nakauchi
Date: 2022-03-17

Abstract:
Cell and gene therapies using haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) epitomize the transformative potential of regenerative medicine. Recent clinical successes for gene therapies involving autologous HSC transplantation (HSCT) demonstrate the potential of genetic engineering in this stem cell type for curing disease. With recent advances in CRISPR gene-editing technologies, methodologies for the ex vivo expansion of HSCs and non-genotoxic conditioning protocols, the range of clinical indications for HSC-based gene therapies is expected to significantly expand. However, substantial immunological challenges need to be overcome. These include pre-existing immunity to gene-therapy reagents, immune responses to neoantigens introduced into HSCs by genetic engineering, and unique challenges associated with next-generation and off-the-shelf HSC products. By synthesizing these factors in this Review, we hope to encourage more research to address the immunological issues associated with current and next-generation HSC-based gene therapies to help realize the full potential of this field.

Abstract:
Recombination activating genes ( RAG ) 1 and 2 defects are the most frequent form of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). Patients with residual RAG activity have a spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from Omenn syndrome to delayed-onset combined immunodeficiency, often associated with granulomas and/or autoimmunity (CID-G/AI). Lentiviral vector (LV) gene therapy (GT) has been proposed as an alternative treatment to the standard hematopoietic stem cell transplant and a clinical trial for RAG1 SCID patients recently started. However, GT in patients with hypomorphic RAG mutations poses additional risks, because of the residual endogenous RAG1 expression and the general state of immune dysregulation and associated inflammation. In this study, we assessed the efficacy of GT in 2 hypomorphic Rag1 murine models (Rag1 F971L/F971L and Rag1 R972Q/R972Q ), exploiting the same LV used in the clinical trial encoding RAG1 under control of the MND promoter. Starting 6 weeks after transplant, GT-treated mice showed a decrease in proportion of myeloid cells and a concomitant increase of B, T and total white blood cells. However, counts remained lower than in mice transplanted with WT Lin- cells. At euthanasia, we observed a general redistribution of immune subsets in tissues, with the appearance of mature recirculating B cells in the bone marrow. In the thymus, we demonstrated correction of the block at double negative stage, with a modest improvement in the cortical/medullary ratio. Analysis of antigenspecific IgM and IgG serum levels after in vivo challenge showed an amelioration of antibody responses, suggesting that the partial immune correction could confer a clinical benefit. Notably, no overt signs of autoimmunity were detected, with B-cell activating factor decreasing to normal levels and autoantibodies remaining stable after GT. On the other hand, thymic enlargement was frequently observed, although not due to vector integration and insertional mutagenesis. In conclusion, our work shows that GT could partially alleviate the combined immunodeficiency of hypomorphic RAG1 patients and that extensive efficacy and safety studies with alternative models are required before commencing RAG gene therapy in thesehighly complex patients.

Title: The Immune Response to the fVIII Gene Therapy in Preclinical Models
Authors: Seema R. Patel, Taran S. Lundgren, H. Trent Spencer, Christopher B. Doering
Date: 2020-04-15

Abstract:
Neutralizing antibodies to factor VIII (fVIII), referred to as “inhibitors,” remain the most challenging complication post-fVIII replacement therapy. Preclinical development of novel fVIII products involves studies incorporating hemophilia A (HA) and wild-type animal models. Though immunogenicity is a critical aspect of preclinical pharmacology studies, gene therapy studies tend to focus on fVIII expression levels without major consideration for immunogenicity. Therefore, little clarity exists on whether preclinical testing can be predictive of clinical immunogenicity risk. Despite this, but perhaps due to the potential for transformative benefits, clinical gene therapy trials have progressed rapidly. In more than two decades, no inhibitors have been observed. However, all trials are conducted in previously treated patients without a history of inhibitors. The current review thus focuses on our understanding of preclinical immunogenicity for HA gene therapy candidates and the potential indication for inhibitor treatment, with a focus on product- and platform-specific determinants, including fVIII transgene sequence composition and tissue/vector biodistribution. Currently, the two leading clinical gene therapy vectors are adeno-associated viral (AAV) and lentiviral (LV) vectors. For HA applications, AAV vectors are liver-tropic and employ synthetic, high-expressing, liver-specific promoters. Factors including vector serotype and biodistribution, transcriptional regulatory elements, transgene sequence, dosing, liver immunoprivilege, and host immune status may contribute to tipping the scale between immunogenicity and tolerance. Many of these factors can also be important in delivery of LV-fVIII gene therapy, especially when delivered intravenously for liver-directed fVIII expression. However, ex vivo LV-fVIII targeting and transplantation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) has been demonstrated to achieve durable and curative fVIII production without inhibitor development in preclinical models. A critical variable appears to be pre-transplantation conditioning regimens that suppress and/or ablate T cells. Additionally, we and others have demonstrated the potential of LV-fVIII HSPC and liver-directed AAV-fVIII gene therapy to eradicate pre-existing inhibitors in murine and canine models of HA, respectively. Future preclinical studies will be essential to elucidate immune mechanism(s) at play in the context of gene therapy for HA, as well as strategies for preventing adverse immune responses and promoting immune tolerance even in the setting of pre-existing inhibitors.

Authors: Fengqi Jiang, Chuanhe Zhang, Weina Liu, Fangyuan Liu, Haiyan Huang, Yao Tan, Bo Qin
Date: 2023-12-08

Abstract:
Gene therapy involves introducing and editing foreign genes in the body to treat and prevent genetic diseases. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector has become a widely used tool in gene therapy due to its high safety and transfection efficiency. This study employs bibliometric analysis to explore the foundation and current state of AAV vector application in gene therapy research. A total of 6,069 publications from 1991 to 2022 were analyzed, retrieved from the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-E) within the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) of Clarivate Analytics. Institutions, authors, journals, references, and keywords were analyzed and visualized by using VOSviewer and CiteSpace. The R language and Microsoft Excel 365 were used for statistical analyses. The global literature on AAV vector and gene therapy exhibited consistent growth, with the United States leading in productivity, contributing 3,868 papers and obtaining the highest H-index. Noteworthy authors like Wilson JM, Samulski RJ, Hauswirth WW, and Mingozzi F were among the top 10 most productive and co-cited authors. The journal “Human Gene Therapy” published the most papers (n = 485) on AAV vector and gene therapy. Current research focuses on “gene editing,” “gene structure,” “CRISPR,” and “AAV gene therapy for specific hereditary diseases.” The application of AAV vector in gene therapy has shown continuous growth, fostering international cooperation among countries and institutions. The intersection of gene editing, gene structure, CRISPR, and AAV gene therapy for specific hereditary diseases and AAV vector represents a prominent and prioritized focus in contemporary gene therapy research. This study provides valuable insights into the trends and characteristics of AAV gene therapy research, facilitating further advancements in the field.

Date: 2024-05-21

Abstract:
Pediatric cancers represent a tragic but also promising area for gene therapy. Although conventional treatments have improved survival rates, there is still a need for targeted and less toxic interventions. This article critically analyzes recent advances in gene therapy for pediatric malignancies and discusses the challenges that remain. We explore the innovative vectors and delivery systems that have emerged, such as adeno-associated viruses and non-viral platforms, which show promise in addressing the unique pathophysiology of pediatric tumors. Specifically, we examine the field of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies and their adaptation for solid tumors, which historically have been more challenging to treat than hematologic malignancies. We also discuss the genetic and epigenetic complexities inherent to pediatric cancers, such as tumor heterogeneity and the dynamic tumor microenvironment, which pose significant hurdles for gene therapy. Ethical considerations specific to pediatric populations, including consent and long-term follow-up, are also analyzed. Additionally, we scrutinize the translation of research from preclinical models that often fail to mimic pediatric cancer biology to the regulatory landscapes that can either support or hinder innovation. In summary, this article provides an up-to-date overview of gene therapy in pediatric oncology, highlighting both the rapid scientific progress and the substantial obstacles that need to be addressed. Through this lens, we propose a roadmap for future research that prioritizes the safety, efficacy, and complex ethical considerations involved in treating pediatric patients. Our ultimate goal is to move from incremental advancements to transformative therapies.

Title: Update on Viral Gene Therapy Clinical Trials for Retinal Diseases
Authors: Shun-Yun Cheng, Claudio Punzo
Date: 2022-09-01

Abstract:
In 2001, the first large animal was successfully treated with a gene therapy that restored its vision. Lancelot, the Briard dog that was treated, suffered from a human childhood blindness called Leber's congenital amaurosis type 2. Sixteen years later, the gene therapy was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The success of this gene therapy in dogs led to a fast expansion of the ocular gene therapy field. By now every class of inherited retinal dystrophy has been treated in at least one animal model and many clinical trials have been initiated in humans. In this study, we review the status of viral gene therapies for the retina, with a focus on ongoing human clinical trials. It is likely that in the next decade we will see several new viral gene therapies approved.

Title: Antiviral immunity and nucleic acid sensing in haematopoietic stem cell gene engineering
Authors: Francesco Piras, Anna Kajaste-Rudnitski
Date: 2020-07-13

Abstract:
The low gene manipulation efficiency of human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) remains a major hurdle for sustainable and broad clinical application of innovative therapies for a wide range of disorders. Given that all current and emerging gene transfer and editing technologies are bound to expose HSPC to exogenous nucleic acids and most often also to viral vectors, we reason that host antiviral factors and nucleic acid sensors play a pivotal role in the efficacy of HSPC genetic manipulation. Here, we review recent progress in our understanding of vector–host interactions and innate immunity in HSPC upon gene engineering and discuss how dissecting this crosstalk can guide the development of more stealth and efficient gene therapy approaches in the future.

Authors: Bat-Erdene Jargalsaikhan, Masanaga Muto, Masatsugu Ema
Date: 2025-07-24

Abstract:
Over 35 years of history, the field of gene therapy has undergone much progress. The initial concept—the replacement of dysfunctional genes with correct ones—has advanced to the next stage and reached the level of precise genome editing. Dozens of gene therapy products based on viral and non-viral delivery platforms have been approved, marking the dawn of the gene therapy era. These viral vector strategies rely on adenoviruses, adeno-associated viruses, lentivirus-derived tools, and so on. From the middle of the gene therapy transition, despite the challenges and serious negative consequences, the lentiviral vector has emerged as a cornerstone and demonstrated benefits in fields ranging from basic science to gene therapy. Therefore, we outline the importance of lentiviral vectors in the gene therapy era by focusing on their roles in the clinical usage, derivation, and development of next-generation platforms, as well as their pseudotyping.

Authors: Rahul G. Ingle, Gehan M. Elossaily, Mohd Nazam Ansari, Shivani Makhijani
Date: 2025-06-17

Abstract:
Several severe disorders, such as inherited diseases (e.g. cystic fibrosis and beta thalassemia), genetic diseases (e.g. malignant tumors and diabetes), and infectious diseases (e.g. HIV) are pose significant challenges to human health. Over the past few decades, researchers have been working on gene therapies, and currently, terrible dreams have come true. To date, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved multiple gene therapies such as Kynamro for familial hypercholesterolaemia, Exondys51 for duchenne muscular dystrophy, Spinraza for spinal muscular atrophy, etc., rest for cancer, infectious diseases, and rare diseases. The authors have summarized recent advances in gene therapy, its background, molecular basis (e.g. viral and non-viral vectors), gene-editing techniques (e.g. CRISPR/Cas9, TALEN, ZFN), and its foremost applications in severe disorders, such as cancer, monogenic disorders (e.g. spinal muscular atrophy), polygenic disorders (e.g. autism), neurogenic disorders (e.g. Parkinson disease and Alzheimer’s disease), and infectious diseases (e.g. HIV). In addition, we explored the major challenges faced by gene therapies during targeted delivery, immunogenicity, efficacy, and safety. To date, most of the promising approaches, such as different vectors, target cell populations, and both in vivo and ex vivo have paved the foundation for applications of gene therapies. Additionally, advances in enhancing the immune system that would certainly lower the healthcare costs. This review highlights the translatory potential of gene therapy in revolutionizing the treatment landscape for severe disorders.

Title: In-Vivo Gene Therapy with Foamy Virus Vectors
Authors: Yogendra Singh Rajawat, Olivier Humbert, Hans-Peter Kiem
Date: 2019-11-23

Abstract:
Foamy viruses (FVs) are nonpathogenic retroviruses that infect various animals including bovines, felines, nonhuman primates (NHPs), and can be transmitted to humans through zoonotic infection. Due to their non-pathogenic nature, broad tissue tropism and relatively safe integration profile, FVs have been engineered as novel vectors (foamy virus vector, FVV) for stable gene transfer into different cells and tissues. FVVs have emerged as an alternative platform to contemporary viral vectors (e.g., adeno associated and lentiviral vectors) for experimental and therapeutic gene therapy of a variety of monogenetic diseases. Some of the important features of FVVs include the ability to efficiently transduce hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) from humans, NHPs, canines and rodents. We have successfully used FVV for proof of concept studies to demonstrate safety and efficacy following in-vivo delivery in large animal models. In this review, we will comprehensively discuss FVV based in-vivo gene therapy approaches established in the X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID-X1) canine model.

Title: Advances in Gene Therapy with Oncolytic Viruses and CAR-T Cells and Therapy-Related Groups
Authors: Yasunari Matsuzaka, Ryu Yashiro
Date: 2025-04-10

Abstract:
Cancer gene therapy is attracting considerable attention as a new treatment method for overcoming intractable cancers. CAR-T cell therapy has already achieved remarkable results, particularly for hematological tumors. Because CAR-T cells can increase within the body, they have the advantage of requiring only a single administration. In addition, CAR-T cell therapy targeting the CD19 antigen has been established for relapsed or refractory disease in young people with CD19-positive acute B-cell leukemia (B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia, B-ALL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). In addition to CAR-T cell therapy, oncolytic viruses represent a promising approach for cancer treatment, with some already in clinical use and others being researched for their potential benefits. These viruses infect and kill cancer cells, triggering an immune response that helps the body recognize and fight cancer. Oncolytic virus therapy is a form of immunotherapy that uses modified viruses to target and destroy tumor cells while potentially stimulating antitumor immune responses. These viruses have shown promising activity in clinical trials, with some approved for specific cancers like melanoma. Research is ongoing to improve their efficacy, expand their use to other cancer types, and overcome the logistical challenges associated with their delivery. Gene therapy can potentially treat diseases caused by recessive gene disorders like cystic fibrosis, hemophilia, muscular dystrophy, and sickle cell anemia, as well as acquired genetic diseases, such as cancer and viral infections like acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).

Title: Gene therapy for cardiovascular disease: advances in vector development, targeting, and delivery for clinical translation
Authors: Melvin Y. Rincon, Thierry VandenDriessche, Marinee K. Chuah
Date: 2015-10-01

Abstract:
Gene therapy is a promising modality for the treatment of inherited and acquired cardiovascular diseases. The identification of the molecular pathways involved in the pathophysiology of heart failure and other associated cardiac diseases led to encouraging preclinical gene therapy studies in small and large animal models. However, the initial clinical results yielded only modest or no improvement in clinical endpoints. The presence of neutralizing antibodies and cellular immune responses directed against the viral vector and/or the gene-modified cells, the insufficient gene expression levels, and the limited gene transduction efficiencies accounted for the overall limited clinical improvements. Nevertheless, further improvements of the gene delivery technology and a better understanding of the underlying biology fostered renewed interest in gene therapy for heart failure. In particular, improved vectors based on emerging cardiotropic serotypes of the adeno-associated viral vector (AAV) are particularly well suited to coax expression of therapeutic genes in the heart. This led to new clinical trials based on the delivery of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca 2+ -ATPase protein (SERCA2a). Though the first clinical results were encouraging, a recent Phase IIb trial did not confirm the beneficial clinical outcomes that were initially reported. New approaches based on S100A1 and adenylate cyclase 6 are also being considered for clinical applications. Emerging paradigms based on the use of miRNA regulation or CRISPR/Cas9-based genome engineering open new therapeutic perspectives for treating cardiovascular diseases by gene therapy. Nevertheless, the continuous improvement of cardiac gene delivery is needed to allow the use of safer and more effective vector doses, ultimately bringing gene therapy for heart failure one step closer to reality.

Abstract:
Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome is a rare, life-threatening, X-linked primary immunodeficiency characterised by microthrombocytopenia, infections, eczema, autoimmunity, and malignant disease. Lentiviral vector-mediated haemopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) gene therapy is a potentially curative treatment that represents an alternative to allogeneic HSPC transplantation. Here, we report safety and efficacy data from an interim analysis of patients with severe Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome who received lentiviral vector-derived gene therapy. We did a non-randomised, open-label, phase 1/2 clinical study in paediatric patients with severe Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, defined by either WAS gene mutation or absent Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) expression or a Zhu clinical score of 3 or higher. We included patients who had no HLA-identical sibling donor available or, for children younger than 5 years of age, no suitable 10/10 matched unrelated donor or 6/6 unrelated cord blood donor. After treatment with rituximab and a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen of busulfan and fludarabine, patients received one intravenous infusion of autologous CD34+ cells genetically modified with a lentiviral vector encoding for human WAS cDNA. The primary safety endpoints were safety of the conditioning regimen and safety of lentiviral gene transfer into HSPCs. The primary efficacy endpoints were overall survival, sustained engraftment of genetically corrected HSPCs, expression of vector-derived WASP, improved T-cell function, antigen-specific responses to vaccinations, and improved platelet count and mean platelet volume normalisation. This interim analysis was done when the first six patients treated had completed at least 3 years of follow-up. The planned analyses are presented for the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (number NCT01515462 ) and EudraCT (number 2009-017346-32). Between April 20, 2010, and Feb 26, 2015, nine patients (all male) were enrolled of whom one was excluded after screening; the age range of the eight treated children was 1·1–12·4 years. At the time of the interim analysis (data cutoff April 29, 2016), median follow-up was 3·6 years (range 0·5–5·6). Overall survival was 100%. Engraftment of genetically corrected HSPCs was successful and sustained in all patients. The fraction of WASP-positive lymphocytes increased from a median of 3·9% (range 1·8–35·6) before gene therapy to 66·7% (55·7–98·6) at 12 months after gene therapy, whereas WASP-positive platelets increased from 19·1% (range 4·1–31·0) to 76·6% (53·1–98·4). Improvement of immune function was shown by normalisation of in-vitro T-cell function and successful discontinuation of immunoglobulin supplementation in seven patients with follow-up longer than 1 year, followed by positive antigen-specific response to vaccination. Severe infections fell from 2·38 (95% CI 1·44–3·72) per patient-year of observation (PYO) in the year before gene therapy to 0·31 (0·04–1·11) per PYO in the second year after gene therapy and 0·17 (0·00–0·93) per PYO in the third year after gene therapy. Before gene therapy, platelet counts were lower than 20 × 10 9 per L in seven of eight patients. At the last follow-up visit, the platelet count had increased to 20–50 × 10 9 per L in one patient, 50–100 × 10 9 per L in five patients, and more than 100 × 10 9 per L in two patients, which resulted in independence from platelet transfusions and absence of severe bleeding events. 27 serious adverse events in six patients occurred after gene therapy, 23 (85%) of which were infectious (pyrexia [five events in three patients], device-related infections, including one case of sepsis [four events in three patients], and gastroenteritis, including one case due to rotavirus [three events in two patients]); these occurred mainly in the first 6 months of follow-up. No adverse reactions to the investigational drug product and no abnormal clonal proliferation or leukaemia were reported after gene therapy. Data from this study show that gene therapy provides a valuable treatment option for patients with severe Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, particularly for those who do not have a suitable HSPC donor available.

Title: Neurosurgical gene therapy for central nervous system diseases
Authors: Ruchit V. Patel, Pranav Nanda, R. Mark Richardson
Date: 2024-07

Abstract:
Viral vector mediated gene therapies for neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental conditions that require neurosurgical administration continue to expand. We systematically reviewed the National Institutes of Health (NIH) ClinicalTrials.gov database to identify all clinical trials studying in-vivo viral vector mediated gene therapies targeted to the CNS for neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases. We isolated studies which delivered therapies using neurosurgical approaches: intracisternal, intraventricular, and/or intraparenchymal. Clinical trials primarily registered in international countries were included if they were referenced by an NIH registered clinical trial. We performed a scoping review to identify the preclinical studies that supported each human clinical trial. Key preclinical and clinical data were aggregated to characterize vector capsid design, delivery methods, gene expression profile, and clinical benefit. A total of 64 clinical trials were identified in active, completed, terminated, and long-term follow-up stages. A range of CNS conditions across pediatric and adult populations are being studied with CNS targeted viral vector gene therapy, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, AADC deficiency, sphingolipidoses, mucopolysaccharidoses, neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses, spinal muscular atrophy, adrenoleukodystrophy, Canavan disease, frontotemporal dementia, Huntington's disease, Rett syndrome, Dravet syndrome, mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, and glutaric acidemia. Adeno-associated viral vectors (AAVs) were utilized by the majority of tested therapies, with vector serotypes, regulatory elements, delivery methods, and vector monitoring varying based on the disease being studied. Intraparenchymal delivery has evolved significantly, with MRI-guided convection-enhanced delivery established as a gold standard method for pioneering novel gene targets.

Abstract:
The development of biological methods over the past decade has stimulated great interest in the possibility to regenerate human tissues. Advances in stem cell research, gene therapy, and tissue engineering have accelerated the technology in tissue and organ regeneration. However, despite significant progress in this area, there are still several technical issues that must be addressed, especially in the clinical use of gene therapy. The aims of gene therapy include utilising cells to produce a suitable protein, silencing over-producing proteins, and genetically modifying and repairing cell functions that may affect disease conditions. While most current gene therapy clinical trials are based on cell- and viral-mediated approaches, non-viral gene transfection agents are emerging as potentially safe and effective in the treatment of a wide variety of genetic and acquired diseases. Gene therapy based on viral vectors may induce pathogenicity and immunogenicity. Therefore, significant efforts are being invested in non-viral vectors to enhance their efficiency to a level comparable to the viral vector. Non-viral technologies consist of plasmid-based expression systems containing a gene encoding, a therapeutic protein, and synthetic gene delivery systems. One possible approach to enhance non-viral vector ability or to be an alternative to viral vectors would be to use tissue engineering technology for regenerative medicine therapy. This review provides a critical view of gene therapy with a major focus on the development of regenerative medicine technologies to control the in vivo location and function of administered genes.

Date: 2023-06-30

Abstract:
Since long before the first approval of gene therapy for retinal disease, ocular gene therapy has captured the hopes of patients, clinicians, and scientists alike. Indeed, the retina provides a unique system for studying and treating ocular diseases, and it holds the distinction as the first tissue targeted by an approved gene therapy for inherited disorders in the United States. There are many methods for addressing genetic diseases in the eyes using a wide range of potential delivery systems and vectors. However, despite the immense progress over the last several decades, both old and new challenges remain, such as the long-term effects of treatments, immunogenicity, targeting, and manufacturing. This review provides a discussion of the history of ocular gene therapy, the various gene therapy approaches, methods to deliver a gene directly to ocular tissues (including both routes of administration and vectors), challenges to ocular gene therapy, the current clinical trial landscape, and future directions of the field.

Title: Retroviral gene therapy in Germany with a view on previous experience and future perspectives
Authors: Michael A. Morgan, Melanie Galla, Manuel Grez, Boris Fehse, Axel Schambach
Date: 2021-03-22

Abstract:
Gene therapy can be used to restore cell function in monogenic disorders or to endow cells with new capabilities, such as improved killing of cancer cells, expression of suicide genes for controlled elimination of cell populations, or protection against chemotherapy or viral infection. While gene therapies were originally most often used to treat monogenic diseases and to improve hematopoietic stem cell transplantation outcome, the advent of genetically modified immune cell therapies, such as chimeric antigen receptor modified T cells, has contributed to the increased numbers of patients treated with gene and cell therapies. The advancement of gene therapy with integrating retroviral vectors continues to depend upon world-wide efforts. As the topic of this special issue is “Spotlight on Germany,” the goal of this review is to provide an overview of contributions to this field made by German clinical and research institutions. Research groups in Germany made, and continue to make, important contributions to the development of gene therapy, including design of vectors and transduction protocols for improved cell modification, methods to assess gene therapy vector efficacy and safety (e.g., clonal imbalance, insertion sites), as well as in the design and conduction of clinical gene therapy trials.

Title: Viral and Non-Viral Systems to Deliver Gene Therapeutics to Clinical Targets
Authors: Maryam Taghdiri, Claudio Mussolino
Date: 2024-07-04

Abstract:
Clustered regularly interspersed short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) technology has revolutionized the field of gene therapy as it has enabled precise genome editing with unprecedented accuracy and efficiency, paving the way for clinical applications to treat otherwise incurable genetic disorders. Typically, precise genome editing requires the delivery of multiple components to the target cells that, depending on the editing platform used, may include messenger RNA (mRNA), protein complexes, and DNA fragments. For clinical purposes, these have to be efficiently delivered into transplantable cells, such as primary T lymphocytes or hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells that are typically sensitive to exogenous substances. This challenge has limited the broad applicability of precise gene therapy applications to those strategies for which efficient delivery methods are available. Electroporation-based methodologies have been generally applied for gene editing applications, but procedure-associated toxicity has represented a major burden. With the advent of novel and less disruptive methodologies to deliver genetic cargo to transplantable cells, it is now possible to safely and efficiently deliver multiple components for precise genome editing, thus expanding the applicability of these strategies. In this review, we describe the different delivery systems available for genome editing components, including viral and non-viral systems, highlighting their advantages, limitations, and recent clinical applications. Recent improvements to these delivery methods to achieve cell specificity represent a critical development that may enable in vivo targeting in the future and will certainly play a pivotal role in the gene therapy field.

Title: Nanomaterial-Based Anti-Angiogenic Gene Therapy for Retinal Neovascular Diseases: Mechanistic Insights and Preclinical Advances
Authors: Longhai Zeng, Yanhao Wei, Yanmei Qiu, Rentang Bi, Haokun Peng, Bo Hu, Ya’nan Li
Date: 2025-09-18

Abstract:
Retinal neovascular diseases (RNVs) are the leading cause of preventable vision loss worldwide, including diabetic retinopathy, age related macular degeneration, retinopathy of prematurity, and retinal vein occlusion. Anti-VEGF therapy remains central to current clinical management, while emerging molecular targets, including ANG-2, PDGF, Sema4D, integrins, and inflammatory mediators, are gaining therapeutic relevance. The current standard anti-VEGF intravitreal injection (administered every 4–8 weeks) regimen significantly increases the risk of complications such as endophthalmitis and elevated intraocular pressure, which has driven interest in one-time gene therapy approaches. However, traditional viral delivery systems for gene therapy are limited by limited drug loading and poor biocompatibility. This review systematically investigated nanomaterial mediated gene therapy options for anti-angiogenesis in RNVs, focusing on six distinct nanomaterial categories: metal nanoparticles, carbon/silicon nanostructures, lipid nanoparticles, polymers, dendrimers, and nanocomposites. The advantages and limitations of various nanomaterials in terms of gene-loading capacity, controlled release profiles, biocompatibility, and transfection efficiency in the preclinical application of anti-angiogenic gene therapy for RNV diseases were compared. It also provides unique insights into the future multi-target therapy of nanomaterials and hybrid nanomaterial delivery.

Abstract:
The p53 gene is one of the genes most closely associated with human tumors and has become a popular target for tumor drug design. Currently, p53 -based gene therapy techniques have been developed, but these therapies face challenges such as immaturity, high safety hazards, limited efficacy, and low patient acceptance. However, researchers are no less enthusiastic about the treatment because of its theoretical potential to treat cancer. In this paper, the advances in p53 -based gene therapy and related nucleic acid delivery technologies were reviewed and prospected in order to support further development in this field.

Title: Emerging Perspectives on Gene Therapy Delivery for Neurodegenerative and Neuromuscular Disorders
Authors: Cintia Gomez Limia, Megan Baird, Maura Schwartz, Smita Saxena, Kathrin Meyer, Nicolas Wein
Date: 2022-11-30

Abstract:
Neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs), such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s Disease (PD), are a group of heterogeneous diseases that mainly affect central nervous system (CNS) functions. A subset of NDDs exhibit CNS dysfunction and muscle degeneration, as observed in Gangliosidosis 1 (GM1) and late stages of PD. Neuromuscular disorders (NMDs) are a group of diseases in which patients show primary progressive muscle weaknesses, including Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), Pompe disease, and Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA). NDDs and NMDs typically have a genetic component, which affects the physiological functioning of critical cellular processes, leading to pathogenesis. Currently, there is no cure or efficient treatment for most of these diseases. More than 200 clinical trials have been completed or are currently underway in order to establish safety, tolerability, and efficacy of promising gene therapy approaches. Thus, gene therapy-based therapeutics, including viral or non-viral delivery, are very appealing for the treatment of NDDs and NMDs. In particular, adeno-associated viral vectors (AAV) are an attractive option for gene therapy for NDDs and NMDs. However, limitations have been identified after systemic delivery, including the suboptimal capacity of these therapies to traverse the blood–brain barrier (BBB), degradation of the particles during the delivery, high reactivity of the patient’s immune system during the treatment, and the potential need for redosing. To circumvent these limitations, several preclinical and clinical studies have suggested intrathecal (IT) delivery to target the CNS and peripheral organs via cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF administration can vastly improve the delivery of small molecules and drugs to the brain and spinal cord as compared to systemic delivery. Here, we review AAV biology and vector design elements, different therapeutic routes of administration, and highlight CSF delivery as an attractive route of administration. We discuss the different aspects of neuromuscular and neurodegenerative diseases, such as pathogenesis, the landscape of mutations, and the biological processes associated with the disease. We also describe the hallmarks of NDDs and NMDs as well as discuss current therapeutic approaches and clinical progress in viral and non-viral gene therapy and enzyme replacement strategies for those diseases.

Authors: Jote T. Bulcha, Yi Wang, Hong Ma, Phillip W. L. Tai, Guangping Gao
Date: 2021-02-08

Abstract:
Throughout its 40-year history, the field of gene therapy has been marked by many transitions. It has seen great strides in combating human disease, has given hope to patients and families with limited treatment options, but has also been subject to many setbacks. Treatment of patients with this class of investigational drugs has resulted in severe adverse effects and, even in rare cases, death. At the heart of this dichotomous field are the viral-based vectors, the delivery vehicles that have allowed researchers and clinicians to develop powerful drug platforms, and have radically changed the face of medicine. Within the past 5 years, the gene therapy field has seen a wave of drugs based on viral vectors that have gained regulatory approval that come in a variety of designs and purposes. These modalities range from vector-based cancer therapies, to treating monogenic diseases with life-altering outcomes. At present, the three key vector strategies are based on adenoviruses, adeno-associated viruses, and lentiviruses. They have led the way in preclinical and clinical successes in the past two decades. However, despite these successes, many challenges still limit these approaches from attaining their full potential. To review the viral vector-based gene therapy landscape, we focus on these three highly regarded vector platforms and describe mechanisms of action and their roles in treating human disease.

Abstract:
The etiology of many neurological diseases affecting the central nervous system (CNS) is unknown and still needs more effective and specific therapeutic approaches. Gene therapy has a promising future in treating neurodegenerative disorders by correcting the genetic defects or by therapeutic protein delivery and is now an attraction for neurologists to treat brain disorders, like Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spinal muscular atrophy, spinocerebellar ataxia, epilepsy, Huntington’s disease, stroke, and spinal cord injury. Gene therapy allows the transgene induction, with a unique expression in cells’ substrate. This article mainly focuses on the delivering modes of genetic materials in the CNS, which includes viral and non-viral vectors and their application in gene therapy. Despite the many clinical trials conducted so far, data have shown disappointing outcomes. The efforts done to improve outcomes, efficacy, and safety in the identification of targets in various neurological disorders are also discussed here. Adapting gene therapy as a new therapeutic approach for treating neurological disorders seems to be promising, with early detection and delivery of therapy before the neuron is lost, helping a lot the development of new therapeutic options to translate to the clinic.

Abstract:
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of central vision loss, progressively impairing the retina and affecting millions worldwide. By 2040, global cases of AMD are projected to reach 300 million, posing a significant public health challenge. While early AMD may only cause mild visual impairment, advanced stages, particularly neovascular (wet) and non-neovascular (dry) AMD, can lead to severe vision loss or legal blindness, substantially affecting daily life. The introduction of anti-angiogenic therapies has revolutionized wet AMD treatment, offering a high probability of preserving or improving vision. However, these therapies do not halt AMD progression, and no definitive treatments exist for dry AMD. The limitations of current therapies, such as frequent injections and treatment resistance, underscore the urgent need for novel strategies. Gene therapy, which has shown success in treating other hereditary retinal diseases, offers a promising long-term solution for AMD by targeting retinal cells to produce therapeutic proteins. This review explores the potential of gene therapy for AMD, examining recent clinical trials and future treatment directions.

Title: Recent Advances in Gene Therapy for Hemophilia

Date: 2025-09-10

Abstract:
Hemophilia, an X-linked monogenic disorder, arises from mutations in the F8 or F9 genes, which encode clotting factor VIII (FVIII) or clotting factor IX (FIX), respectively. As a prominent hereditary coagulation disorder, hemophilia is clinically manifested by spontaneous hemorrhagic episodes. Severe cases may progress to complications such as stroke and arthropathy, significantly compromising patients’ quality of life. Hemophilia has a monogenic nature, coupled with quantifiable therapeutic endpoints and predictable treatment outcomes. These characteristics render it an ideal candidate for gene therapy studies. Currently, Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved gene therapies utilize recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors to deliver functional transgene cassettes to hepatocytes. These therapies offer distinct advantages: a single intravenous administration achieves sustained FVIII and FIX activity levels, providing robust hemostatic control while markedly enhancing patients’ quality of life. However, several challenges remain, including immunogenicity, thrombotic risks, potential gene integration, and prohibitive costs. Future endeavors should prioritize expanding patient eligibility and integrating precision gene-editing technologies to mitigate these limitations. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of recent advances and emerging strategies in hemophilia gene therapy, with a particular focus on clinical translation and technological innovation. Ongoing research in this field remains pivotal to overcome existing barriers, enhance treatment accessibility, and ultimately realize curative potential for patients with hemophilia.

Title: Recombinant Adeno-Associated Virus Vectors for Gene Therapy of the Central Nervous System: Delivery Routes and Clinical Aspects
Authors: Żaneta Słyk, Natalia Stachowiak, Maciej Małecki
Date: 2024-07-09

Abstract:
The Central Nervous System (CNS) is vulnerable to a range of diseases, including neurodegenerative and oncological conditions, which present significant treatment challenges. The blood–brain barrier (BBB) restricts molecule penetration, complicating the achievement of therapeutic concentrations in the CNS following systemic administration. Gene therapy using recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vectors emerges as a promising strategy for treating CNS diseases, demonstrated by the registration of six gene therapy products in the past six years and 87 ongoing clinical trials. This review explores the implementation of rAAV vectors in CNS disease treatment, emphasizing AAV biology and vector engineering. Various administration methods—such as intravenous, intrathecal, and intraparenchymal routes—and experimental approaches like intranasal and intramuscular administration are evaluated, discussing their advantages and limitations in different CNS contexts. Additionally, the review underscores the importance of optimizing therapeutic efficacy through the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of rAAV vectors. A comprehensive analysis of clinical trials reveals successes and challenges, including barriers to commercialization. This review provides insights into therapeutic strategies using rAAV vectors in neurological diseases and identifies areas requiring further research, particularly in optimizing rAAV PK/PD.

Title: Current and Future Prospects for Gene Therapy for Rare Genetic Diseases Affecting the Brain and Spinal Cord
Authors: Thomas Leth Jensen, Casper René Gøtzsche, David P. D. Woldbye
Date: 2021-10-06

Abstract:
In recent years, gene therapy has been raising hopes toward viable treatment strategies for rare genetic diseases for which there has been almost exclusively supportive treatment. We here review this progress at the pre-clinical and clinical trial levels as well as market approvals within diseases that specifically affect the brain and spinal cord, including degenerative, developmental, lysosomal storage, and metabolic disorders. The field reached an unprecedented milestone when Zolgensma® (onasemnogene abeparvovec) was approved by the FDA and EMA for in vivo adeno-associated virus-mediated gene replacement therapy for spinal muscular atrophy. Shortly after EMA approved Libmeldy®, an ex vivo gene therapy with lentivirus vector-transduced autologous CD34-positive stem cells, for treatment of metachromatic leukodystrophy. These successes could be the first of many more new gene therapies in development that mostly target loss-of-function mutation diseases with gene replacement (e.g., Batten disease, mucopolysaccharidoses, gangliosidoses) or, less frequently, gain-of-toxic-function mutation diseases by gene therapeutic silencing of pathologic genes (e.g., amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's disease). In addition, the use of genome editing as a gene therapy is being explored for some diseases, but this has so far only reached clinical testing in the treatment of mucopolysaccharidoses. Based on the large number of planned, ongoing, and completed clinical trials for rare genetic central nervous system diseases, it can be expected that several novel gene therapies will be approved and become available within the near future. Essential for this to happen is the in depth characterization of short- and long-term effects, safety aspects, and pharmacodynamics of the applied gene therapy platforms.

Title: Correcting inborn errors of immunity: From viral mediated gene addition to gene editing
Authors: Maria Carmina Castiello, Samuele Ferrari, Anna Villa
Date: 2023-03

Abstract:
Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is an effective treatment to cure inborn errors of immunity. Remarkable progress has been achieved thanks to the development and optimization of effective combination of advanced conditioning regimens and use of immunoablative/suppressive agents preventing rejection as well as graft versus host disease. Despite these tremendous advances, autologous hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell therapy based on ex vivo gene addition exploiting integrating γ-retro- or lenti-viral vectors, has demonstrated to be an innovative and safe therapeutic strategy providing proof of correction without the complications of the allogeneic approach. The recent advent of targeted gene editing able to precisely correct genomic variants in an intended locus of the genome, by introducing deletions, insertions, nucleotide substitutions or introducing a corrective cassette, is emerging in the clinical setting, further extending the therapeutic armamentarium and offering a cure to inherited immune defects not approachable by conventional gene addition. In this review, we will analyze the current state-of-the art of conventional gene therapy and innovative protocols of genome editing in various primary immunodeficiencies, describing preclinical models and clinical data obtained from different trials, highlighting potential advantages and limits of gene correction.

Abstract:
The prospect of gene therapy for inherited and acquired respiratory disease has energized the research community since the 1980s, with cystic fibrosis, as a monogenic disorder, driving early efforts to develop effective strategies. The fact that there are still no approved gene therapy products for the lung, despite many early phase clinical trials, illustrates the scale of the challenge: in the 1990s, first generation non-viral and viral vector systems demonstrated proof-of-concept but low efficacy. Since then, there has been steady progress towards improved vectors with the capacity to overcome at least some of the formidable barriers presented by the lung. In addition, the inclusion of features such as codon optimisation and promoters providing long-term expression have improved the expression characteristics of therapeutic transgenes. Early approaches were based on gene addition, where a new DNA copy of a gene is introduced to complement a genetic mutation: however, the advent of RNA-based products that can directly express a therapeutic protein or manipulate gene expression, together with the expanding range of tools for gene editing, has stimulated the development of alternative approaches. This review discusses the range of vector systems being evaluated for lung delivery; the variety of cargoes they deliver, including DNA, antisense oligonucleotides, mRNA, siRNA and peptide nucleic acids; and exemplifies progress in selected respiratory disease indications.

Title: Gene therapy for chronic pain management
Authors: Yi-ze Li, Ru-Rong Ji
Date: 2024-10-15

Abstract:
Despite significant advances in identifying molecular targets for chronic pain over the past two decades, many remain difficult to target with traditional methods. Gene therapies such as antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), RNA interference (RNAi), CRISPR, and virus-based delivery systems have played crucial roles in discovering and validating new pain targets. While there has been a surge in gene therapy-based clinical trials, those focusing on pain as the primary outcome remain uncommon. This review examines various gene therapy strategies, including ASOs, small interfering RNA (siRNAs), optogenetics, chemogenetics, and CRISPR, and their delivery methods targeting primary sensory neurons and non-neuronal cells, including glia and chondrocytes. We also explore emerging gene therapy tools and highlight gene therapy’s clinical potential in pain management, including trials targeting pain-related diseases. Advances in single-cell analysis of sensory neurons and non-neuronal cells, along with the development of new delivery tools, are poised to accelerate the application of gene therapy in pain medicine.

Title: Developing AAV-delivered nonsense suppressor tRNAs for neurological disorders
Authors: Jiaming Wang, Guangping Gao, Dan Wang
Date: 2024-07

Abstract:
Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based gene therapy is a clinical stage therapeutic modality for neurological disorders. A common genetic defect in myriad monogenic neurological disorders is nonsense mutations that account for about 11% of all human pathogenic mutations. Stop codon readthrough by suppressor transfer RNA (sup-tRNA) has long been sought as a potential gene therapy approach to target nonsense mutations, but hindered by inefficient in vivo delivery. The rapid advances in AAV delivery technology have not only powered gene therapy development but also enabled in vivo preclinical assessment of a range of nucleic acid therapeutics, such as sup-tRNA. Compared with conventional AAV gene therapy that delivers a transgene to produce therapeutic proteins, AAV-delivered sup-tRNA has several advantages, such as small gene sizes and operating within the endogenous gene expression regulation, which are important considerations for treating some neurological disorders. This review will first examine sup-tRNA designs and delivery by AAV vectors. We will then analyze how AAV-delivered sup-tRNA can potentially address some neurological disorders that are challenging to conventional gene therapy, followed by discussing available mouse models of neurological diseases for in vivo preclinical testing. Potential challenges for AAV-delivered sup-tRNA to achieve therapeutic efficacy and safety will also be discussed.

Title: Adeno-Associated Virus Mediated Gene Therapy for Corneal Diseases
Authors: Prabhakar Bastola, Liujiang Song, Brian C. Gilger, Matthew L. Hirsch
Date: 2020-08-13

Abstract:
According to the World Health Organization, corneal diseases are the fourth leading cause of blindness worldwide accounting for 5.1% of all ocular deficiencies. Current therapies for corneal diseases, which include eye drops, oral medications, corrective surgeries, and corneal transplantation are largely inadequate, have undesirable side effects including blindness, and can require life-long applications. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) mediated gene therapy is an optimistic strategy that involves the delivery of genetic material to target human diseases through gene augmentation, gene deletion, and/or gene editing. With two therapies already approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration and 200 ongoing clinical trials, recombinant AAV (rAAV) has emerged as the in vivo viral vector-of-choice to deliver genetic material to target human diseases. Likewise, the relative ease of applications through targeted delivery and its compartmental nature makes the cornea an enticing tissue for AAV mediated gene therapy applications. This current review seeks to summarize the development of AAV gene therapy, highlight preclinical efficacy studies, and discuss potential applications and challenges of this technology for targeting corneal diseases.

Title: Gene therapy for genetic diseases: challenges and future directions
Authors: Beibei Qie, Jianghua Tuo, Feilong Chen, Haili Ding, Lei Lyu
Date: 2025-02-13

Abstract:
Genetic diseases constitute the majority of rare human diseases, resulting from abnormalities in an individual's genetic composition. Traditional treatments offer limited relief for these challenging conditions. In contrast, the rapid advancement of gene therapy presents significant advantages by directly addressing the underlying causes of genetic diseases, thereby providing the potential for precision treatment and the possibility of curing these disorders. This review aims to delineate the mechanisms and outcomes of current gene therapy approaches in clinical applications across various genetic diseases affecting different body systems. Additionally, genetic muscular disorders will be examined as a case study to investigate innovative strategies of novel therapeutic approaches, including gene replacement, gene suppression, gene supplementation, and gene editing, along with their associated advantages and limitations at both clinical and preclinical levels. Finally, this review emphasizes the existing challenges of gene therapy, such as vector packaging limitations, immunotoxicity, therapy specificity, and the subcellular localization and immunogenicity of therapeutic cargos, while discussing potential optimization directions for future research. Achieving delivery specificity, as well as long‐term effectiveness and safety, will be crucial for the future development of gene therapies targeting genetic diseases.

Title: Gene therapy for neurotransmitter‐related disorders
Authors: Wing Sum Chu, Joanne Ng, Simon N. Waddington, Manju A. Kurian
Date: 2024-01-14

Abstract:
Inborn errors of neurotransmitter (NT) metabolism are a group of rare, heterogenous diseases with predominant neurological features, such as movement disorders, autonomic dysfunction, and developmental delay. Clinical overlap with other disorders has led to delayed diagnosis and treatment, and some conditions are refractory to oral pharmacotherapies. Gene therapies have been developed and translated to clinics for paediatric inborn errors of metabolism, with 38 interventional clinical trials ongoing to date. Furthermore, efforts in restoring dopamine synthesis and neurotransmission through viral gene therapy have been developed for Parkinson's disease. Along with the recent European Medicines Agency (EMA) and Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) approval of an AAV2 gene supplementation therapy for AADC deficiency, promising efficacy and safety profiles can be achieved in this group of diseases. In this review, we present preclinical and clinical advances to address NT‐related diseases, and summarise potential challenges that require careful considerations for NT gene therapy studies.

Abstract:
Gene therapy holds promise as a life-changing option for individuals with genetic variants that give rise to disease. FDA-approved gene therapies for Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy, β-Thalassemia, hemophilia A/B, retinal dystrophy, and Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy have generated buzz around the ability to change the course of genetic syndromes. However, this excitement risks over-expansion into areas of genetic disease that may not fit the current state of gene therapy. While in situ (targeted to an area) and ex vivo (removal of cells, delivery, and administration of cells) approaches show promise, they have a limited target ability. Broader in vivo gene therapy trials have shown various continued challenges, including immune response, use of immune suppressants correlating to secondary infections, unknown outcomes of overexpression, and challenges in driving tissue-specific corrections. Viral delivery systems can be associated with adverse outcomes such as hepatotoxicity and lethality if uncontrolled. In some cases, these risks are far outweighed by the potentially lethal syndromes for which these systems are being developed. Therefore, it is critical to evaluate the field of genetic diseases to perform cost–benefit analyses for gene therapy. In this work, we present the current state while setting forth tools and resources to guide informed directions to avoid foreseeable issues in gene therapy that could prevent the field from continued success.

Title: Adeno-Associated Virus Vectors: Principles, Practices, and Prospects in Gene Therapy
Authors: Limor Zwi-Dantsis, Saira Mohamed, Giulia Massaro, Emad Moeendarbary
Date: 2025-02-09

Abstract:
Gene therapy offers promising potential as an efficacious and long-lasting therapeutic option for genetic conditions, by correcting defective mutations using engineered vectors to deliver genetic material to host cells. Among these vectors, adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) stand out for their efficiency, versatility, and safety, making them one of the leading platforms in gene therapy. The enormous potential of AAVs has been demonstrated through their use in over 225 clinical trials and the FDA’s approval of six AAV-based gene therapy products, positioning these vectors at the forefront of the field. This review highlights the evolution and current applications of AAVs in gene therapy, focusing on their clinical successes, ongoing developments, and the manufacturing processes required for the rapid commercial growth anticipated in the AAV therapy market. It also discusses the broader implications of these advancements for future therapeutic strategies targeting more complex and multi-systemic conditions and biological processes such as aging. Finally, we explore some of the major challenges currently confronting the field.

Title: Durability of transgene expression after rAAV gene therapy
Authors: Manish Muhuri, Daniel I. Levy, Martin Schulz, Douglas McCarty, Guangping Gao
Date: 2022-04-06

Abstract:
Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) gene therapy has the potential to transform the lives of patients with certain genetic disorders by increasing or restoring function to affected tissues. Following the initial establishment of transgene expression, it is unknown how long the therapeutic effect will last, although animal and emerging human data show that expression can be maintained for more than 10 years. The durability of therapeutic response is key to long-term treatment success, especially since immune responses to rAAV vectors may prevent re-dosing with the same therapy. This review explores the non-immunological and immunological processes that may limit or improve durability and the strategies that can be used to increase the duration of the therapeutic effect.

Authors: Jiang-Hui Wang, Dominic J. Gessler, Wei Zhan, Thomas L. Gallagher, Guangping Gao
Date: 2024-04-03

Abstract:
Adeno-associated virus (AAV) has emerged as a pivotal delivery tool in clinical gene therapy owing to its minimal pathogenicity and ability to establish long-term gene expression in different tissues. Recombinant AAV (rAAV) has been engineered for enhanced specificity and developed as a tool for treating various diseases. However, as rAAV is being more widely used as a therapy, the increased demand has created challenges for the existing manufacturing methods. Seven rAAV-based gene therapy products have received regulatory approval, but there continue to be concerns about safely using high-dose viral therapies in humans, including immune responses and adverse effects such as genotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, thrombotic microangiopathy, and neurotoxicity. In this review, we explore AAV biology with an emphasis on current vector engineering strategies and manufacturing technologies. We discuss how rAAVs are being employed in ongoing clinical trials for ocular, neurological, metabolic, hematological, neuromuscular, and cardiovascular diseases as well as cancers. We outline immune responses triggered by rAAV, address associated side effects, and discuss strategies to mitigate these reactions. We hope that discussing recent advancements and current challenges in the field will be a helpful guide for researchers and clinicians navigating the ever-evolving landscape of rAAV-based gene therapy.

Title: Oligodendrocytes, the Forgotten Target of Gene Therapy
Authors: Yasemin Ozgür-Gunes, Catherine Le Stunff, Pierre Bougnères
Date: 2024-11-28

Abstract:
If the billions of oligodendrocytes (OLs) populating the central nervous system (CNS) of patients could express their feelings, they would undoubtedly tell gene therapists about their frustration with the other neural cell populations, neurons, microglia, or astrocytes, which have been the favorite targets of gene transfer experiments. This review questions why OLs have been left out of most gene therapy attempts. The first explanation is that the pathogenic role of OLs is still discussed in most CNS diseases. Another reason is that the so-called ubiquitous CAG, CBA, CBh, or CMV promoters—widely used in gene therapy studies—are unable or poorly able to activate the transcription of episomal transgene copies brought by adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors in OLs. Accordingly, transgene expression in OLs has either not been found or not been evaluated in most gene therapy studies in rodents or non-human primates. The aims of the current review are to give OLs their rightful place among the neural cells that future gene therapy could target and to encourage researchers to test the effect of OL transduction in various CNS diseases.

Authors: Motahareh Arjomandnejad, Ishani Dasgupta, Terence R. Flotte, Allison M. Keeler
Date: 2023-03-02

Abstract:
Recombinant adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) have emerged as promising gene delivery vehicles resulting in three US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and one European Medicines Agency (EMA)-approved AAV-based gene therapies. Despite being a leading platform for therapeutic gene transfer in several clinical trials, host immune responses against the AAV vector and transgene have hampered their widespread application. Multiple factors, including vector design, dose, and route of administration, contribute to the overall immunogenicity of AAVs. The immune responses against the AAV capsid and transgene involve an initial innate sensing. The innate immune response subsequently triggers an adaptive immune response to elicit a robust and specific response against the AAV vector. AAV gene therapy clinical trials and preclinical studies provide important information about the immune-mediated toxicities associated with AAV, yet studies suggest preclinical models fail to precisely predict the outcome of gene delivery in humans. This review discusses the contribution of the innate and adaptive immune response against AAVs, highlighting the challenges and potential strategies to mitigate these responses, thereby enhancing the therapeutic potential of AAV gene therapy.

Abstract:
The human genetic code encrypted in thousands of genes holds the secret for synthesis of proteins that drive all biological processes necessary for normal life and death. Though the genetic ciphering remains unchanged through generations, some genes get disrupted, deleted and or mutated, manifesting diseases, and or disorders. Current treatment options—chemotherapy, protein therapy, radiotherapy, and surgery available for no more than 500 diseases—neither cure nor prevent genetic errors but often cause many side effects. However, gene therapy, colloquially called “living drug,” provides a one-time treatment option by rewriting or fixing errors in the natural genetic ciphering. Since gene therapy is predominantly a viral vector-based medicine, it has met with a fair bit of skepticism from both the science fraternity and patients. Now, thanks to advancements in gene editing and recombinant viral vector development, the interest of clinicians and pharmaceutical industries has been rekindled. With the advent of more than 12 different gene therapy drugs for curing cancer, blindness, immune, and neuronal disorders, this emerging experimental medicine has yet again come in the limelight. The present review article delves into the popular viral vectors used in gene therapy, advances, challenges, and perspectives.

Title: Predicting preferential DNA vector insertion sites: implications for functional genomics and gene therapy
Authors: Christopher S Hackett, Aron M Geurts, Perry B Hackett
Date: 2007

Abstract:
Viral and transposon vectors have been employed in gene therapy as well as functional genomics studies. However, the goals of gene therapy and functional genomics are entirely different; gene therapists hope to avoid altering endogenous gene expression (especially the activation of oncogenes), whereas geneticists do want to alter expression of chromosomal genes. The odds of either outcome depend on a vector's preference to integrate into genes or control regions, and these preferences vary between vectors. Here we discuss the relative strengths of DNA vectors over viral vectors, and review methods to overcome barriers to delivery inherent to DNA vectors. We also review the tendencies of several classes of retroviral and transposon vectors to target DNA sequences, genes, and genetic elements with respect to the balance between insertion preferences and oncogenic selection. Theoretically, knowing the variables that affect integration for various vectors will allow researchers to choose the vector with the most utility for their specific purposes. The three principle benefits from elucidating factors that affect preferences in integration are as follows: in gene therapy, it allows assessment of the overall risks for activating an oncogene or inactivating a tumor suppressor gene that could lead to severe adverse effects years after treatment; in genomic studies, it allows one to discern random from selected integration events; and in gene therapy as well as functional genomics, it facilitates design of vectors that are better targeted to specific sequences, which would be a significant advance in the art of transgenesis.

Abstract:
Gene therapy has recently become a reality in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Strategies to modulate gene expression using antisense oligonucleotides or small interfering RNA are proving to be safe and effective in the clinic. Adeno‐associated viral vector‐based gene delivery and CRISPR‐Cas9‐based genome editing have emerged as efficient strategies for gene delivery and repair in humans. Overall, gene therapy holds the promise not only of expanding current treatment options, but also of intervening in previously untackled causal disease mechanisms with little side effects. This scientific statement provides a comprehensive overview of the various modalities of gene therapy used to treat heart failure and some of its risk factors, and their application in the clinical setting. It discusses specifically the possibilities of gene therapy for hereditary heart diseases and (non)‐genetic heart failure. Furthermore, it addresses safety and clinical trial design issues and challenges for future regulatory strategies.

Title: Gene therapy for monogenic liver diseases: clinical successes, current challenges and future prospects
Authors: Julien Baruteau, Simon N. Waddington, Ian E. Alexander, Paul Gissen
Date: 2017-05-31

Abstract:
Over the last decade, pioneering liver-directed gene therapy trials for haemophilia B have achieved sustained clinical improvement after a single systemic injection of adeno-associated virus (AAV) derived vectors encoding the human factor IX cDNA. These trials demonstrate the potential of AAV technology to provide long-lasting clinical benefit in the treatment of monogenic liver disorders. Indeed, with more than ten ongoing or planned clinical trials for haemophilia A and B and dozens of trials planned for other inherited genetic/metabolic liver diseases, clinical translation is expanding rapidly. Gene therapy is likely to become an option for routine care of a subset of severe inherited genetic/metabolic liver diseases in the relatively near term. In this review, we aim to summarise the milestones in the development of gene therapy, present the different vector tools and their clinical applications for liver-directed gene therapy. AAV-derived vectors are emerging as the leading candidates for clinical translation of gene delivery to the liver. Therefore, we focus on clinical applications of AAV vectors in providing the most recent update on clinical outcomes of completed and ongoing gene therapy trials and comment on the current challenges that the field is facing for large-scale clinical translation. There is clearly an urgent need for more efficient therapies in many severe monogenic liver disorders, which will require careful risk-benefit analysis for each indication, especially in paediatrics.

Abstract:
Disruptions in normal development and the emergence of health conditions often result from the malfunction of vital genes in the human body. Decades of scientific research have focused on techniques to modify or substitute defective genes with healthy alternatives, marking a new era in disease treatment, prevention and cure. Recent strides in science and technology have reshaped our understanding of disorders, medication development and treatment recommendations, with human gene and cell therapy at the forefront of this transformative shift. Its primary objective is the modification of genes or adjustment of cell behaviour for therapeutic purposes. In this review, we focus on the latest advances in gene and cell therapy for treating human genetic diseases, with a particular emphasis on FDA and EMA‐approved therapies and the evolving landscape of genome editing. We examine the current state of innovative gene editing technologies, particularly the CRISPR‐Cas systems. As we explore the progress, ethical considerations and prospects of these innovations, we gain insight into their potential to revolutionize the treatment of genetic diseases, along with a discussion of the challenges associated with their regulatory pathways. This review traces the origins and evolution of these therapies, from conceptual ideas to practical clinical applications, marking a significant milestone in the field of medical science.

Many eye diseases, including retinitis pigmentosa and macular degeneration, have historically been rather difficult to treat and usually cause permanent vision loss. However, thanks to advances in gene therapy, many disorders can now be effectively targeted and genetically changed, providing a safer, more direct, maybe even curative approach. By introducing, altering, or repairing specific genes inside the eye, gene therapy seeks to fix the defective genes causing these disorders, thereby improving general eye health and visual ability. Voretigene neparvovec is one FDA- and EMA-approved treatment for RPE65 mutations. Retinitis pigmentosa, age-related macular degeneration, X-linked retinoschisis, choroideremia, and Stargardt disease are among the several eye disorders still under clinical trials, and experimental treatment is in progress. As research on gene therapy develops, it opens the path for groundbreaking treatments that could fundamentally change the ophthalmic care scene.

Abstract:
Cardiomyopathy is a group of disease characterized by structural and functional damage to the myocardium. The etiologies of cardiomyopathies are diverse, spanning from genetic mutations impacting fundamental myocardial functions to systemic disorders that result in widespread cardiac damage. Many specific gene mutations cause primary cardiomyopathy. Environmental factors and metabolic disorders may also lead to the occurrence of cardiomyopathy. This review provides an in‐depth analysis of the current understanding of the pathogenesis of various cardiomyopathies, highlighting the molecular and cellular mechanisms that contribute to their development and progression. The current therapeutic interventions for cardiomyopathies range from pharmacological interventions to mechanical support and heart transplantation. Gene therapy and cell therapy, propelled by ongoing advancements in overarching strategies and methodologies, has also emerged as a pivotal clinical intervention for a variety of diseases. The increasing number of causal gene of cardiomyopathies have been identified in recent studies. Therefore, gene therapy targeting causal genes holds promise in offering therapeutic advantages to individuals diagnosed with cardiomyopathies. Acting as a more precise approach to gene therapy, they are gradually emerging as a substitute for traditional gene therapy. This article reviews pathogenesis and therapeutic interventions for different cardiomyopathies.

Title: An Overview: Genetic Tumor Markers for Early Detection and Current Gene Therapy Strategies
Authors: Reeshan ul Quraish, Tetsuyuki Hirahata, Afraz ul Quraish, Shahan ul Quraish
Date: 2023-02-01

Abstract:
Genomic instability is considered a fundamental factor involved in any neoplastic disease. Consequently, the genetically unstable cells contribute to intratumoral genetic heterogeneity and phenotypic diversity of cancer. These genetic alterations can be detected by several diagnostic techniques of molecular biology and the detection of alteration in genomic integrity may serve as reliable genetic molecular markers for the early detection of cancer or cancer-related abnormal changes in the body cells. These genetic molecular markers can detect cancer earlier than any other method of cancer diagnosis, once a tumor is diagnosed, then replacement or therapeutic manipulation of these cancer-related abnormal genetic changes can be possible, which leads toward effective and target-specific cancer treatment and in many cases, personalized treatment of cancer could be performed without the adverse effects of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. In this review, we describe how these genetic molecular markers can be detected and the possible ways for the application of this gene diagnosis for gene therapy that can attack cancerous cells, directly or indirectly, which lead to overall improved management and quality of life for a cancer patient.

Title: Recent Advances in Gene Therapy for Hemophilia: Projecting the Perspectives
Authors: Nikita Chernyi, Darina Gavrilova, Mane Saruhanyan, Ezekiel S. Oloruntimehin, Alexander Karabelsky, Evgeny Bezsonov, Alexander Malogolovkin
Date: 2024-07-15

Abstract:
One of the well-known X-linked genetic disorders is hemophilia, which could be hemophilia A as a result of a mutation in the F8 (factor VIII) gene or hemophilia B as a result of a mutation in the F9 (factor IX) gene, leading to insufficient levels of the proteins essential for blood coagulation cascade. In patients with severe hemophilia, factor VIII or factor IX activities in the blood plasma are considerably low, estimated to be less than 1%. This is responsible for spontaneous or post-traumatic bleeding episodes, or both, leading to disease complications and death. Current treatment of hemophilia relies on the prevention of bleeding, which consists of expensive lifelong replacement infusion therapy of blood plasma clotting factors, their recombinant versions, or therapy with recombinant monoclonal antibodies. Recently emerged gene therapy approaches may be a potential game changer that could reshape the therapeutic outcomes of hemophilia A or B using a one-off vector in vivo delivery and aim to achieve long-term endogenous expression of factor VIII or IX. This review examines both traditional approaches to the treatment of hemophilia and modern methods, primarily focusing on gene therapy, to update knowledge in this area. Recent technological advances and gene therapeutics in the pipeline are critically reviewed and summarized. We consider gene therapy to be the most promising method as it may overcome the problems associated with more traditional treatments, such as the need for constant and expensive infusions and the presence of an immune response to the antibody drugs used to treat hemophilia.

Title: Enhancing precision in cancer treatment: the role of gene therapy and immune modulation in oncology
Authors: Emile Youssef, Brandon Fletcher, Dannelle Palmer
Date: 2025-01-13

Abstract:
Gene therapy has long been a cornerstone in the treatment of rare diseases and genetic disorders, offering targeted solutions to conditions once considered untreatable. As the field advances, its transformative potential is now expanding into oncology, where personalized therapies address the genetic and immune-related complexities of cancer. This review highlights innovative therapeutic strategies, including gene replacement, gene silencing, oncolytic virotherapy, CAR-T cell therapy, and CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing, with a focus on their application in both hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. CRISPR-Cas9, a revolutionary tool in precision medicine, enables precise editing of cancer-driving mutations, enhancing immune responses and disrupting tumor growth mechanisms. Additionally, emerging approaches target ferroptosis—a regulated, iron-dependent form of cell death—offering new possibilities for selectively inducing tumor cell death in resistant cancers. Despite significant breakthroughs, challenges such as tumor heterogeneity, immune evasion, and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) remain. To overcome these barriers, novel approaches like dual-targeting, armored CAR-T cells, and combination therapies with immune checkpoint inhibitors and ferroptosis inducers are being explored. Additionally, the rise of allogeneic “off-the-shelf” CAR-T therapies offers scalable and more accessible treatment options. The regulatory landscape is evolving to accommodate these advancements, with frameworks like RMAT (Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy) in the U.S. and ATMP (Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products) in Europe fast-tracking the approval of gene therapies. However, ethical considerations surrounding CRISPR-based gene editing—such as off-target effects, germline editing, and ensuring equitable access—remain at the forefront, requiring ongoing ethical oversight. Advances in non-viral delivery systems, such as lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) and exosomes, are improving the safety and efficacy of gene therapies. By integrating these innovations with combination therapies and addressing regulatory and ethical concerns, gene therapy is poised to revolutionize cancer treatment, providing durable, effective, and personalized solutions for both hematologic and solid tumors.

Date: 2025

Abstract:
Genome editing has recently evolved from a theoretical concept to a powerful and versatile set of tools. The discovery and implementation of CRISPR-Cas9 technology have propelled the field further into a new era. This RNA-guided system allows for specific modification of target genes, offering high accuracy and efficiency. Encouraging results are being announced in clinical trials employed in conditions like sickle cell disease (SCD) and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassaemia (TDT). The path finally led the way to the recent FDA approval of the first gene therapy drug utilising the CRISPR/Cas9 system to edit autologous CD34+ haematopoietic stem cells in SCD patients (Casgevy). Ongoing research explores the potential of CRISPR technology for cancer therapies, HIV treatment and other complex diseases. Despite its remarkable potential, CRISPR technology faces challenges such as off-target effects, suboptimal delivery systems, long-term safety concerns, scalability, ethical dilemmas and potential repercussions of genetic alterations, particularly in the case of germline editing. Here, we examine the transformative role of CRISPR technologies, including base editing and prime editing approaches, in modifying the genetic and epigenetic codes in the human genome and provide a comprehensive focus, particularly on relevant clinical applications, to unlock the full potential and challenges of gene editing.

Title: Gene Therapy: An Historical Overview for Familial Hearing Loss
Authors: O’neil W. Guthrie
Date: 2025-02-10

Abstract:
Gene therapy is a promising molecular approach for the management of familial hearing loss. This type of molecular therapy is the physical manifestation of genetic determinism—the notion that individual genes cause individual phenotypes. The current composition weaves through various branches of the biomedical sciences to uncover the molecular biologic premise for genetic determinism and the impetus behind gene therapy. Consequently, it is revealed that the underlying molecular biologic premise was scaffolded on successful observations from simple biologic assays that were devoid of the complexities of human disease biology. Furthermore, modern successful gene therapies are largely driven by commercial and academic incentives at the cost of scientific rigor. This poses several perverse challenges for patients, clinicians and the public at large. Issues concerning safety, efficacy, and ethics are far from resolved despite regulatory agency approvals, the media’s bias for gene therapy and the many lucrative investor positions. Lastly, the therapeutic claims regarding gene therapy are the most ambitious claims made within the hearing sciences. Therefore, scientists, clinicians, and patients must be equipped with the tools needed to appropriately consume and appraise such claims. These and other issues are also directly addressed, with the aim of providing a realistic sense of whether current human gene therapies are ready to be positioned within our routine clinical armamentarium against hearing loss.

Title: Recombinant Adeno-Associated Viral Vectors (rAAV)-Vector Elements in Ocular Gene Therapy Clinical Trials and Transgene Expression and Bioactivity Assays
Authors: Thilo M. Buck, Jan Wijnholds
Date: 2020-06-12

Abstract:
Inherited retinal dystrophies and optic neuropathies cause chronic disabling loss of visual function. The development of recombinant adeno-associated viral vectors (rAAV) gene therapies in all disease fields have been promising, but the translation to the clinic has been slow. The safety and efficacy profiles of rAAV are linked to the dose of applied vectors. DNA changes in the rAAV gene cassette affect potency, the expression pattern (cell-specificity), and the production yield. Here, we present a library of rAAV vectors and elements that provide a workflow to design novel vectors. We first performed a meta-analysis on recombinant rAAV elements in clinical trials (2007–2020) for ocular gene therapies. We analyzed 33 unique rAAV gene cassettes used in 57 ocular clinical trials. The rAAV gene therapy vectors used six unique capsid variants, 16 different promoters, and six unique polyadenylation sequences. Further, we compiled a list of promoters, enhancers, and other sequences used in current rAAV gene cassettes in preclinical studies. Then, we give an update on pro-viral plasmid backbones used to produce the gene therapy vectors, inverted terminal repeats, production yield, and rAAV safety considerations. Finally, we assess rAAV transgene and bioactivity assays applied to cells or organoids in vitro, explants ex vivo, and clinical studies.

Authors: Laura Garcia-Perez, Anita Ordas, Kirsten Canté-Barrett, Pauline Meij, Karin Pike-Overzet, Arjan Lankester, Frank J. T. Staal
Date: 2020-06-13

Abstract:
Recent clinical trials using patient’s own corrected hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), such as for primary immunodeficiencies (Adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency, X-linked Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID), X-linked chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), Wiskott–Aldrich Syndrome (WAS)), have yielded promising results in the clinic; endorsing gene therapy to become standard therapy for a number of diseases. However, the journey to achieve such a successful therapy is not easy, and several challenges have to be overcome. In this review, we will address several different challenges in the development of gene therapy for immune deficiencies using our own experience with Recombinase-activating gene 1 (RAG1) SCID as an example. We will discuss product development (targeting of the therapeutic cells and choice of a suitable vector and delivery method), the proof-of-concept (in vitro and in vivo efficacy, toxicology, and safety), and the final release steps to the clinic (scaling up, good manufacturing practice (GMP) procedures/protocols and regulatory hurdles).

Title:  In utero therapy for spinal muscular atrophy: closer to clinical translation
Authors: Eduardo F Tizzano, Georg Lindner, Ellie Chilcott, Richard S Finkel, Rafael J Yáñez-Muñoz
Date: 2025-09

Abstract:
5q-Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) has been a trailblazer in the development of advanced therapies for inherited diseases. SMA is an autosomal recessive disorder affecting mainly motor neurons in the anterior horn of the spinal cord and brainstem motor nucle but currently considered a systemic disease. Advances in understanding the genetics of SMA led to the development of disease-modifying therapies, either transferring a healthy version of SMN1, the causative gene absent or altered in SMA, or modulating SMN2, a highly homologous but less functional version of SMN1, present in all patients. After successful clinical trials, these approaches have resulted in three marketed therapies. Severe SMA, ‘type I’, is the most common type and is considered both a developmental arrest and neurodegenerative disorder. As pathology starts during fetal life in type I patients, a cure is unlikely even when treatment is started shortly after birth in the pre- or mildly symptomatic state. In utero fetal therapy offers the opportunity to mitigate further or possibly prevent manifestations of the disease. This review discusses clinical and developmental aspects of SMA, the advanced therapies approved (gene therapy, antisense oligonucleotide and small molecule compounds), and the rationale, options and challenges, including ethical and safety issues, to initiate in utero therapy. Looking beyond sporadic case reports of prenatal intervention, clinical trials of in utero SMA therapy can be envisaged and should be carefully designed and evaluated to move closer to clinical translation.

Title: Immune Reconstitution After Gene Therapy Approaches in Patients With X-Linked Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Disease
Authors: Elena Blanco, Natalia Izotova, Claire Booth, Adrian James Thrasher
Date: 2020-11-27

Abstract:
X-linked severe immunodeficiency disease (SCID-X1) is an inherited, rare, and life-threating disease. The genetic origin is a defect in the interleukin 2 receptor γ chain ( IL2RG ) gene and patients are classically characterized by absence of T and NK cells, as well as presence of partially-functional B cells. Without any treatment the disease is usually lethal during the first year of life. The treatment of choice for these patients is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, with an excellent survival rate (>90%) if an HLA-matched sibling donor is available. However, when alternative donors are used, the success and survival rates are often lower. Gene therapy has been developed as an alternative treatment initially using γ-retroviral vectors to correct the defective γ chain in the absence of pre-conditioning treatment. The results were highly promising in SCID-X1 infants, showing long-term T-cell recovery and clinical benefit, although NK and B cell recovery was less robust. However, some infants developed T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia after the gene therapy, due to vector-mediated insertional mutagenesis. Consequently, considerable efforts have been made to develop safer vectors. The most recent clinical trials using lentiviral vectors together with a low-dose pre-conditioning regimen have demonstrated excellent sustained T cell recovery, but also B and NK cells, in both children and adults. This review provides an overview about the different gene therapy approaches used over the last 20 years to treat SCID-X1 patients, particularly focusing on lymphoid immune reconstitution, as well as the developments that have improved the process and outcomes.

Authors: Suyash Prasad, David P. Dimmock, Benjamin Greenberg, Jagdeep S. Walia, Chanchal Sadhu, Fatemeh Tavakkoli, Gerald S. Lipshutz
Date: 2022-12-01

Abstract:
Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) are being increasingly used as gene therapy vectors in clinical studies especially targeting central nervous system (CNS) disorders. Correspondingly, host immune responses to the AAV capsid or the transgene-encoded protein have been observed in various clinical and preclinical studies. Such immune responses may adversely impact patients' health, prevent viral transduction, prevent repeated dosing strategies, eliminate transduced cells, and pose a significant barrier to the potential effectiveness of AAV gene therapy. Consequently, multiple immunomodulatory strategies have been used in attempts to limit immune-mediated responses to the vector, enable readministration of AAV gene therapy, prevent end-organ toxicity, and increase the duration of transgene-encoded protein expression. Herein we review the innate and adaptive immune responses that may occur during CNS-targeted AAV gene therapy as well as host- and treatment-specific factors that could impact the immune response. We also summarize the available preclinical and clinical data on immune responses specifically to CNS-targeted AAV gene therapy and discuss potential strategies for incorporating prophylactic immunosuppression regimens to circumvent adverse immune responses.

Title: Gene therapy for cystic fibrosis: an example for lung gene therapy
Authors: U Griesenbach, D M Geddes, E W F W Alton
Date: 2004-09-29

Abstract:
Gene therapy is currently being evaluated for a wide range of acute and chronic lung diseases. The requirement of gene transfer into the individual cell types of the complex lung structure will very much depend on the target disease. Over the last decade, the gene therapy community has recognized that there is not even one vector that is good for all applications, but that the gene transfer agent has to be carefully chosen. Gene therapy is particularly attractive for diseases that currently do not have satisfactory treatment options and probably easier for monogenic disorders than for complex diseases. Cystic fibrosis (CF) fulfills these criteria and is therefore a good candidate for gene therapy-based treatment. This review will focus on CF as an example for lung gene therapy and discuss the progress made in this field over the last couple of years.

Abstract:
Since the cloning of the cystic fibrosis gene (CFTR) in 1989, 18 clinical trials have been carried out, including five in the 2 years reviewed here. Most trials demonstrated proof-of-principle for gene transfer to the airway. However, gene transfer efficiency with each of the three gene transfer agents (adenovirus (Ad), adeno-associated virus 2 (AAV2) and cationic liposomes) was low, and most likely insufficient to achieve clinical benefit. Here, we will review the clinical and pre-clinical progress for the last 2 years (2000–2001) and briefly speculate on future prospects for the next 2 in CF gene therapy.

Abstract:
In utero gene therapy (IUGT) to the fetal hematopoietic compartment could be used to treat congenital blood disorders such as β-thalassemia. A humanised mouse model of β-thalassemia was used, in which heterozygous animals are anaemic with splenomegaly and extramedullary hematopoiesis. Intrahepatic in utero injections of a β globin-expressing lentiviral vector (GLOBE), were performed in fetuses at E13.5 of gestation. We analysed animals at 12 and 32 weeks of age, for vector copy number in bone marrow, peripheral blood liver and spleen and we performed integration site analysis. Compared to noninjected heterozygous animals IUGT normalised blood haemoglobin levels and spleen weight. Integration site analysis showed polyclonality. The left ventricular ejection fraction measured using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in treated heterozygous animals was similar to that of normal non-β-thalassemic mice but significantly higher than untreated heterozygous thalassemia mice suggesting that IUGT ameliorated poor cardiac function. GLOBE LV-mediated IUGT normalised the haematological and anatomical phenotype in a heterozygous humanised model of β-thalassemia.

Abstract:
Gene expression during cell development and differentiation is orchestrated by distal regulatory elements that precisely modulate cell selective gene activity. Gene therapy vectors leverage these elements for precise spatiotemporal transgene expression. Here, we develop a one-shot approach to screen candidate regulatory sequences from large-scale epigenomics data for programmable transgene expression within gene therapy viral vectors. We assess a library of 15,000 short sequences derived from developmentally active elements during erythropoiesis using a clinically relevant reporter vector. These elements display a gradient of transcriptional enhancer activity in erythroid cells, with high cell type restriction and developmental stage specificity. Finally, replacing the canonical β-globin μLCR with a compact enhancer in a β-thalassemia lentiviral vector successfully corrects the thalassemic phenotype in patient-derived hematopoietic and stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), while increasing viral titers and cell transducibility. Our approach provides further insights into enhancer biology with wider implications for human gene therapy.

Title: Advancements and future prospects of adeno-associated virus-mediated gene therapy for sensorineural hearing loss
Authors: Linke Li, Tian Shen, Shixi Liu, Jieyu Qi, Yu Zhao
Date: 2024-01-24

Abstract:
Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), a highly prevalent sensory impairment, results from a multifaceted interaction of genetic and environmental factors. As we continually gain insights into the molecular basis of auditory development and the growing compendium of deafness genes identified, research on gene therapy for SNHL has significantly deepened. Adeno-associated virus (AAV), considered a relatively secure vector for gene therapy in clinical trials, can deliver various transgenes based on gene therapy strategies such as gene replacement, gene silencing, gene editing, or gene addition to alleviate diverse types of SNHL. This review delved into the preclinical advances in AAV-based gene therapy for SNHL, spanning hereditary and acquired types. Particular focus is placed on the dual-AAV construction method and its application, the vector delivery route of mouse inner ear models (local, systemic, fetal, and cerebrospinal fluid administration), and the significant considerations in transforming from AAV-based animal model inner ear gene therapy to clinical implementation.

Title: Advances in the Development and the Applications of Nonviral, Episomal Vectors for Gene Therapy
Authors: Grace Elizabeth Mulia, Virginia Picanço-Castro, Eleana F. Stavrou, Aglaia Athanassiadou, Marxa Leão Figueiredo
Date: 2021-10-01

Abstract:
Nonviral and nonintegrating episomal vectors are reemerging as a valid, alternative technology to integrating viral vectors for gene therapy, due to their more favorable safety profile, significantly lower risk for insertional mutagenesis, and a lesser potential for innate immune reactions, in addition to their low production cost. Over the past few years, attempts have been made to generate highly functional nonviral vectors that display long-term maintenance within cells and promote more sustained gene expression relative to conventional plasmids. Extensive research into the parameters that stabilize the episomal DNA within dividing and nondividing cells has shed light into the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms that govern replication and transcription of episomal DNA within a mammalian nucleus in long-term cell culture. Episomal vectors based on scaffold/matrix attachment regions (S/MARs) do not integrate into the genomic DNA and address the serious problem of plasmid loss during mitosis by providing mitotic stability to established plasmids, which results in long-term transfection and transgene expression. The inclusion, in such vectors, of an origin of replication—initiation region—from the human genome has greatly enhanced their performance in primary cell culture. A number of vectors that function as episomes have arisen, which are either devoid or depleted of harmful CpG sequences and bacterial genes, and their effectiveness, as well as that of nonintegrating viral episomes, is enhanced when combined with S/MAR elements. As a result of these advances, an “S/MAR technology” has emerged for the production of efficient episomal vectors. Significant research continues in this field and innovations, in combination with promising systems based on nanoparticles and potentially combined with physical delivery methods, will enable the generation of optimized systems with scale-up and clinical application suitability utilizing episomal vectors.

Abstract:
Gene editing is a growing gene engineering technique that allows accurate editing of a broad spectrum of gene‐regulated diseases to achieve curative treatment and also has the potential to be used as an adjunct to the conventional treatment of diseases. Gene editing technology, mainly based on clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats (CRISPR)–CRISPR‐associated protein systems, which is capable of generating genetic modifications in somatic cells, provides a promising new strategy for gene therapy for a wide range of human diseases. Currently, gene editing technology shows great application prospects in a variety of human diseases, not only in therapeutic potential but also in the construction of animal models of human diseases. This paper describes the application of gene editing technology in hematological diseases, solid tumors, immune disorders, ophthalmological diseases, and metabolic diseases; focuses on the therapeutic strategies of gene editing technology in sickle cell disease; provides an overview of the role of gene editing technology in the construction of animal models of human diseases; and discusses the limitations of gene editing technology in the treatment of diseases, which is intended to provide an important reference for the applications of gene editing technology in the human disease.

Abstract:
Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a genetic disorder that affects 1 in 300 people, leading to high cholesterol levels and significantly increased cardiovascular risk. The limitations of existing FH treatments underscore the need for innovative therapeutics, and gene therapy offers a promising alternative to address FH more effectively. In this review, we survey approved gene therapy drugs first and then delve into the landscape of gene addition, gene inactivation, and gene editing therapies for hypercholesterolemia, highlighting both approved interventions and those in various stages of development. We also discussed recent advancements in gene editing tools that are essential for their application in gene therapy. Safety considerations inherent to gene therapy are also discussed, emphasizing the importance of mitigating potential risks associated with such treatments. Overall, this review highlights the progress and prospects of gene therapies for FH treatments, underscoring their potential to revolutionize the management of this prevalent and challenging condition.

Adenovirus was first identified in the 1950s and since then this pathogenic group
of viruses has been explored and transformed into a genetic transfer vehicle.
Modification or deletion of few genes are necessary to transform it into a
conditionally or non-replicative vector, creating a versatile tool capable of
transducing different tissues and inducing high levels of transgene expression.
In the early years of vector development, the application in monogenic diseases
faced several hurdles, including short-term gene expression and even a fatality.
On the other hand, an adenoviral delivery strategy for treatment of cancer was
the first approved gene therapy product. There is an increasing interest in
expressing transgenes with therapeutic potential targeting the cancer hallmarks,
inhibiting metastasis, inducing cancer cell death or modulating the immune
system to attack the tumor cells. Replicative adenovirus as vaccines may be even
older and date to a few years of its discovery, application of non-replicative
adenovirus for vaccination against different microorganisms has been
investigated, but only recently, it demonstrated its full potential being one of
the leading vaccination tools for COVID-19. This is not a new vector nor a new
technology, but the result of decades of careful and intense work in this
field.

Title: Ocular Gene Therapy: An Overview of Viral Vectors, Immune Responses,
and Future Directions
Authors: Lamprini Banou, Soshian Sarrafpour, Christopher C. Teng, Ji Liu
Date: 2024-12-19

Abstract:
Ocular gene therapy has rapidly advanced from proof-of-concept studies to
clinical trials by exploiting the unique advantages of the eye, including its
easy accessibility, relative immune privilege, and the ability to use the
contralateral eye as a control. An important step forward was achieved with the
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of voretigene neparvovec (Luxturna)
for the treatment of biallelic RPE65-mutation-associated retinal dystrophies in
2017. Gene therapy is a promising field aimed at treating various inherited and
acquired eye diseases. Viral vectors such as adeno-associated virus (AAV) are
mainly used to efficiently deliver genes. Despite the immune-privileged status
of the eye, viral vector-based therapies can induce immune responses,
potentially leading to gene therapy-associated uveitis. Future directions
include developing strategies to reduce immune responses while maintaining
therapeutic efficacy, optimizing vector selection, and improving delivery
techniques. Continued advances in the field of viral vectors, particularly AAV,
are expanding the potential applications of gene therapy to treat a variety of
ocular diseases. To fully realize the potential of ocular gene therapy, more
research and clinical trials are needed to improve these methods, ensure safe
and efficient treatments, and ultimately overcome existing obstacles.

Title: Gene Therapy for Malignant and Benign Gynaecological Disorders: A Systematic Review of an Emerging Success Story
Authors: Ekati Drakopoulou, Nicholas P. Anagnou, Kalliopi I. Pappa
Date: 2022-06-30

Abstract:
This review discusses all the major advances in gene therapy of gynaecological disorders, highlighting the novel and potentially therapeutic perspectives associated with such an approach. It specifically focuses on the gene therapy strategies against major gynaecological malignant disorders, such as ovarian, cervical, and endometrial cancer, as well as benign disorders, such as uterine leiomyomas, endometriosis, placental, and embryo implantation disorders. The above therapeutic strategies, which employ both viral and non-viral systems for mutation compensation, suicide gene therapy, oncolytic virotherapy, antiangiogenesis and immunopotentiation approaches, have yielded promising results over the last decade, setting the grounds for successful clinical trials. Despite the major advances in screening and therapeutic approaches, gynaecological malignancies still present as a leading cause of death among women of reproductive age. Cervical cancer, although largely preventable through vaccination and regular screening, remains the fourth most common and most lethal cancer type in women, while the available treatment schemes still pose a fertility threat. Ovarian cancer is associated with high morbidity rates, primarily due to lack of symptoms and high relapse rates following treatment, whereas endometrial cancer, although usually curable by surgery, it still represents a therapeutic problem. On the other hand, benign abnormalities, such as fibroids, endometriosis, placental, and embryo implantation disorders, although not life-threatening, significantly affect women’s life and fertility and have high socio-economic impacts. In the last decade, targeted gene therapy approaches toward both malignant and benign gynaecological abnormalities have led to promising results, setting the ground for successful clinical trials. The above therapeutic strategies employ both viral and non-viral systems for mutation compensation, suicide gene therapy, oncolytic virotherapy, antiangiogenesis and immunopotentiation. This review discusses all the major advances in gene therapy of gynaecological disorders and highlights the novel and potentially therapeutic perspectives associated with such an approach.

Title: Adeno-Associated Virus Vectors in Retinal Gene Therapy: Challenges, Innovations, and Future Directions
Authors: Jiayu Huang, Jiajun Li, Xiangzhong Xu, Keran Li
Date: 2025-06-28

Abstract:
Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors have emerged as the leading platform for retinal gene therapy due to their favorable safety profile, low immunogenicity, and ability to mediate long-term transgene expression within the immune-privileged ocular environment. By integrating diverse strategies such as gene augmentation and gene editing, AAV-based therapies have demonstrated considerable promise in treating both inherited and acquired retinal disorders. However, their clinical translation remains limited by several key challenges, including restricted packaging capacity, suboptimal transduction efficiency, the risk of gene therapy-associated uveitis, and broader societal concerns such as disease burden and ethical oversight. This review summarizes recent advances aimed at overcoming these barriers, with a particular focus on delivery route-specific disease applicability, multi-vector systems, and capsid engineering approaches to enhance payload capacity, targeting specificity, and biosafety. By synthesizing these developments, we propose a conceptual and technical framework for a more efficient, safer, and broadly applicable AAV platform to accelerate clinical adoption in retinal gene therapy.

Authors: Xiaoyu He, Yidian Fu, Liang Ma, Yizheng Yao, Shengfang Ge, Zhi Yang, Xianqun Fan
Date: 2023-12-22

Abstract:
Owing to the promising therapeutic effect and one-time treatment advantage, gene therapy may completely change the management of eye diseases, especially retinal diseases. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) is considered one of the most promising viral gene delivery tools because it can infect various types of tissues and is considered as a relatively safe gene delivery vector. The eye is one of the most popular organs for gene therapy, since its limited volume is suitable for small doses of AAV stably transduction. Recently, an increasing number of clinical trials of AAV-mediated gene therapy are underway. This review summarizes the biological functions of AAV and its application in the treatment of various ocular diseases, as well as the characteristics of different AAV delivery routes in clinical applications. Here, the latest research progresses in AAV-mediated gene editing and silencing strategies to modify that the genetic ocular diseases are systematically outlined, especially by base editing and prime editing. We discuss the progress of AAV in ocular optogenetic therapy. We also summarize the application of AAV-mediated gene therapy in animal models and the difficulties in its clinical transformation.

Abstract:
Liver gene therapy with adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors delivering clotting factor transgenes into hepatocytes has shown multiyear therapeutic benefit in adults with hemophilia. However, the mostly episomal nature of AAV vectors challenges their application to young pediatric patients. We developed lentiviral vectors, which integrate in the host cell genome, that achieve efficient liver gene transfer in mice, dogs and non-human primates, by intravenous delivery. Here we first compare engineered coagulation factor VIII transgenes and show that codon-usage optimization improved expression 10-20-fold in hemophilia A mice and that inclusion of an unstructured XTEN peptide, known to increase the half-life of the payload protein, provided an additional >10-fold increase in overall factor VIII output in mice and non-human primates. Stable nearly life-long normal and above-normal factor VIII activity was achieved in hemophilia A mouse models. Overall, we show long-term factor VIII activity and restoration of hemostasis, by lentiviral gene therapy to hemophilia A mice and normal-range factor VIII activity in non-human primate, paving the way for potential clinical application.

Abstract:
In the realm of gene therapy, a pivotal moment arrived with Paul Berg’s groundbreaking identification of the first recombinant DNA in 1972. This achievement set the stage for future breakthroughs. Conditions once considered undefeatable, like melanoma, pancreatic cancer, and a host of other ailments, are now being addressed at their root cause—the genetic level. Presently, the gene therapy landscape stands adorned with 22 approved in vivo and ex vivo products, including IMLYGIC, LUXTURNA, Zolgensma, Spinraza, Patisiran, and many more. In this comprehensive exploration, we delve into a rich assortment of 16 drugs, from siRNA, miRNA, and CRISPR/Cas9 to DNA aptamers and TRAIL/APO2L, as well as 46 carriers, from AAV, AdV, LNPs, and exosomes to naked mRNA, sonoporation, and magnetofection. The article also discusses the advantages and disadvantages of each product and vector type, as well as the current challenges faced in the practical use of gene therapy and its future potential.

Abstract:
Mitochondrial diseases (MD) are a heterogeneous group of multisystem disorders involving metabolic errors. MD are characterized by extremely heterogeneous symptoms, ranging from organ-specific to multisystem dysfunction with different clinical courses. Most primary MD are autosomal recessive but maternal inheritance (from mtDNA), autosomal dominant, and X-linked inheritance is also known. Mitochondria are unique energy-generating cellular organelles designed to survive and contain their own unique genetic coding material, a circular mtDNA fragment of approximately 16,000 base pairs. The mitochondrial genetic system incorporates closely interacting bi-genomic factors encoded by the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. Understanding the dynamics of mitochondrial genetics supporting mitochondrial biogenesis is especially important for the development of strategies for the treatment of rare and difficult-to-diagnose diseases. Gene therapy is one of the methods for correcting mitochondrial disorders.

Authors: Young Shin Lee, Jung Ran Choi, Jin-Bae Kim

Abstract:
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) stands as one of the leading causes of death in the United States, with its prevalence steadily on the rise. Traditional therapeutic approaches, such as pharmacological treatment, cardiovascular intervention, and surgery, have inherent limitations. In response to these challenges, cardiac gene therapy has emerged as a promising alternative for treating CVD patients. However, several obstacles persist, including the low efficiency of gene transduction, immune reactions to vectors or transduced cells, and the occurrence of off-target effects. While preclinical research has demonstrated significant success in various CVD model in both small and large animals, the translation of these findings to clinical applications has, for the most part, yielded disappointing results, except for some early, albeit small, trials. This review aims to provide a comprehensive summary of recent preclinical and clinical studies on gene therapy for various CVDs. Additionally, we discuss the existing limitations and challenges that hinder the widespread clinical application of cardiac gene therapy.

Abstract:
Pompe disease (PD) is caused by deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme acid α-glucosidase (GAA), leading to progressive glycogen accumulation and severe myopathy with progressive muscle weakness. In the Infantile-Onset PD (IOPD), death generally occurs <1 year of age. There is no cure for IOPD. Mouse models of PD do not completely reproduce human IOPD severity. Our main objective was to generate the first IOPD rat model to assess an innovative muscle-directed adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector-mediated gene therapy. PD rats were generated by CRISPR/Cas9 technology. The novel highly myotropic bioengineered capsid AAVMYO3 and an optimized muscle-specific promoter in conjunction with a transcriptional cis-regulatory element were used to achieve robust Gaa expression in the entire muscular system. Several metabolic, molecular, histopathological, and functional parameters were measured. PD rats showed early-onset widespread glycogen accumulation, hepato- and cardiomegaly, decreased body and tissue weight, severe impaired muscle function and decreased survival, closely resembling human IOPD. Treatment with AAVMYO3-Gaa vectors resulted in widespread expression of Gaa in muscle throughout the body, normalizing glycogen storage pathology, restoring muscle mass and strength, counteracting cardiomegaly and normalizing survival rate. This gene therapy holds great potential to treat glycogen metabolism alterations in IOPD. Moreover, the AAV-mediated approach may be exploited for other inherited muscle diseases, which also are limited by the inefficient widespread delivery of therapeutic transgenes throughout the muscular system.

Abstract:
Gene regulatory networks within cells modulate the expression of the genome in response to signals and changing environmental conditions. Reconstructions of gene regulatory networks can reveal the information processing and control principles used by cells to maintain homeostasis and execute cell-state transitions. Here, we introduce a computational framework, D-SPIN, that generates quantitative models of gene regulatory networks from single-cell mRNA-seq datasets collected across thousands of distinct perturbation conditions. D-SPIN constructs probabilistic models of regulatory interactions between genes or gene-expression programs to fit the cell state distributions under different perturbations. Using large Perturb-seq and drug-response datasets, we demonstrate that D-SPIN models reveal key regulators of cell fate decisions and the coordination of distant cellular pathways in response to gene knockdown perturbations. D-SPIN also dissects gene-level drug response mechanisms in heterogeneous cell populations, elucidating how combinations of immunomodulatory drugs acting on distinct regulators induce novel cell states through additive recruitment of gene expression programs. D-SPIN provides a computational framework for constructing interpretable models of gene regulatory networks to reveal principles of cellular information processing and physiological control.

Date: 2025-08

Abstract:
Advancements in gene therapy have achieved significant milestones in treating human diseases, offering renewed hope to patients with limited options. Key to this progress are vectors, which include both viral and non-viral methodologies that impact the success of gene therapy. Over the past two decades, three widely used viral vectors—lentiviruses (LV), adenoviruses (Ad), and adeno-associated viruses (AAV)—have enabled notable preclinical and clinical successes, including the approval of Luxturna for a genetic retinal disease and CAR-T therapies for blood cancers. Recently, the first-in-human dual AAV therapy for hereditary hearing loss, which overcomes large gene delivery, has showcased the restoration of auditory function for patients. Additionally, non-viral vectors such as lipid nanoparticles (LNP) and N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) have led to successful gene therapy products. This review focuses on both viral and non-viral delivery systems in gene therapy, highlighting their current state and future perspectives in treating human diseases.

Title: Risk Mitigation of Immunogenicity: A Key to Personalized Retinal Gene Therapy
Authors: Juliette Varin, Clément Morival, Noémien Maillard, Oumeya Adjali, Therese Cronin
Date: 2021-11-26

Abstract:
Gene therapy (GT) for ocular disorders has advanced the most among adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated therapies, with one product already approved in the market. The bank of retinal gene mutations carefully compiled over 30 years, the small retinal surface that does not require high clinical vector stocks, and the relatively immune-privileged environment of the eye explain such success. However, adverse effects due to AAV-delivery, though rare in the retina have led to the interruption of clinical trials. Risk mitigation, as the key to safe and efficient GT, has become the focus of ‘bedside-back-to-bench’ studies. Herein, we overview the inflammatory adverse events described in retinal GT trials and analyze which components of the retinal immunological environment might be the most involved in these immune responses, with a focus on the innate immune system composed of microglial surveillance. We consider the factors that can influence inflammation in the retina after GT such as viral sensors in the retinal tissue and CpG content in promoters or transgene sequences. Finally, we consider options to reduce the immunological risk, including dose, modified capsids or exclusion criteria for clinical trials. A better understanding and mitigation of immune risk factors inducing host immunity in AAV-mediated retinal GT is the key to achieving safe and efficient GT.

Abstract:
Advancements in understanding the pathogenesis mechanisms underlying gastrointestinal diseases, encompassing inflammatory bowel disease, gastrointestinal cancer, and gastroesophageal reflux disease, have led to the identification of numerous novel therapeutic targets. These discoveries have opened up exciting possibilities for developing gene therapy strategies to treat gastrointestinal diseases. These strategies include gene replacement, gene enhancement, gene overexpression, gene function blocking, and transgenic somatic cell transplantation. In this review, we introduce the important gene therapy targets and targeted delivery systems within the field of gastroenterology. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive overview of recent progress in gene therapy related to gastrointestinal disorders and shed light on the application of innovative gene-editing technologies in treating these conditions. These developments are fueling a revolution in the management of gastrointestinal diseases. Ultimately, we discuss the current challenges (particularly regarding safety, oral efficacy, and cost) and explore potential future directions for implementing gene therapy in the clinical settings for gastrointestinal diseases.

Authors: Paula Germino-Watnick, Malikiya Hinds, Anh Le, Rebecca Chu, Xiong Liu, Naoya Uchida
Date: 2022-06-04

Abstract:
Autologous hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)-targeted gene therapy provides a one-time cure for various genetic diseases including sickle cell disease (SCD) and β-thalassemia. SCD is caused by a point mutation (20A > T) in the β-globin gene. Since SCD is the most common single-gene disorder, curing SCD is a primary goal in HSC gene therapy. β-thalassemia results from either the absence or the reduction of β-globin expression, and it can be cured using similar strategies. In HSC gene-addition therapy, patient CD34+ HSCs are genetically modified by adding a therapeutic β-globin gene with lentiviral transduction, followed by autologous transplantation. Alternatively, novel gene-editing therapies allow for the correction of the mutated β-globin gene, instead of addition. Furthermore, these diseases can be cured by γ-globin induction based on gene addition/editing in HSCs. In this review, we discuss HSC-targeted gene therapy in SCD with gene addition as well as gene editing.

Abstract:
Early gene therapy studies held great promise for the cure of heritable diseases, but the occurrence of various genotoxic events led to a pause in clinical trials and a more guarded approach to progress. Recent advances in genetic engineering technologies have reignited interest, leading to the approval of the first gene therapy product targeting genetic mutations in 2017. Gene therapy (GT) can be delivered either in vivo or ex vivo. An ex vivo approach to gene therapy is advantageous, as it allows for the characterization of the gene-modified cells and the selection of desired properties before patient administration. Autologous cells can also be used during this process which eliminates the possibility of immune rejection. This review highlights the various stages of ex vivo gene therapy, current research developments that have increased the efficiency and safety of this process, and a comprehensive summary of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) gene therapy studies, the majority of which have employed the ex vivo approach.

Abstract:
Lentiviral vector genomic RNA requires sequences that partially overlap wild-type HIV-1 gag and env genes for packaging into vector particles. These HIV-1 packaging sequences constitute 19.6% of the wild-type HIV-1 genome and contain functional cis elements that potentially compromise clinical safety. Here, we describe the development of a novel lentiviral vector (LTR1) with a unique genomic structure designed to prevent transfer of HIV-1 packaging sequences to patient cells, thus reducing the total HIV-1 content to just 4.8% of the wild-type genome. This has been achieved by reconfiguring the vector to mediate reverse-transcription with a single strand transfer, instead of the usual two, and in which HIV-1 packaging sequences are not copied. We show that LTR1 vectors offer improved safety in their resistance to remobilization in HIV-1 particles and reduced frequency of splicing into human genes. Following intravenous luciferase vector administration to neonatal mice, LTR1 sustained a higher level of liver transgene expression than an equivalent dose of a standard lentivirus. LTR1 vectors produce reverse-transcription products earlier and start to express transgenes significantly quicker than standard lentiviruses after transduction. Finally, we show that LTR1 is an effective lentiviral gene therapy vector as demonstrated by correction of a mouse hemophilia B model.

Date: 2024

Abstract:
Gene therapy holds promise for patients with inherited monogenic disorders, cancer, and rare genetic diseases. Naturally occurring adeno-associated virus (AAV) offers a well-suited vehicle for clinical gene transfer due to its lack of significant clinical pathogenicity and amenability to be engineered to deliver therapeutic transgenes in a variety of cell types for long-term sustained expression. AAV has been bioengineered to produce recombinant AAV (rAAV) vectors for many gene therapies that are approved or in late-stage development. However, ongoing challenges hamper wider use of rAAV vector-mediated therapies. These include immunity against rAAV vectors, limited transgene packaging capacity, sub-optimal tissue transduction, potential risks of insertional mutagenesis and vector shedding. This review focuses on aspects of immunity against rAAV, mediated by anti-AAV neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) arising after natural exposure to AAVs or after rAAV vector administration. We provide an in-depth analysis of factors determining AAV seroprevalence and examine clinical approaches to managing anti-AAV NAbs pre- and post-vector administration. Methodologies used to quantify anti-AAV NAb levels and strategies to overcome pre-existing AAV immunity are also discussed. The broad adoption of rAAV vector-mediated gene therapies will require wider clinical appreciation of their current limitations and further research to mitigate their impact.

Title: Preclinical and clinical advances in transposon-based gene therapy
Authors: Jaitip Tipanee, Yoke Chin Chai, Thierry VandenDriessche, Marinee K. Chuah
Date: 2017-10-31

Abstract:
Transposons derived from Sleeping Beauty (SB), piggyBac (PB), or Tol2 typically require cotransfection of transposon DNA with a transposase either as an expression plasmid or mRNA. Consequently, this results in genomic integration of the potentially therapeutic gene into chromosomes of the desired target cells, and thus conferring stable expression. Non-viral transfection methods are typically preferred to deliver the transposon components into the target cells. However, these methods do not match the efficacy typically attained with viral vectors and are sometimes associated with cellular toxicity evoked by the DNA itself. In recent years, the overall transposition efficacy has gradually increased by codon optimization of the transposase, generation of hyperactive transposases, and/or introduction of specific mutations in the transposon terminal repeats. Their versatility enabled the stable genetic engineering in many different primary cell types, including stem/progenitor cells and differentiated cell types. This prompted numerous preclinical proof-of-concept studies in disease models that demonstrated the potential of DNA transposons for ex vivo and in vivo gene therapy. One of the merits of transposon systems relates to their ability to deliver relatively large therapeutic transgenes that cannot readily be accommodated in viral vectors such as full-length dystrophin cDNA. These emerging insights paved the way toward the first transposon-based phase I/II clinical trials to treat hematologic cancer and other diseases. Though encouraging results were obtained, controlled pivotal clinical trials are needed to corroborate the efficacy and safety of transposon-based therapies.

Abstract:
Inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) represent a diverse group of genetic disorders leading to progressive degeneration of the retina due to mutations in over 280 genes. This review focuses on the various methodologies for the preclinical characterization and evaluation of adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated gene therapy as a potential treatment option for IRDs, particularly focusing on gene therapies targeting mutations, such as those in the RPE65 and FAM161A genes. AAV vectors, such as AAV2 and AAV5, have been utilized to deliver therapeutic genes, showing promise in preserving vision and enhancing photoreceptor function in animal models. Despite their advantages—including high production efficiency, low pathogenicity, and minimal immunogenicity—AAV-mediated therapies face limitations such as immune responses beyond the retina, vector size constraints, and challenges in large-scale manufacturing. This review systematically compares different experimental models used to investigate AAV-mediated therapies, such as mouse models, human retinal explants (HREs), and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived retinal organoids. Mouse models are advantageous for genetic manipulation and detailed investigations of disease mechanisms; however, anatomical differences between mice and humans may limit the translational applicability of results. HREs offer valuable insights into human retinal pathophysiology but face challenges such as tissue degradation and lack of systemic physiological effects. Retinal organoids, on the other hand, provide a robust platform that closely mimics human retinal development, thereby enabling more comprehensive studies on disease mechanisms and therapeutic strategies, including AAV-based interventions. Specific outcomes targeted in these studies include vision preservation and functional improvements of retinas damaged by genetic mutations. This review highlights the strengths and weaknesses of each experimental model and advocates for their combined use in developing targeted gene therapies for IRDs. As research advances, optimizing AAV vector design and delivery methods will be critical for enhancing therapeutic efficacy and improving clinical outcomes for patients with IRDs.

Abstract:
Cardiac arrhythmias remain a major source of morbidity and mortality, often stemming from molecular and structural abnormalities that are insufficiently addressed by current pharmacologic and interventional therapies. Gene therapy has emerged as a transformative approach, offering precise and durable interventions that directly target the arrhythmogenic substrate. Across the spectrum of inherited and acquired arrhythmias—including long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, and post-infarction ventricular tachycardia—gene-based strategies such as allele-specific silencing, gene replacement, CRISPR-mediated editing, and suppression-and-replacement constructs are showing growing translational potential. Advances in delivery platforms, including cardiotropic viral vectors, lipid nanoparticle-encapsulated mRNA, and non-viral reprogramming tools, have further enhanced the specificity and safety of these approaches. Additionally, innovative applications such as biological pacemaker development and mutation-agnostic therapies underscore the versatility of genetic modulation. Nonetheless, significant challenges remain, including vector tropism, immune responses, payload limitations, and the translational gap between preclinical models and human electrophysiology. Integration of patient-derived cardiomyocytes, computational simulations, and large-animal studies is expected to accelerate clinical translation. This review provides a comprehensive synthesis of the mechanistic rationale, therapeutic strategies, delivery platforms, and translational frontiers of gene therapy for cardiac arrhythmias.

Title: Effects of gene therapy on cardiovascular symptoms of lysosomal
storage diseases
Authors: Edina Poletto, Gabriela Pasqualim, Roberto Giugliani, Ursula Matte, Guilherme Baldo
Date: 2019-05-23

Abstract:
Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) are inherited conditions caused by impaired
lysosomal function and consequent substrate storage, leading to a range of
clinical manifestations, including cardiovascular disease. This may lead to
significant symptoms and even cardiac failure, which is an important cause of
death among patients. Currently available treatments do not completely correct
cardiac involvement in the LSDs. Gene therapy has been tested as a therapeutic
alternative with promising results for the heart disease. In this review, we
present the results of different approaches of gene therapy for LSDs, mainly in
animal models, and its effects in the heart, focusing on protocols with cardiac
functional analysis.

Title: Gene Therapy for β-Hemoglobinopathies: From Discovery to Clinical Trials
Authors: Eva Eugenie Rose Segura, Paul George Ayoub, Kevyn Lopez Hart, Donald Barry Kohn
Date: 2023-03-09

Abstract:
Investigations to understand the function and control of the globin genes have led to some of the most exciting molecular discoveries and biomedical breakthroughs of the 20th and 21st centuries. Extensive characterization of the globin gene locus, accompanied by pioneering work on the utilization of viruses as human gene delivery tools in human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HPSCs), has led to transformative and successful therapies via autologous hematopoietic stem-cell transplant with gene therapy (HSCT-GT). Due to the advanced understanding of the β-globin gene cluster, the first diseases considered for autologous HSCT-GT were two prevalent β-hemoglobinopathies: sickle cell disease and β-thalassemia, both affecting functional β-globin chains and leading to substantial morbidity. Both conditions are suitable for allogeneic HSCT; however, this therapy comes with serious risks and is most effective using an HLA-matched family donor (which is not available for most patients) to obtain optimal therapeutic and safe benefits. Transplants from unrelated or haplo-identical donors carry higher risks, although they are progressively improving. Conversely, HSCT-GT utilizes the patient’s own HSPCs, broadening access to more patients. Several gene therapy clinical trials have been reported to have achieved significant disease improvement, and more are underway. Based on the safety and the therapeutic success of autologous HSCT-GT, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2022 approved an HSCT-GT for β-thalassemia (Zynteglo™). This review illuminates the β-globin gene research journey, adversities faced, and achievements reached; it highlights important molecular and genetic findings of the β-globin locus, describes the predominant globin vectors, and concludes by describing promising results from clinical trials for both sickle cell disease and β-thalassemia.

Abstract:
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) controls the survival, growth, and function of neurons both during the development and in the adult nervous system. Bdnf is transcribed from several distinct promoters generating transcripts with alternative 5' exons. Bdnf transcripts initiated at the first cluster of exons have been associated with the regulation of body weight and various aspects of social behavior, but the mechanisms driving the expression of these transcripts have remained poorly understood. Here, we identify an evolutionarily conserved intronic enhancer region inside the Bdnf gene that regulates both basal and stimulus-dependent expression of the Bdnf transcripts starting from the first cluster of 5' exons in mouse and rat neurons. We further uncover a functional E-box element in the enhancer region, linking the expression of Bdnf and various pro-neural basic helix–loop–helix transcription factors. Collectively, our results shed new light on the cell-type- and stimulus-specific regulation of the important neurotrophic factor BDNF.

Abstract:
We introduce Promoter-Enhancer-Guided Interaction Networks (PENGUIN), a method for studying protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks within enhancer-promoter interactions. PENGUIN integrates H3K27ac-HiChIP data with tissue-specific PPIs to define enhancer-promoter PPI networks (EPINs). We validated PENGUIN using cancer (LNCaP) and benign (LHSAR) prostate cell lines. Our analysis detected EPIN clusters enriched with the architectural protein CTCF, a regulator of enhancer-promoter interactions. CTCF presence was coupled with the prevalence of prostate cancer (PrCa) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the same EPIN clusters, suggesting functional implications in PrCa. Within the EPINs displaying enrichments in both CTCF and PrCa SNPs, we also show enrichment in oncogenes. We substantiated our identified SNPs through CRISPR/Cas9 knockout and RNAi screens experiments. Here we show that PENGUIN provides insights into the intricate interplay between enhancer-promoter interactions and PPI networks, which are crucial for identifying key genes and potential intervention targets.

Abstract:
 Cebpa is a master transcription factor gene for adipogenesis. However, the mechanisms of enhancer–promoter chromatin interactions controlling Cebpa transcriptional regulation during adipogenic differentiation remain largely unknown. To reveal how the three‐dimensional structure of Cebpa changes during adipogenesis, we generated high‐resolution chromatin interactions of Cebpa in 3T3‐L1 preadipocytes and 3T3‐L1 adipocytes using circularized chromosome conformation capture sequencing (4C‐seq). We revealed dramatic changes in chromatin interactions and chromatin status at interaction sites during adipogenic differentiation. Based on this, we identified five active enhancers of Cebpa in 3T3‐L1 adipocytes through epigenomic data and luciferase reporter assays. Next, epigenetic repression of Cebpa‐L1‐AD‐En2 or ‐En3 by the dCas9‐KRAB system significantly down‐regulated Cebpa expression and inhibited adipocyte differentiation. Furthermore, experimental depletion of cohesin decreased the interaction intensity between Cebpa‐L1‐AD‐En2 and the Cebpa promoter and down‐regulated Cebpa expression, indicating that long‐range chromatin loop formation was mediated by cohesin. Two transcription factors, RXRA and PPARG, synergistically regulate the activity of Cebpa‐L1‐AD‐En2. To test whether Cebpa‐L1‐AD‐En2 plays a role in adipose tissue development, we injected dCas9‐KRAB‐En2 lentivirus into the inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) of mice to suppress the activity of Cebpa‐L1‐AD‐En2. Repression of Cebpa‐L1‐AD‐En2 significantly decreased Cebpa expression and adipocyte size, altered iWAT transcriptome, and affected iWAT development. We identified functional enhancers regulating Cebpa expression and clarified the crucial roles of Cebpa‐L1‐AD‐En2 and Cebpa promoter interaction in adipocyte differentiation and adipose tissue development.

Abstract:
Enhancers are powerful and versatile agents of cell-type specific gene regulation, which are thought to play key roles in human disease. Enhancers are short DNA elements that function primarily as clusters of transcription factor binding sites that are spatially coordinated to regulate expression of one or more specific target genes. These regulatory connections between enhancers and target genes can therefore be characterized as enhancer-gene links that can affect development, disease, and homeostatic cellular processes. Despite their implication in disease and the establishment of cell identity during development, most enhancer-gene links remain unknown. Here we introduce a new, publicly accessible database of predicted enhancer-gene links, PEREGRINE. The PEREGRINE human enhancer-gene links interactive web interface incorporates publicly available experimental data from ChIA-PET, eQTL, and Hi-C assays across 78 cell and tissue types to link 449,627 enhancers to 17,643 protein-coding genes. These enhancer-gene links are made available through the new Enhancer module of the PANTHER database and website where the user may easily access the evidence for each enhancer-gene link, as well as query by target gene and enhancer location.

Title: Cell-type-specific cis -regulatory divergence in gene expression and chromatin accessibility revealed by human-chimpanzee hybrid cells
Authors: Ban Wang, Alexander L Starr, Hunter B Fraser, Jenny Tung, Ban Wang, Alexander L Starr, Hunter B Fraser
Date: 2024-02-15

Abstract:
Although gene expression divergence has long been postulated to be the primary driver of human evolution, identifying the genes and genetic variants underlying uniquely human traits has proven to be quite challenging. Theory suggests that cell-type-specific cis -regulatory variants may fuel evolutionary adaptation due to the specificity of their effects. These variants can precisely tune the expression of a single gene in a single cell-type, avoiding the potentially deleterious consequences of trans -acting changes and non-cell type-specific changes that can impact many genes and cell types, respectively. It has recently become possible to quantify human-specific cis -acting regulatory divergence by measuring allele-specific expression in human-chimpanzee hybrid cells—the product of fusing induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells of each species in vitro . However, these cis -regulatory changes have only been explored in a limited number of cell types. Here, we quantify human-chimpanzee cis -regulatory divergence in gene expression and chromatin accessibility across six cell types, enabling the identification of highly cell-type-specific cis -regulatory changes. We find that cell-type-specific genes and regulatory elements evolve faster than those shared across cell types, suggesting an important role for genes with cell-type-specific expression in human evolution. Furthermore, we identify several instances of lineage-specific natural selection that may have played key roles in specific cell types, such as coordinated changes in the cis -regulation of dozens of genes involved in neuronal firing in motor neurons. Finally, using novel metrics and a machine learning model, we identify genetic variants that likely alter chromatin accessibility and transcription factor binding, leading to neuron-specific changes in the expression of the neurodevelopmentally important genes FABP7 and GAD1 . Overall, our results demonstrate that integrative analysis of cis -regulatory divergence in chromatin accessibility and gene expression across cell types is a promising approach to identify the specific genes and genetic variants that make us human.

Title: HDI-STARR-seq: Condition-specific enhancer discovery in mouse liver in vivo
Authors: Ting-Ya Chang, David J. Waxman
Date: 2024-12-24

Abstract:
STARR-seq and other massively-parallel reporter assays are widely used to discover functional enhancers in transfected cell models, which can be confounded by plasmid vector-induced type-I interferon immune responses and lack the multicellular environment and endogenous chromatin state of complex mammalian tissues. We describe HDI-STARR-seq, which combines STARR-seq plasmid library delivery to the liver, by hydrodynamic tail vein injection (HDI), with reporter RNA transcriptional initiation driven by a minimal Albumin promoter, which we show is essential for mouse liver STARR-seq enhancer activity assayed 7 days after HDI. Importantly, little or no vector-induced innate type-I interferon responses were observed. Comparisons of HDI-STARR-seq activity between male and female mouse livers and in livers from males treated with an activating ligand of the transcription factor (TF) CAR ( Nr1i3 ) identified many condition-dependent enhancers linked to condition-specific gene expression. Further, thousands of active liver enhancers were identified using a high complexity STARR-seq library comprised of ~ 50,000 genomic regions released by DNase-I digestion of mouse liver nuclei. When compared to stringently inactive library sequences, the active enhancer sequences identified were highly enriched for liver open chromatin regions with activating histone marks (H3K27ac, H3K4me1, H3K4me3), were significantly closer to gene transcriptional start sites, and were significantly depleted of repressive (H3K27me3, H3K9me3) and transcribed region histone marks (H3K36me3). HDI-STARR-seq offers substantial improvements over current methodologies for large scale, functional profiling of enhancers, including condition-dependent enhancers, in liver tissue in vivo, and can be adapted to characterize enhancer activities in a variety of species and tissues by selecting suitable tissue- and species-specific promoter sequences.

Abstract:
Transcriptional enhancers—unlike promoters—are challenging to identify computationally due to their variable distance and orientation relative to target genes. The scarcity of experimentally confirmed enhancers often limits the training of robust machine-learning models for enhancer prediction. We present EnhancerMatcher, a convolutional neural network-based tool that identifies cell-type-specific enhancers using only two confirmed enhancers as references. Trained on putative enhancers from the CATlas Project and control sequences from the human genome, EnhancerMatcher classifies sequences in triplets: two known enhancers from a common cell type and a third sequence evaluated for enhancer activity. Unlike existing methods, EnhancerMatcher enables classification across all cell types while preserving specificity through two reference enhancers. It achieved 90% accuracy, 92% recall, and 87% specificity on human test data. Furthermore, EnhancerMatcher demonstrated strong cross-species generalization, effectively recognizing mouse enhancers using its human-trained model, and exhibited consistent performance across diverse cell types regardless of their data representation size. EnhancerMatcher extracts features directly from raw sequences and provides interpretability through class activation maps, making it a powerful, versatile, and generalizable tool for enhancer discovery and regulatory sequence analysis.

Title: Building regulatory landscapes reveals that an enhancer can recruit cohesin to create contact domains, engage CTCF sites and activate distant genes

Abstract:
Developmental gene expression is often controlled by distal regulatory DNA elements called enhancers. Distant enhancer action is restricted to structural chromosomal domains that are flanked by CTCF-associated boundaries and formed through cohesin chromatin loop extrusion. To better understand how enhancers, genes and CTCF boundaries together form structural domains and control expression, we used a bottom-up approach, building series of active regulatory landscapes in inactive chromatin. We demonstrate here that gene transcription levels and activity over time reduce with increased enhancer distance. The enhancer recruits cohesin to stimulate domain formation and engage flanking CTCF sites in loop formation. It requires cohesin exclusively for the activation of distant genes, not of proximal genes, with nearby CTCF boundaries supporting efficient long-range enhancer action. Our work supports a dual activity model for enhancers: its classic role of stimulating transcription initiation and elongation from target gene promoters and a role of recruiting cohesin for the creation of chromosomal domains, the engagement of CTCF sites in chromatin looping and the activation of distal target genes.

Abstract:
We have identified active enhancers in the mouse cerebellum at embryonic and postnatal stages which provides a view of novel enhancers active during cerebellar development. The majority of cerebellar enhancers have dynamic activity between embryonic and postnatal development. Cerebellar enhancers were enriched for neural transcription factor binding sites with temporally specific expression. Putative gene targets displayed spatially restricted expression patterns, indicating cell-type specific expression regulation. Functional analysis of target genes indicated that enhancers regulate processes spanning several developmental epochs such as specification, differentiation and maturation. We use these analyses to discover one novel regulator and one novel marker of cerebellar development: Bhlhe22 and Pax3, respectively. We identified an enrichment of de novo mutations and variants associated with autism spectrum disorder in cerebellar enhancers. Furthermore, by comparing our data with relevant brain development ENCODE histone profiles and cerebellar single-cell datasets we have been able to generalize and expand on the presented analyses, respectively. We have made the results of our analyses available online in the Developing Mouse Cerebellum Enhancer Atlas , where our dataset can be efficiently queried, curated and exported by the scientific community to facilitate future research efforts. Our study provides a valuable resource for studying the dynamics of gene expression regulation by enhancers in the developing cerebellum and delivers a rich dataset of novel gene-enhancer associations providing a basis for future in-depth studies in the cerebellum.

Title: Joint reconstruction of cis -regulatory interaction networks across multiple tissues using single-cell chromatin accessibility data
Authors: Kangning Dong, Shihua Zhang
Date: 2021-05

Abstract:
The rapid accumulation of single-cell chromatin accessibility data offers a unique opportunity to investigate common and specific regulatory mechanisms across different cell types. However, existing methods for cis -regulatory network reconstruction using single-cell chromatin accessibility data were only designed for cells belonging to one cell type, and resulting networks may be incomparable directly due to diverse cell numbers of different cell types. Here, we adopt a computational method to jointly reconstruct cis -regulatory interaction maps (JRIM) of multiple cell populations based on patterns of co-accessibility in single-cell data. We applied JRIM to explore common and specific regulatory interactions across multiple tissues from single-cell ATAC-seq dataset containing ~80 000 cells across 13 mouse tissues. Reconstructed common interactions among 13 tissues indeed relate to basic biological functions, and individual cis -regulatory networks show strong tissue specificity and functional relevance. More importantly, tissue-specific regulatory interactions are mediated by coordination of histone modifications and tissue-related TFs, and many of them may reveal novel regulatory mechanisms.

Title: Evidence for additive and synergistic action of mammalian enhancers during cell fate determination
Authors: Jinmi Choi, Kseniia Lysakovskaia, Gregoire Stik, Carina Demel, Johannes Söding, Tian V Tian, Thomas Graf, Patrick Cramer
Date: 2021-03-26

Abstract:
Enhancer activity drives cell differentiation and cell fate determination, but it remains unclear how enhancers cooperate during these processes. Here we investigate enhancer cooperation during transdifferentiation of human leukemia B-cells to macrophages. Putative enhancers are established by binding of the pioneer factor C/EBPα followed by chromatin opening and enhancer RNA (eRNA) synthesis from H3K4-monomethylated regions. Using eRNA synthesis as a proxy for enhancer activity, we find that most putative enhancers cooperate in an additive way to regulate transcription of assigned target genes. However, transcription from 136 target genes depends exponentially on the summed activity of its putative paired enhancers, indicating that these enhancers cooperate synergistically. The target genes are cell type-specific, suggesting that enhancer synergy can contribute to cell fate determination. Enhancer synergy appears to depend on cell type-specific transcription factors, and such interacting enhancers are not predicted from occupancy or accessibility data that are used to detect superenhancers.

Title: Enhancer–promoter interactions become more instructive in the transition from cell-fate specification to tissue differentiation
Authors: Tim Pollex, Adam Rabinowitz, Maria Cristina Gambetta, Raquel Marco-Ferreres, Rebecca R. Viales, Aleksander Jankowski, Christoph Schaub, Eileen E. M. Furlong
Date: 2024-03-11

Abstract:
To regulate expression, enhancers must come in proximity to their target gene. However, the relationship between the timing of enhancer–promoter (E–P) proximity and activity remains unclear, with examples of uncoupled, anticorrelated and correlated interactions. To assess this, we selected 600 characterized enhancers or promoters with tissue-specific activity in Drosophila embryos and performed Capture-C in FACS-purified myogenic or neurogenic cells during specification and tissue differentiation. This enabled direct comparison between E–P proximity and activity transitioning from OFF-to-ON and ON-to-OFF states across developmental conditions. This showed remarkably similar E–P topologies between specified muscle and neuronal cells, which are uncoupled from activity. During tissue differentiation, many new distal interactions emerge where changes in E–P proximity reflect changes in activity. The mode of E–P regulation therefore appears to change as embryogenesis proceeds, from largely permissive topologies during cell-fate specification to more instructive regulation during terminal tissue differentiation, when E–P proximity is coupled to activation.

Title: Combinatorial chromatin dynamics foster accurate cardiopharyngeal fate choices
Authors: Claudia Racioppi, Keira A Wiechecki, Lionel Christiaen
Date: 2019-11-20

Abstract:
During embryogenesis, chromatin accessibility profiles control lineage-specific gene expression by modulating transcription, thus impacting multipotent progenitor states and subsequent fate choices. Subsets of cardiac and pharyngeal/head muscles share a common origin in the cardiopharyngeal mesoderm, but the chromatin landscapes that govern multipotent progenitors competence and early fate choices remain largely elusive. Here, we leveraged the simplicity of the chordate model Ciona to profile chromatin accessibility through stereotyped transitions from naive Mesp + mesoderm to distinct fate-restricted heart and pharyngeal muscle precursors. An FGF-Foxf pathway acts in multipotent progenitors to establish cardiopharyngeal-specific patterns of accessibility, which govern later heart vs. pharyngeal muscle-specific expression profiles, demonstrating extensive spatiotemporal decoupling between early cardiopharyngeal enhancer accessibility and late cell-type-specific activity. We found that multiple cis -regulatory elements, with distinct chromatin accessibility profiles and motif compositions, are required to activate Ebf and Tbx1/10 , two key determinants of cardiopharyngeal fate choices. We propose that these ‘combined enhancers’ foster spatially and temporally accurate fate choices, by increasing the repertoire of regulatory inputs that control gene expression, through either accessibility and/or activity.

Date: 2022-10-07

Abstract:
Chromatin organization and enhancer-promoter contacts establish unique spatiotemporal gene expression patterns in distinct cell types. Non-coding genetic variants can influence cellular phenotypes by modifying higher-order transcriptional hubs and consequently gene expression. To elucidate genomic regulation in human retina, we mapped chromatin contacts at high resolution and integrated with super-enhancers (SEs), histone marks, binding of CTCF and select transcription factors. We show that topologically associated domains (TADs) with central SEs exhibit stronger insulation and augmented contact with retinal genes relative to TADs with edge SEs. Merging genome-wide expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) with topology map reveals physical links between 100 eQTLs and corresponding eGenes associated with retinal neurodegeneration. Additionally, we uncover candidate genes for susceptibility variants linked to age-related macular degeneration and glaucoma. Our study of high-resolution genomic architecture of human retina provides insights into genetic control of tissue-specific functions, suggests paradigms for missing heritability, and enables the dissection of common blinding disease phenotypes.

Authors: Nikita Gondalia, Luis Felipe Quiroz, Linyi Lai, Avinash Kumar Singh, Moman Khan, Galina Brychkova, Peter C. McKeown, Manash Chatterjee, Charles Spillane
Date: 2025-02-27

Abstract:
Genome‐edited plants, endowed with climate‐smart traits, have been promoted as tools for strengthening resilience against climate change. Successful plant gene editing (GE) requires precise regulation of the GE machinery, a process controlled by the promoters, which drives its transcription through interactions with transcription factors (TFs) and RNA polymerase. While constitutive promoters are extensively used in GE constructs, their limitations highlight the need for alternative approaches. This review emphasizes the promise of tissue/organ specific as well as inducible promoters, which enable targeted GE in a spatiotemporal manner with no effects on other tissues. Advances in synthetic biology have paved the way for the creation of synthetic promoters, offering refined control over gene expression and augmenting the potential of plant GE. The integration of these novel promoters with synthetic systems presents significant opportunities for precise and conditional genome editing. Moreover, the advent of bioinformatic tools and artificial intelligence is revolutionizing the characterization of regulatory elements, enhancing our understanding of their roles in plants. Thus, this review provides novel insights into the strategic use of promoters and promoter editing to enhance the precision, efficiency and specificity of plant GE, setting the stage for innovative crop improvement strategies.

Title: Enhancer regulatory networks globally connect non-coding breast cancer loci to cancer genes
Authors: Yihan Wang, Daniel Armendariz, Lei Wang, Huan Zhao, Shiqi Xie, Gary C. Hon
Date: 2023-11-20

Abstract:
Genetic studies have associated thousands of enhancers with breast cancer. However, the vast majority have not been functionally characterized. Thus, it remains unclear how variant-associated enhancers contribute to cancer. Here, we perform single-cell CRISPRi screens of 3,512 regulatory elements associated with breast cancer to measure the impact of these regions on transcriptional phenotypes. Analysis of >500,000 single-cell transcriptomes in two breast cancer cell lines shows that perturbation of variant-associated enhancers disrupts breast cancer gene programs. We observe variant-associated enhancers that directly or indirectly regulate the expression of cancer genes. We also find one-to-multiple and multiple-to-one network motifs where enhancers indirectly regulate cancer genes. Notably, multiple variant-associated enhancers indirectly regulate TP53. Comparative studies illustrate sub-type specific functions between enhancers in ER+ and ER− cells. Finally, we developed the pySpade package to facilitate analysis of single-cell enhancer screens. Overall, we demonstrate that enhancers form regulatory networks that link cancer genes in the genome, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the contribution of enhancers to breast cancer development.

Title: Genome-wide Identification and Characterization of Enhancers Across 10 Human Tissues
Authors: Lili Xiong, Ran Kang, Ruofan Ding, Wenyuan Kang, Yiming Zhang, Wenrong Liu, Qingqing Huang, Junhua Meng, Zhiyun Guo
Date: 2018

Abstract:
Background: Enhancers can act as cis-regulatory elements (CREs) to control development and cellular function by regulating gene expression in a tissue-specific and ubiquitous manner. However, the regulatory network and characteristic of different types of enhancers (e.g., transcribed/non-transcribed enhancers, tissue-specific/ubiquitous enhancers) across multiple tissues are still unclear. Results: Here, a total of 53,924 active enhancers and 10,307 enhancer-associated RNAs (eRNAs) in 10 tissues (adrenal, brain, breast, heart, liver, lung, ovary, placenta, skeletal muscle and kidney) were identified through the integration of histone modifications (H3K4me1, H3K27ac and H3K4me3) and DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs) data. Moreover, 40,101 tissue-specific enhancers (TS-Enh), 1,241 ubiquitously expressed enhancers (UE-Enh) as well as transcribed enhancers (T-Enh), including 7,727 unidirectionally transcribed enhancers (1D-Enh) and 1,215 bidirectionally transcribed enhancers (2D-Enh) were defined in 10 tissues. The results show that enhancers exhibited high GC content, genomic variants and transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) enrichment in all tissues. These characteristics were significantly different between TS-Enh and UE-Enh, T-Enh and NT-Enh, 2D-Enh and 1D-Enh. Furt hermore, the results showed that enhancers obviously upregulate the expression of adjacent target genes which were remarkably correlated with the functions of corresponding tissues. Finally, a free user-friendly tissue-specific enhancer database, TiED ( http://lcbb.swjtu.edu.cn/TiED ), has been built to store, visualize, and confer these results. Conclusion: Genome-wide analysis of the regulatory network and characteristic of various types of enhancers showed that enhancers associated with TFs, eRNAs and target genes appeared in tissue specificity and function across different tissues.

Title: Combined analysis of dissimilar promoter accessibility and gene expression profiles identifies tissue-specific genes and actively repressed networks
Authors: Rebekah R. Starks, Anilisa Biswas, Ashish Jain, Geetu Tuteja

Abstract:
The assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (ATAC-seq) is a powerful method to examine chromatin accessibility. While many studies have reported a positive correlation between gene expression and promoter accessibility, few have investigated the genes that deviate from this trend. In this study, we aimed to understand the relationship between gene expression and promoter accessibility in multiple cell types while also identifying gene regulatory networks in the placenta, an understudied organ that is critical for a successful pregnancy. We started by assaying the open chromatin landscape in the mid-gestation placenta, when the fetal vasculature has started developing. After incorporating transcriptomic data generated in the placenta at the same time point, we grouped genes based on their expression levels and ATAC-seq promoter coverage. We found that the genes with the strongest correlation (high expression and high coverage) are likely involved in housekeeping functions, whereas tissue-specific genes were highly expressed and had only medium–low coverage. We also predicted that genes with medium–low expression and high promoter coverage were actively repressed. Within this group, we extracted a protein–protein interaction network enriched for neuronal functions, likely preventing the cells from adopting a neuronal fate. We further confirmed that a repressive histone mark is bound to the promoters of genes in this network. Finally, we ran our pipeline using ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data generated in ten additional cell types. We again found that genes with the strongest correlation are enriched for housekeeping functions and that genes with medium–low promoter coverage and high expression are more likely to be tissue-specific. These results demonstrate that only two data types, both of which require relatively low starting material to generate and are becoming more commonly available, can be integrated to understand multiple aspects of gene regulation. Within the placenta, we identified an active placenta-specific gene network as well as a repressed neuronal network. Beyond the placenta, we demonstrate that ATAC-seq data and RNA-seq data can be integrated to identify tissue-specific genes and actively repressed gene networks in multiple cell types.

Title: Emergence of enhancers at late DNA replicating regions
Authors: Paola Cornejo-Páramo, Veronika Petrova, Xuan Zhang, Robert S. Young, Emily S. Wong
Date: 2024-04-24

Abstract:
Enhancers are fast-evolving genomic sequences that control spatiotemporal gene expression patterns. By examining enhancer turnover across mammalian species and in multiple tissue types, we uncover a relationship between the emergence of enhancers and genome organization as a function of germline DNA replication time. While enhancers are most abundant in euchromatic regions, enhancers emerge almost twice as often in late compared to early germline replicating regions, independent of transposable elements. Using a deep learning sequence model, we demonstrate that new enhancers are enriched for mutations that alter transcription factor (TF) binding. Recently evolved enhancers appear to be mostly neutrally evolving and enriched in eQTLs. They also show more tissue specificity than conserved enhancers, and the TFs that bind to these elements, as inferred by binding sequences, also show increased tissue-specific gene expression. We find a similar relationship with DNA replication time in cancer, suggesting that these observations may be time-invariant principles of genome evolution. Our work underscores that genome organization has a profound impact in shaping mammalian gene regulation.

Abstract:
While a rich set of putative cis -regulatory sequences involved in mouse fetal development have been annotated recently on the basis of chromatin accessibility and histone modification patterns, delineating their role in developmentally regulated gene expression continues to be challenging. To fill this gap, here we mapped chromatin contacts between gene promoters and distal sequences across the genome in seven mouse fetal tissues and across six developmental stages of the forebrain. We identified 248,620 long-range chromatin interactions centered at 14,138 protein-coding genes and characterized their tissue-to-tissue variations and developmental dynamics. Integrative analysis of the interactome with previous epigenome and transcriptome datasets from the same tissues revealed a strong correlation between the chromatin contacts and chromatin state at distal enhancers, as well as gene expression patterns at predicted target genes. We predicted target genes of 15,098 candidate enhancers and used them to annotate target genes of homologous candidate enhancers in the human genome that harbor risk variants of human diseases. We present evidence that schizophrenia and other adult disease risk variants are frequently found in fetal enhancers, providing support for the hypothesis of fetal origins of adult diseases.

Authors: Florian Noack, Silvia Vangelisti, Nora Ditzer, Faye Chong, Mareike Albert, Boyan Bonev
Date: 2023-11-23

Abstract:
Gene expression is regulated by multiple epigenetic mechanisms, which are coordinated in development and disease. However, current multiomics methods are frequently limited to one or two modalities at a time, making it challenging to obtain a comprehensive gene regulatory signature. Here, we describe a method—3D genome, RNA, accessibility and methylation sequencing (3DRAM-seq)—that simultaneously interrogates spatial genome organization, chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation genome-wide and at high resolution. We combine 3DRAM-seq with immunoFACS and RNA sequencing in cortical organoids to map the cell-type-specific regulatory landscape of human neural development across multiple epigenetic layers. Finally, we apply a massively parallel reporter assay to profile cell-type-specific enhancer activity in organoids and to functionally assess the role of key transcription factors for human enhancer activation and function. More broadly, 3DRAM-seq can be used to profile the multimodal epigenetic landscape in rare cell types and different tissues.

Title: Cell type-specific cis -regulatory divergence in gene expression and chromatin accessibility revealed by human-chimpanzee hybrid cells
Authors: Ban Wang, Alexander L. Starr, Hunter B. Fraser
Date: 2023-09-25

Abstract:
Although gene expression divergence has long been postulated to be the primary driver of human evolution, identifying the genes and genetic variants underlying uniquely human traits has proven to be quite challenging. Theory suggests that cell type-specific cis -regulatory variants may fuel evolutionary adaptation due to the specificity of their effects. These variants can precisely tune the expression of a single gene in a single cell type, avoiding the potentially deleterious consequences of trans -acting changes and non-cell type-specific changes that can impact many genes and cell types, respectively. It has recently become possible to quantify human-specific cis -acting regulatory divergence by measuring allele-specific expression in human-chimpanzee hybrid cells—the product of fusing induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells of each species in vitro . However, these cis -regulatory changes have only been explored in a limited number of cell types. Here, we quantify human-chimpanzee cis -regulatory divergence in gene expression and chromatin accessibility across six cell types, enabling the identification of highly cell type-specific cis -regulatory changes. We find that cell type-specific genes and regulatory elements evolve faster than those shared across cell types, suggesting an important role for genes with cell type-specific expression in human evolution. Furthermore, we identify several instances of lineage-specific natural selection that may have played key roles in specific cell types, such as coordinated changes in the cis -regulation of dozens of genes involved in neuronal firing in motor neurons. Finally, using novel metrics and a machine learning model, we identify genetic variants that likely alter chromatin accessibility and transcription factor binding, leading to neuron-specific changes in the expression of the neurodevelopmentally important genes FABP7 and GAD1 . Overall, our results demonstrate that integrative analysis of cis -regulatory divergence in chromatin accessibility and gene expression across cell types is a promising approach to identify the specific genes and genetic variants that make us human.

Abstract:
Gene transcription by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) is under control of promoters and distal regulatory elements known as enhancers. Enhancers are themselves transcribed by Pol II correlating with their activity. How enhancer transcription is regulated and coordinated with transcription at target genes has remained unclear. Here, we developed a high-sensitive native elongating transcript sequencing approach, called HiS-NET-seq, to provide an extended high-resolution view on transcription, especially at lowly transcribed regions such as enhancers. HiS-NET-seq uncovers new transcribed enhancers in human cells. A multi-omics analysis shows that genome-wide enhancer transcription depends on the BET family protein BRD4. Specifically, BRD4 co-localizes to enhancer and promoter-proximal gene regions, and is required for elongation activation at enhancers and their genes. BRD4 keeps a set of enhancers and genes in proximity through long-range contacts. From these studies BRD4 emerges as a general regulator of enhancer transcription that may link transcription at enhancers and genes.

Abstract:
Approximately a quarter of the human genome consists of gene deserts, large regions devoid of genes often located adjacent to developmental genes and thought to contribute to their regulation. However, defining the regulatory functions embedded within these deserts is challenging due to their large size. Here, we explore the cis -regulatory architecture of a gene desert flanking the Shox2 gene, which encodes a transcription factor indispensable for proximal limb, craniofacial, and cardiac pacemaker development. We identify the gene desert as a regulatory hub containing more than 15 distinct enhancers recapitulating anatomical subdomains of Shox2 expression. Ablation of the gene desert leads to embryonic lethality due to Shox2 depletion in the cardiac sinus venosus, caused in part by the loss of a specific distal enhancer. The gene desert is also required for stylopod morphogenesis, mediated via distributed proximal limb enhancers. In summary, our study establishes a multi-layered role of the Shox2 gene desert in orchestrating pleiotropic developmental expression through modular arrangement and coordinated dynamics of tissue-specific enhancers.

Abstract:
Differentiation of multipotent stem cells into mature cells is fundamental for development and homeostasis of mammalian tissues, and requires the coordinated induction of lineage-specific transcriptional programs and cell cycle withdrawal. To understand the underlying regulatory mechanisms of this fundamental process, we investigated how the tissue-specific transcription factors, CEBPA and CEBPE, coordinate cell cycle exit and lineage-specification in vivo during granulocytic differentiation. We demonstrate that CEBPA promotes lineage-specification by launching an enhancer-primed differentiation program and direct activation of CEBPE expression. Subsequently, CEBPE confers promoter-driven cell cycle exit by sequential repression of MYC target gene expression at the G1/S transition and E2F-meditated G2/M gene expression, as well as by the up-regulation of Cdk1/2/4 inhibitors. Following cell cycle exit, CEBPE unleashes the CEBPA-primed differentiation program to generate mature granulocytes. These findings highlight how tissue-specific transcription factors coordinate cell cycle exit with differentiation through the use of distinct gene regulatory elements.

Abstract:
The CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) works together with the cohesin complex to drives the formation of chromatin loops and topologically associating domains, but its role in gene regulation has not been fully defined. Here, we investigated the effects of acute CTCF loss on chromatin architecture and transcriptional programs in mouse embryonic stem cells undergoing differentiation to neural precursor cells. We identified CTCF-dependent enhancer-promoter contacts genome-wide and found that they disproportionally affect genes that are bound by CTCF at promoter and dependent on long-distance enhancers. Disruption of promoter-proximal CTCF binding reduced both long-range enhancer-promoter contacts and transcription, which are restored by artificial tethering of CTCF to the promoter. Promoter-proximal CTCF binding is correlated with transcription of over 2,000 genes, across a diverse set of adult tissues. Taken together, our study shows that CTCF binding to promoters may promote long-distance-enhancer dependent transcription at specific genes in diverse cell types.

Abstract:
Systematic characterization of how  genetic variation modulates gene regulation in a cell type-specific context is essential for understanding complex traits. To address this question, we profile gene expression and chromatin accessibility in cells from healthy retinae of 20 human donors through single-cell multiomics and genomic sequencing. We map eQTL, caQTL, allelic-specific expression, and allelic-specific chromatin accessibility in major retinal cell types. By integrating these results, we identify and characterize regulatory elements and genetic variants effective on gene regulation in individual cell types. The majority of identified sc-eQTLs and sc-caQTLs display cell type-specific effects, while the cis-elements containing genetic variants with cell type-specific effects are often accessible in multiple cell types. Furthermore, the transcription factors whose binding sites are perturbed by genetic variants tend to have higher expression levels in the cell types where the variants exert their effects, compared to the cell types where the variants have no impact. We further validate our findings with high-throughput reporter assays. Lastly, we identify the enriched cell types, candidate causal variants and genes, and cell type-specific regulatory mechanism underlying GWAS loci. Overall, genetic effects on gene regulation are highly context dependent. Our results suggest that cell type-dependent genetic effect is driven by precise modulation of both trans-factor expression and chromatin accessibility of cis-elements. Our findings indicate hierarchical collaboration among transcription factors plays a crucial role in mediating cell type-specific effects of genetic variants on gene regulation.

Title: Independence of chromatin conformation and gene regulation during Drosophila dorsoventral patterning
Authors: Elizabeth Ing-Simmons, Roshan Vaid, Xin Yang Bing, Michael Levine, Mattias Mannervik, Juan M. Vaquerizas
Date: 2021-04-01

Abstract:
The relationship between chromatin organization and gene regulation remains unclear. While disruption of chromatin domains and domain boundaries can lead to misexpression of developmental genes, acute depletion of regulators of genome organization has a relatively small effect on gene expression. It is therefore uncertain whether gene expression and chromatin state drive chromatin organization or whether changes in chromatin organization facilitate cell-type-specific activation of gene expression. Here, using the dorsoventral patterning of the Drosophila melanogaster embryo as a model system, we provide evidence for the independence of chromatin organization and dorsoventral gene expression. We define tissue-specific enhancers and link them to expression patterns using single-cell RNA-seq. Surprisingly, despite tissue-specific chromatin states and gene expression, chromatin organization is largely maintained across tissues. Our results indicate that tissue-specific chromatin conformation is not necessary for tissue-specific gene expression but rather acts as a scaffold facilitating gene expression when enhancers become active.

Date: 2023-05-30

Abstract:
Genetic variation influences both chromatin accessibility, assessed in chromatin accessibility quantitative trait loci (caQTL) studies, and gene expression, assessed in expression QTL (eQTL) studies. Genetic variants can impact either nearby genes (cis-eQTLs) or distal genes (trans-eQTLs). Colocalization between caQTL and eQTL, or cis- and trans-eQTLs suggests that they share causal variants. However, pairwise colocalization between these molecular QTLs does not guarantee a causal relationship. Mediation analysis can be applied to assess the evidence supporting causality versus independence between molecular QTLs. Given that the function of QTLs can be cell-type-specific, we performed mediation analyses to find epigenetic and distal regulatory causal pathways for genes within two major cell types of the developing human cortex, progenitors and neurons. We find that the expression of 168 and 38 genes is mediated by chromatin accessibility in progenitors and neurons, respectively. We also find that the expression of 11 and 12 downstream genes is mediated by upstream genes in progenitors and neurons. Moreover, we discover that a genetic locus associated with inter-individual differences in brain structure shows evidence for mediation of SLC26A7 through chromatin accessibility, identifying molecular mechanisms of a common variant association to a brain trait. In this study, we identify cell-type-specific causal gene regulatory networks whereby the impacts of variants on gene expression were mediated by chromatin accessibility or distal gene expression. Identification of these causal paths will enable identifying and prioritizing actionable regulatory targets perturbing these key processes during neurodevelopment.

Abstract:
Enhancers play a vital role in gene regulation and are critical in mediating the impact of noncoding genetic variants associated with complex traits. Enhancer activity is a cell‐type‐specific process regulated by transcription factors (TFs), epigenetic mechanisms and genetic variants. Despite the strong mechanistic link between TFs and enhancers, we currently lack a framework for jointly analysing them in cell‐type‐specific gene regulatory networks (GRN). Equally important, we lack an unbiased way of assessing the biological significance of inferred GRNs since no complete ground truth exists. To address these gaps, we present GRaNIE (Gene Regulatory Network Inference including Enhancers) and GRaNPA (Gene Regulatory Network Performance Analysis). GRaNIE ( https://git.embl.de/grp‐zaugg/GRaNIE ) builds enhancer‐mediated GRNs based on covariation of chromatin accessibility and RNA‐seq across samples (e.g. individuals), while GRaNPA ( https://git.embl.de/grp‐zaugg/GRaNPA ) assesses the performance of GRNs for predicting cell‐type‐specific differential expression. We demonstrate their power by investigating gene regulatory mechanisms underlying the response of macrophages to infection, cancer and common genetic traits including autoimmune diseases. Finally, our methods identify the TF PURA as a putative regulator of pro‐inflammatory macrophage polarisation.

Abstract:
Over 500 genetic loci have been associated with risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs); however, most loci are located in gene-distal non-coding regions and their target genes are not known. Here, we generated high-resolution promoter capture Hi-C (PCHi-C) maps in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (CMs) to provide a resource for identifying and prioritizing the functional targets of CVD associations. We validate these maps by demonstrating that promoters preferentially contact distal sequences enriched for tissue-specific transcription factor motifs and are enriched for chromatin marks that correlate with dynamic changes in gene expression. Using the CM PCHi-C map, we linked 1999 CVD-associated SNPs to 347 target genes. Remarkably, more than 90% of SNP-target gene interactions did not involve the nearest gene, while 40% of SNPs interacted with at least two genes, demonstrating the importance of considering long-range chromatin interactions when interpreting functional targets of disease loci.

Abstract:
Cell type–specific enhancers are critically important for lineage specification. The mechanisms that determine cell-type specificity of enhancer activity, however, are not fully understood. Most current models for how enhancers function invoke physical proximity between enhancer elements and their target genes. Here, we use an imaging-based approach to examine the spatial relationship of cell type–specific enhancers and their target genes with single-cell resolution. Using high-throughput microscopy, we measure the spatial distance from target promoters to their cell type–specific active and inactive enhancers in individual pancreatic cells derived from distinct lineages. We find increased proximity of all promoter-enhancer pairs relative to non-enhancer pairs separated by similar genomic distances. Strikingly, spatial proximity between enhancers and target genes was unrelated to tissue-specific enhancer activity. Furthermore, promoter-enhancer proximity did not correlate with the expression status of target genes. Our results suggest that promoter-enhancer pairs exist in a distinctive chromatin environment but that genome folding is not a universal driver of cell-type specificity in enhancer function.

Abstract:
During mammalian development, differences in chromatin state coincide with cellular differentiation and reflect changes in the gene regulatory landscape 1 . In the developing brain, cell fate specification and topographic identity are important for defining cell identity 2 and confer selective vulnerabilities to neurodevelopmental disorders 3 . Here, to identify cell-type-specific chromatin accessibility patterns in the developing human brain, we used a single-cell assay for transposase accessibility by sequencing (scATAC-seq) in primary tissue samples from the human forebrain. We applied unbiased analyses to identify genomic loci that undergo extensive cell-type- and brain-region-specific changes in accessibility during neurogenesis, and an integrative analysis to predict cell-type-specific candidate regulatory elements. We found that cerebral organoids recapitulate most putative cell-type-specific enhancer accessibility patterns but lack many cell-type-specific open chromatin regions that are found in vivo. Systematic comparison of chromatin accessibility across brain regions revealed unexpected diversity among neural progenitor cells in the cerebral cortex and implicated retinoic acid signalling in the specification of neuronal lineage identity in the prefrontal cortex. Together, our results reveal the important contribution of chromatin state to the emerging patterns of cell type diversity and cell fate specification and provide a blueprint for evaluating the fidelity and robustness of cerebral organoids as a model for cortical development.

Title: Epigenetics of neural differentiation: Spotlight on enhancers
Authors: Mayela Giacoman-Lozano, César Meléndez-Ramírez, Emmanuel Martinez-Ledesma, Raquel Cuevas-Diaz Duran, Iván Velasco
Date: 2022-10-13

Abstract:
Neural induction, both in vivo and in vitro , includes cellular and molecular changes that result in phenotypic specialization related to specific transcriptional patterns. These changes are achieved through the implementation of complex gene regulatory networks. Furthermore, these regulatory networks are influenced by epigenetic mechanisms that drive cell heterogeneity and cell-type specificity, in a controlled and complex manner. Epigenetic marks, such as DNA methylation and histone residue modifications, are highly dynamic and stage-specific during neurogenesis. Genome-wide assessment of these modifications has allowed the identification of distinct non-coding regulatory regions involved in neural cell differentiation, maturation, and plasticity. Enhancers are short DNA regulatory regions that bind transcription factors (TFs) and interact with gene promoters to increase transcriptional activity. They are of special interest in neuroscience because they are enriched in neurons and underlie the cell-type-specificity and dynamic gene expression profiles. Classification of the full epigenomic landscape of neural subtypes is important to better understand gene regulation in brain health and during diseases. Advances in novel next-generation high-throughput sequencing technologies, genome editing, Genome-wide association studies (GWAS), stem cell differentiation, and brain organoids are allowing researchers to study brain development and neurodegenerative diseases with an unprecedented resolution. Herein, we describe important epigenetic mechanisms related to neurogenesis in mammals. We focus on the potential roles of neural enhancers in neurogenesis, cell-fate commitment, and neuronal plasticity. We review recent findings on epigenetic regulatory mechanisms involved in neurogenesis and discuss how sequence variations within enhancers may be associated with genetic risk for neurological and psychiatric disorders.

Abstract:
Genome-wide association study (GWAS) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are known to preferentially co-locate to active regulatory elements in tissues and cell types relevant to disease aetiology. Further characterisation of associated cell type-specific regulation can broaden our understanding of how GWAS signals may contribute to disease risk. To gain insight into potential functional mechanisms underlying GWAS associations, we developed FORGE2 ( https://forge2.altiusinstitute.org/ ), which is an updated version of the FORGE web tool. FORGE2 uses an expanded atlas of cell type-specific regulatory element annotations, including DNase I hotspots, five histone mark categories and 15 hidden Markov model (HMM) chromatin states, to identify tissue- and cell type-specific signals. An analysis of 3,604 GWAS from the NHGRI-EBI GWAS catalogue yielded at least one significant disease/trait-tissue association for 2,057 GWAS, including > 400 associations specific to epigenomic marks in immune tissues and cell types, > 30 associations specific to heart tissue, and > 60 associations specific to brain tissue, highlighting the key potential of tissue- and cell type-specific regulatory elements. Importantly, we demonstrate that FORGE2 analysis can separate previously observed accessible chromatin enrichments into different chromatin states, such as enhancers or active transcription start sites, providing a greater understanding of underlying regulatory mechanisms. Interestingly, tissue-specific enrichments for repressive chromatin states and histone marks were also detected, suggesting a role for tissue-specific repressed regions in GWAS-mediated disease aetiology. In summary, we demonstrate that FORGE2 has the potential to uncover previously unreported disease-tissue associations and identify new candidate mechanisms. FORGE2 is a transparent, user-friendly web tool for the integrative analysis of loci discovered from GWAS. The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s13059-021-02560-3.

Abstract:
DNA methylation is a fundamental epigenetic mark that governs gene expression and chromatin organization, thus providing a window into cellular identity and developmental processes 1 . Current datasets typically include only a fraction of methylation sites and are often based either on cell lines that underwent massive changes in culture or on tissues containing unspecified mixtures of cells 2 – 5 . Here we describe a human methylome atlas, based on deep whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, allowing fragment-level analysis across thousands of unique markers for 39 cell types sorted from 205 healthy tissue samples. Replicates of the same cell type are more than 99.5% identical, demonstrating the robustness of cell identity programmes to environmental perturbation. Unsupervised clustering of the atlas recapitulates key elements of tissue ontogeny and identifies methylation patterns retained since embryonic development. Loci uniquely unmethylated in an individual cell type often reside in transcriptional enhancers and contain DNA binding sites for tissue-specific transcriptional regulators. Uniquely hypermethylated loci are rare and are enriched for CpG islands, Polycomb targets and CTCF binding sites, suggesting a new role in shaping cell-type-specific chromatin looping. The atlas provides an essential resource for study of gene regulation and disease-associated genetic variants, and a wealth of potential tissue-specific biomarkers for use in liquid biopsies.

Title: Tissue-specific RNA Polymerase II promoter-proximal pause release and burst kinetics in a Drosophila embryonic patterning network
Authors: George Hunt, Roshan Vaid, Sergei Pirogov, Alexander Pfab, Christoph Ziegenhain, Rickard Sandberg, Johan Reimegård, Mattias Mannervik
Date: 2024-01-02

Abstract:
Formation of tissue-specific transcriptional programs underlies multicellular development, including dorsoventral (DV) patterning of the Drosophila embryo. This involves interactions between transcriptional enhancers and promoters in a chromatin context, but how the chromatin landscape influences transcription is not fully understood. Here we comprehensively resolve differential transcriptional and chromatin states during Drosophila DV patterning. We find that RNA Polymerase II pausing is established at DV promoters prior to zygotic genome activation (ZGA), that pausing persists irrespective of cell fate, but that release into productive elongation is tightly regulated and accompanied by tissue-specific P-TEFb recruitment. DV enhancers acquire distinct tissue-specific chromatin states through CBP-mediated histone acetylation that predict the transcriptional output of target genes, whereas promoter states are more tissue-invariant. Transcriptome-wide inference of burst kinetics in different cell types revealed that while DV genes are generally characterized by a high burst size, either burst size or frequency can differ between tissues. The data suggest that pausing is established by pioneer transcription factors prior to ZGA and that release from pausing is imparted by enhancer chromatin state to regulate bursting in a tissue-specific manner in the early embryo. Our results uncover how developmental patterning is orchestrated by tissue-specific bursts of transcription from Pol II primed promoters in response to enhancer regulatory cues.

Title: GATv2EPI: Predicting Enhancer–Promoter Interactions with a Dynamic Graph Attention Network
Authors: Tianjiao Zhang, Xingjie Zhao, Hao Sun, Bo Gao, Xiaoqi Liu
Date: 2024-11-25

Abstract:
Background: The enhancer–promoter interaction (EPI) is a critical component of gene regulatory networks, playing a significant role in understanding the complexity of gene expression. Traditional EPI prediction methods focus on one-to-one interactions, neglecting more complex one-to-many and many-to-many patterns. To address this gap, we utilize graph neural networks to comprehensively explore all interaction patterns between enhancers and promoters, capturing complex regulatory relationships for more accurate predictions. Methods: In this study, we introduce a novel EPI prediction framework, GATv2EPI, based on dynamic graph attention neural networks. GATv2EPI leverages epigenetic information from enhancers, promoters, and their surrounding regions and organizes interactions into a network to comprehensively explore complex EPI regulatory patterns, including one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships. To avoid overfitting and ensure diverse data representation, we implemented a connectivity-based sampling method for dataset partitioning, which constructs graphs for each chromosome and assigns entire connected subgraphs to training or test sets, thereby preventing information leakage and ensuring comprehensive chromosomal representation. Results: In experiments conducted on four cell lines—NHEK, IMR90, HMEC, and K562—GATv2EPI demonstrated superior EPI recognition accuracy compared to existing similar methods, with a training time improvement of 95.29% over TransEPI. Conclusions: GATv2EPI enhances EPI prediction accuracy by capturing complex topological structure information from gene regulatory networks through graph neural networks. Additionally, our results emphasize the importance of epigenetic features surrounding enhancers and promoters in EPI prediction.

Abstract:
Histone lactylation has been recently described as a novel histone post-translational modification linking cellular metabolism to epigenetic regulation. Given the expected relevance of this modification and current limited knowledge of its function, we generate genome-wide datasets of H3K18la distribution in various in vitro and in vivo samples, including mouse embryonic stem cells, macrophages, adipocytes, and mouse and human skeletal muscle. We compare them to profiles of well-established histone modifications and gene expression patterns. Supervised and unsupervised bioinformatics analysis shows that global H3K18la distribution resembles H3K27ac, although we also find notable differences. H3K18la marks active CpG island-containing promoters of highly expressed genes across most tissues assessed, including many housekeeping genes, and positively correlates with H3K27ac and H3K4me3 as well as with gene expression. In addition, H3K18la is enriched at active enhancers that lie in proximity to genes that are functionally important for the respective tissue. Overall, our data suggests that H3K18la is not only a marker for active promoters, but also a mark of tissue specific active enhancers.

Title: Enhancers regulate 3′ end processing activity to control expression of alternative 3′UTR isoforms
Authors: Buki Kwon, Mervin M. Fansler, Neil D. Patel, Jihye Lee, Weirui Ma, Christine Mayr
Date: 2022-05-17

Abstract:
Multi-UTR genes are widely transcribed and express their alternative 3′UTR isoforms in a cell type-specific manner. As transcriptional enhancers regulate mRNA expression, we investigated if they also regulate 3′UTR isoform expression. Endogenous enhancer deletion of the multi-UTR gene PTEN did not impair transcript production but prevented 3′UTR isoform switching which was recapitulated by silencing of an enhancer-bound transcription factor. In reporter assays, enhancers increase transcript production when paired with single-UTR gene promoters. However, when combined with multi-UTR gene promoters, they change 3′UTR isoform expression by increasing 3′ end processing activity of polyadenylation sites. Processing activity of polyadenylation sites is affected by transcription factors, including NF-κB and MYC, transcription elongation factors, chromatin remodelers, and histone acetyltransferases. As endogenous cell type-specific enhancers are associated with genes that increase their short 3′UTRs in a cell type-specific manner, our data suggest that transcriptional enhancers integrate cellular signals to regulate cell type-and condition-specific 3′UTR isoform expression.

Date: 2022-07-11

Abstract:
Epigenomic profiling has enabled large-scale identification of regulatory elements, yet we still lack a systematic mapping from any sequence or variant to regulatory activities. We address this challenge with Sei, a framework for integrating human genetics data with sequence information to discover the regulatory basis of traits and diseases. Sei learns a vocabulary of regulatory activities, called sequence classes, using a deep learning model that predicts 21,907 chromatin profiles across >1,300 cell lines and tissues. Sequence classes provide a global classification and quantification of sequence and variant effects based on diverse regulatory activities, such as cell type-specific enhancer functions. These predictions are supported by tissue-specific expression, expression quantitative trait loci and evolutionary constraint data. Furthermore, sequence classes enable characterization of the tissue-specific, regulatory architecture of complex traits and generate mechanistic hypotheses for individual regulatory pathogenic mutations. We provide Sei as a resource to elucidate the regulatory basis of human health and disease.

Abstract:
Genetic risk for complex traits is strongly enriched in non-coding genomic regions involved in gene regulation, especially enhancers. However, we lack adequate tools to connect the characteristics of these disruptions to genetic risk. Here, we propose RWAS (Regulome Wide Association Study), a new application of the MAGMA software package to identify the characteristics of enhancers that contribute to genetic risk for disease. RWAS involves three steps: (i) assign genotyped SNPs to cell type- or tissue-specific regulatory features (e.g., enhancers); (ii) test associations of each regulatory feature with a trait of interest for which genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics are available; (iii) perform enhancer-set enrichment analyses to identify quantitative or categorical features of regulatory elements that are associated with the trait. These steps are implemented as a novel application of MAGMA, a tool originally developed for gene-based GWAS analyses. Applying RWAS to interrogate genetic risk for schizophrenia, we discovered a class of risk-associated AT-rich enhancers that are active in the developing brain and harbor binding sites for multiple transcription factors with neurodevelopmental functions. RWAS utilizes open-source software, and we provide a comprehensive collection of annotations for tissue-specific enhancer locations and features, including their evolutionary conservation, AT content, and co-localization with binding sites for hundreds of TFs. RWAS will enable researchers to characterize properties of regulatory elements associated with any trait of interest for which GWAS summary statistics are available.

Title: GQ-DNABERT reveals GQ proximal enhancer–promoter interactions associated with tissue-specific transcription
Authors: Dmitry Konovalov, Dmitry Umerenkov, Alan Herbert, Maria Poptsova
Date: 2025-10-28

Abstract:
Alternative DNA conformation formed by sequences called flipons are thought to play an important role in regulating various genomic processes, either repressing or enhancing transcription, chromatin organization, DNA repair, telomere maintenance, RNA splicing, translation, and stress responses. The formation of G-quadruplexes (GQs) has been investigated experimentally using various methodologies with varying degrees of overlap between the results underscoring the need for a gold-standard GQ dataset. With this aim we trained a large language model, GQ-DNABERT using EndoQuad, the most comprehensive human GQ dataset. GQ-DNABERT recalled the training data and predicted de novo GQs in intergenic and intronic regions, enriched for cis -regulatory elements (cCREs) and ATAC-seq peaks. We evaluated the predicted GQ-DNABERT proximal enhancer–promoter (pEP) pairs, using annotations from ENdb, ENCODE, Zoonomia, Chromium multiomics scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq data from normal cells, and cCREs from normal-cancer pairs. We found GQ pEP pairs correlating with gene expression, with some pairings potentially acting as tissue-specific switches. Genes with GQ pEP pairs in cancer cells are enriched in different processes compared to the corresponding normal tissues. Overall, GQ-DNABERT is a valuable tool for extending and harmonizing data collected ex vivo . We demonstrate the usefulness of GQ-DNABERT for investigating transcriptional regulation in single-cell experiments.

Abstract:
Developmental control of gene expression critically depends on distal cis-regulatory elements including enhancers which interact with promoters to activate gene expression. To date no global experiments have been conducted that identify their cell type and cell stage-specific activity within one developmental pathway and in a chromatin context. Here, we describe a high-throughput method that identifies thousands of differentially active cis-elements able to stimulate a minimal promoter at five stages of hematopoietic progenitor development from embryonic stem (ES) cells, which can be adapted to any ES cell derived cell type. We show that blood cell-specific gene expression is controlled by the concerted action of thousands of differentiation stage-specific sets of cis-elements which respond to cytokine signals terminating at signalling responsive transcription factors. Our work provides an important resource for studies of hematopoietic specification and highlights the mechanisms of how and where extrinsic signals program a cell type-specific chromatin landscape driving hematopoietic differentiation.

Title: Predict long-range enhancer regulation based on protein–protein interactions between transcription factors
Authors: Hao Wang, Binbin Huang, Jianrong Wang
Date: 2021-10-11

Abstract:
Long-range regulation by distal enhancers plays critical roles in cell-type specific transcriptional programs. Computational predictions of genome-wide enhancer–promoter interactions are still challenging due to limited accuracy and the lack of knowledge on the molecular mechanisms. Based on recent biological investigations, the protein–protein interactions (PPIs) between transcription factors (TFs) have been found to participate in the regulation of chromatin loops. Therefore, we developed a novel predictive model for cell-type specific enhancer–promoter interactions by leveraging the information of TF PPI signatures. Evaluated by a series of rigorous performance comparisons, the new model achieves superior performance over other methods. The model also identifies specific TF PPIs that may mediate long-range regulatory interactions, revealing new mechanistic understandings of enhancer regulation. The prioritized TF PPIs are associated with genes in distinct biological pathways, and the predicted enhancer–promoter interactions are strongly enriched with cis-eQTLs. Most interestingly, the model discovers enhancer-mediated trans-regulatory links between TFs and genes, which are significantly enriched with trans-eQTLs. The new predictive model, along with the genome-wide analyses, provides a platform to systematically delineate the complex interplay among TFs, enhancers and genes in long-range regulation. The novel predictions also lead to mechanistic interpretations of eQTLs to decode the genetic associations with gene expression.

Abstract:
Enhancer-mediated gene activation generally requires physical proximity between enhancers and their target gene promoters. However, the molecular mechanisms by which interactions between enhancers and promoters are formed are not well understood. Here, we investigate the function of the Mediator complex in the regulation of enhancer-promoter interactions, by combining rapid protein depletion and high-resolution MNase-based chromosome conformation capture approaches. We show that depletion of Mediator leads to reduced enhancer-promoter interaction frequencies, which are associated with a strong decrease in gene expression. In addition, we find increased interactions between CTCF-binding sites upon Mediator depletion. These changes in chromatin architecture are associated with a redistribution of the Cohesin complex on chromatin and a reduction in Cohesin occupancy at enhancers. Together, our results indicate that the Mediator and Cohesin complexes contribute to enhancer-promoter interactions and provide insights into the molecular mechanisms by which communication between enhancers and promoters is regulated.

Abstract:
Although genome wide association studies (GWAS) in large populations have identified hundreds of variants associated with common diseases such as coronary artery disease (CAD), most disease-associated variants lie within non-coding regions of the genome, rendering it difficult to determine the downstream causal gene and cell type. Here, we performed paired single nucleus gene expression and chromatin accessibility profiling from 44 human coronary arteries. To link disease variants to molecular traits, we developed a meta-map of 88 samples and discovered 11,182 single-cell chromatin accessibility quantitative trait loci (caQTLs). Heritability enrichment analysis and disease variant mapping demonstrated that smooth muscle cells (SMCs) harbor the greatest genetic risk for CAD. To capture the continuum of SMC cell states in disease, we used dynamic single cell caQTL modeling for the first time in tissue to uncover QTLs whose effects are modified by cell state and expand our insight into genetic regulation of heterogenous cell populations. Notably, we identified a variant in the COL4A1 / COL4A2 CAD GWAS locus which becomes a caQTL as SMCs de-differentiate by changing a transcription factor binding site for EGR1/2. To unbiasedly prioritize functional candidate genes, we built a genome-wide single cell variant to enhancer to gene (scV2E2G) map for human CAD to link disease variants to causal genes in cell types. Using this approach, we found several hundred genes predicted to be linked to disease variants in different cell types. Next, we performed genome-wide Hi-C in 16 human coronary arteries to build tissue specific maps of chromatin conformation and link disease variants to integrated chromatin hubs and distal target genes. Using this approach, we show that rs4887091 within the ADAMTS7 CAD GWAS locus modulates function of a super chromatin interactome through a change in a CTCF binding site. Finally, we used CRISPR interference to validate a distal gene, AMOTL2 , liked to a CAD GWAS locus. Collectively we provide a disease-agnostic framework to translate human genetic findings to identify pathologic cell states and genes driving disease, producing a comprehensive scV2E2G map with genetic and tissue level convergence for future mechanistic and therapeutic studies.

Abstract:
Existing studies of chromatin conformation have primarily focused on potential enhancers interacting with gene promoters. By contrast, the interactivity of promoters per se, while equally critical to understanding transcriptional control, has been largely unexplored, particularly in a cell type-specific manner for blood lineage cell types. In this study, we leverage promoter capture Hi-C data across a compendium of blood lineage cell types to identify and characterize cell type-specific super-interactive promoters (SIPs). Notably, promoter-interacting regions (PIRs) of SIPs are more likely to overlap with cell type-specific ATAC-seq peaks and GWAS variants for relevant blood cell traits than PIRs of non-SIPs. Moreover, PIRs of cell-type-specific SIPs show enriched heritability of relevant blood cell trait (s), and are more enriched with GWAS variants associated with blood cell traits compared to PIRs of non-SIPs. Further, SIP genes tend to express at a higher level in the corresponding cell type. Importantly, SIP subnetworks incorporating cell-type-specific SIPs and ATAC-seq peaks help interpret GWAS variants. Examples include GWAS variants associated with platelet count near the megakaryocyte SIP gene EPHB3 and variants associated lymphocyte count near the native CD4 T-Cell SIP gene ETS1 . Interestingly, around 25.7% ~ 39.6% blood cell traits GWAS variants residing in SIP PIR regions disrupt transcription factor binding motifs. Importantly, our analysis shows the potential of using promoter-centric analyses of chromatin spatial organization data to identify biologically important genes and their regulatory regions.

Title: Cell-type-specific mapping of enhancers and target genes from single-cell multimodal data
Authors: Chang Su, Dongsoo Lee, Peng Jin, Jingfei Zhang
Date: 2024-09-26

Abstract:
Mapping enhancers and target genes in disease-related cell types has provided critical insights into the functional mechanisms of genetic variants identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, most existing analyses rely on bulk data or cultured cell lines, which may fail to identify cell-type-specific enhancers and target genes. Recently, single-cell multimodal data measuring both gene expression and chromatin accessibility within the same cells have enabled the inference of enhancer-gene pairs in a cell-type-specific and context-specific manner. However, this task is challenged by the data’s high sparsity, sequencing depth variation, and the computational burden of analyzing a large number of enhancer-gene pairs. To address these challenges, we propose scMultiMap, a statistical method that infers enhancer-gene association from sparse multimodal counts using a joint latent-variable model. It adjusts for technical confounding, permits fast moment-based estimation and provides analytically derived p -values. In systematic analyses of blood and brain data, scMultiMap shows appropriate type I error control, high statistical power with greater reproducibility across independent datasets and stronger consistency with orthogonal data modalities. Meanwhile, its computational cost is less than 1% of existing methods. When applied to single-cell multimodal data from postmortem brain samples from Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients and controls, scMultiMap gave the highest heritability enrichment in microglia and revealed new insights into the regulatory mechanisms of AD GWAS variants in microglia.

Title: Temporal inhibition of chromatin looping and enhancer accessibility during neuronal remodeling
Authors: Dahong Chen, Catherine E. McManus, Behram Radmanesh, Leah H. Matzat, Elissa P. Lei
Date: 2021-11-04

Abstract:
During development, looping of an enhancer to a promoter is frequently observed in conjunction with temporal and tissue-specific transcriptional activation. The chromatin insulator-associated protein Alan Shepard (Shep) promotes Drosophila post-mitotic neuronal remodeling by repressing transcription of master developmental regulators, such as brain tumor ( brat ), specifically in maturing neurons. Since insulator proteins can promote looping, we hypothesized that Shep antagonizes brat promoter interaction with an as yet unidentified enhancer. Using chromatin conformation capture and reporter assays, we identified two enhancer regions that increase in looping frequency with the brat promoter specifically in pupal brains after Shep depletion. The brat promoters and enhancers function independently of Shep, ruling out direct repression of these elements. Moreover, ATAC-seq in isolated neurons demonstrates that Shep restricts chromatin accessibility of a key brat enhancer as well as other enhancers genome-wide in remodeling pupal but not larval neurons. These enhancers are enriched for chromatin targets of Shep and are located at Shep-inhibited genes, suggesting direct Shep inhibition of enhancer accessibility and gene expression during neuronal remodeling. Our results provide evidence for temporal regulation of chromatin looping and enhancer accessibility during neuronal maturation.

Abstract:
Tissue-specific gene expression requires coordinated control of gene-proximal and -distal cis -regulatory elements (CREs), yet functional analysis of gene-distal CREs such as enhancers remains challenging. Here we describe CRISPR/dCas9-based enhancer-targeting epigenetic editing systems, enCRISPRa and enCRISPRi, for efficient analysis of enhancer function in situ and in vivo. Using dual effectors capable of re-writing enhancer-associated chromatin modifications, we show that enCRISPRa and enCRISPRi modulate gene transcription by remodeling local epigenetic landscapes at sgRNA-targeted enhancers and associated genes. Comparing with existing methods, the improved systems display more robust perturbations of enhancer activity and gene transcription with minimal off-targets. Allele-specific targeting of enCRISPRa to oncogenic TAL1 super-enhancer modulates TAL1 expression and cancer progression in xenotransplants. Single or multi-loci perturbations of lineage-specific enhancers using an enCRISPRi knock-in mouse establish in vivo evidence for lineage-restricted essentiality of developmental enhancers during hematopoiesis. Hence, enhancer-targeting CRISPR epigenetic editing provides opportunities for interrogating enhancer function in native biological contexts.

Title: CRISPRlnc: a machine learning method for lncRNA-specific single-guide RNA design of CRISPR/Cas9 system
Authors: Zitian Yang, Zexin Zhang, Jing Li, Wen Chen, Changning Liu
Date: 2024-03

Abstract:
CRISPR/Cas9 is a promising RNA-guided genome editing technology, which consists of a Cas9 nuclease and a single-guide RNA (sgRNA). So far, a number of sgRNA prediction softwares have been developed. However, they were usually designed for protein-coding genes without considering that long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) genes may have different characteristics. In this study, we first evaluated the performances of a series of known sgRNA-designing tools in the context of both coding and non-coding datasets. Meanwhile, we analyzed the underpinnings of their varied performances on the sgRNA’s specificity for lncRNA including nucleic acid sequence, genome location and editing mechanism preference. Furthermore, we introduce a support vector machine-based machine learning algorithm named CRISPRlnc, which aims to model both CRISPR knock-out (CRISPRko) and CRISPR inhibition (CRISPRi) mechanisms to predict the on-target activity of targets. CRISPRlnc combined the paired-sgRNA design and off-target analysis to achieve one-stop design of CRISPR/Cas9 sgRNAs for non-coding genes. Performance comparison on multiple datasets showed that CRISPRlnc was far superior to existing methods for both CRISPRko and CRISPRi mechanisms during the lncRNA-specific sgRNA design. To maximize the availability of CRISPRlnc, we developed a web server ( http://predict.crisprlnc.cc ) and made it available for download on GitHub.

Abstract:
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) play a crucial role in intercellular
communication, signaling pathways, and disease pathogenesis by transporting
biomolecules such as DNA, RNA, proteins, and lipids derived from their
cells of origin, and they have demonstrated substantial potential
in clinical applications. Their clinical significance underscores
the need for sensitive methods to fully harness their diagnostic potential.
In this comprehensive review, we explore EV heterogeneity related
to biogenesis, structure, content, origin, sample type, and function
roles; the use of EVs as disease biomarkers; and the evolving landscape
of EV measurement for clinical diagnostics, highlighting the progression
from bulk measurement to single vesicle analysis. This review covers
emerging technologies such as single-particle tracking microscopy,
single-vesicle RNA sequencing, and various nanopore-, nanoplasmonic-,
immuno-digital droplet–, microfluidic-, and nanomaterial-based
techniques. Unlike traditional bulk analysis methods, these methods
contribute uniquely to EV characterization. Techniques like droplet-based
single EV-counting enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), proximity-dependent
barcoding assays, and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy further
enhance our ability to precisely identify biomarkers, detect diseases
earlier, and significantly improve clinical outcomes. These innovations
provide access to intricate molecular details that expand our understanding
of EV composition, with profound diagnostic implications. This review
also examines key research challenges in the field, including the
complexities of sample analysis, technique sensitivity and specificity,
the level of detail provided by analytical methods, and practical
applications, and we identify directions for future research. This
review underscores the value of advanced EV analysis methods, which
contribute to deep insights into EV-mediated pathological diversity
and enhanced clinical diagnostics.

Abstract:
CRISPR/Cas-derived base editor enables precise editing of target sites and has been widely used for basic research and crop genetic improvement. However, the editing efficiency of base editors at different targets varies greatly. Here, we develop a set of highly efficient base editors in cotton plants. GhABE8e, which is fused to conventional nCas9, exhibits 99.9% editing efficiency, compared to GhABE7.10 with 64.9%, and no off-target editing is detected. We further replace nCas9 with dCpf1, which recognizes TTTV PAM sequences, to broaden the range of the target site. To explore the functional divergence of TERMINAL FLOWER 1 (TFL1), we edit the non-coding and coding regions of GhTFL1 with 26 targets to generate a comprehensive allelic population including 300 independent lines in cotton. This allows hidden pleiotropic roles for GhTFL1 to be revealed and allows us to rapidly achieve directed domestication of cotton and create ideotype germplasm with moderate height, shortened fruiting branches, compact plant, and early-flowering. Further, by exploring the molecular mechanism of the GhTFL1 L86P and GhTFL1 K53G+S78G mutations, we find that the GhTFL1 L86P mutation weakens the binding strength of the GhTFL1 to other proteins but does not lead to a complete loss of GhTFL1 function. This strategy provides an important technical platform and genetic information for the study and creation of ideal plant architecture.

Authors: Jason J. Hughes, Benjamin K. Kesler, John E. Adams, Blythe G. Hospelhorn, Gregor Neuert
Date: 2025-08-19

Abstract:
Single-molecule RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (smRNA-FISH) is a widely used method for visualizing and quantifying RNA molecules in cells and tissues at high spatial resolution. The technique relies on fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide probes that hybridize to target RNA. Accurate quantification depends on high probe specificity to ensure fluorescent signals reflect target RNA binding rather than off-target interactions. Numerous factors, including genome sequence complexity, secondary probe structure, hybridization conditions, and gene expression variability across cell types and lines, influence smRNA-FISH probe efficacy. Existing smRNA-FISH probe design tools have limitations, including narrow heuristics, incomplete off-target assessment, and reliance on “trial-and-error approaches. To address these challenges, we developed TrueProbes, a probe design software platform that integrates genome-wide BLAST-based binding analysis with thermodynamic modeling to generate high-specificity probe sets. TrueProbes ranks and selects probes based on predicted binding affinity, target specificity, and structural constraints. It also incorporates a thermodynamic-kinetic simulation model to provide predictive design metrics and optimize probe performance under user-defined conditions. We benchmarked TrueProbes against several widely used smRNA-FISH design tools and found that it consistently outperformed alternatives across multiple computational metrics and experimental validation assays. Probes designed with TrueProbes showed enhanced target selectivity and superior experimental performance.

Title: Mitigating off-target effects in CRISPR/Cas9-mediated in vivo gene editing
Authors: Hua Alexander Han, Jeremy Kah Sheng Pang, Boon-Seng Soh
Date: 2020-03-20

Abstract:
The rapid advancement of genome editing technologies has opened up new possibilities in the field of medicine. Nuclease-based techniques such as the CRISPR/Cas9 system are now used to target genetically linked disorders that were previously hard-to-treat. The CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing approach wields several advantages over its contemporary editing systems, notably in the ease of component design, implementation and the option of multiplex genome editing. While results from the early phase clinical trials have been encouraging, the small patient population recruited into these trials hinders a conclusive assessment on the safety aspects of the CRISPR/Cas9 therapy. Potential safety concerns include the lack of fidelity in the CRISPR/Cas9 system which may lead to unintended DNA modifications at non-targeted gene loci. This review focuses modifications to the CRISPR/Cas9 components that can mitigate off-target effects in in vitro and preclinical models and its translatability to gene therapy in patient populations.

Title: siRNA Features—Automated Machine Learning of 3D Molecular Fingerprints and Structures for Therapeutic Off-Target Data
Authors: Michael Richter, Alem Admasu
Date: 2025-07-16

Abstract:
Chemical modifications are the standard for small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in therapeutic applications, but predicting their off-target effects remains a significant challenge. Current approaches often rely on sequence-based encodings, which fail to fully capture the structural and protein–RNA interaction details critical for off-target prediction. In this study, we developed a framework to generate reproducible structure-based chemical features, incorporating both molecular fingerprints and computationally derived siRNA–hAgo2 complex structures. Using an RNA-Seq off-target study, we generated over 30,000 siRNA–gene data points and systematically compared nine distinct types of feature representation strategies. Among the datasets, the highest predictive performance was achieved by Dataset 3, which used extended connectivity fingerprints (ECFPs) to encode siRNA and mRNA features. An energy-minimized dataset (7R), representing siRNA–hAgo2 structural alignments, was the second-best performer, underscoring the value of incorporating reproducible structural information into feature engineering. Our findings demonstrate that combining detailed structural representations with sequence-based features enables the generation of robust, reproducible chemical features for machine learning models, offering a promising path forward for off-target prediction and siRNA therapeutic design that can be seamlessly extended to include any modification, such as clinically relevant 2′-F or 2′-OMe.

Title: Precise and broad scope genome editing based on high-specificity Cas9 nickases
Authors: Qian Wang, Jin Liu, Josephine M Janssen, Marie Le Bouteiller, Richard L Frock, Manuel A F V Gonçalves
Date: 2021-01-25

Abstract:
RNA-guided nucleases (RGNs) based on CRISPR systems permit installing short and large edits within eukaryotic genomes. However, precise genome editing is often hindered due to nuclease off-target activities and the multiple-copy character of the vast majority of chromosomal sequences. Dual nicking RGNs and high-specificity RGNs both exhibit low off-target activities. Here, we report that high-specificity Cas9 nucleases are convertible into nicking Cas9 D10A variants whose precision is superior to that of the commonly used Cas9 D10A nickase. Dual nicking RGNs based on a selected group of these Cas9 D10A variants can yield gene knockouts and gene knock-ins at frequencies similar to or higher than those achieved by their conventional counterparts. Moreover, high-specificity dual nicking RGNs are capable of distinguishing highly similar sequences by ‘tiptoeing’ over pre-existing single base-pair polymorphisms. Finally, high-specificity RNA-guided nicking complexes generally preserve genomic integrity, as demonstrated by unbiased genome-wide high-throughput sequencing assays. Thus, in addition to substantially enlarging the Cas9 nickase toolkit, we demonstrate the feasibility in expanding the range and precision of DNA knockout and knock-in procedures. The herein introduced tools and multi-tier high-specificity genome editing strategies might be particularly beneficial whenever predictability and/or safety of genetic manipulations are paramount.

Abstract:
Pooled CRISPR-Cas9 screens are a powerful method for functionally characterizing regulatory elements in the non-coding genome, but off-target effects in these experiments have not been systematically evaluated. Here, we investigate Cas9, dCas9, and CRISPRi/a off-target activity in screens for essential regulatory elements. The sgRNAs with the largest effects in genome-scale screens for essential CTCF loop anchors in K562 cells were not single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) that disrupted gene expression near the on-target CTCF anchor. Rather, these sgRNAs had high off-target activity that, while only weakly correlated with absolute off-target site number, could be predicted by the recently developed GuideScan specificity score. Screens conducted in parallel with CRISPRi/a, which do not induce double-stranded DNA breaks, revealed that a distinct set of off-targets also cause strong confounding fitness effects with these epigenome-editing tools. Promisingly, filtering of CRISPRi libraries using GuideScan specificity scores removed these confounded sgRNAs and enabled identification of essential regulatory elements.

Date: 2024-11-29

Abstract:
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) maintain cellular homeostasis by blocking mRNAs by binding with them to fine-tune the expression of genes across numerous biological pathways. The 2024 Nobel Prize in Medicine and Physiology for discovering miRNAs was long overdue. We anticipate a deluge of research work involving miRNAs to repeat the history of prizes awarded for research on other RNAs. Although miRNA therapies are included for several complex diseases, the realization that miRNAs regulate genes and their roles in addressing therapies for hundreds of diseases are expected; but with advancement in drug discovery tools, we anticipate even faster entry of new drugs. To promote this, we provide details of the current science, logic, intellectual property, formulations, and regulatory process with anticipation that many more researchers will introduce novel therapies based on the discussion and advice provided in this paper.

Abstract:
Sparse profiling of CpG methylation in blood by microarrays has identified epigenetic links to common diseases. Here we apply methylC-capture sequencing (MCC-Seq) in a clinical population of ~200 adipose tissue and matched blood samples (N total ~400), providing high-resolution methylation profiling (>1.3 M CpGs) at regulatory elements. We link methylation to cardiometabolic risk through associations to circulating plasma lipid levels and identify lipid-associated CpGs with unique localization patterns in regulatory elements. We show distinct features of tissue-specific versus tissue-independent lipid-linked regulatory regions by contrasting with parallel assessments in ~800 independent adipose tissue and blood samples from the general population. We follow-up on adipose-specific regulatory regions under (1) genetic and (2) epigenetic (environmental) regulation via integrational studies. Overall, the comprehensive sequencing of regulatory element methylomes reveals a rich landscape of functional variants linked genetically as well as epigenetically to plasma lipid traits.

Title: Inference of drug off-target effects on cellular signaling using interactome-based deep learning
Authors: Nikolaos Meimetis, Douglas A. Lauffenburger, Avlant Nilsson
Date: 2024-04-19

Abstract:
Many diseases emerge from dysregulated cellular signaling, and drugs are often designed to target specific signaling proteins. Off-target effects are, however, common and may ultimately result in failed clinical trials. Here we develop a computer model of the cell’s transcriptional response to drugs for improved understanding of their mechanisms of action. The model is based on ensembles of artificial neural networks and simultaneously infers drug-target interactions and their downstream effects on intracellular signaling. With this, it predicts transcription factors’ activities, while recovering known drug-target interactions and inferring many new ones, which we validate with an independent dataset. As a case study, we analyze the effects of the drug Lestaurtinib on downstream signaling. Alongside its intended target, FLT3, the model predicts an inhibition of CDK2 that enhances the downregulation of the cell cycle-critical transcription factor FOXM1. Our approach can therefore enhance our understanding of drug signaling for therapeutic design.

Date: 2025-02-25

Abstract:
DNA nanotechnology leverages the specificity of Watson–Crick base pairing and the inherent attributes of DNA, enabling the exploitation of molecular characteristics, notably self-assembly, in nucleic acids to fabricate novel, controllable nanoscale structures and mechanisms. In the emerging field of DNA nanotechnology, DNA is not only a genetic material, but also a versatile multifunctional polymer, comprising deoxyribonucleotides, and facilitating the construction of precisely dimensioned and precise shaped two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) nanostructures. DNA molecules act as carriers of biological information, with notable advancements in bioimaging, biosensing, showing the profound impact. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated systems (Cas) constitute self-defense mechanisms employed by bacteria and archaea to defend against viral invasion. With the discovery and modification of various functional Cas proteins, coupled with the identification of increasingly designable and programmable CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs), the potential of the CRISPR/Cas system in the field of molecular diagnostics is steadily being realized. Structural DNA nanotechnology provides a customizable and modular platform for accurate positioning of nanoscopic materials, for e.g. , biomedical uses. This addressability has just recently been applied in conjunction with the newly developed gene engineering tools to enable impactful, programmable nanotechnological applications. As of yet, self-assembled DNA nanostructures have been mainly employed to enhance and direct the delivery of CRISPR/Cas, but lately the groundwork has also been laid out for other intriguing and complex functions. These recent advances will be described in this perspective. This review explores biosensing detection methods that combine DNA nanotechnology with CRISPR/Cas systems. These techniques are used in biosensors to detect small molecules such as DNA, RNA, and etc. The combination of 2D and 3D DNA nanostructures with the CRISPR/Cas system holds significant value and great development prospects in the detection of important biomarkers, gene editing, and other biological applications in fields like biosensing.

Abstract:
The past decade has witnessed a rapid evolution in identifying more versatile clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein (Cas) nucleases and their functional variants, as well as in developing precise CRISPR/Cas-derived genome editors. The programmable and robust features of the genome editors provide an effective RNA-guided platform for fundamental life science research and subsequent applications in diverse scenarios, including biomedical innovation and targeted crop improvement. One of the most essential principles is to guide alterations in genomic sequences or genes in the intended manner without undesired off-target impacts, which strongly depends on the efficiency and specificity of single guide RNA ( sgRNA )-directed recognition of targeted DNA sequences. Recent advances in empirical scoring algorithms and machine learning models have facilitated sgRNA design and off-target prediction. In this review, we first briefly introduce the different features of CRISPR/Cas tools that should be taken into consideration to achieve specific purposes. Secondly, we focus on the computer-assisted tools and resources that are widely used in designing sgRNAs and analyzing CRISPR/Cas-induced on- and off-target mutations. Thirdly, we provide insights into the limitations of available computational tools that would help researchers of this field for further optimization. Lastly, we suggest a simple but effective workflow for choosing and applying web-based resources and tools for CRISPR/Cas genome editing .

Abstract:
Base editors (BEs) display diverse applications in a variety of plant species such as Arabidopsis, rice, wheat, maize, soybean, and cotton, where they have been used to mediate precise base pair conversions without the collateral generation of undesirable double-stranded breaks (DSB). Studies of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) underpinning plant traits are still challenging, particularly in polyploidy species where such SNPs are present in multiple copies, and simultaneous modification of all alleles would be required for functional analysis. Allotetraploid cotton has a number of homoeologous gene pairs located in the A and D sub-genomes with considerable SNPs, and it is desirable to develop adenine base editors (ABEs) for efficient and precise A-to-G single-base editing without DSB in such complex genome. We established various ABE vectors based on different engineered adenosine deaminase (TadA) proteins fused to Cas9 variants (dCas9, nCas9), enabling efficient A to G editing up to 64% efficiency on-target sites of the allotetraploid cotton genome. Comprehensive analysis showed that GhABE7.10n exhibited the highest editing efficiency, with the main editing sites specifically located at the position A5 (counting the PAM as positions 21–23). Furthermore, DNA and RNA off-target analysis of cotton plants edited with GhABE7.10n and GhABE7.10d by whole genome and whole-transcriptome sequencing revealed no DNA off-target mutations, while very low-level RNA off-target mutations were detected. A new base editor, namely GhABE7.10dCpf1 (7.10TadA + dCpf1), that recognizes a T-rich PAM, was developed for the first time. Targeted A-to-G substitutions generated a single amino acid change in the cotton phosphatidyl ethanolamine-binding protein ( GhPEBP ), leading to a compact cotton plant architecture, an ideotype for mechanized harvesting of modern cotton production. Our data illustrate the robustness of adenine base editing in plant species with complex genomes, which provides efficient and precise toolkit for cotton functional genomics and precise molecular breeding.

Date: 2021-12-01

Abstract:
Steric-blocking oligonucleotides (SBOs) are short, single-stranded nucleic acids
designed to modulate gene expression by binding to RNA transcripts and blocking
access from cellular machinery such as splicing factors. SBOs have the potential
to bind to near-complementary sites in the transcriptome, causing off-target
effects. In this study, we used RNA-seq to evaluate the off-target differential
splicing events of 81 SBOs and differential expression events of 46 SBOs. Our
results suggest that differential splicing events are predominantly
hybridization driven, whereas differential expression events are more common and
driven by other mechanisms (including spurious experimental variation). We
further evaluated the performance of in silico screens for
off-target splicing events, and found an edit distance cutoff of three to result
in a sensitivity of 14% and false discovery rate (FDR) of 99%. A
machine learning model incorporating splicing predictions substantially improved
the ability to prioritize low edit distance hits, increasing sensitivity from
4% to 26% at a fixed FDR of 90%. Despite these large
improvements in performance, this approach does not detect the majority of
events at an FDR <99%. Our results suggest that in
silico methods are currently of limited use for predicting the
off-target effects of SBOs, and experimental screening by RNA-seq should be the
preferred approach.

Title: Advances in nucleic acid probe-based detection of gene point mutations: a review
Authors: Xuyang Pu, Xueqiang Wu
Date: 2025-09-25

Abstract:
A fundamental characteristic of gene mutations is the permanent alteration of the DNA sequence, including point mutations, deletions, inversions, and translocations. Among these, DNA point mutation detection has consistently remained a central focus of research across multiple disciplines due to its close association with a range of diseases, such as sickle cell anemia and β-thalassemia. However, the typically low abundance of such mutations presents a significant technical challenge. Due to technical limitations in detection sensitivity, increasing research efforts have been directed toward nucleic acid probe-based strategies to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of point mutation identification. This review summarizes the developments in nucleic acid probe-based techniques for detecting gene point mutations, with an emphasis on strategies involving pure nucleic acid probes as well as the synergistic use of enzymes, nucleic acid analogs, and nanotechnology. The principles, advantages, and limitations of the above technologies are also described and summarized. In addition, we also explored the application of AI technology in nucleic acid probes and the potential future challenges.

Title: CRISPR-Powered Liquid Biopsies in Cancer Diagnostics
Authors: Joshua R. Slattery, Noel Ye Naung, Bernd H. Kalinna, Martin Pal
Date: 2025-10-01

Abstract:
Liquid biopsies promise major advantages for cancer screening and diagnosis. By detecting biomarkers in peripheral blood samples, liquid biopsies reduce the need for invasive techniques and provide important genetic information integral to the emerging molecular classification of cancers. Unfortunately, the concentrations of most biomarkers, particularly circulating tumour nucleic acids, are vanishingly small—beyond the sensitivity and specificity of most assays. Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats diagnostics (herein labelled ‘CRISPR-Dx’) use gene editing tools to detect, rather than modify, nucleic acids with extremely high specificity. These tools are commonly combined with isothermal nucleic acid amplification to also achieve sensitivities comparable to high-performance laboratory-based techniques, such as digital PCR. CRISPR assays, however, are inherently well suited to adaptation for point-of-care (POC) use, and unlike antigen-based POC assays, are significantly easier and faster to develop. In this review, we summarise current CRISPR-Dx platforms and their analytical potential for cancer biomarker discovery, with an emphasis on enhancing early diagnosis, disease monitoring, point-of-care testing, and supporting cancer therapy.

Abstract:
Genome editing using the CRISPR/Cas system has revolutionized the field of genetic engineering, offering unprecedented opportunities for therapeutic applications in vivo . Despite the numerous ongoing clinical trials focusing on ex vivo genome editing, recent studies emphasize the therapeutic promise of in vivo gene editing using CRISPR/Cas technology. However, it is worth noting that the complete attainment of the inherent capabilities of in vivo therapy in humans is yet to be accomplished. Before the full realization of in vivo therapeutic potential, it is crucial to achieve enhanced specificity in selectively targeting defective cells while minimizing harm to healthy cells. This review examines emerging studies, focusing on CRISPR/Cas-based pre-clinical and clinical trials for innovative therapeutic approaches for a wide range of diseases. Furthermore, we emphasize targeting cancer-specific sequences target in genes associated with tumors, shedding light on the diverse strategies employed in cancer treatment. We highlight the various challenges associated with in vivo CRISPR/Cas-based cancer therapy and explore their prospective clinical translatability and the strategies employed to overcome these obstacles.

Title: The role of structure in regulatory RNA elements
Authors: Jan-Niklas Tants, Andreas Schlundt
Date: 2024-10-30

Abstract:
Regulatory RNA elements fulfill functions such as translational regulation, control of transcript levels, and regulation of viral genome replication. Trans -acting factors (i.e., RNA-binding proteins) bind the so-called cis elements and confer functionality to the complex. The specificity during protein-RNA complex (RNP) formation often exploits the structural plasticity of RNA. Functional integrity of cis - trans pairs depends on the availability of properly folded RNA elements, and RNA conformational transitions can cause diseases. Knowledge of RNA structure and the conformational space is needed for understanding complex formation and deducing functional effects. However, structure determination of RNAs under in vivo conditions remains challenging. This review provides an overview of structured eukaryotic and viral RNA cis elements and discusses the effect of RNA structural equilibria on RNP formation. We showcase implications of RNA structural changes for diseases, outline strategies for RNA structure-based drug targeting, and summarize the methodological toolbox for deciphering RNA structures.

Authors: Yaxue Hu, Jinghui Zhang, Ke Shen, Wei Shen, Hian Kee Lee, Sheng Tang
Date: 2025-10-17

Abstract:
Molecular logic computing is revolutionizing biosensing by enabling intelligent, programmable detection, moving beyond simple target recognition to advanced molecular-level information processing. By employing biological molecules such as DNA/RNA, proteins/enzymes, or even whole biological cells as building blocks for creating molecular logic toolkits, logic operations have made rapid progress in molecular logic-based biosensing. In this review, we present a comprehensive overview of intelligent molecular logic operation toolkits and their contributions to advancing biosensing technologies. We first outline the design principles of these toolkits, detailing various types of logic gates, including Boolean, combinatorial, and sequential logic, as well as advanced feedback systems, fuzzy logic, and reversible logic. We delve into the construction of DNA-based, synthetic, and nanomaterial-based logical operation toolkits. Following this, we explore the functionalities of intelligent molecular logic computing toolkits, which encompass modular multi-signal integration, activatable lock–key (OFF–ON) reconfigurable control, programmable control, and logic-gated nanomachines. We also elaborate on the analytical mechanisms underpinning molecular logic-gated operations that utilize various detection platforms, including fluorescent, colorimetric, and electrochemical techniques, along with artificial intelligence-powered and smartphone-based detection platforms. Applications spanning genetic analysis, cancer analysis, pathogen identification, living cell logic analysis, and point-of-care diagnostics are highlighted. Finally, the future challenges associated with molecular logic toolkits in enhancing biosensing and potential solutions were outlined, providing insights into practical obstacles as well as future trends and prospects.

Authors: Zilong Wang, Qianqian Wang, Jiaming Zhang, Bingyu Li, Yuke Li, Zhengbo Chen, Dandan Guo, Shuying Feng
Date: 2025-09-26

Abstract:
In the realm of public health, among the primary perils menacing human well‐being, the issue of pathogen infection persists as a significant concern. Precise and timely diagnosis of diseases constitutes the bedrock for effective therapeutic interventions and epidemiological monitoring. Hence, it is crucial to develop quick, sensitive, and highly effective methods for identifying pathogen and their variants. This article reviews the recent research progress in the CRISPR/Cas system for detecting nucleic acids, with an emphasis on CRISPR/Cas9, CRISPR/Cas12, and CRISPR/Cas13. Initially, we provided a concise overview of the nucleic acid detection mechanism utilizing the CRISPR/Cas system. Subsequently, we dissect the molecular mechanisms of CRISPR tools, compare their clinical efficacy against traditional methods, and explore frontier innovations such as amplification‐free detection and AI integration. Ultimately, we argue that CRISPR diagnostics must evolve beyond technical optimization to embrace ecological adaptability, ensuring that precision medicine serves as a bridge‐rather than a barrier‐to global health equity.   Core Mechanism : Explains the molecular basis of CRISPR‐Cas (Cas9, Cas12, Cas13) for nucleic acid detection, leveraging crRNA‐guided targeting and trans‐cleavage activity for ultra‐sensitive (aM level) and specific pathogen identification.

Title: Detection of a G-Quadruplex as a Regulatory Element in Thymidylate synthase for Gene Silencing Using Polypurine Reverse Hoogsteen Hairpins
Authors: Eva Aubets, Alex J. Félix, Miguel Garavís, Laura Reyes, Anna Aviñó, Ramón Eritja, Carlos J. Ciudad, Véronique Noé

Abstract:
Thymidylate synthase (TYMS) enzyme is an anti-cancer target given its role in DNA biosynthesis. TYMS inhibitors (e.g., 5-Fluorouracil) can lead to drug resistance through an autoregulatory mechanism of TYMS that causes its overexpression. Since G-quadruplexes (G4) can modulate gene expression, we searched for putative G4 forming sequences (G4FS) in the TYMS gene that could be targeted using polypurine reverse Hoogsteen hairpins (PPRH). G4 structures in the TYMS gene were detected using the quadruplex forming G-rich sequences mapper and confirmed through spectroscopic approaches such as circular dichroism and NMR using synthetic oligonucleotides. Interactions between G4FS and TYMS protein or G4FS and a PPRH targeting this sequence (HpTYMS-G4-T) were studied by EMSA and thioflavin T staining. We identified a G4FS in the 5’UTR of the TYMS gene in both DNA and RNA capable of interacting with TYMS protein. The PPRH binds to its corresponding target dsDNA, promoting G4 formation. In cancer cells, HpTYMG-G4-T decreased TYMS mRNA and protein levels, leading to cell death, and showed a synergic effect when combined with 5-fluorouracil. These results reveal the presence of a G4 motif in the TYMS gene, probably involved in the autoregulation of TYMS expression, and the therapeutic potential of a PPRH targeted to the G4FS.

Abstract:
The specificity of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing is largely determined by the sequences of guide RNA (gRNA) and the targeted DNA, yet the sequence-dependent rules underlying off-target effects are not fully understood. To systematically explore the sequence determinants governing CRISPR/Cas9 specificity, here we describe a dual-target system to measure the relative cleavage rate between off- and on-target sequences (off-on ratios) of 1902 gRNAs on 13,314 synthetic target sequences, and reveal a set of sequence rules involving 2 factors in off-targeting: 1) a guide-intrinsic mismatch tolerance (GMT) independent of the mismatch context; 2) an “epistasis-like” combinatorial effect of multiple mismatches, which are associated with the free-energy landscape in R-loop formation and are explainable by a multi-state kinetic model. These sequence rules lead to the development of MOFF, a model-based predictor of Cas9-mediated off-target effects. Moreover, the “epistasis-like” combinatorial effect suggests a strategy of allele-specific genome editing using mismatched guides. With the aid of MOFF prediction, this strategy significantly improves the selectivity and expands the application domain of Cas9-based allele-specific editing, as tested in a high-throughput allele-editing screen on 18 cancer hotspot mutations.

Abstract:
Immune‐mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) impose an immeasurable burden on individuals and society. While the conventional use of immunosuppressants and disease‐modifying drugs has provided partial relief and control, their inevitable side effects and limited efficacy cast a shadow over finding a cure. Promising nucleic acid drugs have shown the potential to exert precise effects at the molecular level, with different classes of nucleic acids having regulatory functions through varying mechanisms. For the better delivery of nucleic acids, safe and effective viral vectors and non‐viral delivery systems (including liposomes, polymers, etc.) have been intensively explored. Herein, after describing a range of nucleic acid categories and vectors, we focus on the application of therapeutic nucleic acid delivery in various IMIDs, including rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, asthma, ankylosing spondylitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and uveitis. Molecules implicated in inflammation and immune dysregulation are abnormally expressed in a series of IMIDs, and their meticulous modulation through nucleic acid therapy results in varying degrees of remission and improvement of these diseases. By synthesizing findings centered on specific molecular targets, this review delivers a systematic elucidation and perspective towards advancing and utilization of nucleic acid therapeutics for managing IMIDs.

Title: Efficient activation of hundreds of LTR12C elements reveals cis -regulatory function determined by distinct epigenetic mechanisms
Authors: Hitoshi Ohtani, Minmin Liu, Gangning Liang, H Josh Jang, Peter A Jones
Date: 2024-08-12

Abstract:
Long terminal repeats (LTRs), which often contain promoter and enhancer sequences of intact endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), are known to be co-opted as cis- regulatory elements for fine-tuning host-coding gene expression. Since LTRs are mainly silenced by the deposition of repressive epigenetic marks, substantial activation of LTRs has been found in human cells after treatment with epigenetic inhibitors. Although the LTR12C family makes up the majority of ERVs activated by epigenetic inhibitors, how these epigenetically and transcriptionally activated LTR12C elements can regulate the host-coding gene expression remains unclear due to genome-wide alteration of transcriptional changes after epigenetic inhibitor treatments. Here, we specifically transactivated >600 LTR12C elements by using single guide RNA-based dCas9-SunTag-VP64, a site-specific targeting CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) system, with minimal off-target events. Interestingly, most of the transactivated LTR12C elements acquired the H3K27ac-marked enhancer feature, while only 20% were co-marked with promoter-associated H3K4me3 modifications. The enrichment of the H3K4me3 signal was intricately associated with downstream regions of LTR12C, such as internal regions of intact ERV9 or other types of retrotransposons. Here, we leverage an optimized CRISPRa system to identify two distinct epigenetic signatures that define LTR12C transcriptional activation, which modulate the expression of proximal protein-coding genes.

a promising
advancement in nucleic acid nanotechnology due to their unique structural
properties, high biocompatibility, and multifaceted biomedical applications.
Constructed through a one-pot annealing method, four single-stranded
DNAs self-assemble into stable, three-dimensional tetrahedral nanostructures

the development of biomedical research and clinical applications,
fostering novel therapies and enhancing therapeutic outcomes across
a wide spectrum of diseases. This Perspective thoroughly details the

Abstract:
Regulation of gene expression has recently been complicated by identifying Epromoters, a subset of promoters with enhancer function. Here, we uncovered a dual cis -regulatory element, “ESpromoter,” exhibiting both enhancer and silencer function as a regulator of the nearby genes ATP2B4 and LAX1 in single human T cells. Through an integrative approach, we pinpointed functional rs11240391, a severe malaria-risk variant that escapes detection in genome-wide association studies, challenging conventional strategies for identifying causal variants. CRISPR-modified cells demonstrated the regulatory effect of ESpromoter and rs11240391 on LAX1 expression and T cell activation. Furthermore, our findings revealed an epistatic interaction between ESpromoter SNPs and rs11240391, impacting severe malaria susceptibility by further reducing LAX1 expression. This groundbreaking discovery challenges the conventional enhancer-silencer dichotomy. It highlights the sophistication of transcriptional regulation and argues for an integrated approach combining genetics, epigenetics, and genomics to identify new therapeutic targets for complex diseases.

Date: 2025-10-02

Abstract:
CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats)-Cas (CRISPR-associated) systems, originally identified as prokaryotic adaptive immune mechanisms, have rapidly evolved into powerful tools for molecular diagnostics. Leveraging their precise nucleic acid targeting capabilities, CRISPR diagnostics offer rapid, sensitive, and specific detection solutions for a wide array of targets. This review delves into the fundamental principles of various Cas proteins (e.g., Cas9, Cas12a, Cas13a) and their distinct mechanisms of action (cis- and trans-cleavage). It highlights the diverse applications spanning infectious disease surveillance, cancer biomarker detection, and genetic disorder screening, emphasizing key advantages such as speed, high sensitivity, specificity, portability, and cost-effectiveness, particularly for point-of-care (POC) testing in resource-limited settings. The report also addresses current challenges, including sensitivity limitations without pre-amplification, specificity issues, and complex sample preparation, while exploring promising future trajectories like the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and the development of universal diagnostic platforms to enhance clinical translation.

Abstract:
Neuronal stimulation induced by the brain‐derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) triggers gene expression, which is crucial for neuronal survival, differentiation, synaptic plasticity, memory formation, and neurocognitive health. However, its role in chromatin regulation is unclear. Here, using temporal profiling of chromatin accessibility and transcription in mouse primary cortical neurons upon either BDNF stimulation or depolarization (KCl), we identify features that define BDNF‐specific chromatin‐to‐gene expression programs. Enhancer activation is an early event in the regulatory control of BDNF‐treated neurons, where the bZIP motif‐binding Fos protein pioneered chromatin opening and cooperated with co‐regulatory transcription factors (Homeobox, EGRs, and CTCF) to induce transcription. Deleting cis‐regulatory sequences affect BDNF‐mediated Arc expression, a regulator of synaptic plasticity. BDNF‐induced accessible regions are linked to preferential exon usage by neurodevelopmental disorder‐related genes and the heritability of neuronal complex traits, which were validated in human iPSC‐derived neurons. Thus, we provide a comprehensive view of BDNF‐mediated genome regulatory features using comparative genomic approaches to dissect mammalian neuronal stimulation.

Title: Off-target interactions in the CRISPR-Cas9 Machinery: mechanisms and outcomes
Authors: Lyubov Yu. Kanazhevskaya, Polina V. Zhdanova, Alexander A. Chernonosov, Vladimir V. Koval
Date: 2025-09

Abstract:
The in vivo editing of genetic information necessitates tools of unprecedented accuracy. CRISPR-Cas-based systems have emerged as leading technologies for precisely targeting the genome. The Cas9 endonuclease derived from Streptococcus pyogenes is the most commonly used instrument for targeted DNA cleavage. The development of engineered and chimeric Cas9 variants with enhanced activity and specificity has enabled not only the simple knockout of target genes but also the sophisticated engineering of the epigenome. This advancement has broadened the potential applications of CRISPR-Cas9 technology for the treatment of various disorders characterized by a combination of mutations, deletions, and duplications in the coding and non-coding regions of the genome. The inherent simplicity and predictability of the CRISPR-Cas9 targeting mechanism have led to an explosive growth in the development of prototype gene-editing drugs. However, their therapeutic application is still challenged by potential off-target effects. The erroneous editing of tumor suppressors and oncogenes could lead to adverse outcomes that mitigate the benefits of CRISPR therapy. The evolution of DNA-targeting technologies requires a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underlying CRISPR-Cas9 off-target binding and cleavage. The use of massive libraries of DNA targets and guide RNAs, coupled with high-throughput sequencing, contributes significantly to the analysis of mismatch tolerance. Nevertheless, the detection of ultra-low levels of off-target activity is hindered by the sensitivity limitations of current technologies. This review focuses on the mechanisms responsible for off-target interactions during CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene editing. We discuss the influence of various factors, including nucleotide context, enzyme concentration, guide RNA structure, and the energetics of the RNA–DNA hybrid on mismatch tolerance in vitro and in vivo. Recent advances in the development of technologies for predicting off-target effects are briefly summarized. Particular emphasis is placed on the role of the Cas9 protein structure in the allosteric regulation of the specific and non-specific activity of the Cas9–sgRNA complex.

Abstract:
Motor neurons transduce the motor outputs of nervous system activity to muscle and are the vulnerable neurons in a number of clinically significant degenerative conditions, including spinal muscular atrophy and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. A recent strategy for treating motor neuron degenerative diseases has been to use viruses to introduce genes into motor neurons to inhibit the degenerative process. However, we still lack viral reagents that promote gene expression in motor neurons without potentially toxic off-target expression in other cell types. Our study identifies cis-regulatory elements (CREs) capable of conferring motor neuron-selective transgene expression in a viral context. These findings have important implications for future gene therapeutics for motor neuron-related disorders.

Title: Biomaterial-Based Nucleic Acid Delivery Systems for In Situ Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine
Authors: Qi-Xiang Wu, Natalia De Isla, Lei Zhang
Date: 2025-07-30

Abstract:
Gene therapy is a groundbreaking strategy in regenerative medicine, enabling precise cellular behavior modulation for tissue repair. In situ nucleic acid delivery systems aim to directly deliver nucleic acids to target cells or tissues to realize localized genetic reprogramming and avoid issues like donor cell dependency and immune rejection. The key to success relies on biomaterial-engineered delivery platforms that ensure tissue-specific targeting and efficient intracellular transport. Viral vectors and non-viral carriers are strategically modified to enhance nucleic acid stability and cellular uptake, and integrate them into injectable or 3D-printed scaffolds. These scaffolds not only control nucleic acid release but also mimic native extracellular microenvironments to support stem cell recruitment and tissue regeneration. This review explores three key aspects: the mechanisms of gene editing in tissue repair; advancements in viral and non-viral vector engineering; and innovations in biomaterial scaffolds, including stimuli-responsive hydrogels and 3D-printed matrices. We evaluate scaffold fabrication methodologies, nucleic acid loading–release kinetics, and their biological impacts. Despite progress in spatiotemporal gene delivery control, challenges remain in balancing vector biocompatibility, manufacturing scalability, and long-term safety. Future research should focus on multifunctional “smart” scaffolds with CRISPR-based editing tools, multi-stimuli responsiveness, and patient-specific designs. This work systematically integrates the latest methodological advances, outlines actionable strategies for future investigations and advances clinical translation perspectives beyond the existing literature.

Abstract:
The powerful CRISPR genome editing system is hindered by its off-target effects, and existing computational tools achieved limited performance in genome-wide off-target prediction due to the lack of deep understanding of the CRISPR molecular mechanism. In this study, we propose to incorporate molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in the computational analysis of CRISPR system, and present CRISOT, an integrated tool suite containing four related modules, i.e., CRISOT-FP, CRISOT-Score, CRISOT-Spec, CRISORT-Opti for RNA-DNA molecular interaction fingerprint generation, genome-wide CRISPR off-target prediction, sgRNA specificity evaluation and sgRNA optimization of Cas9 system respectively. Our comprehensive computational and experimental tests reveal that CRISOT outperforms existing tools with extensive in silico validations and proof-of-concept experimental validations. In addition, CRISOT shows potential in accurately predicting off-target effects of the base editors and prime editors, indicating that the derived RNA-DNA molecular interaction fingerprint captures the underlying mechanisms of RNA-DNA interaction among distinct CRISPR systems. Collectively, CRISOT provides an efficient and generalizable framework for genome-wide CRISPR off-target prediction, evaluation and sgRNA optimization for improved targeting specificity in CRISPR genome editing.

Abstract:
Plant science has entered a transformative era as genome editing enables precise DNA modifications to address global challenges such as climate adaptation and food security. These modifications are primarily driven by the integration of three modular components—DNA-targeting modules, effector modules, and control modules—that can be selectively activated or suppressed. The field has evolved from protein-based systems (e.g., zinc finger nucleases and transcription activator-like effector nucleases) to RNA-guided systems (e.g., CRISPR-Cas) that can control both genetic and epigenetic states. Modular pairing of DNA-targeting and effector domains, with or without inducible control, enables precise transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling. The present review examines these three modules and highlights strategies for their optimization. It also outlines innovative tools, such as optogenetic and receptor-integrated systems, that enable spatiotemporal control over genome editor expression. These modular approaches bypass traditional limitations and allow scientists to create plants with desirable traits, decipher complex gene networks, and promote sustainable agriculture.

Title: Spherical nucleic acids-based nanoplatforms for tumor precision medicine and immunotherapy
Authors: Songbin Liu, Cui-Yun Yu, Hua Wei
Date: 2023-10

Abstract:
Precise diagnosis and treatment of tumors currently still face considerable challenges due to the development of highly degreed heterogeneity in the dynamic evolution of tumors. With the rapid development of genomics, personalized diagnosis and treatment using specific genes may be a robust strategy to break through the bottleneck of traditional tumor treatment. Nevertheless, efficient in vivo gene delivery has been frequently hampered by the inherent defects of vectors and various biological barriers. Encouragingly, spherical nucleic acids (SNAs) with good modularity and programmability are excellent candidates capable of addressing traditional gene transfer-associated issues, which enables SNAs a precision nanoplatform with great potential for diverse biomedical applications. In this regard, there have been detailed reviews of SNA in drug delivery, gene regulation, and dermatology treatment. Still, to the best of our knowledge, there is no published systematic review summarizing the use of SNAs in oncology precision medicine and immunotherapy, which are considered new guidelines for oncology treatment. To this end, we summarized the notable advances in SNAs-based precision therapy and immunotherapy for tumors following a classification standard of different types of precise spatiotemporal control on active species by SNAs. Specifically, we focus on the structural diversity and programmability of SNAs. Finally, the challenges and possible solutions were discussed in the concluding remarks. This review will promote the rational design and development of SNAs for tumor-precise medicine and immunotherapy.

Date: 2024-06-21

Abstract:
 Introduction: CRISPR gene editing, while highly efficient in creating desired mutations, also has the potential to cause off-target mutations. This risk is especially high in clonally propagated plants, where editing reagents may remain in the genome for long periods of time or in perpetuity. We studied a diverse population of Populus and Eucalyptus trees that had CRISPR/Cas9-containing transgenes that targeted one or two types of floral development genes, homologs of LEAFY and AGAMOUS .  Methods: Using a targeted sequence approach, we studied approximately 20,000 genomic sites with degenerate sequence homology of up to five base pairs relative to guide RNA (gRNA) target sites. We analyzed those sites in 96 individual tree samples that represented 37 independent insertion events containing one or multiples of six unique gRNAs.  Results: We found low rates of off-target mutations, with rates of 1.2 × 10 −9 in poplar and 3.1 × 10 −10 in eucalypts, respectively, comparable to that expected due to sexual reproduction. The rates of mutation were highly idiosyncratic among sites and not predicted by sequence similarity to the target sites; a subset of two gRNAs showed off-target editing of four unique genomic sites with up to five mismatches relative to the true target sites, reaching fixation in some gene insertion events and clonal ramets. The location of off-target mutations relative to the PAM site were essentially identical to that seen with on-target CRISPR mutations.  Discussion: The low rates observed support many other studies in plants that suggest that the rates of off-target mutagenesis from CRISPR/Cas9 transgenes are negligible; our study extends this conclusion to trees and other long-lived plants where CRISPR/Cas9 transgenes were present in the genome for approximately four years.

Abstract:
Genome- or gene-editing (abbreviated here as ‘GEd’) presents great opportunities for crop improvement. This is especially so for the countries in the Asia-Pacific region, which is home to more than half of the world’s growing population. A brief description of the science of gene-editing is provided with examples of GEd products. For the benefits of GEd technologies to be realized, international policy and regulatory environments must be clarified, otherwise non-tariff trade barriers will result. The status of regulations that relate to GEd crop products in Asian countries and Australasia are described, together with relevant definitions and responsible regulatory bodies. The regulatory landscape is changing rapidly: in some countries, the regulations are clear, in others they are developing, and some countries have yet to develop appropriate policies. There is clearly a need for the harmonization or alignment of GEd regulations in the region: this will promote the path-to-market and enable the benefits of GEd technologies to reach the end-users.

Abstract:
As genome-editing nucleases move toward broader clinical applications, the need to define the limits of their specificity and efficiency increases. A variety of approaches for nuclease cleavage detection have been developed, allowing a full-genome survey of the targeting landscape and the detection of a variety of repair outcomes for nuclease-induced double-strand breaks. Each approach has advantages and disadvantages relating to the means of target-site capture, target enrichment mechanism, cellular environment, false discovery, and validation of bona fide off-target cleavage sites in cells. This review examines the strengths, limitations, and origins of the different classes of off-target cleavage detection systems including anchored primer enrichment (GUIDE-seq), in situ detection (BLISS), in vitro selection libraries (CIRCLE-seq), chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) (DISCOVER-Seq), translocation sequencing (LAM PCR HTGTS), and in vitro genomic DNA digestion (Digenome-seq and SITE-Seq). Emphasis is placed on the specific modifications that give rise to the enhanced performance of contemporary techniques over their predecessors and the comparative performance of techniques for different applications. The clinical relevance of these techniques is discussed in the context of assessing the safety of novel CRISPR/Cas9 HIV-1 curative strategies. With the recent success of HIV-1 and SIV-1 viral suppression in humanized mice and non-human primates, respectively, using CRISPR/Cas9, rigorous exploration of potential off-target effects is of critical importance. Such analyses would benefit from the application of the techniques discussed in this review.

Abstract:
The genome editing approach by clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) is a revolutionary advancement in genetic engineering. Owing to its simple design and powerful genome-editing capability, it offers a promising strategy for the treatment of different infectious, metabolic, and genetic diseases. The crystal structure of Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9) in complex with sgRNA and its target DNA at 2.5 Å resolution reveals a groove accommodating sgRNA:DNA heteroduplex within a bilobate architecture with target recognition (REC) and nuclease (NUC) domains. The presence of a PAM is significantly required for target recognition, R-loop formation, and strand scission. Recently, the spatiotemporal control of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing has been considerably improved by genetic, chemical, and physical regulatory strategies. The use of genetic modifiers anti-CRISPR proteins, cell-specific promoters, and histone acetyl transferases has uplifted the application of CRISPR/Cas9 as a future-generation genome editing tool. In addition, interventions by chemical control, small-molecule activators, oligonucleotide conjugates and bioresponsive delivery carriers have improved its application in other areas of biological fields. Furthermore, the intermediation of physical control by using heat-, light-, magnetism-, and ultrasound-responsive elements attached to this molecular tool has revolutionized genome editing further. These strategies significantly reduce CRISPR/Cas9’s undesirable off-target effects. However, other undesirable effects still offer some challenges for comprehensive clinical translation using this genome-editing approach. In this review, we summarize recent advances in CRISPR/Cas9 structure, mechanistic action, and the role of small-molecule activators, inhibitors, promoters, and physical approaches. Finally, off-target measurement approaches, challenges, future prospects, and clinical applications are discussed.

Abstract:
Current methods can illuminate the genome-wide activity of CRISPR-Cas9 nucleases, but are not easily scalable to the throughput needed to fully understand the principles that govern Cas9 specificity. Here we describe ‘circularization for high-throughput analysis of nuclease genome-wide effects by sequencing’ (CHANGE-seq), a scalable, automatable tagmentation-based method for measuring the genome-wide activity of Cas9 in vitro . We applied CHANGE-seq to 110 sgRNA targets across 13 therapeutically relevant loci in human primary T-cells and identified 201,934 off-target sites, enabling the training of a machine learning model to predict off-target activity. Comparing matched genome-wide off-target, chromatin modification and accessibility, and transcriptional data, we found that cellular off-target activity was two to four times more likely to occur near active promoters, enhancers, and transcribed regions. Finally, CHANGE-seq analysis of 6 targets across 8 individual genomes revealed that human single-nucleotide variation had significant effects on activity at ~15.2% of off-target sites analyzed. CHANGE-seq is a simplified, sensitive, and scalable approach to understanding the specificity of genome editors.

Title: Perspectives on conformationally constrained peptide nucleic acid (PNA): insights into the structural design, properties and applications
Authors: Chaturong Suparpprom, Tirayut Vilaivan
Date: 2022-03-18

Abstract:
Peptide nucleic acid or PNA is a synthetic DNA mimic that contains a sequence of nucleobases attached to a peptide-like backbone derived from N -2-aminoethylglycine. The semi-rigid PNA backbone acts as a scaffold that arranges the nucleobases in a proper orientation and spacing so that they can pair with their complementary bases on another DNA, RNA, or even PNA strand perfectly well through the standard Watson–Crick base-pairing. The electrostatically neutral backbone of PNA contributes to its many unique properties that make PNA an outstanding member of the xeno-nucleic acid family. Not only PNA can recognize its complementary nucleic acid strand with high affinity, but it does so with excellent specificity that surpasses the specificity of natural nucleic acids and their analogs. Nevertheless, there is still room for further improvements of the original PNA in terms of stability and specificity of base-pairing, direction of binding, and selectivity for different types of nucleic acids, among others. This review focuses on attempts towards the rational design of new generation PNAs with superior performance by introducing conformational constraints such as a ring or a chiral substituent in the PNA backbone. A large collection of conformationally rigid PNAs developed during the past three decades are analyzed and compared in terms of molecular design and properties in relation to structural data if available. Applications of selected modified PNA in various areas such as targeting of structured nucleic acid targets, supramolecular scaffold, biosensing and bioimaging, and gene regulation will be highlighted to demonstrate how the conformation constraint can improve the performance of the PNA. Challenges and future of the research in the area of constrained PNA will also be discussed.

Title: Incorporation of bridged nucleic acids into CRISPR RNAs improves Cas9 endonuclease specificity
Authors: Christopher R. Cromwell, Keewon Sung, Jinho Park, Amanda R. Krysler, Juan Jovel, Seong Keun Kim, Basil P. Hubbard
Date: 2018-04-13

Abstract:
Off-target DNA cleavage is a paramount concern when applying CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing technology to functional genetics and human therapeutic applications. Here, we show that incorporation of next-generation bridged nucleic acids (2′,4′-BNA NC [N-Me]) as well as locked nucleic acids (LNA) at specific locations in CRISPR-RNAs (crRNAs) broadly reduces off-target DNA cleavage by Cas9 in vitro and in cells by several orders of magnitude. Using single-molecule FRET experiments we show that BNA NC incorporation slows Cas9 kinetics and improves specificity by inducing a highly dynamic crRNA–DNA duplex for off-target sequences, which shortens dwell time in the cleavage-competent, “zipped” conformation. In addition to describing a robust technique for improving the precision of CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing, this study illuminates an application of synthetic nucleic acids.

Date: 2023-02-01

Abstract:
The nucleic acid therapeutics field has made tremendous progress in the past decades. Continuous advances in chemistry and design have led to many successful clinical applications, eliciting even more interest from researchers including both academic groups and drug development companies. Many preclinical studies in the field focus on improving the delivery of antisense oligonucleotide drugs (ONDs) and/or assessing their efficacy in target tissues, often neglecting the evaluation of toxicity, at least in early phases of development. A series of consensus recommendations regarding regulatory considerations and expectations have been generated by the Oligonucleotide Safety Working Group and the Japanese Research Working Group for the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use S6 and Related Issues (WGS6) in several white papers. However, safety aspects should also be kept in sight in earlier phases while screening and designing OND to avoid subsequent failure in the development phase. Experts and members of the network “DARTER,” a COST Action funded by the Cooperation in Science and Technology of the EU, have utilized their collective experience working with OND, as well as their insights into OND-mediated toxicities, to generate a series of consensus recommendations to assess OND toxicity in early stages of preclinical research. In the past few years, several publications have described predictive assays, which can be used to assess OND-mediated toxicity in vitro or ex vivo to filter out potential toxic candidates before moving to in vivo phases of preclinical development, that is, animal toxicity studies. These assays also have the potential to provide translational insight since they allow a safety evaluation in human in vitro systems. Yet, small preliminary in vivo studies should also be considered to complement this early assessment. In this study, we summarize the state of the art and provide guidelines and recommendations on the different tests available for these early stage preclinical assessments.

Title: Joint single-cell profiling of Cas9 edits and transcriptomes reveals widespread off-target events and effects on gene expression
Authors: Michael H. Lorenzini, Brad Balderson, Karthyayani Sajeev, Aaron J. Ho, Graham McVicker
Date: 2025-08-28

Abstract:
A longstanding barrier in genome engineering with CRISPR-Cas9 has been the inability to measure Cas9 edit outcomes and their functional effects at single-cell resolution. Here we present Superb-seq, a new technology that leverages T7 in situ transcription and single-cell RNA sequencing to jointly measure on- and off-target Cas9 edits and their effects on gene expression. We performed Superb-seq on 10,000 K562 cells, targeting four chromatin remodeler genes with seven guide RNAs. Superb-seq identified 11,891 edit events in 6,230 edited cells at all seven on-target sites and at an additional 36 off-target sites. Although the seven guides were selected for high specificity, six of them caused off-target edits, ranging in frequency from 0.03% to 18.6% of cells. A notable off-target edit within the first intron of USP9X disrupted the expression of this gene and over 150 downstream genes. In summary, Cas9 off-targeting is pervasive due to a combination of rare and common edit events, occurs primarily within introns of off-target genes, and can exert widespread effects on gene expression. Superb-seq uses off-the-shelf kits, standard equipment, and requires no virus, which will enable genome-wide CRISPR screens in diverse cell types as well as functional characterization of clinically-relevant guides.

Title: Current status and trends in small nucleic acid drug development: Leading the future
Authors: Yuxi Miao, Chen Fu, Zhaojin Yu, Lifeng Yu, Yu Tang, Minjie Wei
Date: 2024-09

Abstract:
Small nucleic acid drugs, composed of nucleotides, represent a novel class of pharmaceuticals that differ significantly from conventional small molecule and antibody-based therapeutics. These agents function by selectively targeting specific genes or their corresponding messenger RNAs (mRNAs), further modulating gene expression and regulating translation-related processes. Prominent examples within this category include antisense oligonucleotides (ASO), small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs), and aptamers. The emergence of small nucleic acid drugs as a focal point in contemporary biopharmaceutical research is attributed to their remarkable specificity, facile design, abbreviated development cycles, expansive target spectrum, and prolonged activity. Overcoming challenges such as poor stability, immunogenicity, and permeability issues have been addressed through the integration of chemical modifications and the development of drug delivery systems. This review provides an overview of the current status and prospective trends in small nucleic acid drug development. Commencing with a historical context, we introduce the primary classifications and mechanisms of small nucleic acid drugs. Subsequently, we delve into the advantages of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drugs and mainly discuss the challenges encountered during their development. Apart from researching chemical modification and delivery system that efficiently deliver and enrich small nucleic acid drugs to target tissues, promoting endosomal escape is a critical scientific question and important research direction in siRNA drug development. Future directions in this field will prioritize addressing these challenges to facilitate the clinical transformation of small nucleic acid drugs.

Abstract:
Since most variants that impact polygenic disease phenotypes localize to non-coding genomic regions, understanding the consequences of regulatory element variants will advance understanding of human disease mechanisms. Here, we report that the systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) risk variant rs2431697 as likely causal for SLE through disruption of a regulatory element, modulating miR-146a expression. Using epigenomic analysis, genome-editing and 3D chromatin structure analysis, we show that rs2431697 tags a cell-type dependent distal enhancer specific for miR-146a that physically interacts with the miR-146a promoter. NF-kB binds the disease protective allele in a sequence-specific manner, increasing expression of this immunoregulatory microRNA. Finally, CRISPR activation-based modulation of this enhancer in the PBMCs of SLE patients attenuates type I interferon pathway activation by increasing miR-146a expression. Our work provides a strategy to define non-coding RNA functional regulatory elements using disease-associated variants and provides mechanistic links between autoimmune disease risk genetic variation and disease etiology.

Abstract:
Preclinical mechanistic studies have pointed towards RNA interference-mediated off-target effects as a major driver of hepatotoxicity for GalNAc–siRNA conjugates. Here, we demonstrate that a single glycol nucleic acid or 2′–5′-RNA modification can substantially reduce small interfering RNA (siRNA) seed-mediated binding to off-target transcripts while maintaining on-target activity. In siRNAs with established hepatotoxicity driven by off-target effects, these novel designs with seed-pairing destabilization, termed enhanced stabilization chemistry plus (ESC+), demonstrated a substantially improved therapeutic window in rats. In contrast, siRNAs thermally destabilized to a similar extent by the incorporation of multiple DNA nucleotides in the seed region showed little to no improvement in rat safety suggesting that factors in addition to global thermodynamics play a role in off-target mitigation. We utilized the ESC+ strategy to improve the safety of ALN-HBV, which exhibited dose-dependent, transient and asymptomatic alanine aminotransferase elevations in healthy volunteers. The redesigned ALN-HBV02 (VIR-2218) showed improved specificity with comparable on-target activity and the program was reintroduced into clinical development.

Abstract:
Given the pleiotropic nature of coding sequences and that many loci exhibit multiple disease associations, it is within non-coding sequence that disease-specificity likely exists. Here, we focus on joint disorders, finding among replicated loci, that GDF5 exhibits over twenty distinct associations, and we identify causal variants for two of its strongest associations, hip dysplasia and knee osteoarthritis. By mapping regulatory regions in joint chondrocytes, we pinpoint two variants (rs4911178; rs6060369), on the same risk haplotype, which reside in anatomical site-specific enhancers. We show that both variants have clinical relevance, impacting disease by altering morphology. By modeling each variant in humanized mice, we observe joint-specific response, correlating with GDF5 expression. Thus, we uncouple separate regulatory variants on a common risk haplotype that cause joint-specific disease. By broadening our perspective, we finally find that patterns of modularity at GDF5 are also found at over three-quarters of loci with multiple GWAS disease associations.

Abstract:
Viral latency of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) has become a major hurdle to a cure in the highly effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) era. The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 system has successfully been demonstrated to excise or inactivate integrated HIV-1 provirus from infected cells by targeting the long terminal repeat (LTR) region. However, the guide RNAs (gRNAs) have classically avoided transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) that are readily observed and known to be important in human promoters. Although conventionally thought unfavorable due to potential impact on human promoters, our computational pipeline identified gRNA sequences that were predicted to inactivate HIV-1 transcription by targeting the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) binding sites (gNFKB0, gNFKB1) with a high safety profile (lack of predicted or observed human edits) and broad-spectrum activity (predicted coverage of known viral sequences). Genome-wide, unbiased identification of double strand breaks (DSBs) enabled by sequencing (GUIDE-seq) showed that the gRNAs targeting NF-κB binding sites had no detectable CRISPR-induced off-target edits in HeLa cells. 5′ LTR-driven HIV-1 transcription was significantly reduced in three HIV-1 reporter cell lines. These results demonstrate a working model to specifically target well-known TFBSs in the HIV-1 LTR that are readily observed in human promoters to reduce HIV-1 transcription with a high-level safety profile and broad-spectrum activity.

Date: 2019-06-13

Abstract:
CRISPR-Cpf1 has recently been reported as another RNA-guided endonuclease of class 2 CRISPR-Cas system, which expands the molecular biology toolkit for genome editing. However, most of the online tools and applications to date have been developed primarily for the Cas9. There are a limited number of tools available for the Cpf1. We present DeepCpf1, a deep convolution neural networks (CNN) approach to predict Cpf1 guide RNAs on-target activity and off-target effects using their matched and mismatched DNA sequences. Trained on published data sets, DeepCpf1 is superior to other machine learning algorithms and reliably predicts the most efficient and less off-target effects guide RNAs for a given gene. Combined with a permutation importance analysis, the key features of guide RNA sequences are identified, which determine the activity and specificity of genome editing. DeepCpf1 can significantly improve the accuracy of Cpf1-based genome editing and facilitates the generation of optimized guide RNAs libraries. The online version of this article (10.1186/s12859-019-2939-6) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.

Authors: Hara Kang, Yun Ji Ga, Soo Hyun Kim, Young Hoon Cho, Jung Won Kim, Chaeyeon Kim, Jung-Yong Yeh
Date: 2023-10-16

Abstract:
RNA has emerged as a revolutionary and important tool in the battle against emerging infectious diseases, with roles extending beyond its applications in vaccines, in which it is used in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Since their development in the 1990s, RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutics have demonstrated potential in reducing the expression of disease-associated genes. Nucleic acid‐based therapeutics, including RNAi therapies, that degrade viral genomes and rapidly adapt to viral mutations, have emerged as alternative treatments. RNAi is a robust technique frequently employed to selectively suppress gene expression in a sequence-specific manner. The swift adaptability of nucleic acid‐based therapeutics such as RNAi therapies endows them with a significant advantage over other antiviral medications. For example, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are produced on the basis of sequence complementarity to target and degrade viral RNA, a novel approach to combat viral infections. The precision of siRNAs in targeting and degrading viral RNA has led to the development of siRNA-based treatments for diverse diseases. However, despite the promising therapeutic benefits of siRNAs, several problems, including impaired long-term protein expression, siRNA instability, off-target effects, immunological responses, and drug resistance, have been considerable obstacles to the use of siRNA-based antiviral therapies. This review provides an encompassing summary of the siRNA-based therapeutic approaches against viruses while also addressing the obstacles that need to be overcome for their effective application. Furthermore, we present potential solutions to mitigate major challenges.

Title: Hybridization-mediated off-target effects of splice-switching antisense oligonucleotides
Authors: Juergen Scharner, Wai Kit Ma, Qian Zhang, Kuan-Ting Lin, Frank Rigo, C Frank Bennett, Adrian R Krainer
Date: 2020-01-24

Abstract:
Splice-switching antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), which bind specific RNA-target sequences and modulate pre-mRNA splicing by sterically blocking the binding of splicing factors to the pre-mRNA, are a promising therapeutic modality to treat a range of genetic diseases. ASOs are typically 15–25 nt long and considered to be highly specific towards their intended target sequence, typically elements that control exon definition and/or splice-site recognition. However, whether or not splice-modulating ASOs also induce hybridization-dependent mis-splicing of unintended targets has not been systematically studied. Here, we tested the in vitro effects of splice-modulating ASOs on 108 potential off-targets predicted on the basis of sequence complementarity, and identified 17 mis-splicing events for one of the ASOs tested. Based on analysis of data from two overlapping ASO sequences, we conclude that off-target effects are difficult to predict, and the choice of ASO chemistry influences the extent of off-target activity. The off-target events caused by the uniformly modified ASOs tested in this study were significantly reduced with mixed-chemistry ASOs of the same sequence. Furthermore, using shorter ASOs, combining two ASOs, and delivering ASOs by free uptake also reduced off-target activity. Finally, ASOs with strategically placed mismatches can be used to reduce unwanted off-target splicing events.

Abstract:
Derived from the bacterial immune system, CRISPR/Cas9 induces DSBs at specific DNA sequences, which are repaired by the cell's endogenous mechanisms, leading to gene insertions, deletions, or substitutions. Despite its transformative potential, several challenges remain in optimizing of CRISPR/Cas systems, including off‐target effects, delivery methods, PAM restrictions, and the limitations of traditional editing approaches. This review focuses on the interplay between these challenges and their contributions to gene editing precision, specificity, accessibility, flexibility, and safety. How reducing off‐target effects enhances specificity and safety is explored, while discussing the role of HDR‐based editing in achieving precise gene modifications, alongside alternative methods such as base editing and prime editing. Improved delivery mechanisms are examined for their impact on accessibility and efficiency, while the reduction of PAM restrictions is highlighted for its contributions to flexibility. Lastly, emerging cleavage‐free editing technologies are evaluated as they relate to safety and accessibility. This focused review aims to clarify the connections among these aspects and outline future research directions for advancing CRISPR‐based applications.

Abstract:
Targeted nucleases, primarily CRISPR-Cas-based systems, have revolutionized genome editing by enabling precise modification of target genes or transcripts. Many pre-clinical and clinical studies leverage this technology to develop treatments for human diseases; however, substantial off-target genotoxicity concerns delay its clinical translation. Despite the development of a wide array of tools, assays, and technologies aimed at identifying and quantifying off-target effects, the absence of standardized guidelines leads to inconsistent practices across studies. This review highlights the key challenges and potential solutions in ensuring the safety of gene editing studies for therapeutic applications, focusing on gRNA design, off-target sites prediction, and off-target activity measurement.

Title: Specificity of oligonucleotide gene therapy (OGT) agents

Abstract:
Oligonucleotide gene therapy (OGT) agents (e. g. antisense, deoxyribozymes, siRNA and CRISPR/Cas) are promising therapeutic tools. Despite extensive efforts, only few OGT drugs have been approved for clinical use. Besides the problem of efficient delivery to targeted cells, hybridization specificity is a potential limitation of OGT agents. To ensure tight binding, a typical OGT agent hybridizes to the stretch of 15-25 nucleotides of a unique targeted sequence. However, hybrids of such lengths tolerate one or more mismatches under physiological conditions, the problem known as the affinity/specificity dilemma. Here, we assess the scale of this problem by analyzing OGT hybridization-dependent off-target effects (HD OTE) in vitro , in animal models and clinical studies. All OGT agents except deoxyribozymes exhibit HD OTE in vitro , with most thorough evidence of poor specificity reported for siRNA and CRISPR/Cas9. Notably, siRNA suppress non-targeted genes due to (1) the partial complementarity to mRNA 3'-untranslated regions (3'-UTR), and (2) the antisense activity of the sense strand. CRISPR/Cas9 system can cause hundreds of non-intended dsDNA breaks due to low specificity of the guide RNA, which can limit therapeutic applications of CRISPR/Cas9 by ex-vivo formats. Contribution of this effects to the observed in vivo toxicity of OGT agents is unclear and requires further investigation. Locked or peptide nucleic acids improve OGT nuclease resistance but not specificity. Approaches that use RNA marker dependent (conditional) activation of OGT agents may improve specificity but require additional validation in cell culture and in vivo .

Title: Increasing the specificity of CRISPR systems with engineered RNA secondary structures
Authors: D. Dewran Kocak, Eric A. Josephs, Vidit Bhandarkar, Shaunak S. Adkar, Jennifer B. Kwon, Charles A. Gersbach
Date: 2019-04-15

Abstract:
CRISPR systems have been broadly adopted for basic science, biotechnology, and gene and cell therapy. In some cases, these bacterial nucleases have demonstrated off-target activity. This creates a potential hazard for therapeutic applications and could confound results in biological research. Therefore, improving the precision of these nucleases is of broad interest. Here we show that engineering a hairpin secondary structure onto the spacer region of single guide RNAs (hp-sgRNAs) can increase specificity by several orders of magnitude when combined with various CRISPR effectors. We first demonstrate that designed hp-sgRNAs can tune the activity of a transactivator based on Cas9 from S. pyogenes (SpCas9). We then show that hp-sgRNAs increase the specificity of gene editing using five different Cas9 or Cas12a variants. Our results demonstrate that RNA secondary structure is a fundamental parameter that can tune the activity of diverse CRISPR systems.

Abstract:
Aberrations in the capacity of DNA/chromatin modifiers and transcription factors to bind non-coding regions can lead to changes in gene regulation and impact disease phenotypes. However, identifying distal regulatory elements and connecting them with their target genes remains challenging. Here, we present MethNet, a pipeline that integrates large-scale DNA methylation and gene expression data across multiple cancers, to uncover cis regulatory elements (CREs) in a 1 Mb region around every promoter in the genome. MethNet identifies clusters of highly ranked CREs, referred to as ‘hubs’, which contribute to the regulation of multiple genes and significantly affect patient survival. Promoter-capture Hi-C confirmed that highly ranked associations involve physical interactions between CREs and their gene targets, and CRISPR interference based single-cell RNA Perturb-seq validated the functional impact of CREs. Thus, MethNet-identified CREs represent a valuable resource for unraveling complex mechanisms underlying gene expression, and for prioritizing the verification of predicted non-coding disease hotspots.

Title: Prediction of off-target specificity and cell-specific fitness of CRISPR-Cas System using attention boosted deep learning and network-based gene feature
Authors: Qiao Liu, Di He, Lei Xie
Date: 2019-10-28

Abstract:
CRISPR-Cas is a powerful genome editing technology and has a great potential for in vivo gene therapy. Successful translational application of CRISPR-Cas to biomedicine still faces many safety concerns, including off-target side effect, cell fitness problem after CRISPR-Cas treatment, and on-target genome editing side effect in undesired tissues. To solve these issues, it is needed to design sgRNA with high cell-specific efficacy and specificity. Existing single-guide RNA (sgRNA) design tools mainly depend on a sgRNA sequence and the local information of the targeted genome, thus are not sufficient to account for the difference in the cellular response of the same gene in different cell types. To incorporate cell-specific information into the sgRNA design, we develop novel interpretable machine learning models, which integrate features learned from advanced transformer-based deep neural network with cell-specific gene property derived from biological network and gene expression profile, for the prediction of CRISPR-Cas9 and CRISPR-Cas12a efficacy and specificity. In benchmark studies, our models significantly outperform state-of-the-art algorithms. Furthermore, we find that the network-based gene property is critical for the prediction of cell-specific post-treatment cellular response. Our results suggest that the design of efficient and safe CRISPR-Cas needs to consider cell-specific information of genes. Our findings may bolster developing more accurate predictive models of CRISPR-Cas across a broad spectrum of biological conditions as well as provide new insight into developing efficient and safe CRISPR-based gene therapy.

Abstract:
The European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST) is an intergovernmental organization dedicated to funding and coordinating scientific and technological research in Europe, fostering collaboration among researchers and institutions across countries. Recently, COST Action funded the "Genome Editing to treat Human Diseases" (GenE-HumDi) network, uniting various stakeholders such as pharmaceutical companies, academic institutions, regulatory agencies, biotech firms, and patient advocacy groups. GenE-HumDi’s primary objective is to expedite the application of genome editing for therapeutic purposes in treating human diseases. To achieve this goal, GenE-HumDi is organized in several working groups, each focusing on specific aspects. These groups aim to enhance genome editing technologies, assess delivery systems, address safety concerns, promote clinical translation, and develop regulatory guidelines. The network seeks to establish standard procedures and guidelines for these areas to standardize scientific practices and facilitate knowledge sharing. Furthermore, GenE-HumDi aims to communicate its findings to the public in accessible yet rigorous language, emphasizing genome editing’s potential to revolutionize the treatment of many human diseases. The inaugural GenE-HumDi meeting, held in Granada, Spain, in March 2023, featured presentations from experts in the field, discussing recent breakthroughs in delivery methods, safety measures, clinical translation, and regulatory aspects related to gene editing.

Title: CRISPR/Cas13 effectors have differing extents of off-target effects that limit their utility in eukaryotic cells
Authors: Yuxi Ai, Dongming Liang, Jeremy E Wilusz
Date: 2022-06-24

Abstract:
CRISPR/Cas13 effectors have garnered increasing attention as easily customizable tools for detecting and depleting RNAs of interest. Near perfect complementarity between a target RNA and the Cas13-associated guide RNA is required for activation of Cas13 ribonuclease activity. Nonetheless, the specificity of Cas13 effectors in eukaryotic cells has been debated as the Cas13 nuclease domains can be exposed on the enzyme surface, providing the potential for promiscuous cleavage of nearby RNAs (so-called collateral damage). Here, using co-transfection assays in Drosophila and human cells, we found that the off-target effects of RxCas13d, a commonly used Cas13 effector, can be as strong as the level of on-target RNA knockdown. The extent of off-target effects is positively correlated with target RNA expression levels, and collateral damage can be observed even after reducing RxCas13d/guide RNA levels. The PspCas13b effector showed improved specificity and, unlike RxCas13d, can be used to deplete a Drosophila circular RNA without affecting the expression of the associated linear RNA. PspCas13b nonetheless still can have off-target effects and we notably found that the extent of off-target effects for Cas13 effectors differs depending on the cell type and target RNA examined. In total, these results highlight the need for caution when designing and interpreting Cas13-based knockdown experiments.

Authors: Jia‐Mei Li, Jie Huang, Yan Liao, Ting Hu, Chang‐Li Wang, Wang‐Zheqi Zhang, Chen‐Wei Huang
Date: 2025-10-13

Abstract:
Gene editing and RNA editing technologies are advancing modern medicine by enabling precise manipulation of genetic information at the DNA and RNA levels, respectively. The third‐generation gene editing tools, particularly Clustered regularly interspaced shortpalindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR‐associated (Cas) system, have transformed genetic disease treatment with high efficiency, precision, and cost effectiveness, while RNA editing, via adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) enzymes and CRISPR–Cas13, offers reversible regulation to avoid genomic integration risks. Despite advancements, challenges persist in delivery efficiency, tissue specificity, and long‐term safety, limiting their clinical translation. This review systematically discusses the molecular mechanisms and technological evolution of these tools, focusing on their promising applications in treating nervous system disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's, Parkinson's), immune diseases (e.g., severe combined immunodeficiency, lupus), and cancers. It compares their technical attributes, analyzes ethical and regulatory issues, and highlights synergies between the two technologies. By bridging basic research and clinical translation, this review provides critical insights for advancing precision medicine, reshaping disease diagnosis, prevention, and treatment paradigms.

Title: Stable bulged G-quadruplexes in the human genome: identification, experimental validation and functionalization
Authors: Csaba Papp, Vineeth T Mukundan, Piroon Jenjaroenpun, Fernaldo Richtia Winnerdy, Ghim Siong Ow, Anh Tuân Phan, Vladimir A Kuznetsov

Abstract:
DNA sequence composition determines the topology and stability of G-quadruplexes (G4s). Bulged G-quadruplex structures (G4-Bs) are a subset of G4s characterized by 3D conformations with bulges. Current search algorithms fail to capture stable G4-B, making their genome-wide study infeasible. Here, we introduced a large family of computationally defined and experimentally verified potential G4-B forming sequences (pG4-BS). We found 478 263 pG4-BS regions that do not overlap ‘canonical’ G4-forming sequences in the human genome and are preferentially localized in transcription regulatory regions including R-loops and open chromatin. Over 90% of protein-coding genes contain pG4-BS in their promoter or gene body. We observed generally higher pG4-BS content in R-loops and their flanks, longer genes that are associated with brain tissue, immune and developmental processes. Also, the presence of pG4-BS on both template and non-template strands in promoters is associated with oncogenesis, cardiovascular disease and stemness. Our G4-BS models predicted G4-forming ability in vitro with 91.5% accuracy. Analysis of G4-seq and CUT&Tag data strongly supports the existence of G4-BS conformations genome-wide. We reconstructed a novel G4-B 3D structure located in the E2F8 promoter. This study defines a large family of G4-like sequences, offering new insights into the essential biological functions and potential future therapeutic uses of G4-B.

Abstract:
p47 phox -deficient chronic granulomatous disease (p47-CGD) is a primary immunodeficiency caused by mutations in the neutrophil cytosolic factor 1 ( NCF1 ) gene, resulting in defective NADPH oxidase function in phagocytes. Due to its complex genomic context, the NCF1 locus is not suited for safe gene editing with current genome editing technologies. Therefore, we developed a targeted NCF1 coding sequence knock-in by CRISPR-Cas9 ribonucleoprotein and viral vector template delivery, to restore p47 phox expression under the control of the endogenous NCF2 locus. NCF2 encodes for p67 phox , an NADPH oxidase subunit that closely interacts with p47 phox and is predominantly expressed in myeloid cells. This approach restored p47 phox expression and NADPH oxidase function in p47-CGD patient hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) and in p47 phox -deficient mouse HSPCs, with the transgene expression following a myeloid differentiation pattern. Adeno-associated viral vectors performed favorably over integration-deficient lentiviral vectors for template delivery, with fewer off-target integrations and higher correction efficacy in HSPCs. Such myeloid-directed gene editing is promising for clinical CGD gene therapy, as it leads to the co-expression of p47 phox and p67 phox , ensuring spatiotemporal and near-physiological transgene expression in myeloid cells.

Authors: Adam J Bogdanove, Andrew Bohm, Jeffrey C Miller, Richard D Morgan, Barry L Stoddard
Date: 2018-06-01

Abstract:
Protein engineering is used to generate novel protein folds and assemblages, to impart new properties and functions onto existing proteins, and to enhance our understanding of principles that govern protein structure. While such approaches can be employed to reprogram protein–protein interactions, modifying protein–DNA interactions is more difficult. This may be related to the structural features of protein–DNA interfaces, which display more charged groups, directional hydrogen bonds, ordered solvent molecules and counterions than comparable protein interfaces. Nevertheless, progress has been made in the redesign of protein–DNA specificity, much of it driven by the development of engineered enzymes for genome modification. Here, we summarize the creation of novel DNA specificities for zinc finger proteins, meganucleases, TAL effectors, recombinases and restriction endonucleases. The ease of re-engineering each system is related both to the modularity of the protein and the extent to which the proteins have evolved to be capable of readily modifying their recognition specificities in response to natural selection. The development of engineered DNA binding proteins that display an ideal combination of activity, specificity, deliverability, and outcomes is not a fully solved problem, however each of the current platforms offers unique advantages, offset by behaviors and properties requiring further study and development.

Title: Trials and Tribulations of MicroRNA Therapeutics
Authors: Attila A. Seyhan
Date: 2024-01-25

Abstract:
The discovery of the link between microRNAs (miRNAs) and a myriad of human diseases, particularly various cancer types, has generated significant interest in exploring their potential as a novel class of drugs. This has led to substantial investments in interdisciplinary research fields such as biology, chemistry, and medical science for the development of miRNA-based therapies. Furthermore, the recent global success of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines against the COVID-19 pandemic has further revitalized interest in RNA-based immunotherapies, including miRNA-based approaches to cancer treatment. Consequently, RNA therapeutics have emerged as highly adaptable and modular options for cancer therapy. Moreover, advancements in RNA chemistry and delivery methods have been pivotal in shaping the landscape of RNA-based immunotherapy, including miRNA-based approaches. Consequently, the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry has witnessed a resurgence of interest in incorporating RNA-based immunotherapies and miRNA therapeutics into their development programs. Despite substantial progress in preclinical research, the field of miRNA-based therapeutics remains in its early stages, with only a few progressing to clinical development, none reaching phase III clinical trials or being approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and several facing termination due to toxicity issues. These setbacks highlight existing challenges that must be addressed for the broad clinical application of miRNA-based therapeutics. Key challenges include establishing miRNA sensitivity, specificity, and selectivity towards their intended targets, mitigating immunogenic reactions and off-target effects, developing enhanced methods for targeted delivery, and determining optimal dosing for therapeutic efficacy while minimizing side effects. Additionally, the limited understanding of the precise functions of miRNAs limits their clinical utilization. Moreover, for miRNAs to be viable for cancer treatment, they must be technically and economically feasible for the widespread adoption of RNA therapies. As a result, a thorough risk evaluation of miRNA therapeutics is crucial to minimize off-target effects, prevent overdosing, and address various other issues. Nevertheless, the therapeutic potential of miRNAs for various diseases is evident, and future investigations are essential to determine their applicability in clinical settings.

Authors: Xiaolong Cheng, Zexu Li, Ruocheng Shan, Zihan Li, Shengnan Wang, Wenchang Zhao, Han Zhang, Lumen Chao, Jian Peng, Teng Fei, Wei Li
Date: 2023-02-10

Abstract:
A major challenge in the application of the CRISPR-Cas13d system is to accurately predict its guide-dependent on-target and off-target effect. Here, we perform CRISPR-Cas13d proliferation screens and design a deep learning model, named DeepCas13, to predict the on-target activity from guide sequences and secondary structures. DeepCas13 outperforms existing methods to predict the efficiency of guides targeting both protein-coding and non-coding RNAs. Guides targeting non-essential genes display off-target viability effects, which are closely related to their on-target efficiencies. Choosing proper negative control guides during normalization mitigates the associated false positives in proliferation screens. We apply DeepCas13 to the guides targeting lncRNAs, and identify lncRNAs that affect cell viability and proliferation in multiple cell lines. The higher prediction accuracy of DeepCas13 over existing methods is extensively confirmed via a secondary CRISPR-Cas13d screen and quantitative RT-PCR experiments. DeepCas13 is freely accessible via http://deepcas13.weililab.org .

Title: Recent Advances and Prospects of Nucleic Acid Therapeutics for Anti-Cancer Therapy
Authors: Minhyuk Lee, Minjae Lee, Youngseo Song, Sungjee Kim, Nokyoung Park
Date: 2024-10-07

Abstract:
Nucleic acid therapeutics are promising alternatives to conventional anti-cancer therapy, such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy. While conventional therapies have limitations, such as high side effects, low specificity, and drug resistance, nucleic acid therapeutics work at the gene level to eliminate the cause of the disease. Nucleic acid therapeutics treat diseases in various forms and using different mechanisms, including plasmid DNA (pDNA), small interfering RNA (siRNA), anti-microRNA (anti-miR), microRNA mimics (miRNA mimic), messenger RNA (mRNA), aptamer, catalytic nucleic acid (CNA), and CRISPR cas9 guide RNA (gRNA). In addition, nucleic acids have many advantages as nanomaterials, such as high biocompatibility, design flexibility, low immunogenicity, small size, relatively low price, and easy functionalization. Nucleic acid therapeutics can have a high therapeutic effect by being used in combination with various nucleic acid nanostructures, inorganic nanoparticles, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), etc. to overcome low physiological stability and cell internalization efficiency. The field of nucleic acid therapeutics has advanced remarkably in recent decades, and as more and more nucleic acid therapeutics have been approved, they have already demonstrated their potential to treat diseases, including cancer. This review paper introduces the current status and recent advances in nucleic acid therapy for anti-cancer treatment and discusses the tasks and prospects ahead.

Abstract:
We evaluated the effect of alkyl phosphonate linkages in enhancing the specificity and therapeutic profile of siRNA when incorporated into the seed region. siRNAs modified with a single alkyl phosphonate linkage demonstrated enhanced specificity and therapeutic profile compared to the parent siRNA. We found that these modifications are most effective when positioned at the internucleotide linkages 6–7 from the 5′-end of the guide strand. Our findings reveal that siRNAs with this modification maintain robust on-target activity both in vitro and in vivo . Importantly, differential gene expression (DGE) analysis showed a significant reduction in off-target effects across in vitro and in vivo , leading to an improved therapeutic profile. We also demonstrate enhanced safety in mice, as evidenced by reduced ALT/AST elevation and the absence of histopathological changes. This novel chemical approach to siRNA design provides impetus to advancing RNA interference-based treatments for various diseases.

Abstract:
Methods for sensitive and high-throughput evaluation of CRISPR RNA-guided nucleases (RGNs) off-targets (OTs) are essential for advancing RGN-based gene therapies. Here we report SURRO-seq for simultaneously evaluating thousands of therapeutic RGN OTs in cells. SURRO-seq captures RGN-induced indels in cells by pooled lentiviral OTs libraries and deep sequencing, an approach comparable and complementary to OTs detection by T7 endonuclease 1, GUIDE-seq, and CIRCLE-seq. Application of SURRO-seq to 8150 OTs from 110 therapeutic RGNs identifies significantly detectable indels in 783 OTs, of which 37 OTs are found in cancer genes and 23 OTs are further validated in five human cell lines by targeted amplicon sequencing. Finally, SURRO-seq reveals that thermodynamically stable wobble base pair (rG•dT) and free binding energy strongly affect RGN specificity. Our study emphasizes the necessity of thoroughly evaluating therapeutic RGN OTs to minimize inevitable off-target effects.

Title: Antisense Versus Antigene in the Computer-Aided Design of Triplex-Forming Oligonucleotides (TFO): Insights from a Dual-Method Review, Combining Bibliometric and Systematic Review
Authors: Martha Hincapié-López, Jeison Marín-Alfonso, Efrén Romero-Riaño, Rafael Augusto Núñez-Rodríguez, Yarley Vladimir Pabón-Martínez

Abstract:
This study offers a comprehensive overview of the scientific landscape surrounding computer-aided drug design (CADD) for triplex-forming oligonucleotides (TFOs) within antisense and antigene therapeutic strategies. A dual-method approach was used, combining bibliometric mapping of 6154 Scopus-indexed articles (1980–2023) to identify publication trends and intellectual networks, with a PRISMA 2020-guided systematic review of 62 experimental studies (2015–2024) from Scopus and Web of Science, after removing duplicates using AteneaSIRES. Results show the strong dominance and clinical maturity of antisense strategies, supported by 18 FDA/EMA/MHLW-approved drugs, whereas antigene approaches remain technically limited and underdeveloped. Antigene research has focused on triplex stability modeling and biophysical feasibility but faces challenges with poor biochemical stability, limited in vivo validation, and outdated methods. Meanwhile, antisense design benefits advanced CADD pipelines, including molecular dynamics and docking modeling. Based on these insights, we propose a practical, narrative roadmap as a methodological guide: integrating proven antisense design practices and providing actionable strategies to enhance antigene research, ultimately increasing the translational potential of therapeutic TFOs with solid mechanistic and translational support.

Abstract:
The development of genome-editing technology could lead to breakthrough gene therapy. Genome editing has made it possible to easily knock out or modify a target gene, while current gene therapy using a virus vector or plasmid hampering modification with respect to gene replacement therapies. Clinical development using these genome-editing tools is progressing rapidly. However, it is also becoming clear that there is a possibility of unintended gene sequence modification or deletion, or the insertion of undesired genes, or the selection of cells with abnormalities in the cancer suppressor gene p53 ; these unwanted actions are not possible with current gene therapy. The Science Board of the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency of Japan has compiled a report on the expected aspects of such genome-editing technology and the risks associated with it. This article summarizes the history of that discussion and compares the key concepts with information provided by other regulatory authorities.

Title: Recent Therapeutic Gene Editing Applications to Genetic Disorders
Authors: Eric Deneault
Date: 2024-04-30

Abstract:
Recent years have witnessed unprecedented progress in therapeutic gene editing, revolutionizing the approach to treating genetic disorders. In this comprehensive review, we discuss the progression of milestones leading to the emergence of the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-based technology as a powerful tool for precise and targeted modifications of the human genome. CRISPR-Cas9 nuclease, base editing, and prime editing have taken center stage, demonstrating remarkable precision and efficacy in targeted ex vivo and in vivo genomic modifications. Enhanced delivery systems, including viral vectors and nanoparticles, have further improved the efficiency and safety of therapeutic gene editing, advancing their clinical translatability. The exploration of CRISPR-Cas systems beyond the commonly used Cas9, such as the development of Cas12 and Cas13 variants, has expanded the repertoire of gene editing tools, enabling more intricate modifications and therapeutic interventions. Outstandingly, prime editing represents a significant leap forward, given its unparalleled versatility and minimization of off-target effects. These innovations have paved the way for therapeutic gene editing in a multitude of previously incurable genetic disorders, ranging from monogenic diseases to complex polygenic conditions. This review highlights the latest innovative studies in the field, emphasizing breakthrough technologies in preclinical and clinical trials, and their applications in the realm of precision medicine. However, challenges such as off-target effects and ethical considerations remain, necessitating continued research to refine safety profiles and ethical frameworks.

Abstract:
The 3D organization of the genome is critical for gene expression regulation, cellular identity, and disease progression. Traditional methods that analyze bulk genomic data often obscure cell-to-cell heterogeneity, limiting the resolution of intrinsic variability within complex biological systems. To overcome this, single-cell 3D genomics has emerged, revealing chromatin architecture at the individual cell level. Advanced experimental approaches enable genome-wide chromatin contact mapping, while computational frameworks reconstruct dynamic chromatin topologies from high-dimensional data. Building on these breakthroughs, recent advances in single-cell 3D genomics have led to transformative progress in epigenetics, linking 3D genome architecture with gene regulation, cellular identity, and disease phenotypes. This review focuses on the breakthroughs in single-cell 3D genomics, demonstrating how integrated experimental, computational, and mechanistic approaches decode chromatin architecture. These insights have deepened the understanding of genome function at the single-cell level and lay the foundation for future advances in precision medicine and topology-guided therapeutic strategies.

Abstract:
The composition of muscle fibers, characterized by distinct contractile and metabolic properties, significantly influences meat quality and glucose homeostasis. However, the mechanisms by which three-dimensional (3D) genome topology integrates with epigenetic states to regulate muscle fiber specification and transformation remain poorly understood. Here, we present an integrative analysis of the transcriptome, epigenome, and 3D genome architecture in the slow-twitch glycolytic extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and fast-twitch oxidative soleus (SOL) muscles of the pig ( Sus scrofa ). Global remodeling of enhancer-promoter (E-P) interactions emerged as a central driver of transcriptional reprogramming associated with muscle contraction and glucose metabolism. We identified tissue-specific super-enhancers (SEs) that regulate muscle fiber-type specification through cooperation of chromatin looping and transcription factors such as KLF5. Notably, the SE-driven activation of STARD7 facilitated the transformation of glycolytic fibers into oxidative fibers by mitigating reactive oxygen species levels and suppressing ERK MAPK signaling. This study elucidates the principles of 3D genome organization in the epigenetic regulation of muscle fiber specification and transformation, providing a foundation for novel therapeutic strategies targeting metabolic disorders and enhancing meat quality.

Abstract:
Enhancers are DNA sequences that enable complex temporal and tissue-specific regulation of genes in higher eukaryotes. Although it is not entirely clear how enhancer-promoter interactions can increase gene expression, this proximity has been observed in multiple systems at multiple loci and is thought to be essential for the maintenance of gene expression. Bromodomain and Extra-Terminal domain (BET) and Mediator proteins have been shown capable of forming phase condensates and are thought to be essential for super-enhancer function. Here, we show that targeting of cells with inhibitors of BET proteins or pharmacological degradation of BET protein Bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) has a strong impact on transcription but very little impact on enhancer-promoter interactions. Dissolving phase condensates reduces BRD4 and Mediator binding at enhancers and can also strongly affect gene transcription, without disrupting enhancer-promoter interactions. These results suggest that activation of transcription and maintenance of enhancer-promoter interactions are separable events. Our findings further indicate that enhancer-promoter interactions are not dependent on high levels of BRD4 and Mediator, and are likely maintained by a complex set of factors including additional activator complexes and, at some sites, CTCF and cohesin.

Title: Coming full circle: On the origin and evolution of the looping model for enhancer–promoter communication
Authors: Tessa M. Popay, Jesse R. Dixon
Date: 2022-08

Abstract:
In mammalian organisms, enhancers can regulate transcription from great genomic distances. How enhancers affect distal gene expression has been a major question in the field of gene regulation. One model to explain how enhancers communicate with their target promoters, the chromatin looping model, posits that enhancers and promoters come in close spatial proximity to mediate communication. Chromatin looping has been broadly accepted as a means for enhancer–promoter communication, driven by accumulating in vitro and in vivo evidence. The genome is now known to be folded into a complex 3D arrangement, created and maintained in part by the interplay of the Cohesin complex and the DNA-binding protein CTCF. In the last few years, however, doubt over the relationship between looping and transcriptional activation has emerged, driven by studies finding that only a modest number of genes are perturbed with acute degradation of looping machinery components. In parallel, newer models describing distal enhancer action have also come to prominence. In this article, we explore the emergence and development of the looping model as a means for enhancer–promoter communication and review the contrasting evidence between historical gene-specific and current global data for the role of chromatin looping in transcriptional regulation. We also discuss evidence for alternative models to chromatin looping and their support in the literature. We suggest that, while there is abundant evidence for chromatin looping as a major mechanism for enhancer function, enhancer–promoter communication is likely mediated by more than one mechanism in an enhancer- and context-dependent manner.

Abstract:
Eukaryotic genomes are highly folded for packing into higher‐order chromatin structures in the nucleus. With the emergence of state‐of‐the‐art chromosome conformation capture methods and microscopic imaging techniques, the spatial organization of chromatin and its functional implications have been interrogated. Our knowledge of 3D chromatin organization in plants has improved dramatically in the past few years, building on the early advances in animal systems. Here, we review recent advances in 3D genome mapping approaches, our understanding of the sophisticated organization of spatial structures, and the application of 3D genomic principles in plants. We also discuss directions for future developments in 3D genomics in plants.

Date: 2024-01-02

Abstract:
Although chromatin organizations in plants have been dissected at the scales of compartments and topologically associating domain (TAD)-like domains, there remains a gap in resolving fine-scale structures. Here, we use Micro-C-XL, a high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C)-based technology that involves micrococcal nuclease (instead of restriction enzymes) and long cross-linkers, to dissect single nucleosome-resolution chromatin organization in Arabidopsis . Insulation analysis reveals more than 14,000 boundaries, which mostly include chromatin accessibility, epigenetic modifications, and transcription factors. Micro-C-XL reveals associations between RNA Pols and local chromatin organizations, suggesting that gene transcription substantially contributes to the establishment of local chromatin domains. By perturbing Pol II both genetically and chemically at the gene level, we confirm its function in regulating chromatin organization. Visible loops and stripes are assigned to super-enhancers and their targeted genes, thus providing direct insights for the identification and mechanistic analysis of distal CREs and their working modes in plants. We further investigate possible factors regulating these chromatin loops. Subsequently, we expand Micro-C-XL to soybean and rice. In summary, we use Micro-C-XL for analyses of plants, which reveal fine-scale chromatin organization and enhancer-promoter loops and provide insights regarding three-dimensional genomes in plants.

Abstract:
Gene expression is orchestrated by transcription factors, which function within the context of a three-dimensional genome. Zinc-finger protein 143 (ZNF143/ZFP143) is a transcription factor that has been implicated in both gene activation and chromatin looping. To study the direct consequences of ZNF143/ZFP143 loss, we generated a ZNF143/ZFP143 depletion system in mouse embryonic stem cells. Our results show that ZNF143/ZFP143 degradation has no effect on chromatin looping. Systematic analysis of ZNF143/ZFP143 occupancy data revealed that a commonly used antibody cross-reacts with CTCF, leading to its incorrect association with chromatin loops. Nevertheless, ZNF143/ZFP143 specifically activates nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes, and its loss leads to severe mitochondrial dysfunction. Using an in vitro embryo model, we find that ZNF143/ZFP143 is an essential regulator of organismal development. Our results establish ZNF143/ZFP143 as a conserved transcriptional regulator of cell proliferation and differentiation by safeguarding mitochondrial activity.

Abstract:
MYC is a well characterized oncogenic transcription factor in prostate cancer, and CTCF is the main architectural protein of three-dimensional genome organization. However, the functional link between the two master regulators has not been reported. In this study, we find that MYC rewires prostate cancer chromatin architecture by interacting with CTCF protein. Through combining the H3K27ac, AR and CTCF HiChIP profiles with CRISPR deletion of a CTCF site upstream of MYC gene, we show that MYC activation leads to profound changes of CTCF-mediated chromatin looping. Mechanistically, MYC colocalizes with CTCF at a subset of genomic sites, and enhances CTCF occupancy at these loci. Consequently, the CTCF-mediated chromatin looping is potentiated by MYC activation, resulting in the disruption of enhancer-promoter looping at neuroendocrine lineage plasticity genes. Collectively, our findings define the function of MYC as a CTCF co-factor in three-dimensional genome organization.

Title: Three-dimensional interactions between enhancers and promoters during intestinal differentiation depend upon HNF4
Authors: Lei Chen, Weihuan Cao, Rohit Aita, Dennis Aldea, Juan Flores, Nan Gao, Edward M. Bonder, Christopher E. Ellison, Michael P. Verzi
Date: 2021-01-26

Abstract:
Cells in renewing tissues exhibit dramatic transcriptional changes as they differentiate. The contribution of chromatin looping to tissue renewal is incompletely understood. Enhancer-promoter interactions could be relatively stable as cells transition from progenitor to differentiated states; alternatively, chromatin looping could be as dynamic as the gene expression from their loci. The intestinal epithelium is the most rapidly renewing mammalian tissue. Proliferative cells in crypts of Lieberkühn sustain a stream of differentiated cells that are continually shed into the lumen. We apply chromosome conformation capture combined with chromatin immunoprecipitation (HiChIP) and sequencing to measure enhancer-promoter interactions in progenitor and differentiated cells of the intestinal epithelium. Despite dynamic gene regulation across the differentiation axis, we find that enhancer-promoter interactions are relatively stable. Functionally, we find HNF4 transcription factors are required for chromatin looping at target genes. Depletion of HNF4 disrupts local chromatin looping, histone modifications, and target gene expression. This study provides insights into transcriptional regulatory mechanisms governing homeostasis in renewing tissues.

Title: Minor Loops in Major Folds: Enhancer–Promoter Looping, Chromatin Restructuring, and Their Association with Transcriptional Regulation and Disease
Authors: Navneet Matharu, Nadav Ahituv
Date: 2015-12-03

Abstract:
The organization and folding of chromatin within the nucleus can determine the outcome of gene expression. Recent technological advancements have enabled us to study chromatin interactions in a genome-wide manner at high resolution. These studies have increased our understanding of the hierarchy and dynamics of chromatin domains that facilitate cognate enhancer–promoter looping, defining the transcriptional program of different cell types. In this review, we focus on vertebrate chromatin long-range interactions as they relate to transcriptional regulation. In addition, we describe how the alteration of boundaries that mark discrete regions in the genome with high interaction frequencies within them, called topological associated domains (TADs), could lead to various phenotypes, including human diseases, which we term as “TADopathies.”

Abstract:
Cohesin and CTCF are major drivers of 3D genome organization, but their role in neurons is still emerging. Here, we show a prominent role for cohesin in the expression of genes that facilitate neuronal maturation and homeostasis. Unexpectedly, we observed two major classes of activity-regulated genes with distinct reliance on cohesin in mouse primary cortical neurons. Immediate early genes (IEGs) remained fully inducible by KCl and BDNF, and short-range enhancer-promoter contacts at the IEGs Fos formed robustly in the absence of cohesin. In contrast, cohesin was required for full expression of a subset of secondary response genes characterized by long-range chromatin contacts. Cohesin-dependence of constitutive neuronal genes with key functions in synaptic transmission and neurotransmitter signaling also scaled with chromatin loop length. Our data demonstrate that key genes required for the maturation and activation of primary cortical neurons depend on cohesin for their full expression, and that the degree to which these genes rely on cohesin scales with the genomic distance traversed by their chromatin contacts.

Title: Hi-C profiling in tissues reveals 3D chromatin-regulated breast tumor heterogeneity informing a looping-mediated therapeutic avenue
Authors: Lavanya Choppavarapu, Kun Fang, Tianxiang Liu, Aigbe G. Ohihoin, Victor X. Jin
Date: 2025-04-22

Abstract:
The limitations of Hi-C (high-throughput chromosome conformation capture) profiling in in vitro cell culture include failing to recapitulate disease-specific physiological properties and lacking a clinically relevant disease microenvironment. In this study, we conduct Hi-C profiling in a pilot cohort of 12 breast tissues comprising two normal tissues, five ER+ breast primary tumors, and five tamoxifen-treated recurrent tumors. We demonstrate 3D chromatin-regulated breast tumor heterogeneity and identify a looping-mediated target gene, CA2, which might play a role in driving tamoxifen resistance. The inhibition of CA2 impedes tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo and reverses chromatin looping. The disruption of CA2 looping reduces tamoxifen-resistant cancer cell proliferation, decreases CA2 mRNA and protein expression, and weakens the looping interaction. Our study thus provides mechanistic and functional insights into the role of 3D chromatin architecture in regulating breast tumor heterogeneity and informs a new looping-mediated therapeutic avenue for treating breast cancer.

Title: The Mediator complex as a master regulator of transcription by RNA polymerase II
Authors: William F. Richter, Shraddha Nayak, Janet Iwasa, Dylan J. Taatjes
Date: 2022-06-20

Abstract:
The Mediator complex, which in humans is 1.4 MDa in size and includes 26 subunits, controls many aspects of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) function. Apart from its size, a defining feature of Mediator is its intrinsic disorder and conformational flexibility, which contributes to its ability to undergo phase separation and to interact with a myriad of regulatory factors. In this Review, we discuss Mediator structure and function, with emphasis on recent cryogenic electron microscopy data of the 4.0-MDa transcription preinitiation complex. We further discuss how Mediator and sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factors enable enhancer-dependent regulation of Pol II function at distal gene promoters, through the formation of molecular condensates (or transcription hubs) and chromatin loops. Mediator regulation of Pol II reinitiation is also discussed, in the context of transcription bursting. We propose a working model for Mediator function that combines experimental results and theoretical considerations related to enhancer–promoter interactions, which reconciles contradictory data regarding whether enhancer–promoter communication is direct or indirect. We conclude with a discussion of Mediator’s potential as a therapeutic target and of future research directions.

Abstract:
In this review, we consider various aspects of enhancer functioning in the context of the 3D genome. Particular attention is paid to the mechanisms of enhancer-promoter communication and the significance of the spatial juxtaposition of enhancers and promoters in 3D nuclear space. A model of an activator chromatin compartment is substantiated, which provides the possibility of transferring activating factors from an enhancer to a promoter without establishing direct contact between these elements. The mechanisms of selective activation of individual promoters or promoter classes by enhancers are also discussed.

Abstract:
Although spatial organization of compartments and topologically associating domains at large scale is relatively well studied, the spatial organization of regulatory elements at fine scale is poorly understood in plants. Here we perform high-resolution chromatin interaction analysis using paired-end tag sequencing approach. We map chromatin interactions tethered with RNA polymerase II and associated with heterochromatic, transcriptionally active, and Polycomb-repressive histone modifications in Arabidopsis . Analysis of the regulatory repertoire shows that distal active cis -regulatory elements are linked to their target genes through long-range chromatin interactions with increased expression of the target genes, while poised cis -regulatory elements are linked to their target genes through long-range chromatin interactions with depressed expression of the target genes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that transcription factor MYC2 is critical for chromatin spatial organization, and propose that MYC2 occupancy and MYC2-mediated chromatin interactions coordinately facilitate transcription within the framework of 3D chromatin architecture. Analysis of functionally related gene-defined chromatin connectivity networks reveals that genes implicated in flowering-time control are functionally compartmentalized into separate subdomains via their spatial activity in the leaf or shoot apical meristem, linking active mark- or Polycomb-repressive mark-associated chromatin conformation to coordinated gene expression. The results reveal that the regulation of gene transcription in Arabidopsis is not only by linear juxtaposition, but also by long-range chromatin interactions. Our study uncovers the fine scale genome organization of Arabidopsis and the potential roles of such organization in orchestrating transcription and development.

Abstract:
The human brain is a complex organ comprised of distinct cell types, and the contribution of the 3D genome to lineage specific gene expression remains poorly understood. To decipher cell type specific genome architecture, and characterize fine scale changes in the chromatin interactome across neural development, we compared the 3D genome of the human fetal cortical plate to that of neurons and glia isolated from the adult prefrontal cortex. We found that neurons have weaker genome compartmentalization compared to glia, but stronger TADs, which emerge during fetal development. Furthermore, relative to glia, the neuronal genome shifts more strongly towards repressive compartments. Neurons have differential TAD boundaries that are proximal to active promoters involved in neurodevelopmental processes. CRISPRi on CNTNAP2 in hIPSC-derived neurons reveals that transcriptional inactivation correlates with loss of insulation at the differential boundary. Finally, re-wiring of chromatin loops during neural development is associated with transcriptional and functional changes. Importantly, differential loops in the fetal cortex are associated with autism GWAS loci, suggesting a neuropsychiatric disease mechanism affecting the chromatin interactome. Furthermore, neural development involves gaining enhancer-promoter loops that upregulate genes that control synaptic activity. Altogether, our study provides multi-scale insights on the 3D genome in the human brain.

Title: The Biological Function of Genome Organization
Authors: Xin Yang, Hongni Zhu, Yajie Liu, Jinhong Wang, Yi Song, Shasha Liao, Peng Dong
Date: 2025-09-17

Abstract:
The mammalian genome is hierarchically packaged into distinct functional units, including chromatin loops, topologically associating domains, compartments and chromosome territories. This structural organization is fundamentally important because it orchestrates essential nuclear functions that underpin normal cellular identity and organismal development. In this review, we synthesize current understanding of the intricate relationship between genome architecture and its critical biological roles. We discuss how hierarchical structures are dynamically established and maintained by architectural proteins, transcription factors, epigenetic regulators and non-coding RNAs via distinct mechanisms. Importantly, we focus on the functional consequences of three-dimensional (3D) genome organization and discuss how it modulates fundamental biological processes such as transcription, gene co-expression, epigenetic modification, DNA replication and repair. We also examine the dynamics of 3D genome organization during cellular differentiation, early embryonic development and organogenesis, followed by discussing how structural disruptions are mechanistically linked to various human diseases. Understanding the biological function of 3D genome organization is thus not only essential for deciphering fundamental nuclear processes but also holds significant promise for elucidating disease etiologies and developing effective therapeutics.

Title:  TAD ‐dependent sub‐ TAD is required for enhancer–promoter interaction enabling the β‐globin transcription
Authors: Dasoul Lee, Jin Kang, AeRi Kim
Date: 2024-11-15

Abstract:
Topologically associating domains (TADs) are chromatin domains in the eukaryotic genome. TADs often comprise several sub‐TADs. The boundaries of TADs and sub‐TADs are enriched in CTCF, an architectural protein. Deletion of CTCF‐binding motifs at one boundary disrupts the domains, often resulting in a transcriptional decrease in genes inside the domains. However, it is not clear how TAD and sub‐TAD affect each other in the domain formation. Unaffected gene transcription was observed in the β‐globin locus when one boundary of TAD or sub‐TAD was destroyed. Here, we disrupted β‐globin TAD and sub‐TAD by deleting CTCF motifs at both boundaries in MEL/ch11 cells. Disruption of TAD impaired sub‐TAD, but sub‐TAD disruption did not affect TAD. Both TAD and sub‐TAD disruption compromised the β‐globin transcription, accompanied by the loss of enhancer–promoter interactions. However, histone H3 occupancy and H3K27ac were largely maintained across the β‐globin locus. Genome‐wide analysis showed that putative enhancer–promoter interactions and gene transcription were decreased by the disruption of CTCF‐mediated topological domains in neural progenitor cells. Collectively, our results indicate that there is unequal relationship between TAD and sub‐TAD formation. TAD is likely not sufficient for gene transcription, and, therefore, sub‐TAD appears to be required. TAD‐dependently formed sub‐TADs are considered to provide chromatin environments for enhancer–promoter interactions enabling gene transcription.

Here, to test causal function, an array of G4s, or control sequence that does not form G4s, were inserted within chromatin in cells. In vivo G4 formation of the inserted G4 sequence array, and not the control sequence, was confirmed using G4-selective antibody. Compared to the control insert, we observed a remarkable increase in the number of 3D chromatin looping interactions from the inserted G4 array. This was evident within the immediate topologically associated domain (TAD) and throughout the genome. Locally, recruitment of enhancer histone marks and the transcriptional coactivator p300/Acetylated-p300 increased in the G4-array, but not in the control insertion. Resulting promoter-enhancer interactions and gene activation were clear up to 5 Mb away from the insertion site. Together, these show the causal role of G4s in enhancer function and long-range chromatin interactions. Mechanisms of 3D topology are primarily based on DNA-bound architectural proteins that induce/stabilize long-range interactions. Involvement of the underlying intrinsic DNA sequence/structure in 3D looping shown here therefore throws new light on how long-range chromosomal interactions might be induced or maintained.

Abstract:
The exploration of three-dimensional chromatin interaction and organization provides insight into mechanisms underlying gene regulation, cell differentiation and disease development. Advances in chromosome conformation capture technologies, such as high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) and chromatin interaction analysis by paired-end tag (ChIA-PET), have enabled the exploration of chromatin interaction and organization. However, high-resolution Hi-C and ChIA-PET data are only available for a limited number of cell lines, and their acquisition is costly, time consuming, laborious and affected by theoretical limitations. Increasing evidence shows that DNA sequence and epigenomic features are informative predictors of regulatory interaction and chromatin architecture. Based on these features, numerous computational methods have been developed for the prediction of chromatin interaction and organization, whereas they are not extensively applied in biomedical study. A systematical study to summarize and evaluate such methods is still needed to facilitate their application. Here, we summarize 48 computational methods for the prediction of chromatin interaction and organization using sequence and epigenomic profiles, categorize them and compare their performance. Besides, we provide a comprehensive guideline for the selection of suitable methods to predict chromatin interaction and organization based on available data and biological question of interest.

Abstract:
The complex and dynamic three-dimensional organization of chromatin within the nucleus makes understanding the control of gene expression challenging, but also opens up possible ways to epigenetically modulate gene expression. Because plants are sessile, they evolved sophisticated ways to rapidly modulate gene expression in response to environmental stress, that are thought to be coordinated by changes in chromatin conformation to mediate specific cellular and physiological responses. However, to what extent and how stress induces dynamic changes in chromatin reorganization remains poorly understood. Here, we comprehensively investigated genome-wide chromatin changes associated with transcriptional reprogramming response to heat stress in tomato. Our data show that heat stress induces rapid changes in chromatin architecture, leading to the transient formation of promoter-enhancer contacts, likely driving the expression of heat-stress responsive genes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that chromatin spatial reorganization requires HSFA1a, a transcription factor (TF) essential for heat stress tolerance in tomato. In light of our findings, we propose that TFs play a key role in controlling dynamic transcriptional responses through 3D reconfiguration of promoter-enhancer contacts.

Title: EBNA leader protein orchestrates chromatin architecture remodeling during Epstein-Barr virus-induced B cell transformation
Authors: Davide Maestri, Lisa B Caruso, Jana M Cable, Rachel Sklutuis, Sarah Preston-Alp, Robert E White, Micah A Luftig, Italo Tempera

Abstract:
Epstein-Barr virus Nuclear Antigen Leader Protein (EBNA-LP) plays a pivotal role in the transformation of B cells by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), functioning independently of EBNA2 to regulate chromatin architecture and gene expression. Our study reveals that EBNA-LP binds to chromatin regions distinct from EBNA2 and facilitates the formation of long-distance chromatin loops by interacting with the cellular factor YY1. This interaction reconfigures the three-dimensional structure of the host genome, enhancing the integrity of topologically associating domains (TADs) and promoting the interaction between enhancers and promoters within these domains. In EBV-infected B cells, EBNA-LP strengthens YY1-mediated chromatin loops within TADs, which helps maintain stable regulatory programs essential for B cell transformation. Notably, EBNA-LP is crucial for establishing EBV-induced enhancers, yet it is not required for their maintenance once formed. Additionally, our data suggest a compensatory increase in CTCF binding in the absence of EBNA-LP, leading to more promiscuous chromatin interactions between TADs and a reduced TAD insulation at their boundaries. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms by which EBV reshapes the host genome chromatin architecture to support B cell transformation and highlight potential therapeutic targets for disrupting EBV-driven oncogenesis.

Abstract:
The 3D conformation of the chromatin is crucial for transcriptional regulation. However, current experimental techniques for detecting the 3D structure of the genome are costly and limited to the biological conditions. Here, we described “Chrombus XMBD ,” a graph convolution model capable of predicting chromatin interactions ab initio based on available chromatin features. Using dynamic edge convolution with multihead attention mechanism, Chrombus encodes the 2D-chromatin features into a learnable embedding space, thereby generating a genome-wide 3D-contactmap. In validation, Chrombus effectively recapitulated the topological associated domains, expression quantitative trait loci, and promoter/enhancer interactions. Especially, Chrombus outperforms existing algorithms in predicting chromatin interactions over 1–2 Mb, increasing prediction correlation by 11.8%–48.7%, and predicts long-range interactions over 2 Mb (Pearson’s coefficient 0.243–0.582). Chrombus also exhibits strong generalizability across human and mouse-derived cell lines. Additionally, the parameters of Chrombus inform the biological mechanisms underlying cistrome. Our model provides a new, generalizable analytical tool for understanding the complex dynamics of chromatin interactions and the landscape of cis -regulation of gene expression.

Title: 3D chromatin architecture and transcription regulation in cancer
Authors: Siwei Deng, Yuliang Feng, Siim Pauklin
Date: 2022-05-04

Abstract:
Chromatin has distinct three-dimensional (3D) architectures important in key biological processes, such as cell cycle, replication, differentiation, and transcription regulation. In turn, aberrant 3D structures play a vital role in developing abnormalities and diseases such as cancer. This review discusses key 3D chromatin structures (topologically associating domain, lamina-associated domain, and enhancer–promoter interactions) and corresponding structural protein elements mediating 3D chromatin interactions [CCCTC-binding factor, polycomb group protein, cohesin, and Brother of the Regulator of Imprinted Sites (BORIS) protein] with a highlight of their associations with cancer. We also summarise the recent development of technologies and bioinformatics approaches to study the 3D chromatin interactions in gene expression regulation, including crosslinking and proximity ligation methods in the bulk cell population (ChIA-PET and HiChIP) or single-molecule resolution (ChIA-drop), and methods other than proximity ligation, such as GAM, SPRITE, and super-resolution microscopy techniques.

Title: Tet-mediated DNA methylation dynamics affect chromosome organization
Authors: Hao Tian, Pengfei Luan, Yaping Liu, Guoqiang Li
Date: 2024-04-24

Abstract:
DNA Methylation is a significant epigenetic modification that can modulate chromosome states, but its role in orchestrating chromosome organization has not been well elucidated. Here we systematically assessed the effects of DNA Methylation on chromosome organization with a multi-omics strategy to capture DNA Methylation and high-order chromosome interaction simultaneously on mouse embryonic stem cells with DNA methylation dioxygenase Tet triple knock-out (Tet-TKO). Globally, upon Tet-TKO, we observed weakened compartmentalization, corresponding to decreased methylation differences between CpG island (CGI) rich and poor domains. Tet-TKO could also induce hypermethylation for the CTCF binding peaks in TAD boundaries and chromatin loop anchors. Accordingly, CTCF peak generally weakened upon Tet-TKO, which results in weakened TAD structure and depletion of long-range chromatin loops. Genes that lost enhancer–promoter looping upon Tet-TKO showed DNA hypermethylation in their gene bodies, which may compensate for the disruption of gene expression. We also observed distinct effects of Tet1 and Tet2 on chromatin organization and increased DNA methylation correlation on spatially interacted fragments upon Tet inactivation. Our work showed the broad effects of Tet inactivation and DNA methylation dynamics on chromosome organization.

Date: 2023-02

Abstract:
Little is known about three-dimensional (3D) genome organization in skeletal muscle stem cells [also called satellite cells (SCs)]. Here, we comprehensively map the 3D genome topology reorganization during mouse SC lineage progression. Specifically, rewiring at the compartment level is most pronounced when SCs become activated. Marked loss in topologically associating domain (TAD) border insulation and chromatin looping also occurs during early activation process. Meanwhile, TADs can form TAD clusters and super-enhancer–containing TAD clusters orchestrate stage-specific gene expression. Furthermore, we uncover that transcription factor PAX7 is pivotal in enhancer-promoter (E-P) loop formation. We also identify cis-regulatory elements that are crucial for local chromatin organization at Pax7 locus and Pax7 expression. Lastly, we unveil that geriatric SC displays a prominent gain in long-range contacts and loss of TAD border insulation. Together, our results uncover that 3D chromatin extensively reorganizes at multiple architectural levels and underpins the transcriptome remodeling during SC lineage development and SC aging.

Abstract:
The female mammalian brain exhibits sex hormone-driven plasticity during the reproductive period. Recent evidence implicates chromatin dynamics in gene regulation underlying this plasticity. However, whether ovarian hormones impact higher-order chromatin organization in post-mitotic neurons in vivo is unknown. Here, we mapped the 3D genome of ventral hippocampal neurons across the oestrous cycle and by sex in mice. In females, we find cycle-driven dynamism in 3D chromatin organization, including in oestrogen response elements-enriched X chromosome compartments, autosomal CTCF loops, and enhancer-promoter interactions. With rising oestrogen levels, the female 3D genome becomes more similar to the male 3D genome. Cyclical enhancer-promoter interactions are partially associated with gene expression and enriched for brain disorder-relevant genes and pathways. Our study reveals unique 3D genome dynamics in the female brain relevant to female-specific gene regulation, neuroplasticity, and disease risk.

Abstract:
During the development of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESC) to neuronal committed cells (NCC), coordinated changes in the expression of 2851 genes take place, mediated by the nuclear form of FGFR1. In this paper, widespread differences are demonstrated in the ESC and NCC inter- and intra-chromosomal interactions, chromatin looping, the formation of CTCF- and nFGFR1-linked Topologically Associating Domains (TADs) on a genome-wide scale and in exemplary HoxA-D loci. The analysis centered on HoxA cluster shows that blocking FGFR1 disrupts the loop formation. FGFR1 binding and genome locales are predictive of the genome interactions; likewise, chromatin interactions along with nFGFR1 binding are predictive of the genome function and correlate with genome regulatory attributes and gene expression. This study advances a topologically integrated genome archipelago model that undergoes structural transformations through the formation of nFGFR1-associated TADs. The makeover of the TAD islands serves to recruit distinct ontogenic programs during the development of the ESC to NCC.

Date: 2022-11-05

Abstract:
The three-dimensional genomic structure plays a critical role in gene expression, cellular differentiation, and pathological conditions. It is pivotal to elucidate fine-scale chromatin architectures, especially interactions of regulatory elements, to understand the temporospatial regulation of gene expression. In this study, we report Hi-TrAC as a proximity ligation-free, robust, and sensitive technique to profile genome-wide chromatin interactions at high-resolution among regulatory elements. Hi-TrAC detects chromatin looping among accessible regions at single nucleosome resolution. With almost half-million identified loops, we reveal a comprehensive interaction network of regulatory elements across the genome. After integrating chromatin binding profiles of transcription factors, we discover that cohesin complex and CTCF are responsible for organizing long-range chromatin loops, related to domain formation; whereas ZNF143 and HCFC1 are involved in structuring short-range chromatin loops between regulatory elements, which directly regulate gene expression. Thus, we introduce a methodology to identify a delicate and comprehensive network of cis-regulatory elements, revealing the complexity and a division of labor of transcription factors in organizing chromatin loops for genome organization and gene expression.

Authors: Merve Sahin, Wilfred Wong, Yingqian Zhan, Kinsey Van Deynze, Richard Koche, Christina S. Leslie
Date: 2021-06-07

Abstract:
Recent genome-wide chromosome conformation capture assays such as Hi-C and HiChIP have vastly expanded the resolution and throughput with which we can study 3D genomic architecture and function. Here, we present HiC-DC+, a software tool for Hi-C/HiChIP interaction calling and differential analysis using an efficient implementation of the HiC-DC statistical framework. HiC-DC+ integrates with popular preprocessing and visualization tools and includes topologically associating domain (TAD) and A/B compartment callers. We found that HiC-DC+ can more accurately identify enhancer-promoter interactions in H3K27ac HiChIP, as validated by CRISPRi-FlowFISH experiments, compared to existing methods. Differential HiC-DC+ analyses of published HiChIP and Hi-C data sets in settings of cellular differentiation and cohesin perturbation systematically and quantitatively recovers biological findings, including enhancer hubs, TAD aggregation, and the relationship between promoter-enhancer loop dynamics and gene expression changes. HiC-DC+ therefore provides a principled statistical analysis tool to empower genome-wide studies of 3D chromatin architecture and function.

Abstract:
CTCF is crucial to the organization of mammalian genomes into loop structures.
According to recent studies, the transcription apparatus is compartmentalized
and concentrated at super-enhancers to form phase-separated condensates and
drive the expression of cell-identity genes. However, it remains unclear whether
and how transcriptional condensates are coupled to higher-order chromatin
organization. Here, we show that CTCF is essential for RNA polymerase II (Pol
II)-mediated chromatin interactions, which occur as hyperconnected spatial
clusters at super-enhancers. We also demonstrate that CTCF clustering, unlike
Pol II clustering, is independent of liquid-liquid phase-separation and
resistant to perturbation of transcription. Interestingly, clusters of Pol II,
BRD4, and MED1 were found to dissolve upon CTCF depletion, but were reinstated
upon restoration of CTCF, suggesting a potent instructive function for CTCF in
the formation of transcriptional condensates. Overall, we provide evidence
suggesting that CTCF-mediated chromatin looping acts as an architectural
prerequisite for the assembly of phase-separated transcriptional
condensates.

Abstract:
How enhancers regulate their target genes in the context of 3D chromatin organization is extensively studied and models which do not require direct enhancer-promoter contact have recently emerged. Here, we use the activation of estrogen receptor-dependent enhancers in a breast cancer cell line to study enhancer-promoter communication at two loci. This allows high temporal resolution tracking of molecular events from hormone stimulation to efficient gene activation. We examine how both enhancer-promoter spatial proximity assayed by DNA fluorescence in situ hybridization, and contact frequencies resulting from chromatin in situ fragmentation and proximity ligation, change dynamically during enhancer-driven gene activation. These orthogonal methods produce seemingly paradoxical results: upon enhancer activation enhancer-promoter contact frequencies increase while spatial proximity decreases. We explore this apparent discrepancy using different estrogen receptor ligands and transcription inhibitors. Our data demonstrate that enhancer-promoter contact frequencies are transcription independent whereas altered enhancer-promoter proximity depends on transcription. Our results emphasize that the relationship between contact frequencies and physical distance in the nucleus, especially over short genomic distances, is not always a simple one.

Abstract:
Although emerging evidence indicates that alterations in proteins within nuclear compartments elicit changes in chromosomal architecture and differentiation, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Here we investigate the direct role of the abundant nuclear complex protein Matrin3 (Matr3) in chromatin architecture and development in the context of myogenesis. Using an acute targeted protein degradation platform (dTAG-Matr3), we reveal the dynamics of development-related chromatin reorganization. High-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) experiments revealed substantial chromatin loop rearrangements soon after Matr3 depletion. Notably, YY1 binding was detected, accompanied by the emergence of novel YY1-mediated enhancer-promoter loops, which occurred concurrently with changes in histone modifications and chromatin-level binding patterns. Changes in chromatin occupancy by Matr3 also correlated with these alterations. Overall, our results suggest that Matr3 mediates differentiation through stabilizing chromatin accessibility and chromatin loop-domain interactions, and highlight a conserved and direct role for Matr3 in maintenance of chromosomal architecture.

Abstract:
3D chromatin structure is critical for the regulation of gene expression during development. Here we used Micro-C assays at 100-bp resolution to map genome organization in Drosophila melanogaster throughout the first half of embryogenesis. These high-resolution contact maps reveal fine-scale features such as loops and boundaries delineating topologically associating domains. Notably, we observe that 3D chromatin structures form prior to zygotic genome activation and persist during successive mitotic cycles. Integrative analysis with 149 public chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) datasets identifies four classes of chromatin structuring elements, including a distinct group enriched for GAGA-associated factor (GAF) and Zelda binding, associated with developmental-gene regulation. These elements are mitotically retained and exhibit sequence and structure similarity between D. melanogaster and D. virilis . We propose that 3D chromatin organization in the pre-cellular embryo facilitates deployment of developmentally regulated genes during Drosophila embryogenesis.

Title: Loop competition and extrusion model predicts CTCF interaction specificity
Authors: Wang Xi, Michael A. Beer
Date: 2021-02-16

Abstract:
Three-dimensional chromatin looping interactions play an important role in constraining enhancer–promoter interactions and mediating transcriptional gene regulation. CTCF is thought to play a critical role in the formation of these loops, but the specificity of which CTCF binding events form loops and which do not is difficult to predict. Loops often have convergent CTCF binding site motif orientation, but this constraint alone is only weakly predictive of genome-wide interaction data. Here we present an easily interpretable and simple mathematical model of CTCF mediated loop formation which is consistent with Cohesin extrusion and can predict ChIA-PET CTCF looping interaction measurements with high accuracy. Competition between overlapping loops is a critical determinant of loop specificity. We show that this model is consistent with observed chromatin interaction frequency changes induced by CTCF binding site deletion, inversion, and mutation, and is also consistent with observed constraints on validated enhancer–promoter interactions.

Title: Transposable elements contribute to cell and species-specific chromatin looping and gene regulation in mammalian genomes
Authors: Adam G. Diehl, Ningxin Ouyang, Alan P. Boyle
Date: 2020-04-14

Abstract:
Chromatin looping is important for gene regulation, and studies of 3D chromatin structure across species and cell types have improved our understanding of the principles governing chromatin looping. However, 3D genome evolution and its relationship with natural selection remains largely unexplored. In mammals, the CTCF protein defines the boundaries of most chromatin loops, and variations in CTCF occupancy are associated with looping divergence. While many CTCF binding sites fall within transposable elements (TEs), their contribution to 3D chromatin structural evolution is unknown. Here we report the relative contributions of TE-driven CTCF binding site expansions to conserved and divergent chromatin looping in human and mouse. We demonstrate that TE-derived CTCF binding divergence may explain a large fraction of variable loops. These variable loops contribute significantly to corresponding gene expression variability across cells and species, possibly by refining sub-TAD-scale loop contacts responsible for cell-type-specific enhancer-promoter interactions.

Abstract:
Three-dimensional (3D) genome folding has a fundamental role in the regulation of developmental genes by facilitating or constraining chromatin interactions between cis -regulatory elements (CREs). Polycomb response elements (PREs) are a specific kind of CRE involved in the memory of transcriptional states in Drosophila melanogaster . PREs act as nucleation sites for Polycomb group (PcG) proteins, which deposit the repressive histone mark H3K27me3, leading to the formation of a class of topologically associating domain (TAD) called a Polycomb domain. PREs can establish looping contacts that stabilize the gene repression of key developmental genes during development. However, the mechanism by which PRE loops fine-tune gene expression is unknown. Using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and Cas9 genome engineering, we specifically perturbed PRE contacts or enhancer function and used complementary approaches including 4C-seq, Hi-C and Hi-M to analyze how chromatin architecture perturbation affects gene expression. Our results suggest that the PRE loop at the dac gene locus acts as a constitutive 3D chromatin scaffold during Drosophila development that forms independently of gene expression states and has a versatile function; it restricts enhancer–promoter communication and contributes to enhancer specificity.

Authors: Bobbie Pelham-Webb, Dylan Murphy, Effie Apostolou
Date: 2020-12-08

Abstract:
Higher-order chromatin structure is tightly linked to gene expression and therefore cell identity. In recent years, the chromatin landscape of pluripotent stem cells has become better characterized, and unique features at various architectural levels have been revealed. However, the mechanisms that govern establishment and maintenance of these topological characteristics and the temporal and functional relationships with transcriptional or epigenetic features are still areas of intense study. Here, we will discuss progress and limitations of our current understanding regarding how the 3D chromatin topology of pluripotent stem cells is established during somatic cell reprogramming and maintained during cell division. We will also discuss evidence and theories about the driving forces of topological reorganization and the functional links with key features and properties of pluripotent stem cell identity.

Abstract:
The gene activity underlying cell differentiation is regulated by a diverse set of transcription factors (TFs), histone modifications, chromatin structures and more. Although definitive hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are known to emerge via endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition (EHT), how the multi-layered epigenome is sequentially unfolded in a small portion of endothelial cells (ECs) transitioning into the hematopoietic fate remains elusive. With optimized low-input itChIP-seq and Hi-C assays, we performed multi-omics dissection of the HSC ontogeny trajectory across early arterial ECs (eAECs), hemogenic endothelial cells (HECs), pre-HSCs and long-term HSCs (LT-HSCs) in mouse embryos. Interestingly, HSC regulatory regions are already pre-configurated with active histone modifications as early as eAECs, preceding chromatin looping dynamics within topologically associating domains. Chromatin looping structures between enhancers and promoters only become gradually strengthened over time. Notably, RUNX1, a master TF for hematopoiesis, enriched at half of these loops is observed early from eAECs through pre-HSCs but its enrichment further increases in HSCs. RUNX1 and co-TFs together constitute a central, progressively intensified enhancer-promoter interactions. Thus, our study provides a framework to decipher how temporal epigenomic configurations fulfill cell lineage specification during development.

Abstract:
To better understand the impact of chromatin structure on regulation of the prostate cancer transcriptome, we develop high-resolution chromatin interaction maps in normal and prostate cancer cells using in situ Hi-C. By combining the in situ Hi-C data with active and repressive histone marks, CTCF binding sites, nucleosome-depleted regions, and transcriptome profiling, we identify topologically associating domains (TADs) that change in size and epigenetic states between normal and prostate cancer cells. Moreover, we identify normal and prostate cancer-specific enhancer-promoter loops and involved transcription factors. For example, we show that FOXA1 is enriched in prostate cancer-specific enhancer-promoter loop anchors. We also find that the chromatin structure surrounding the androgen receptor (AR) locus is altered in the prostate cancer cells with many cancer-specific enhancer-promoter loops. This creation of 3D epigenomic maps enables a better understanding of prostate cancer biology and mechanisms of gene regulation.

Abstract:
As the genome is organized into a three-dimensional structure in intracellular space, epigenomic information also has a complex spatial arrangement. However, most epigenetic studies describe locations of methylation marks, chromatin accessibility regions, and histone modifications in the horizontal dimension. Proper spatial epigenomic information has rarely been obtained. In this study, we designed spatial chromatin accessibility sequencing (SCA-seq) to resolve the genome conformation by capturing the epigenetic information in single-molecular resolution while simultaneously resolving the genome conformation. Using SCA-seq, we are able to examine the spatial interaction of chromatin accessibility (e.g. enhancer–promoter contacts), CpG island methylation, and spatial insulating functions of the CCCTC-binding factor. We demonstrate that SCA-seq paves the way to explore the mechanism of epigenetic interactions and extends our knowledge in 3D packaging of DNA in the nucleus.

Abstract:
Investigating how chromatin organization determines cell-type-specific gene expression remains challenging. Experimental methods for measuring three-dimensional chromatin organization, such as Hi-C, are costly and have technical limitations, restricting their broad application particularly in high-throughput genetic perturbations. We present C.Origami, a multimodal deep neural network that performs de novo prediction of cell-type-specific chromatin organization using DNA sequence and two cell-type-specific genomic features—CTCF binding and chromatin accessibility. C.Origami enables in silico experiments to examine the impact of genetic changes on chromatin interactions. We further developed an in silico genetic screening approach to assess how individual DNA elements may contribute to chromatin organization and to identify putative cell-type-specific trans -acting regulators that collectively determine chromatin architecture. Applying this approach to leukemia cells and normal T cells, we demonstrate that cell-type-specific in silico genetic screening, enabled by C.Origami, can be used to systematically discover novel chromatin regulation circuits in both normal and disease-related biological systems.

Title: Revisiting 3D chromatin architecture in cancer development and progression
Authors: Yuliang Feng, Siim Pauklin
Date: 2020-11-04

Abstract:
Cancer development and progression are demarcated by transcriptional dysregulation, which is largely attributed to aberrant chromatin architecture. Recent transformative technologies have enabled researchers to examine the genome organization at an unprecedented dimension and precision. In particular, increasing evidence supports the essential roles of 3D chromatin architecture in transcriptional homeostasis and proposes its alterations as prominent causes of human cancer. In this article, we will discuss the recent findings on enhancers, enhancer–promoter interaction, chromatin topology, phase separation and explore their potential mechanisms in shaping transcriptional dysregulation in cancer progression. In addition, we will propose our views on how to employ state-of-the-art technologies to decode the unanswered questions in this field. Overall, this article motivates the study of 3D chromatin architecture in cancer, which allows for a better understanding of its pathogenesis and develop novel approaches for diagnosis and treatment of cancer.

Abstract:
Three-dimensional (3D) genomics is an emerging discipline that studies the three-dimensional structure of chromatin and the three-dimensional and functions of genomes. It mainly studies the three-dimensional conformation and functional regulation of intranuclear genomes, such as DNA replication, DNA recombination, genome folding, gene expression regulation, transcription factor regulation mechanism, and the maintenance of three-dimensional conformation of genomes. Self-chromosomal conformation capture (3C) technology has been developed, and 3D genomics and related fields have developed rapidly. In addition, chromatin interaction analysis techniques developed by 3C technologies, such as paired-end tag sequencing (ChIA-PET) and whole-genome chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C), enable scientists to further study the relationship between chromatin conformation and gene regulation in different species. Thus, the spatial conformation of plant, animal, and microbial genomes, transcriptional regulation mechanisms, interaction patterns of chromosomes, and the formation mechanism of spatiotemporal specificity of genomes are revealed. With the help of new experimental technologies, the identification of key genes and signal pathways related to life activities and diseases is sustaining the rapid development of life science, agriculture, and medicine. In this paper, the concept and development of 3D genomics and its application in agricultural science, life science, and medicine are introduced, which provides a theoretical basis for the study of biological life processes.

Date: 2023-06-06

Abstract:
Three-dimensional (3D) genomics is an emerging field of research that investigates the relationship between gene regulatory function and the spatial structure of chromatin. Chromatin folding can be studied using chromosome conformation capture (3C) technology and 3C-based derivative sequencing technologies, including chromosome conformation capture-on-chip (4C), chromosome conformation capture carbon copy (5C), and high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C), which allow scientists to capture 3D conformations from a single site to the entire genome. A comprehensive analysis of the relationships between various regulatory components and gene function also requires the integration of multi-omics data such as genomics, transcriptomics, and epigenomics. 3D genome folding is involved in immune cell differentiation, activation, and dysfunction and participates in a wide range of diseases, including autoimmune diseases. We describe hierarchical 3D chromatin organization in this review and conclude with characteristics of C-techniques and multi-omics applications of the 3D genome. In addition, we describe the relationship between 3D genome structure and the differentiation and maturation of immune cells and address how changes in chromosome folding contribute to autoimmune diseases.

Abstract:
Nuclear compartments are prominent features of 3D chromatin organization, but sequencing depth limitations have impeded investigation at ultra fine-scale. CTCF loops are generally studied at a finer scale, but the impact of looping on proximal interactions remains enigmatic. Here, we critically examine nuclear compartments and CTCF loop-proximal interactions using a combination of in situ Hi-C at unparalleled depth, algorithm development, and biophysical modeling. Producing a large Hi-C map with 33 billion contacts in conjunction with an algorithm for performing principal component analysis on sparse, super massive matrices (POSSUMM), we resolve compartments to 500 bp. Our results demonstrate that essentially all active promoters and distal enhancers localize in the A compartment, even when flanking sequences do not. Furthermore, we find that the TSS and TTS of paused genes are often segregated into separate compartments. We then identify diffuse interactions that radiate from CTCF loop anchors, which correlate with strong enhancer-promoter interactions and proximal transcription. We also find that these diffuse interactions depend on CTCF’s RNA binding domains. In this work, we demonstrate features of fine-scale chromatin organization consistent with a revised model in which compartments are more precise than commonly thought while CTCF loops are more protracted.

Title: Through the lens of phase separation: intrinsically unstructured protein and chromatin looping
Authors: Ling Cai, Gang Greg Wang
Date: 2023-02-23

Abstract:
The establishment, maintenance and dynamic regulation of three-dimensional (3D) chromatin structures provide an important means for partitioning of genome into functionally distinctive domains, which helps to define specialized gene expression programs associated with developmental stages and cell types. Increasing evidence supports critical roles for intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) harbored within transcription factors (TFs) and chromatin-modulatory proteins in inducing phase separation, a phenomenon of forming membrane-less condensates through partitioning of biomolecules. Such a process is also critically involved in the establishment of high-order chromatin structures and looping. IDR- and phase separation-driven 3D genome (re)organization often goes wrong in disease such as cancer. This review discusses about recent advances in understanding how phase separation of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) modulates chromatin looping and gene expression.

Title: Relaxed 3D genome conformation facilitates the pluripotent to totipotent-like state transition in embryonic stem cells
Authors: Yezhang Zhu, Jiali Yu, Jiahui Gu, Chaoran Xue, Long Zhang, Jiekai Chen, Li Shen
Date: 2021-12-02

Abstract:
The 3D genome organization is crucial for gene regulation. Although recent studies have revealed a uniquely relaxed genome conformation in totipotent early blastomeres of both fertilized and cloned embryos, how weakened higher-order chromatin structure is functionally linked to totipotency acquisition remains elusive. Using low-input Hi-C, ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq, we systematically examined the dynamics of 3D genome and epigenome during pluripotent to totipotent-like state transition in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). The spontaneously converted 2-cell-embryo-like cells (2CLCs) exhibited more relaxed chromatin architecture compared to ESCs, including global weakening of both enhancer-promoter interactions and TAD insulation. While the former correlated with inactivation of ESC enhancers and down-regulation of pluripotent genes, the latter might facilitate contacts between the putative new enhancers arising in 2CLCs and neighboring 2C genes. Importantly, disruption of chromatin organization by depleting CTCF or the cohesin complex promoted the ESC to 2CLC transition. Our results thus establish a critical role of 3D genome organization in totipotency acquisition.

Abstract:
The mechanisms underpinning axon regeneration after injury remain only partially understood. This work shows that three-dimensional chromatin architecture is required for the activation of the axonal regeneration program and for nerve regeneration. Nerve regeneration is supported by cohesin, which generates long and complex promoter–enhancer loops at regenerative genes. This work shows that, in addition to previously recognized epigenetic mechanisms at the level of the linear genome, the three-dimensional chromatin architecture, such as promoter–enhancer interactions, should be considered as an added layer of transcriptional regulation in the response to nerve injury. These findings have broad implications for neuronal biology and future repair strategies.

Abstract:
The nuclear pore complex (NPC) comprises more than 30 nucleoporins (NUPs) and is a hallmark of eukaryotes. NUPs have been suggested to be important in regulating gene transcription and 3D genome organization. However, evidence in support of their direct roles remains limited. Here, by Cut&Run, we find that core NUPs display broad but also cell-type-specific association with active promoters and enhancers in human cells. Auxin-mediated rapid depletion of two NUPs demonstrates that NUP93, but not NUP35, directly and specifically controls gene transcription. NUP93 directly activates genes with high levels of RNA polymerase II loading and transcriptional elongation by facilitating full BRD4 recruitment to their active enhancers. dCas9-based tethering confirms a direct and causal role of NUP93 in gene transcriptional activation. Unexpectedly, in situ Hi-C and H3K27ac or H3K4me1 HiChIP results upon acute NUP93 depletion show negligible changes of 3D genome organization ranging from A/B compartments and topologically associating domains (TADs) to enhancer-promoter contacts.

Abstract:
The enhancer-promoter looping model, in which enhancers activate their target genes via physical contact, has long dominated the field of gene regulation. However, the ubiquity of this model has been questioned due to evidence of alternative mechanisms and the lack of its systematic validation, primarily owing to the absence of suitable experimental techniques. In this study, we present a new MNase-based proximity ligation method called MChIP-C, allowing for the measurement of protein-mediated chromatin interactions at single-nucleosome resolution on a genome-wide scale. By applying MChIP-C to study H3K4me3 promoter-centered interactions in K562 cells, we found that it had greatly improved resolution and sensitivity compared to restriction endonuclease-based C-methods. This allowed us to identify EP300 histone acetyltransferase and the SWI/SNF remodeling complex as potential candidates for establishing and/or maintaining enhancer-promoter interactions. Finally, leveraging data from published CRISPRi screens, we found that most functionally verified enhancers do physically interact with their cognate promoters, supporting the enhancer-promoter looping model.

Title: Regulation associated modules reflect 3D genome modularity associated with chromatin activity
Authors: Lina Zheng, Wei Wang
Date: 2022-09-08

Abstract:
The 3D genome has been shown to be organized into modules including topologically associating domains (TADs) and compartments that are primarily defined by spatial contacts from Hi-C. There exists a gap to investigate whether and how the spatial modularity of the chromatin is related to the functional modularity resulting from chromatin activity. Despite histone modifications reflecting chromatin activity, inferring spatial modularity of the genome directly from the histone modification patterns has not been well explored. Here, we report that histone modifications show a modular pattern (referred to as regulation associated modules, RAMs) that reflects spatial chromatin modularity. Enhancer-promoter interactions, loop anchors, super-enhancer clusters and extrachromosomal DNAs (ecDNAs) are found to occur more often within the same RAMs than within the same TADs. Consistently, compared to the TAD boundaries, deletions of RAM boundaries perturb the chromatin structure more severely (may even cause cell death) and somatic variants in cancer samples are more enriched in RAM boundaries. These observations suggest that RAMs reflect a modular organization of the 3D genome at a scale better aligned with chromatin activity, providing a bridge connecting the structural and functional modularity of the genome.

Abstract:
Cancer cells undergo widespread changes in epigenetic patterns that mediate cancer compromised gene expression programs during cancer progression. However, the alterations in higher-order genome organization in which these changes occur and their functional implications are less well understood. To explore how chromatin structure and epigenetic parameters of genome architecture changes during cancer progression at a fine scale and genome-wide, we generated high-resolution Micro-C contact maps in non-malignant, pre-cancerous, and metastatic MCF10 breast cancer epithelial cells. We profiled progression-associated reorganization of chromatin compartments, topologically associated domains (TADs), and chromatin loops, and also identified invariable chromatin features. We find large-scale compartmental shifts occur predominantly in early stages of cancer development, with more fine-scale structural changes in TADs and looping accumulating during the later transition to metastasis. We related these structural features to changes in gene expression, histone marks, and potential enhancers and found a large portion of differentially expressed genes physically connected to distal regulatory elements. While changes in chromatin loops were relatively rare during progression, differential loops were enriched for progression-associated genes, including those involved in proliferation, angiogenesis, and differentiation. Changes in either enhancer-promoter contacts or distal enhancer activity were accompanied by differential gene regulation, suggesting that changes in chromatin contacts are not necessary but can be sufficient for gene regulation. Together, our results demonstrate a functionally relevant connection between gene regulation and genome remodeling at many key genes during cancer progression.

Title: 3D chromatin architecture and epigenetic regulation in cancer stem cells
Authors: Yuliang Feng, Xingguo Liu, Siim Pauklin
Date: 2021-01-16

Abstract:
Dedifferentiation of cell identity to a progenitor-like or stem cell-like state with increased cellular plasticity is frequently observed in cancer formation. During this process, a subpopulation of cells in tumours acquires a stem cell-like state partially resembling to naturally occurring pluripotent stem cells that are temporarily present during early embryogenesis. Such characteristics allow these cancer stem cells (CSCs) to give rise to the whole tumour with its entire cellular heterogeneity and thereby support metastases formation while being resistant to current cancer therapeutics. Cancer development and progression are demarcated by transcriptional dysregulation. In this article, we explore the epigenetic mechanisms shaping gene expression during tumorigenesis and cancer stem cell formation, with an emphasis on 3D chromatin architecture. Comparing the pluripotent stem cell state and epigenetic reprogramming to dedifferentiation in cellular transformation provides intriguing insight to chromatin dynamics. We suggest that the 3D chromatin architecture could be used as a target for re-sensitizing cancer stem cells to therapeutics.

Abstract:
Three-dimensional (3D) chromatin architectural differences can influence the integrity of topologically associating domains (TADs) and rewire specific enhancer-promoter interactions, impacting gene expression and leading to human disease. Here, we investigate the 3D chromatin architecture in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) using primary human leukemia specimens and its dynamic responses to pharmacological agents. Systematic integration of matched in situ Hi-C, RNA-seq and CTCF ChIP-seq datasets revealed widespread differences in intra-TAD chromatin interactions and TAD boundary insulation in T-ALL. Our studies identify and focus on a TAD “fusion” event associated with absence of CTCF-mediated insulation, enabling direct interactions between the MYC promoter and a distal super-enhancer. Moreover, our data also demonstrate that small molecule inhibitors targeting either oncogenic signal transduction or epigenetic regulation can alter specific 3D interactions found in leukemia. Overall, our study highlights the impact, complexity and dynamic nature of 3D chromatin architecture in human acute leukemia.

Authors: Abrar Aljahani, Peng Hua, Magdalena A. Karpinska, Kimberly Quililan, James O. J. Davies, A. Marieke Oudelaar
Date: 2022-04-19

Abstract:
Enhancers and promoters predominantly interact within large-scale topologically associating domains (TADs), which are formed by loop extrusion mediated by cohesin and CTCF. However, it is unclear whether complex chromatin structures exist at sub-kilobase-scale and to what extent fine-scale regulatory interactions depend on loop extrusion. To address these questions, we present an MNase-based chromosome conformation capture (3C) approach, which has enabled us to generate the most detailed local interaction data to date (20 bp resolution) and precisely investigate the effects of cohesin and CTCF depletion on chromatin architecture. Our data reveal that cis -regulatory elements have distinct internal nano-scale structures, within which local insulation is dependent on CTCF, but which are independent of cohesin. In contrast, we find that depletion of cohesin causes a subtle reduction in longer-range enhancer-promoter interactions and that CTCF depletion can cause rewiring of regulatory contacts. Together, our data show that loop extrusion is not essential for enhancer-promoter interactions, but contributes to their robustness and specificity and to precise regulation of gene expression.

Abstract:
Dendritic cells are antigen-presenting cells orchestrating innate and adaptive immunity. The crucial role of transcription factors and histone modifications in the transcriptional regulation of dendritic cells has been extensively studied. However, it is not been well understood whether and how three-dimensional chromatin folding controls gene expression in dendritic cells. Here we demonstrate that activation of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells induces extensive reprogramming of chromatin looping as well as enhancer activity, both of which are implicated in the dynamic changes in gene expression. Interestingly, depletion of CTCF attenuates GM-CSF-mediated JAK2/STAT5 signaling, resulting in defective NF-κB activation. Moreover, CTCF is necessary for establishing NF-κB-dependent chromatin interactions and maximal expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which prime Th1 and Th17 cell differentiation. Collectively, our study provides mechanistic insights into how three-dimensional enhancer networks control gene expression during bone marrow-derived dendritic cells activation, and offers an integrative view of the complex activities of CTCF in the inflammatory response of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells.

Title: Enhancer–promoter interactions can form independently of genomic distance and be functional across TAD boundaries

Date: 2024-02-28

Abstract:
Topologically Associating Domains (TADs) have been suggested to facilitate and constrain enhancer–promoter interactions. However, the role of TAD boundaries in effectively restricting these interactions remains unclear. Here, we show that a significant proportion of enhancer–promoter interactions are established across TAD boundaries in Drosophila embryos, but that developmental genes are strikingly enriched in intra- but not inter-TAD interactions. We pursued this observation using the twist locus, a master regulator of mesoderm development, and systematically relocated one of its enhancers to various genomic locations. While this developmental gene can establish inter-TAD interactions with its enhancer, the functionality of these interactions remains limited, highlighting the existence of topological constraints. Furthermore, contrary to intra-TAD interactions, the formation of inter-TAD enhancer–promoter interactions is not solely driven by genomic distance, with distal interactions sometimes favored over proximal ones. These observations suggest that other general mechanisms must exist to establish and maintain specific enhancer–promoter interactions across large distances.

Abstract:
In bilaterian animals, gene regulation is shaped by a combination of linear and spatial regulatory information. Regulatory elements along the genome are integrated into gene regulatory landscapes through chromatin compartmentalization 1 , 2 , insulation of neighbouring genomic regions 3 , 4 and chromatin looping that brings together distal cis -regulatory sequences 5 . However, the evolution of these regulatory features is unknown because the three-dimensional genome architecture of most animal lineages remains unexplored 6 , 7 . To trace the evolutionary origins of animal genome regulation, here we characterized the physical organization of the genome in non-bilaterian animals (sponges, ctenophores, placozoans and cnidarians) 8 , 9 and their closest unicellular relatives (ichthyosporeans, filastereans and choanoflagellates) 10 by combining high-resolution chromosome conformation capture 11 , 12 with epigenomic marks and gene expression data. Our comparative analysis showed that chromatin looping is a conserved feature of genome architecture in ctenophores, placozoans and cnidarians. These sequence-determined distal contacts involve both promoter–enhancer and promoter–promoter interactions. By contrast, chromatin loops are absent in the unicellular relatives of animals. Our findings indicate that spatial genome regulation emerged early in animal evolution. This evolutionary innovation introduced regulatory complexity, ultimately facilitating the diversification of animal developmental programmes and cell type repertoires.

Title: 7C: Computational Chromosome Conformation Capture by Correlation of ChIP-seq at CTCF motifs
Authors: Jonas Ibn-Salem, Miguel A. Andrade-Navarro
Date: 2019-10-25

Abstract:
Knowledge of the three-dimensional structure of the genome is necessary to understand how gene expression is regulated. Recent experimental techniques such as Hi-C or ChIA-PET measure long-range chromatin interactions genome-wide but are experimentally elaborate, have limited resolution and such data is only available for a limited number of cell types and tissues. While ChIP-seq was not designed to detect chromatin interactions, the formaldehyde treatment in the ChIP-seq protocol cross-links proteins with each other and with DNA. Consequently, also regions that are not directly bound by the targeted TF but interact with the binding site via chromatin looping are co-immunoprecipitated and sequenced. This produces minor ChIP-seq signals at loop anchor regions close to the directly bound site. We use the position and shape of ChIP-seq signals around CTCF motif pairs to predict whether they interact or not. We implemented this approach in a prediction method, termed Computational Chromosome Conformation Capture by Correlation of ChIP-seq at CTCF motifs (7C). We applied 7C to all CTCF motif pairs within 1 Mb in the human genome and validated predicted interactions with high-resolution Hi-C and ChIA-PET. A single ChIP-seq experiment from known architectural proteins (CTCF, Rad21, Znf143) but also from other TFs (like TRIM22 or RUNX3) predicts loops accurately. Importantly, 7C predicts loops in cell types and for TF ChIP-seq datasets not used in training. 7C predicts chromatin loops which can help to associate TF binding sites to regulated genes. Furthermore, profiling of hundreds of ChIP-seq datasets results in novel candidate factors functionally involved in chromatin looping. Our method is available as an R/Bioconductor package: http://bioconductor.org/packages/sevenC .

Title: The macro and micro of chromosome conformation capture
Authors: Viraat Y. Goel, Anders S. Hansen
Date: 2020-09-28

Abstract:
The 3D organization of the genome facilitates gene regulation, replication, and repair, making it a key feature of genomic function and one that remains to be properly understood. Over the past two decades, a variety of chromosome conformation capture (3C) methods have delineated genome folding from megabase‐scale compartments and topologically associating domains (TADs) down to kilobase‐scale enhancer‐promoter interactions. Understanding the functional role of each layer of genome organization is a gateway to understanding cell state, development, and disease. Here, we discuss the evolution of 3C‐based technologies for mapping 3D genome organization. We focus on genomics methods and provide a historical account of the development from 3C to Hi‐C. We also discuss ChIP‐based techniques that focus on 3D genome organization mediated by specific proteins, capture‐based methods that focus on particular regions or regulatory elements, 3C‐orthogonal methods that do not rely on restriction digestion and proximity ligation, and methods for mapping the DNA–RNA and RNA–RNA interactomes. We consider the biological discoveries that have come from these methods, examine the mechanistic contributions of CTCF, cohesin, and loop extrusion to genomic folding, and detail the 3D genome field's current understanding of nuclear architecture. Finally, we give special consideration to Micro‐C as an emerging frontier in chromosome conformation capture and discuss recent Micro‐C findings uncovering fine‐scale chromatin organization in unprecedented detail.

Title: CTCF and Its Partners: Shaper of 3D Genome during Development
Authors: Xiaoyue Sun, Jing Zhang, Chunwei Cao
Date: 2022-08-02

Abstract:
The 3D genome organization and its dynamic modulate genome function, playing a pivotal role in cell differentiation and development. CTCF and cohesin, acting as the core architectural components involved in chromatin looping and genome folding, can also recruit other protein or RNA partners to fine-tune genome structure during development. Moreover, systematic screening for partners of CTCF has been performed through high-throughput approaches. In particular, several novel protein and RNA partners, such as BHLHE40, WIZ, MAZ, Aire, MyoD, YY1, ZNF143, and Jpx, have been identified, and these partners are mostly implicated in transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling, offering a unique opportunity for dissecting their roles in higher-order chromatin organization by collaborating with CTCF and cohesin. Here, we review the latest advancements with an emphasis on features of CTCF partners and also discuss the specific functions of CTCF-associated complexes in chromatin structure modulation, which may extend our understanding of the functions of higher-order chromatin architecture in developmental processes.

Title: High-resolution simulations of chromatin folding at genomic rearrangements in malignant B cells provide mechanistic insights into proto-oncogene deregulation

Abstract:
Genomic rearrangements are known to result in proto-oncogene deregulation in many cancers, but the link to 3D genome structure remains poorly understood. Here, we used the highly predictive heteromorphic polymer (HiP-HoP) model to predict chromatin conformations at the proto-oncogene CCND1 in healthy and malignant B cells. After confirming that the model gives good predictions of Hi-C data for the nonmalignant human B cell–derived cell line GM12878, we generated predictions for two cancer cell lines, U266 and Z-138. These possess genome rearrangements involving CCND1 and the immunoglobulin heavy locus ( IGH ), which we mapped using targeted genome sequencing. Our simulations showed that a rearrangement in U266 cells where a single IGH super-enhancer is inserted next to CCND1 leaves the local topologically associated domain (TAD) structure intact. We also observed extensive changes in enhancer-promoter interactions within the TAD, suggesting that it is the downstream chromatin remodeling which gives rise to the oncogene activation, rather than the presence of the inserted super-enhancer DNA sequence per se. Simulations of the IGH - CCND1 reciprocal translocation in Z-138 cells revealed that an oncogenic fusion TAD is created, encompassing CCND1 and the IGH super-enhancers. We predicted how the structure and expression of CCND1 changes in these different cell lines, validating this using qPCR and fluorescence in situ hybridization microscopy. Our work demonstrates the power of polymer simulations to predict differences in chromatin interactions and gene expression for different translocation breakpoints.

Title: Widespread contribution of transposable elements to the rewiring of mammalian 3D genomes
Authors: Mayank N. K. Choudhary, Kara Quaid, Xiaoyun Xing, Heather Schmidt, Ting Wang
Date: 2023-02-06

Abstract:
Transposable elements (TEs) are major contributors of genetic material in mammalian genomes. These often include binding sites for architectural proteins, including the multifarious master protein, CTCF, which shapes the 3D genome by creating loops, domains, compartment borders, and RNA-DNA interactions. These play a role in the compact packaging of DNA and have the potential to facilitate regulatory function. In this study, we explore the widespread contribution of TEs to mammalian 3D genomes by quantifying the extent to which they give rise to loops and domain border differences across various cell types and species using several 3D genome mapping technologies. We show that specific families and subfamilies of TEs have contributed to lineage-specific 3D chromatin structures across mammalian species. In many cases, these loops may facilitate sustained interaction between distant cis-regulatory elements and target genes, and domains may segregate chromatin state to impact gene expression in a lineage-specific manner. An experimental validation of our analytical findings using CRISPR-Cas9 to delete a candidate TE resulted in disruption of species-specific 3D chromatin structure. Taken together, we comprehensively quantify and selectively validate our finding that TEs contribute to shaping 3D genome organization and may, in some cases, impact gene regulation during the course of mammalian evolution.

Abstract:
The insulator protein CTCF is essential for mediating chromatin loops and regulating gene expression. While it is established that DNA methylation hinders CTCF binding, the impacts of this methylation-sensitive CTCF binding on chromatin architecture and transcription are poorly defined. Here, we used a selective DNMT1 inhibitor (DNMT1i) to investigate the characteristics and functions of ‘DNMT1i-specific’ CTCF peaks resulting from global DNA demethylation. We found that DNMT1i-specific peaks preferentially form chromatin loops on gene bodies and interact with highly looping partner peaks located in regions of active chromatin. Notably, both DNMT1i-specific CTCF peaks and their highly looping partners are enriched near nuclear speckles – condensate bodies implicated in transcription and splicing. Utilizing targeted protein degradation, we specifically depleted CTCF and nuclear speckles to elucidate their functional interplay. By degrading CTCF upon DNMT1 inhibition, we revealed that CTCF is important for DNMT1i-dependent interactions between chromatin and speckle proteins. Moreover, we found that CTCF promotes the activation of genes near speckles upon DNMT1 inhibition. Conversely, acute depletion of nuclear speckles revealed that they influence RNA abundance but do not maintain CTCF binding or looping. Collectively, our study suggests a model wherein DNA methylation prevents spurious CTCF occupancy and interactions with regulatory elements near nuclear speckles, yet CTCF looping is robust toward the loss of speckles.

Title: DeepNanoHi-C: deep learning enables accurate single-cell nanopore long-read data analysis and 3D genome interpretation
Authors: Wenjing Ma, Fuzhou Wang, Yi Fan, Gaoyang Hao, Yanchi Su, Ka-Chun Wong, Xiangtao Li
Date: 2025-07-22

Abstract:
Single-cell long-read concatemer sequencing (scNanoHi-C) technology provides unique insights into the higher-order chromatin structure across the genome in individual cells, crucial for understanding 3D genome organization. However, the lack of specialized analytical tools for scNanoHi-C data impedes progress, as existing methods, which primarily focus on scHi-C technologies, do not fully address the specific challenges of scNanoHi-C, such as sparsity, cell-specific variability, and complex chromatin interaction networks. Here, we introduce DeepNanoHi-C, a novel deep learning framework specifically designed for scNanoHi-C data, which leverages a multistep autoencoder and a Sparse Gated Mixture of Experts (SGMoE) to accurately predict chromatin interactions by imputing sparse contact maps, thereby capturing cell-specific structural features. DeepNanoHi-C effectively captures complex global chromatin contact patterns through the multistep autoencoder and dynamically selects the most appropriate expert from a pool of experts based on distinct chromatin contact patterns. Furthermore, DeepNanoHi-C integrates multiscale predictions through a dual-channel prediction net, refining complex interaction information and facilitating comprehensive downstream analyses of chromatin architecture. Experimental validation shows that DeepNanoHi-C outperforms existing methods in distinguishing cell types and demonstrates robust performance in data imputation tasks. Additionally, the framework identifies single-cell 3D genome features, such as cell-specific topologically associating domain (TAD) boundaries, further confirming its ability to accurately model chromatin interactions. Beyond single-cell analysis, DeepNanoHi-C also uncovers conserved genomic structures across species, providing insights into the evolutionary conservation of chromatin organization.

Abstract:
Three-dimensional (3D) chromatin structure has been shown to play a role in regulating gene transcription during biological transitions. Although our understanding of loop formation and maintenance is rapidly improving, much less is known about the mechanisms driving changes in looping and the impact of differential looping on gene transcription. One limitation has been a lack of well-powered differential looping data sets. To address this, we conducted a deeply sequenced Hi-C time course of megakaryocyte development comprising four biological replicates and 6 billion reads per time point. Statistical analysis revealed 1503 differential loops. Gained loop anchors were enriched for AP-1 occupancy and were characterized by large increases in histone H3K27ac (over 11-fold) but relatively small increases in CTCF and RAD21 binding (1.26- and 1.23-fold, respectively). Linear modeling revealed that changes in histone H3K27ac, chromatin accessibility, and JUN binding were better correlated with changes in looping than RAD21 and almost as well correlated as CTCF. Changes to epigenetic features between—rather than at—boundaries were highly predictive of changes in looping. Together these data suggest that although CTCF and RAD21 may be the core machinery dictating where loops form, other features (both at the anchors and within the loop boundaries) may play a larger role than previously anticipated in determining the relative loop strength across cell types and conditions.

Abstract:
Coordinated chromatin interactions between enhancers and promoters are critical for gene regulation. The architectural protein CTCF mediates chromatin looping and is enriched at the boundaries of topologically associating domains (TADs), which are sub-megabase chromatin structures. In vitro CTCF depletion leads to a loss of TADs but has only limited effects over gene expression, challenging the concept that CTCF-mediated chromatin structures are a fundamental requirement for gene regulation. However, how CTCF and a perturbed chromatin structure impacts gene expression during development remains poorly understood. Here we link the loss of CTCF and gene regulation during patterning and organogenesis in a ctcf knockout zebrafish model. CTCF absence leads to loss of chromatin structure and affects the expression of thousands of genes, including many developmental regulators. Our results demonstrate the essential role of CTCF in providing the structural context for enhancer-promoter interactions, thus regulating developmental genes.

Abstract:
Genetic sharing is extensively observed for autoimmune diseases, but the causal variants and their underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Through systematic investigation of autoimmune disease pleiotropic loci, we found most of these shared genetic effects are transmitted from regulatory code. We used an evidence-based strategy to functionally prioritize causal pleiotropic variants and identify their target genes. A top-ranked pleiotropic variant, rs4728142, yielded many lines of evidence as being causal. Mechanistically, the rs4728142-containing region interacts with the IRF5 alternative promoter in an allele-specific manner and orchestrates its upstream enhancer to regulate IRF5 alternative promoter usage through chromatin looping. A putative structural regulator, ZBTB3, mediates the allele-specific loop to promote IRF5 -short transcript expression at the rs4728142 risk allele, resulting in IRF5 overactivation and M1 macrophage polarization. Together, our findings establish a causal mechanism between the regulatory variant and fine-scale molecular phenotype underlying the dysfunction of pleiotropic genes in human autoimmunity.

Title: Regulating epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity from 3D genome organization
Authors: Qing You Pang, Yi-Chia Chiu, Ruby Yun-Ju Huang
Date: 2024-06-20

Abstract:
Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a dynamic process enabling polarized epithelial cells to acquire mesenchymal features implicated in development and carcinoma progression. As our understanding evolves, it is clear the reversible execution of EMT arises from complex epigenomic regulation involving histone modifications and 3-dimensional (3D) genome structural changes, leading to a cascade of transcriptional events. This review summarizes current knowledge on chromatin organization in EMT, with a focus on hierarchical structures of the 3D genome and chromatin accessibility changes.

Title: The 3D Genome: From Structure to Function
Authors: Tapan Kumar Mohanta, Awdhesh Kumar Mishra, Ahmed Al-Harrasi
Date: 2021-10-27

Abstract:
The genome is the most functional part of a cell, and genomic contents are organized in a compact three-dimensional (3D) structure. The genome contains millions of nucleotide bases organized in its proper frame. Rapid development in genome sequencing and advanced microscopy techniques have enabled us to understand the 3D spatial organization of the genome. Chromosome capture methods using a ligation approach and the visualization tool of a 3D genome browser have facilitated detailed exploration of the genome. Topologically associated domains (TADs), lamin-associated domains, CCCTC-binding factor domains, cohesin, and chromatin structures are the prominent identified components that encode the 3D structure of the genome. Although TADs are the major contributors to 3D genome organization, they are absent in Arabidopsis . However, a few research groups have reported the presence of TAD-like structures in the plant kingdom.

Title: Chromatin Profiling Techniques: Exploring the Chromatin Environment and Its Contributions to Complex Traits
Authors: Anjali Chawla, Corina Nagy, Gustavo Turecki
Date: 2021-07-16

Abstract:
The genetic architecture of complex traits is multifactorial. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified risk loci for complex traits and diseases that are disproportionately located at the non-coding regions of the genome. On the other hand, we have just begun to understand the regulatory roles of the non-coding genome, making it challenging to precisely interpret the functions of non-coding variants associated with complex diseases. Additionally, the epigenome plays an active role in mediating cellular responses to fluctuations of sensory or environmental stimuli. However, it remains unclear how exactly non-coding elements associate with epigenetic modifications to regulate gene expression changes and mediate phenotypic outcomes. Therefore, finer interrogations of the human epigenomic landscape in associating with non-coding variants are warranted. Recently, chromatin-profiling techniques have vastly improved our understanding of the numerous functions mediated by the epigenome and DNA structure. Here, we review various chromatin-profiling techniques, such as assays of chromatin accessibility, nucleosome distribution, histone modifications, and chromatin topology, and discuss their applications in unraveling the brain epigenome and etiology of complex traits at tissue homogenate and single-cell resolution. These techniques have elucidated compositional and structural organizing principles of the chromatin environment. Taken together, we believe that high-resolution epigenomic and DNA structure profiling will be one of the best ways to elucidate how non-coding genetic variations impact complex diseases, ultimately allowing us to pinpoint cell-type targets with therapeutic potential.

Title: Plant 3D Chromatin Organization: Important Insights from Chromosome Conformation Capture Analyses of the Last 10 Years
Authors: Xinxin Zhang, Tianzuo Wang
Date: 2021-11

Abstract:
Over the past few decades, eukaryotic linear genomes and epigenomes have been widely and extensively studied for understanding gene expression regulation. More recently, the three-dimensional (3D) chromatin organization was found to be important for determining genome functionality, finely tuning physiological processes for appropriate cellular responses. With the development of visualization techniques and chromatin conformation capture (3C)-based techniques, increasing evidence indicates that chromosomal architecture characteristics and chromatin domains with different epigenetic modifications in the nucleus are correlated with transcriptional activities. Subsequent studies have further explored the intricate interplay between 3D genome organization and the function of interacting regions. In this review, we summarize spatial distribution patterns of chromatin, including chromatin positioning, configurations and domains, with a particular focus on the effect of a unique form of interaction between varieties of factors that shape the 3D genome conformation in plants. We further discuss the methods, advantages and limitations of various 3C-based techniques, highlighting the applications of these technologies in plants to identify chromatin domains, and address their dynamic changes and functional implications in evolution, and adaptation to development and changing environmental conditions. Moreover, the future implications and emerging research directions of 3D genome organization are discussed.

Date: 2022-05-30

Abstract:
The plasticity along the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) spectrum has been shown to be regulated by various epigenetic repertoires. Emerging evidence of local chromatin conformation changes suggests that regulation of EMT may occur at a higher order of three-dimensional genome level. We perform Hi-C analysis and combine ChIP-seq data across cancer cell lines representing different EMT states. We demonstrate that the epithelial and mesenchymal genes are regulated distinctively. We find that EMT genes are regulated within their topologically associated domains (TADs), with only a subset of mesenchymal genes being influenced by A/B compartment switches, indicating topological remodeling is required in the transcriptional regulation of these genes. At the TAD level, epithelial and mesenchymal genes are associated with different regulatory trajectories. The epithelial gene-residing TADs are enriched with H3K27me3 marks in the mesenchymal-like states. The mesenchymal gene-residing TADs, which do not show enrichment of H3K27me3 in epithelial-like states, exhibit increased interaction frequencies with regulatory elements in the mesenchymal-like states. We propose a novel workflow coupling immunofluorescence and dielectrophoresis to unravel EMT heterogeneity at single-cell resolution. The predicted three-dimensional structures of chromosome 10, harboring Vimentin, identify cell clusters of different states. Our results pioneer a novel avenue to decipher the complexities underlying the regulation of EMT and may infer the barriers of plasticity in the 3D genome context.

Abstract:
Endocrine therapy resistance frequently develops in estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we show that 3-dimensional (3D) chromatin interactions both within and between topologically associating domains (TADs) frequently change in ER+ endocrine-resistant breast cancer cells and that the differential interactions are enriched for resistance-associated genetic variants at CTCF-bound anchors. Ectopic chromatin interactions are preferentially enriched at active enhancers and promoters and ER binding sites, and are associated with altered expression of ER-regulated genes, consistent with dynamic remodelling of ER pathways accompanying the development of endocrine resistance. We observe that loss of 3D chromatin interactions often occurs coincidently with hypermethylation and loss of ER binding. Alterations in active A and inactive B chromosomal compartments are also associated with decreased ER binding and atypical interactions and gene expression. Together, our results suggest that 3D epigenome remodelling is a key mechanism underlying endocrine resistance in ER+ breast cancer.

Date: 2020-08-12

Abstract:
The hierarchical three-dimensional folding of the mammalian genome constitutes an important regulatory layer of gene expression and cell fate control during processes such as development and tumorigenesis. Accumulating evidence supports the existence of complex topological assemblies in which multiple genes and regulatory elements are frequently interacting with each other in the 3D nucleus. Here, we will discuss the nature, organizational principles, and potential function of such assemblies, including the recently reported enhancer “hubs,” “cliques,” and FIREs (frequently interacting regions) as well as multi-contact hubs. We will also review recent studies that investigate the role of transcription factors (TFs) in driving the topological genome reorganization and hub formation in the context of cell fate transitions and cancer. Finally, we will highlight technological advances that enabled these studies, current limitations, and future directions necessary to advance our understating in the field.

Date: 2025-03

Abstract:
Transcriptional enhancers can regulate individual or multiple genes through long-range three-dimensional (3D) genome interactions, and these interactions are commonly altered in cancer. Yet, the functional relationship between changes in 3D genome interactions associated with regulatory regions and differential gene expression appears context-dependent. In this study, we used HiChIP to capture changes in 3D genome interactions between active regulatory regions of endometrial cancer cells in response to estrogen treatment and uncovered significant differential long-range interactions strongly enriched for estrogen receptor alpha (ER, also known as ESR1)–bound sites (ERBSs). The ERBSs anchoring differential chromatin loops with either a gene's promoter or distal regions were correlated with larger transcriptional responses to estrogen compared with ERBSs not involved in differential 3D genome interactions. To functionally test this observation, CRISPR-based Enhancer-i was used to deactivate specific ERBSs, which revealed a wide range of effects on the transcriptional response to estrogen. However, these effects are only subtly and not significantly stronger for ERBSs in differential chromatin loops. In addition, we observed an enrichment of 3D genome interactions between the promoters of estrogen-upregulated genes and found that looped promoters can work together cooperatively. Overall, our work reveals that estrogen treatment causes large changes in 3D genome structure in endometrial cancer cells; however, these changes are not required for a regulatory region to contribute to an estrogen transcriptional response.

Title: Hi-BDiSCO: folding 3D mesoscale genome structures from Hi-C data using brownian dynamics
Authors: Zilong Li, Tamar Schlick
Date: 2024-01-25

Abstract:
The structure and dynamics of the eukaryotic genome are intimately linked to gene regulation and transcriptional activity. Many chromosome conformation capture experiments like Hi-C have been developed to detect genome-wide contact frequencies and quantify loop/compartment structures for different cellular contexts and time-dependent processes. However, a full understanding of these events requires explicit descriptions of representative chromatin and chromosome configurations. With the exponentially growing amount of data from Hi-C experiments, many methods for deriving 3D structures from contact frequency data have been developed. Yet, most reconstruction methods use polymer models with low resolution to predict overall genome structure. Here we present a Brownian Dynamics (BD) approach termed Hi-BDiSCO for producing 3D genome structures from Hi-C and Micro-C data using our mesoscale-resolution chromatin model based on the Discrete Surface Charge Optimization (DiSCO) model. Our approach integrates reconstruction with chromatin simulations at nucleosome resolution with appropriate biophysical parameters. Following a description of our protocol, we present applications to the NXN, HOXC, HOXA and Fbn2 mouse genes ranging in size from 50 to 100 kb. Such nucleosome-resolution genome structures pave the way for pursuing many biomedical applications related to the epigenomic regulation of chromatin and control of human disease.

Evidence indicates that enhancers are transcriptionally active. Herein, we investigated transcriptionally active enhancers by using cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) combined with epigenetic marks and chromatin interactions. We identified CAGE-tag highly active (CHA) enhancers as distant regulatory elements with CAGE-tag ≥ 90th percentile and overlapping with H3K27ac peaks (4.5% of enhancers). CHA enhancers were conserved between mouse and man and were independent from super-enhancers in predicting cell identity with lower P-values. CHA enhancers had increased open chromatin and a higher recruitment of cell-specific transcription factors as well as molecules involved in 3D genome interactions. HiChIP analysis of enhancer-promoter looping indicated that CHA enhancers had a higher density of anchor loops when compared to regular enhancers. A subset of CHA enhancers and promoters characterized by a high density of chromatin loops and forming hub regulatory units were connected to the promoter of immediate early response genes, genes involved in cancer and encoding for transcription factors. Promoter of genes within hub CHA regulatory units were less likely to be paused. CHA enhancers were enriched in gene variants associated with autoimmune disorders and had looping with causal candidate genes as revealed by Mendelian randomization. Hence, CHA enhancers form a dense hierarchical network of chromatin interactions between regulatory elements and genes involved in cell identity and disorders.

Abstract:
Chromosome structure in mammals is thought to regulate transcription by modulating three-dimensional interactions between enhancers and promoters, notably through CTCF-mediated loops and topologically associating domains (TADs) 1 – 4 . However, how chromosome interactions are actually translated into transcriptional outputs remains unclear. Here, to address this question, we use an assay to position an enhancer at large numbers of densely spaced chromosomal locations relative to a fixed promoter, and measure promoter output and interactions within a genomic region with minimal regulatory and structural complexity. A quantitative analysis of hundreds of cell lines reveals that the transcriptional effect of an enhancer depends on its contact probabilities with the promoter through a nonlinear relationship. Mathematical modelling suggests that nonlinearity might arise from transient enhancer–promoter interactions being translated into slower promoter bursting dynamics in individual cells, therefore uncoupling the temporal dynamics of interactions from those of transcription. This uncovers a potential mechanism of how distal enhancers act from large genomic distances, and of how topologically associating domain boundaries block distal enhancers. Finally, we show that enhancer strength also determines absolute transcription levels as well as the sensitivity of a promoter to CTCF-mediated transcriptional insulation. Our measurements establish general principles for the context-dependent role of chromosome structure in long-range transcriptional regulation.

Title: A review of deep learning models for the prediction of chromatin interactions with DNA and epigenomic profiles
Authors: Yunlong Wang, Siyuan Kong, Cong Zhou, Yanfang Wang, Yubo Zhang, Yaping Fang, Guoliang Li

Abstract:
Advances in three-dimensional (3D) genomics have revealed the spatial characteristics of chromatin interactions in gene expression regulation, which is crucial for understanding molecular mechanisms in biological processes. High-throughput technologies like ChIA-PET, Hi-C, and their derivatives methods have greatly enhanced our knowledge of 3D chromatin architecture. However, the chromatin interaction mechanisms remain largely unexplored. Deep learning, with its powerful feature extraction and pattern recognition capabilities, offers a promising approach for integrating multi-omics data, to build accurate predictive models of chromatin interaction matrices. This review systematically summarizes recent advances in chromatin interaction matrix prediction models. By integrating DNA sequences and epigenetic signals, we investigate the latest developments in these methods. This article details various models, focusing on how one-dimensional (1D) information transforms into the 3D structure chromatin interactions, and how the integration of different deep learning modules specifically affects model accuracy. Additionally, we discuss the critical role of DNA sequence information and epigenetic markers in shaping 3D genome interaction patterns. Finally, this review addresses the challenges in predicting chromatin interaction matrices, in order to improve the precise mapping of chromatin interaction matrices and DNA sequence, and supporting the transformation and theoretical development of 3D genomics across biological systems.

Abstract:
3D organization of the genome plays a critical role in regulating gene expression. How 3D-genome organization differs among different cell types and relates to cell type–dependent transcriptional regulation remains unclear. Here, we used genome-scale DNA and RNA imaging to investigate 3D-genome organization in transcriptionally distinct cell types in the mouse cerebral cortex. We uncovered a wide spectrum of differences in the nuclear architecture and 3D-genome organization among different cell types, ranging from the size of the cell nucleus to higher-order chromosome structures and radial positioning of chromatin loci within the nucleus. These cell type–dependent variations in nuclear architecture and chromatin organization exhibit strong correlations with both the total transcriptional activity of the cell and transcriptional regulation of cell type–specific marker genes. Moreover, we found that the methylated DNA binding protein MeCP2 promotes active-inactive chromatin segregation and regulates transcription in a nuclear radial position–dependent manner that is highly correlated with its function in modulating active-inactive chromatin compartmentalization.

Abstract:
Enhancer–promoter communication is known to regulate spatiotemporal dynamics of gene expression. Several methods are available to capture enhancer–promoter interactions, but they either require large amounts of starting materials and are costly, or provide a relative low resolution in chromatin contact maps. Here, we present nicking enzyme-assisted open chromatin interaction capture (NicE-C), a method that leverages nicking enzyme–mediated open chromatin profiling and chromosome conformation capture to enable robust and cost-effective detection of open chromatin interactions at high resolution, especially enhancer–promoter interactions. Using TNF stimulation and mouse kidney aging as models, we applied NicE-C to reveal characteristics of dynamic enhancer–promoter interactions.

Abstract:
The three-dimensional (3D) genome structure plays a fundamental role in gene regulation and cellular functions. Recent studies in 3D genomics inferred the very basic functional chromatin folding structures known as chromatin loops, the long-range chromatin interactions that are mediated by protein factors and dynamically extruded by cohesin. We combined the use of FISH staining of a very short (33 kb) chromatin fragment, interferometric photoactivated localization microscopy (iPALM), and traveling salesman problem-based heuristic loop reconstruction algorithm from an image of the one of the strongest CTCF-mediated chromatin loops in human lymphoblastoid cells. In total, we have generated thirteen good quality images of the target chromatin region with 2–22 nm oligo probe localization precision. We visualized the shape of the single chromatin loops with unprecedented genomic resolution which allowed us to study the structural heterogeneity of chromatin looping. We were able to compare the physical distance maps from all reconstructed image-driven computational models with contact frequencies observed by ChIA-PET and Hi-C genomic-driven methods to examine the concordance between single cell imaging and population based genomic data.

Abstract:
The dynamics of three-dimensional (3D) genome organization are essential to transcriptional regulation. While enhancers regulate spatiotemporal gene expression, chromatin looping is a means for enhancer-promoter interactions yielding cell-type-specific gene expression. Further, non-canonical DNA secondary structures, such as G-quadruplexes (G4s), are related to increased gene expression. However, the role of G4s in promoter-distal regulatory elements, such as super-enhancers (SE), and in chromatin looping has remained elusive. Here we show that mature microRNA 9 ( miR-9 ) is enriched at promoters and SE of genes that are inducible by transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFB1) signaling. Moreover, we find that miR-9 is required for formation of G4s, promoter-super-enhancer looping and broad domains of the euchromatin histone mark H3K4me3 at TGFB1-responsive genes. Our study places miR-9 in the same functional context with G4s and promoter-enhancer interactions during 3D genome organization and transcriptional activation induced by TGFB1 signaling, a critical signaling pathway in cancer and fibrosis.

Abstract:
Chromatin architecture regulates gene expression and shapes cellular identity, particularly in neuronal cells. Specifically, polycomb group (PcG) proteins enable establishment and maintenance of neuronal cell type by reorganizing chromatin into repressive domains that limit the expression of fate-determining genes and sustain distinct gene expression patterns in neurons. Here, we map the 3D genome architecture in neuronal and non-neuronal cells isolated from the Wernicke's area of four human brains and comprehensively analyze neuron-specific aspects of chromatin organization. We find that genome segregation into active and inactive compartments is greatly reduced in neurons compared to other brain cells. Furthermore, neuronal Hi-C maps reveal strong long-range interactions, forming a specific network of PcG-mediated contacts in neurons that is nearly absent in other brain cells. These interacting loci contain developmental transcription factors with repressed expression in neurons and other mature brain cells. But only in neurons, they are rich in bivalent promoters occupied by H3K4me3 histone modification together with H3K27me3, which points to a possible functional role of PcG contacts in neurons. Importantly, other layers of chromatin organization also exhibit a distinct structure in neurons, characterized by an increase in short-range interactions and a decrease in long-range ones.

Title: Systematic and synthetic approaches to rewire regulatory networks
Authors: Jimin Park, Harris H. Wang
Date: 2018-01-03

Abstract:
Microbial gene regulatory networks are composed of cis- and trans-components that in concert act to control essential and adaptive cellular functions. Regulatory components and interactions evolve to adopt new configurations through mutations and network rewiring events, resulting in novel phenotypes that may benefit the cell. Advances in high-throughput DNA synthesis and sequencing have enabled the development of new tools and approaches to better characterize and perturb various elements of regulatory networks. Here, we highlight key recent approaches to systematically dissect the sequence space of cis-regulatory elements and trans-regulators as well as their inter-connections. These efforts yield fundamental insights into the architecture, robustness, and dynamics of gene regulation and provide models and design principles for building synthetic regulatory networks for a variety of practical applications.

Title: Discovering and Constructing ceRNA-miRNA-Target Gene Regulatory Networks during Anther Development in Maize
Authors: Ziwen Li, Xueli An, Taotao Zhu, Tingwei Yan, Suowei Wu, Youhui Tian, Jinping Li, Xiangyuan Wan
Date: 2019-07-15

Abstract:
The “competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) hypothesis” has recently been proposed for a new type of gene regulatory model in many organisms. Anther development is a crucial biological process in plant reproduction, and its gene regulatory network (GRN) has been gradually revealed during the past two decades. However, it is still unknown whether ceRNAs contribute to anther development and sexual reproduction in plants. We performed RNA and small RNA sequencing of anther tissues sampled at three developmental stages in two maize lines. A total of 28,233 stably transcribed loci, 61 known and 51 potentially novel microRNAs (miRNAs) were identified from the transcriptomes. Predicted ceRNAs and target genes were found to conserve in sequences of recognition sites where their corresponding miRNAs bound. We then reconstructed 79 ceRNA-miRNA-target gene regulatory networks consisting of 51 known miRNAs, 28 potentially novel miRNAs, 619 ceRNA-miRNA pairs, and 869 miRNA-target gene pairs. More than half of the regulation pairs showed significant negative correlations at transcriptional levels. Several well-studied miRNA-target gene pairs associated with plant flower development were located in some networks, including miR156 - SPL , miR159 - MYB , miR160 - ARF , miR164 - NAC , miR172 - AP2 , and miR319 - TCP pairs. Six target genes in the networks were found to be orthologs of functionally confirmed genes participating in anther development in plants. Our results provide an insight that the ceRNA-miRNA-target gene regulatory networks likely contribute to anther development in maize. Further functional studies on a number of ceRNAs, miRNAs, and target genes will facilitate our deep understanding on mechanisms of anther development and sexual plants reproduction.

Date: 2018-09-10

Abstract:
Phenotypic variation is the raw material of adaptive Darwinian evolution. The phenotypic variation found in organismal development is biased towards certain phenotypes, but the molecular mechanisms behind such biases are still poorly understood. Gene regulatory networks have been proposed as one cause of constrained phenotypic variation. However, most pertinent evidence is theoretical rather than experimental. Here, we study evolutionary biases in two synthetic gene regulatory circuits expressed in Escherichia coli that produce a gene expression stripe—a pivotal pattern in embryonic development. The two parental circuits produce the same phenotype, but create it through different regulatory mechanisms. We show that mutations cause distinct novel phenotypes in the two networks and use a combination of experimental measurements, mathematical modelling and DNA sequencing to understand why mutations bring forth only some but not other novel gene expression phenotypes. Our results reveal that the regulatory mechanisms of networks restrict the possible phenotypic variation upon mutation. Consequently, seemingly equivalent networks can indeed be distinct in how they constrain the outcome of further evolution.

Abstract:
Tightly controlled gene expression is a hallmark of multicellular development and is accomplished by transcription factors (TFs) and microRNAs (miRNAs). Although many studies have focused on identifying downstream targets of these molecules, less is known about the factors that regulate their differential expression. We used data from high spatial resolution gene expression experiments and yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) and two-hybrid (Y2H) assays to delineate a subset of interactions occurring within a gene regulatory network (GRN) that determines tissue-specific TF and miRNA expression in plants. We find that upstream TFs are expressed in more diverse cell types than their targets and that promoters that are bound by a relatively large number of TFs correspond to key developmental regulators. The regulatory consequence of many TFs for their target was experimentally determined using genetic analysis. Remarkably, molecular phenotypes were identified for 65% of the TFs, but morphological phenotypes were associated with only 16%. This indicates that the GRN is robust, and that gene expression changes may be canalized or buffered.

Title: Gene Regulatory Networks in Peripheral Mononuclear Cells Reveals Critical Regulatory Modules and Regulators of Multiple Sclerosis

Date: 2019-09-04

Abstract:
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex, demyelinating disease with the involvement of autoimmunity and neurodegeneration. Increasing efforts have been made towards identifying the diagnostic markers to differentiate the classes of MS from other similar neurological conditions. Using a systems biology approach, we constructed four types of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) involved in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The regulatory strength of each GRN across primary progressive MS (PPMS), relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), secondary progressive MS (SPMS), and control were evaluated by an integrity algorithm. Among the constructed GRNs (referred as TF_gene_miRNA), POU3F2_CDK6_hsa-miR-590-3p, MEIS1_CASC3_hsa-miR-1261, STAT3_OGG1_hsa-miR-298, and TCF4_FMR1_hsa-miR-301b were top-ranked and differentially regulated in all classes of MS compared to control. These GRNs showed potential involvement in regulating various molecular pathways such as interleukin, integrin, glypican, sphingosine phosphate, androgen, and Wnt signaling pathways. For validation, the qPCR analysis of the GRN components (TFs, gene, and miRNAs) in PBMCs of healthy controls (n = 30), RRMS (n = 14), PPMS (n = 13) and SPMS (n = 12) were carried out. Real-time expression analysis of GRNs showed a similar regulatory pattern as derived from our systems biology approach. Also, our study provided several novel GRNs that regulate unique and common molecular mechanisms between MS conditions. Hence, these regulatory components of GRNs will help to understand the disease mechanism across MS classes and further insight may though light towards diagnosis.

Title: Cis-regulatory evolution integrated the Bric-à-brac transcription factors into a novel fruit fly gene regulatory network
Authors: Maxwell J Roeske, Eric M Camino, Sumant Grover, Mark Rebeiz, Thomas Michael Williams
Date: 2018-01-03

Abstract:
Gene expression evolution through gene regulatory network (GRN) changes has gained appreciation as a driver of morphological evolution. However, understanding how GRNs evolve is hampered by finding relevant cis -regulatory element (CRE) mutations, and interpreting the protein-DNA interactions they alter. We investigated evolutionary changes in the duplicated Bric-à-brac (Bab) transcription factors and a key Bab target gene in a GRN underlying the novel dimorphic pigmentation of D. melanogaster and its relatives. It has remained uncertain how Bab was integrated within the pigmentation GRN. Here, we show that the ancestral transcription factor activity of Bab gained a role in sculpting sex-specific pigmentation through the evolution of binding sites in a CRE of the pigment-promoting yellow gene. This work demonstrates how a new trait can evolve by incorporating existing transcription factors into a GRN through CRE evolution, an evolutionary path likely to predominate newly evolved functions of transcription factors.

Title: Quantifying cancer cell plasticity with gene regulatory networks and single-cell dynamics
Authors: Sarah M. Groves, Vito Quaranta
Date: 2023-09-04

Abstract:
Phenotypic plasticity of cancer cells can lead to complex cell state dynamics during tumor progression and acquired resistance. Highly plastic stem-like states may be inherently drug-resistant. Moreover, cell state dynamics in response to therapy allow a tumor to evade treatment. In both scenarios, quantifying plasticity is essential for identifying high-plasticity states or elucidating transition paths between states. Currently, methods to quantify plasticity tend to focus on 1) quantification of quasi-potential based on the underlying gene regulatory network dynamics of the system; or 2) inference of cell potency based on trajectory inference or lineage tracing in single-cell dynamics. Here, we explore both of these approaches and associated computational tools. We then discuss implications of each approach to plasticity metrics, and relevance to cancer treatment strategies.

Title: Using Network-Based Machine Learning to Predict Transcription Factors Involved in Drought Resistance
Authors: Chirag Gupta, Venkategowda Ramegowda, Supratim Basu, Andy Pereira
Date: 2021-06-24

Abstract:
Gene regulatory networks underpin stress response pathways in plants. However, parsing these networks to prioritize key genes underlying a particular trait is challenging. Here, we have built the Gene Regulation and Association Network (GRAiN) of rice ( Oryza sativa ). GRAiN is an interactive query-based web-platform that allows users to study functional relationships between transcription factors (TFs) and genetic modules underlying abiotic-stress responses. We built GRAiN by applying a combination of different network inference algorithms to publicly available gene expression data. We propose a supervised machine learning framework that complements GRAiN in prioritizing genes that regulate stress signal transduction and modulate gene expression under drought conditions. Our framework converts intricate network connectivity patterns of 2160 TFs into a single drought score. We observed that TFs with the highest drought scores define the functional, structural, and evolutionary characteristics of drought resistance in rice. Our approach accurately predicted the function of OsbHLH148 TF, which we validated using in vitro protein-DNA binding assays and mRNA sequencing loss-of-function mutants grown under control and drought stress conditions. Our network and the complementary machine learning strategy lends itself to predicting key regulatory genes underlying other agricultural traits and will assist in the genetic engineering of desirable rice varieties.

Title: Architecture and evolution of the cis -regulatory system of the echinoderm kirrelL gene
Authors: Jian Ming Khor, Charles A Ettensohn, Kathryn Song Eng Cheah
Date: 2022-02-25

Abstract:
The gene regulatory network (GRN) that underlies echinoderm skeletogenesis is a prominent model of GRN architecture and evolution. KirrelL is an essential downstream effector gene in this network and encodes an Ig-superfamily protein required for the fusion of skeletogenic cells and the formation of the skeleton. In this study, we dissected the transcriptional control region of the kirrelL gene of the purple sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus . Using plasmid- and bacterial artificial chromosome-based transgenic reporter assays, we identified key cis -regulatory elements (CREs) and transcription factor inputs that regulate Sp-kirrelL , including direct, positive inputs from two key transcription factors in the skeletogenic GRN, Alx1 and Ets1. We next identified kirrelL cis -regulatory regions from seven other echinoderm species that together represent all classes within the phylum. By introducing these heterologous regulatory regions into developing sea urchin embryos we provide evidence of their remarkable conservation across ~500 million years of evolution. We dissected in detail the kirrelL regulatory region of the sea star, Patiria miniata , and demonstrated that it also receives direct inputs from Alx1 and Ets1. Our findings identify kirrelL as a component of the ancestral echinoderm skeletogenic GRN. They support the view that GRN subcircuits, including specific transcription factor–CRE interactions, can remain stable over vast periods of evolutionary history. Lastly, our analysis of kirrelL establishes direct linkages between a developmental GRN and an effector gene that controls a key morphogenetic cell behavior, cell–cell fusion, providing a paradigm for extending the explanatory power of GRNs.

Abstract:
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology provides an unprecedented opportunity to understand gene functions and interactions at single-cell resolution. While computational tools for scRNA-seq data analysis to decipher differential gene expression profiles and differential pathway expression exist, we still lack methods to learn differential regulatory disease mechanisms directly from the single-cell data. Here, we provide a new methodology, named DiNiro, to unravel such mechanisms de novo and report them as small, easily interpretable transcriptional regulatory network modules. We demonstrate that DiNiro is able to uncover novel, relevant, and deep mechanistic models that not just predict but explain differential cellular gene expression programs. DiNiro is available at https://exbio.wzw.tum.de/diniro/ .

Title: Single-cell multi-omics analysis identifies context-specific gene regulatory gates and mechanisms
Authors: Seyed Amir Malekpour, Laleh Haghverdi, Mehdi Sadeghi
Date: 2024-05

Abstract:
There is a growing interest in inferring context specific gene regulatory networks from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. This involves identifying the regulatory relationships between transcription factors (TFs) and genes in individual cells, and then characterizing these relationships at the level of specific cell types or cell states. In this study, we introduce scGATE (single-cell gene regulatory gate) as a novel computational tool for inferring TF–gene interaction networks and reconstructing Boolean logic gates involving regulatory TFs using scRNA-seq data. In contrast to current Boolean models, scGATE eliminates the need for individual formulations and likelihood calculations for each Boolean rule (e.g. AND, OR, XOR). By employing a Bayesian framework, scGATE infers the Boolean rule after fitting the model to the data, resulting in significant reductions in time-complexities for logic-based studies. We have applied assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (scATAC-seq) data and TF DNA binding motifs to filter out non-relevant TFs in gene regulations. By integrating single-cell clustering with these external cues, scGATE is able to infer context specific networks. The performance of scGATE is evaluated using synthetic and real single-cell multi-omics data from mouse tissues and human blood, demonstrating its superiority over existing tools for reconstructing TF-gene networks. Additionally, scGATE provides a flexible framework for understanding the complex combinatorial and cooperative relationships among TFs regulating target genes by inferring Boolean logic gates among them.

Date: 2020-05-25

Abstract:
Plant responses to environmental and intrinsic signals are tightly controlled by multiple transcription factors (TFs). These TFs and their regulatory connections form gene regulatory networks (GRNs), which provide a blueprint of the transcriptional regulations underlying plant development and environmental responses. This review provides examples of experimental methodologies commonly used to identify regulatory interactions and generate GRNs. Additionally, this review describes network inference techniques that leverage gene expression data to predict regulatory interactions. These computational and experimental methodologies yield complex networks that can identify new regulatory interactions, driving novel hypotheses. Biological properties that contribute to the complexity of GRNs are also described in this review. These include network topology, network size, transient binding of TFs to DNA, and competition between multiple upstream regulators. Finally, this review highlights the potential of machine learning approaches to leverage gene expression data to predict phenotypic outputs.

Abstract:
Stem cells exist in vitro in a spectrum of interconvertible pluripotent states. Analyzing hundreds of hiPSCs derived from different individuals, we show the proportions of these pluripotent states vary considerably across lines. We discover 13 gene network modules (GNMs) and 13 regulatory network modules (RNMs), which are highly correlated with each other suggesting that the coordinated co-accessibility of regulatory elements in the RNMs likely underlie the coordinated expression of genes in the GNMs. Epigenetic analyses reveal that regulatory networks underlying self-renewal and pluripotency are more complex than previously realized. Genetic analyses identify thousands of regulatory variants that overlapped predicted transcription factor binding sites and are associated with chromatin accessibility in the hiPSCs. We show that the master regulator of pluripotency, the NANOG-OCT4 Complex, and its associated network are significantly enriched for regulatory variants with large effects, suggesting that they play a role in the varying cellular proportions of pluripotency states between hiPSCs. Our work bins tens of thousands of regulatory elements in hiPSCs into discrete regulatory networks, shows that pluripotency and self-renewal processes have a surprising level of regulatory complexity, and suggests that genetic factors may contribute to cell state transitions in human iPSC lines.

Title: Spatiotemporal network motif reveals the biological traits of developmental gene regulatory networks in Drosophila melanogaster
Authors: Man-Sun Kim, Jeong-Rae Kim, Dongsan Kim, Arthur D Lander, Kwang-Hyun Cho
Date: 2012

Abstract:
Network motifs provided a “conceptual tool” for understanding the functional principles of biological networks, but such motifs have primarily been used to consider static network structures. Static networks, however, cannot be used to reveal time- and region-specific traits of biological systems. To overcome this limitation, we proposed the concept of a “spatiotemporal network motif,” a spatiotemporal sequence of network motifs of sub-networks which are active only at specific time points and body parts. On the basis of this concept, we analyzed the developmental gene regulatory network of the Drosophila melanogaster embryo. We identified spatiotemporal network motifs and investigated their distribution pattern in time and space. As a result, we found how key developmental processes are temporally and spatially regulated by the gene network. In particular, we found that nested feedback loops appeared frequently throughout the entire developmental process. From mathematical simulations, we found that mutual inhibition in the nested feedback loops contributes to the formation of spatial expression patterns. Taken together, the proposed concept and the simulations can be used to unravel the design principle of developmental gene regulatory networks.

Title: From graph topology to ODE models for gene regulatory networks
Authors: Xiaohan Kang, Bruce Hajek, Yoshie Hanzawa, Enrique Hernandez-Lemus, Enrique Hernandez-Lemus, Enrique Hernandez-Lemus
Date: 2020

Abstract:
A gene regulatory network can be described at a high level by a directed graph with signed edges, and at a more detailed level by a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The former qualitatively models the causal regulatory interactions between ordered pairs of genes, while the latter quantitatively models the time-varying concentrations of mRNA and proteins. This paper clarifies the connection between the two types of models. We propose a property, called the constant sign property, for a general class of ODE models. The constant sign property characterizes the set of conditions (system parameters, external signals, or internal states) under which an ODE model is consistent with a signed, directed graph. If the constant sign property for an ODE model holds globally for all conditions, then the ODE model has a single signed, directed graph. If the constant sign property for an ODE model only holds locally, which may be more typical, then the ODE model corresponds to different graphs under different sets of conditions. In addition, two versions of constant sign property are given and a relationship between them is proved. As an example, the ODE models that capture the effect of cis -regulatory elements involving protein complex binding, based on the model in the GeneNetWeaver source code, are described in detail and shown to satisfy the global constant sign property with a unique consistent gene regulatory graph. Even a single gene regulatory graph is shown to have many ODE models of GeneNetWeaver type consistent with it due to combinatorial complexity and continuous parameters. Finally the question of how closely data generated by one ODE model can be fit by another ODE model is explored. It is observed that the fit is better if the two models come from the same graph.

Title: Identifying noncoding risk variants using disease-relevant gene regulatory networks
Authors: Long Gao, Yasin Uzun, Peng Gao, Bing He, Xiaoke Ma, Jiahui Wang, Shizhong Han, Kai Tan
Date: 2018-02-16

Abstract:
Identifying noncoding risk variants remains a challenging task. Because noncoding variants exert their effects in the context of a gene regulatory network (GRN), we hypothesize that explicit use of disease-relevant GRNs can significantly improve the inference accuracy of noncoding risk variants. We describe Annotation of Regulatory Variants using Integrated Networks (ARVIN), a general computational framework for predicting causal noncoding variants. It employs a set of novel regulatory network-based features, combined with sequence-based features to infer noncoding risk variants. Using known causal variants in gene promoters and enhancers in a number of diseases, we show ARVIN outperforms state-of-the-art methods that use sequence-based features alone. Additional experimental validation using reporter assay further demonstrates the accuracy of ARVIN. Application of ARVIN to seven autoimmune diseases provides a holistic view of the gene subnetwork perturbed by the combinatorial action of the entire set of risk noncoding mutations.

Title: Network Approaches for Dissecting the Immune System
Authors: Hao Shi, Koon-Kiu Yan, Liang Ding, Chenxi Qian, Hongbo Chi, Jiyang Yu
Date: 2020-08-21

Abstract:
The immune system is a complex biological network composed of hierarchically organized genes, proteins, and cellular components that combat external pathogens and monitor the onset of internal disease. To meet and ultimately defeat these challenges, the immune system orchestrates an exquisitely complex interplay of numerous cells, often with highly specialized functions, in a tissue-specific manner. One of the major methodologies of systems immunology is to measure quantitatively the components and interaction levels in the immunologic networks to construct a computational network and predict the response of the components to perturbations. The recent advances in high-throughput sequencing techniques have provided us with a powerful approach to dissecting the complexity of the immune system. Here we summarize the latest progress in integrating omics data and network approaches to construct networks and to infer the underlying signaling and transcriptional landscape, as well as cell-cell communication, in the immune system, with a focus on hematopoiesis, adaptive immunity, and tumor immunology. Understanding the network regulation of immune cells has provided new insights into immune homeostasis and disease, with important therapeutic implications for inflammation, cancer, and other immune-mediated disorders.

Date: 2019-11-13

Abstract:
Recent technological advances for the acquisition of multi- omics data have allowed an unprecedented understanding of the complex intricacies of biological systems. In parallel, a myriad of computational analysis techniques and bioinformatics tools have been developed, with many efforts directed towards the creation and interpretation of networks from this data. In this review, we begin by examining key network concepts and terminology. Then, computational tools that allow for their construction and analysis from high-throughput omics datasets are presented. We focus on the study of functional relationships such as co-expression, protein–protein interactions, and regulatory interactions that are particularly amenable to modeling using the framework of networks. We envisage that many potential users of these analytical strategies may not be completely literate in programming languages and code adaptation, and for this reason, emphasis is given to tools’ user-friendliness, including plugins for the widely adopted Cytoscape software, an open-source, cross-platform tool for network analysis, visualization, and data integration.

Title: A single-cell multimodal view on gene regulatory network inference from transcriptomics and chromatin accessibility data
Authors: Jens Uwe Loers, Vanessa Vermeirssen
Date: 2024-09

Abstract:
Eukaryotic gene regulation is a combinatorial, dynamic, and quantitative process that plays a vital role in development and disease and can be modeled at a systems level in gene regulatory networks (GRNs). The wealth of multi-omics data measured on the same samples and even on the same cells has lifted the field of GRN inference to the next stage. Combinations of (single-cell) transcriptomics and chromatin accessibility allow the prediction of fine-grained regulatory programs that go beyond mere correlation of transcription factor and target gene expression, with enhancer GRNs (eGRNs) modeling molecular interactions between transcription factors, regulatory elements, and target genes. In this review, we highlight the key components for successful (e)GRN inference from (sc)RNA-seq and (sc)ATAC-seq data exemplified by state-of-the-art methods as well as open challenges and future developments. Moreover, we address preprocessing strategies, metacell generation and computational omics pairing, transcription factor binding site detection, and linear and three-dimensional approaches to identify chromatin interactions as well as dynamic and causal eGRN inference. We believe that the integration of transcriptomics together with epigenomics data at a single-cell level is the new standard for mechanistic network inference, and that it can be further advanced with integrating additional omics layers and spatiotemporal data, as well as with shifting the focus towards more quantitative and causal modeling strategies.

Abstract:
The rise of single-cell data highlights the need for a nondeterministic view of gene expression, while offering new opportunities regarding gene regulatory network inference. We recently introduced two strategies that specifically exploit time-course data, where single-cell profiling is performed after a stimulus: HARISSA, a mechanistic network model with a highly efficient simulation procedure, and CARDAMOM, a scalable inference method seen as model calibration. Here, we combine the two approaches and show that the same model driven by transcriptional bursting can be used simultaneously as an inference tool, to reconstruct biologically relevant networks, and as a simulation tool, to generate realistic transcriptional profiles emerging from gene interactions. We verify that CARDAMOM quantitatively reconstructs causal links when the data is simulated from HARISSA, and demonstrate its performance on experimental data collected on in vitro differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells. Overall, this integrated strategy largely overcomes the limitations of disconnected inference and simulation.

Title: Common Themes and Future Challenges in Understanding Gene Regulatory Network Evolution
Authors: Isabella Schember, Marc S. Halfon
Date: 2022-02-01

Abstract:
A major driving force behind the evolution of species-specific traits and novel structures is alterations in gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Comprehending evolution therefore requires an understanding of the nature of changes in GRN structure and the responsible mechanisms. Here, we review two insect pigmentation GRNs in order to examine common themes in GRN evolution and to reveal some of the challenges associated with investigating changes in GRNs across different evolutionary distances at the molecular level. The pigmentation GRN in Drosophila melanogaster and other drosophilids is a well-defined network for which studies from closely related species illuminate the different ways co-option of regulators can occur. The pigmentation GRN for butterflies of the Heliconius species group is less fully detailed but it is emerging as a useful model for exploring important questions about redundancy and modularity in cis -regulatory systems. Both GRNs serve to highlight the ways in which redeployment of trans -acting factors can lead to GRN rewiring and network co-option. To gain insight into GRN evolution, we discuss the importance of defining GRN architecture at multiple levels both within and between species and of utilizing a range of complementary approaches.

Date: 2023-06

Abstract:
The genetic information coded in DNA leads to trait innovation via a gene regulatory network (GRN) in development. Here, we developed a conserved non-coding element interpretation method to integrate multi-omics data into gene r eg ulatory network (CNEReg) to investigate the ruminant multi-chambered stomach innovation. We generated paired expression and chromatin accessibility data during rumen and esophagus development in sheep, and revealed 1601 active ruminant-specific conserved non-coding elements (active-RSCNEs). To interpret the function of these active-RSCNEs, we defined toolkit transcription factors (TTFs) and modeled their regulation on rumen-specific genes via batteries of active-RSCNEs during development. Our developmental GRN revealed 18 TTFs and 313 active-RSCNEs regulating 7 rumen functional modules. Notably, 6 TTFs (OTX1, SOX21, HOXC8, SOX2, TP63, and PPARG), as well as 16 active-RSCNEs, functionally distinguished the rumen from the esophagus. Our study provides a systematic approach to understanding how gene regulation evolves and shapes complex traits by putting evo-devo concepts into practice with developmental multi-omics data.

Date: 2024-03-27

Abstract:
Despite numerous studies in the field of dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD), a comprehensive understanding of this devastating disease remains elusive. Bulk transcriptomics have provided insights into the underlying genetic factors at a high level. Subsequent technological advancements have focused on single‐cell omics, encompassing techniques such as single‐cell RNA sequencing and epigenomics, enabling the capture of RNA transcripts and chromatin states at a single cell or nucleus resolution. Furthermore, the emergence of spatial omics has allowed the study of gene responses in the vicinity of amyloid beta plaques or across various brain regions. With the vast amount of data generated, utilizing gene regulatory networks to comprehensively study this disease has become essential. This review delves into some techniques employed in the field of AD, explores the discoveries made using these techniques, and provides insights into the future of the field.

Date: 2020-12-04

Abstract:
The extensive array of morphological diversity among animal taxa represents the product of millions of years of evolution. Morphology is the output of development, therefore phenotypic evolution arises from changes to the topology of the gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that control the highly coordinated process of embryogenesis. A particular challenge in understanding the origins of animal diversity lies in determining how GRNs incorporate novelty while preserving the overall stability of the network, and hence, embryonic viability. Here we assemble a comprehensive GRN for endomesoderm specification in the sea star from zygote through gastrulation that corresponds to the GRN for sea urchin development of equivalent territories and stages. Comparison of the GRNs identifies how novelty is incorporated in early development. We show how the GRN is resilient to the introduction of a transcription factor, pmar1 , the inclusion of which leads to a switch between two stable modes of Delta-Notch signaling. Signaling pathways can function in multiple modes and we propose that GRN changes that lead to switches between modes may be a common evolutionary mechanism for changes in embryogenesis. Our data additionally proposes a model in which evolutionarily conserved network motifs, or kernels, may function throughout development to stabilize these signaling transitions.

Title: Continuous lifelong learning for modeling of gene regulation from single cell multiome data by leveraging atlas-scale external data
Authors: Qiuyue Yuan, Zhana Duren
Date: 2023-08-03

Abstract:
Accurate context-specific Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) inference from genomics data is a crucial task in computational biology. However, existing methods face limitations, such as reliance on gene expression data alone, lower resolution from bulk data, and data scarcity for specific cellular systems. Despite recent technological advancements, including single-cell sequencing and the integration of ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data, learning such complex mechanisms from limited independent data points still presents a daunting challenge, impeding GRN inference accuracy. To overcome this challenge, we present LINGER (LIfelong neural Network for GEne Regulation), a novel deep learning-based method to infer GRNs from single-cell multiome data with paired gene expression and chromatin accessibility data from the same cell. LINGER incorporates both 1) atlas-scale external bulk data across diverse cellular contexts and 2) the knowledge of transcription factor (TF) motif matching to cis -regulatory elements as a manifold regularization to address the challenge of limited data and extensive parameter space in GRN inference. Our results demonstrate that LINGER achieves 2–3 fold higher accuracy over existing methods. LINGER reveals a complex regulatory landscape of genome-wide association studies, enabling enhanced interpretation of disease-associated variants and genes. Additionally, following the GRN inference from a reference sc-multiome data, LINGER allows for the estimation of TF activity solely from bulk or single-cell gene expression data, leveraging the abundance of available gene expression data to identify driver regulators from case-control studies. Overall, LINGER provides a comprehensive tool for robust gene regulation inference from genomics data, empowering deeper insights into cellular mechanisms.

Authors: Matti Hoch, Jannik Rauthe, Konstantin Cesnulevicius, Myron Schultz, David Lescheid, Olaf Wolkenhauer, Valerio Chiurchiù, Shailendra Gupta
Date: 2023-02-22

Abstract:
Lipid mediators are important regulators in inflammatory responses, and their biosynthetic pathways are targeted by commonly used anti-inflammatory drugs. Switching from pro-inflammatory lipid mediators (PIMs) to specialized pro-resolving (SPMs) is a critical step toward acute inflammation resolution and preventing chronic inflammation. Although the biosynthetic pathways and enzymes for PIMs and SPMs have now been largely identified, the actual transcriptional profiles underlying the immune cell type-specific transcriptional profiles of these mediators are still unknown. Using the Atlas of Inflammation Resolution, we created a large network of gene regulatory interactions linked to the biosynthesis of SPMs and PIMs. By mapping single-cell sequencing data, we identified cell type-specific gene regulatory networks of the lipid mediator biosynthesis. Using machine learning approaches combined with network features, we identified cell clusters of similar transcriptional regulation and demonstrated how specific immune cell activation affects PIM and SPM profiles. We found substantial differences in regulatory networks in related cells, accounting for network-based preprocessing in functional single-cell analyses. Our results not only provide further insight into the gene regulation of lipid mediators in the immune response but also shed light on the contribution of selected cell types in their biosynthesis.

Abstract:
Wound response programs are often activated during neoplastic growth in tumors. In both wound repair and tumor growth, cells respond to acute stress and balance the activation of multiple programs, including apoptosis, proliferation, and cell migration. Central to those responses are the activation of the JNK/MAPK and JAK/STAT signaling pathways. Yet, to what extent these signaling cascades interact at the cis -regulatory level and how they orchestrate different regulatory and phenotypic responses is still unclear. Here, we aim to characterize the regulatory states that emerge and cooperate in the wound response, using the Drosophila melanogaster wing disc as a model system, and compare these with cancer cell states induced by ras V12 scrib -/- in the eye disc. We used single-cell multiome profiling to derive enhancer gene regulatory networks (eGRNs) by integrating chromatin accessibility and gene expression signals. We identify a ‘proliferative’ eGRN, active in the majority of wounded cells and controlled by AP-1 and STAT. In a smaller, but distinct population of wound cells, a ‘senescent’ eGRN is activated and driven by C/EBP-like transcription factors (Irbp18, Xrp1, Slow border, and Vrille) and Scalloped. These two eGRN signatures are found to be active in tumor cells at both gene expression and chromatin accessibility levels. Our single-cell multiome and eGRNs resource offers an in-depth characterization of the senescence markers, together with a new perspective on the shared gene regulatory programs acting during wound response and oncogenesis.

Abstract:
Following amputation, zebrafish regenerate their injured caudal fin through lineage-restricted reprogramming. Although previous studies have charted various genetic and epigenetic dimensions of this process, the intricate gene regulatory programs shared by, or unique to, different regenerating cell types remain underinvestigated. Here, we mapped the regulatory landscape of fin regeneration by applying paired snRNA-seq and snATAC-seq on uninjured and regenerating fins. This map delineates the regulatory dynamics of predominant cell populations at multiple stages of regeneration. We observe a marked increase in the accessibility of chromatin regions associated with regenerative and developmental processes at 1 dpa, followed by a gradual closure across major cell types at later stages. This pattern is distinct from that of transcriptomic dynamics, which is characterized by several waves of gene upregulation and downregulation. We identified and in vivo validated cell-type-specific and position-specific regeneration-responsive enhancers and constructed regulatory networks by cell type and stage. Our single-cell resolution transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility map across regenerative stages provides new insights into regeneration regulatory mechanisms and serves as a valuable resource for the community.

Date: 2021-01

Abstract:
Deciphering gene regulatory networks (GRNs) is both a promise and challenge of systems biology. The promise lies in identifying key transcription factors (TFs) that enable an organism to react to changes in its environment. The challenge lies in validating GRNs that involve hundreds of TFs with hundreds of thousands of interactions with their genome-wide targets experimentally determined by high-throughput sequencing. To address this challenge, we developed ConnecTF, a species-independent, web-based platform that integrates genome-wide studies of TF–target binding, TF–target regulation, and other TF-centric omic datasets and uses these to build and refine validated or inferred GRNs. We demonstrate the functionality of ConnecTF by showing how integration within and across TF–target datasets uncovers biological insights. Case study 1 uses integration of TF–target gene regulation and binding datasets to uncover TF mode-of-action and identify potential TF partners for 14 TFs in abscisic acid signaling. Case study 2 demonstrates how genome-wide TF–target data and automated functions in ConnecTF are used in precision/recall analysis and pruning of an inferred GRN for nitrogen signaling. Case study 3 uses ConnecTF to chart a network path from NLP7, a master TF in nitrogen signaling, to direct secondary TF 2 s and to its indirect targets in a Network Walking approach. The public version of ConnecTF ( https://ConnecTF.org ) contains 3,738,278 TF–target interactions for 423 TFs in Arabidopsis, 839,210 TF–target interactions for 139 TFs in maize ( Zea mays ), and 293,094 TF–target interactions for 26 TFs in rice ( Oryza sativa ). The database and tools in ConnecTF will advance the exploration of GRNs in plant systems biology applications for model and crop species.

Title: Transcriptional circuitry atlas of genetic diverse unstimulated murine and human macrophages define disparity in population-wide innate immunity
Authors: Bharat Mishra, Mohammad Athar, M. Shahid Mukhtar
Date: 2021-04-01

Abstract:
Macrophages are ubiquitous custodians of tissues, which play decisive role in maintaining cellular homeostasis through regulatory immune responses. Within tissues, macrophage exhibit extremely heterogeneous population with varying functions orchestrated through regulatory response, which can be further exacerbated in diverse genetic backgrounds. Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) offer comprehensive understanding of cellular regulatory behavior by unfolding the transcription factors (TFs) and regulated target genes. RNA-Seq coupled with ATAC-Seq has revolutionized the regulome landscape influenced by gene expression modeling. Here, we employ an integrative multi-omics systems biology-based analysis and generated GRNs derived from the unstimulated bone marrow-derived macrophages of five inbred genetically defined murine strains, which are reported to be linked with most of the population-wide human genetic variants. Our probabilistic modeling of a basal hemostasis pan regulatory repertoire in diverse macrophages discovered 96 TFs targeting 6279 genes representing 468,291 interactions across five inbred murine strains. Subsequently, we identify core and distinctive GRN sub-networks in unstimulated macrophages to describe the system-wide conservation and dissimilarities, respectively across five murine strains. Our study concludes that discrepancies in unstimulated macrophage-specific regulatory networks not only drives the basal functional plasticity within genetic backgrounds, additionally aid in understanding the complexity of racial disparity among the human population during stress.

Authors: Sean de la O, Xinkai Yao, Sean Chang, Zhe Liu, Julie B. Sneddon
Date: 2023-07

Abstract:
Numerous studies have characterized the existence of cell subtypes, along with their corresponding transcriptional profiles, within the developing mouse pancreas. The upstream mechanisms that initiate and maintain gene expression programs across cell states, however, remain largely unknown. Here, we generate single-nucleus ATAC-Sequencing data of developing murine pancreas and perform an integrated, multi-omic analysis of both chromatin accessibility and RNA expression to describe the chromatin landscape of the developing pancreas at both E14.5 and E17.5 at single-cell resolution. We identify candidate transcription factors regulating cell fate and construct gene regulatory networks of active transcription factor binding to regulatory regions of downstream target genes. This work serves as a valuable resource for the field of pancreatic biology in general and contributes to our understanding of lineage plasticity among endocrine cell types. In addition, these data identify which epigenetic states should be represented in the differentiation of stem cells to the pancreatic beta cell fate to best recapitulate in vitro the gene regulatory networks that are critical for progression along the beta cell lineage in vivo .

Abstract:
Inference and analysis of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) require software that integrates multi-omic data from various sources. The Network Zoo (netZoo; netzoo.github.io) is a collection of open-source methods to infer GRNs, conduct differential network analyses, estimate community structure, and explore the transitions between biological states. The netZoo builds on our ongoing development of network methods, harmonizing the implementations in various computing languages and between methods to allow better integration of these tools into analytical pipelines. We demonstrate the utility using multi-omic data from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia. We will continue to expand the netZoo to incorporate additional methods. The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s13059-023-02877-1.

Title: SCING: Inference of robust, interpretable gene regulatory networks from single cell and spatial transcriptomics
Authors: Russell Littman, Michael Cheng, Ning Wang, Chao Peng, Xia Yang
Date: 2023-07-21

Abstract:
Gene regulatory network (GRN) inference is an integral part of understanding physiology and disease. Single cell/nuclei RNA-seq (scRNA-seq/snRNA-seq) data has been used to elucidate cell-type GRNs; however, the accuracy and speed of current scRNAseq-based GRN approaches are suboptimal. Here, we present Single Cell INtegrative Gene regulatory network inference (SCING), a gradient boosting and mutual information-based approach for identifying robust GRNs from scRNA-seq, snRNA-seq, and spatial transcriptomics data. Performance evaluation using Perturb-seq datasets, held-out data, and the mouse cell atlas combined with the DisGeNET database demonstrates the improved accuracy and biological interpretability of SCING compared to existing methods. We applied SCING to the entire mouse single cell atlas, human Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and mouse AD spatial transcriptomics. SCING GRNs reveal unique disease subnetwork modeling capabilities, have intrinsic capacity to correct for batch effects, retrieve disease relevant genes and pathways, and are informative on spatial specificity of disease pathogenesis.

Title: Evolutionary Changes in the Chromatin Landscape Contribute to Reorganization of a Developmental Gene Network During Rapid Life History Evolution in Sea Urchins
Authors: Phillip L Davidson, Maria Byrne, Gregory A Wray
Date: 2022-09

Abstract:
Chromatin configuration is highly dynamic during embryonic development in animals, exerting an important point of control in transcriptional regulation. Yet there exists remarkably little information about the role of evolutionary changes in chromatin configuration to the evolution of gene expression and organismal traits. Genome-wide assays of chromatin configuration, coupled with whole-genome alignments, can help address this gap in knowledge in several ways. In this study we present a comparative analysis of regulatory element sequences and accessibility throughout embryogenesis in three sea urchin species with divergent life histories: a lecithotroph Heliocidaris erythrogramma , a closely related planktotroph H. tuberculata , and a distantly related planktotroph Lytechinus variegatus . We identified distinct epigenetic and mutational signatures of evolutionary modifications to the function of putative cis -regulatory elements in H. erythrogramma that have accumulated nonuniformly throughout the genome, suggesting selection, rather than drift, underlies many modifications associated with the derived life history. Specifically, regulatory elements composing the sea urchin developmental gene regulatory network are enriched for signatures of positive selection and accessibility changes which may function to alter binding affinity and access of developmental transcription factors to these sites. Furthermore, regulatory element changes often correlate with divergent expression patterns of genes involved in cell type specification, morphogenesis, and development of other derived traits, suggesting these evolutionary modifications have been consequential for phenotypic evolution in H. erythrogramma . Collectively, our results demonstrate that selective pressures imposed by changes in developmental life history rapidly reshape the cis -regulatory landscape of core developmental genes to generate novel traits and embryonic programs.

Title: scGRN: a comprehensive single-cell gene regulatory network platform of human and mouse
Authors: Xuemei Huang, Chao Song, Guorui Zhang, Ye Li, Yu Zhao, Qinyi Zhang, Yuexin Zhang, Shifan Fan, Jun Zhao, Liyuan Xie, Chunquan Li
Date: 2024-01-05

Abstract:
Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) are interpretable graph models encompassing the regulatory interactions between transcription factors (TFs) and their downstream target genes. Making sense of the topology and dynamics of GRNs is fundamental to interpreting the mechanisms of disease etiology and translating corresponding findings into novel therapies. Recent advances in single-cell multi-omics techniques have prompted the computational inference of GRNs from single-cell transcriptomic and epigenomic data at an unprecedented resolution. Here, we present scGRN ( https://bio.liclab.net/scGRN/ ), a comprehensive single-cell multi-omics gene regulatory network platform of human and mouse. The current version of scGRN catalogs 237 051 cell type-specific GRNs (62 999 692 TF–target gene pairs), covering 160 tissues/cell lines and 1324 single-cell samples. scGRN is the first resource documenting large-scale cell type-specific GRN information of diverse human and mouse conditions inferred from single-cell multi-omics data. We have implemented multiple online tools for effective GRN analysis, including differential TF–target network analysis, TF enrichment analysis, and pathway downstream analysis. We also provided details about TF binding to promoters, super-enhancers and typical enhancers of target genes in GRNs. Taken together, scGRN is an integrative and useful platform for searching, browsing, analyzing, visualizing and downloading GRNs of interest, enabling insight into the differences in regulatory mechanisms across diverse conditions.

Title: PI3K signaling specifies proximal-distal fate by driving a developmental gene regulatory network in SOX9+ mouse lung progenitors

Abstract:
The tips of the developing respiratory buds are home to important progenitor cells marked by the expression of SOX9 and ID2. Early in embryonic development (prior to E13.5), SOX9+progenitors are multipotent, generating both airway and alveolar epithelium, but are selective progenitors of alveolar epithelial cells later in development. Transcription factors, including Sox9, Etv5 , Irx , Mycn , and Foxp1/2 interact in complex gene regulatory networks to control proliferation and differentiation of SOX9+progenitors. Molecular mechanisms by which these transcription factors and other signaling pathways control chromatin state to establish and maintain cell-type identity are not well-defined. Herein, we analyze paired gene expression (RNA-Seq) and chromatin accessibility (ATAC-Seq) data from SOX9+ epithelial progenitor cells (EPCs) during embryonic development in Mus musculus . Widespread changes in chromatin accessibility were observed between E11.5 and E16.5, particularly at distal cis-regulatory elements (e.g. enhancers). Gene regulatory network (GRN) inference identified a common SOX9+ progenitor GRN, implicating phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling in the developmental regulation of SOX9+ progenitor cells. Consistent with this model, conditional ablation of PI3K signaling in the developing lung epithelium in mouse resulted in an expansion of the SOX9+ EPC population and impaired airway epithelial cell differentiation. These data demonstrate that PI3K signaling is required for epithelial patterning during lung organogenesis, and emphasize the combinatorial power of paired RNA and ATAC seq in defining regulatory networks in development.

Title: hReg-CNCC reconstructs a regulatory network in human cranial neural crest cells and annotates variants in a developmental context
Authors: Zhanying Feng, Zhana Duren, Ziyi Xiong, Sijia Wang, Fan Liu, Wing Hung Wong, Yong Wang
Date: 2021-04-06

Abstract:
Cranial Neural Crest Cells (CNCC) originate at the cephalic region from forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain, migrate into the developing craniofacial region, and subsequently differentiate into multiple cell types. The entire specification, delamination, migration, and differentiation process is highly regulated and abnormalities during this craniofacial development cause birth defects. To better understand the molecular networks underlying CNCC, we integrate paired gene expression & chromatin accessibility data and reconstruct the genome-wide human Regulatory network of CNCC (hReg-CNCC). Consensus optimization predicts high-quality regulations and reveals the architecture of upstream, core, and downstream transcription factors that are associated with functions of neural plate border, specification, and migration. hReg-CNCC allows us to annotate genetic variants of human facial GWAS and disease traits with associated cis-regulatory modules, transcription factors, and target genes. For example, we reveal the distal and combinatorial regulation of multiple SNPs to core TF ALX1 and associations to facial distances and cranial rare disease. In addition, hReg-CNCC connects the DNA sequence differences in evolution, such as ultra-conserved elements and human accelerated regions, with gene expression and phenotype. hReg-CNCC provides a valuable resource to interpret genetic variants as early as gastrulation during embryonic development. The network resources are available at https://github.com/AMSSwanglab/hReg-CNCC .

Title: Network Topology Can Explain Differences in Pleiotropy Between Cis- and Trans -regulatory Mutations
Authors: Pétra Vande Zande, Patricia J Wittkopp
Date: 2022-12

Abstract:
A mutation's degree of pleiotropy (i.e., the number of traits it alters) is predicted to impact the probability of the mutation being detrimental to fitness. For mutations that impact gene expression, mutations acting in cis have been hypothesized to generally be less pleiotropic than mutations affecting the same gene's expression in trans , suggesting that cis -regulatory mutations should be less deleterious and more likely to fix over evolutionary time. Here, we use expression and fitness data from Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene deletion strains to test these hypotheses. By treating deletion of each gene as a cis -regulatory mutation affecting its own expression and deletions of other genes affecting expression of this focal gene as trans -regulatory mutations, we find that cis -acting mutations do indeed tend to be less pleiotropic than trans -acting mutations affecting expression of the same gene. This pattern was observed for the vast majority of genes in the data set and could be explained by the topology of the regulatory network controlling gene expression. Comparing the fitness of cis - and trans -acting mutations affecting expression of the same gene also confirmed that trans -acting deletions tend to be more deleterious. These findings provide strong support for pleiotropy playing a role in the preferential fixation of cis -regulatory alleles over evolutionary time.

Title: Cis -regulatory interfaces reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying the notochord gene regulatory network of Ciona
Authors: Lenny J. Negrón-Piñeiro, Yushi Wu, Sydney Popsuj, Diana S. José-Edwards, Alberto Stolfi, Anna Di Gregorio
Date: 2024-04-08

Abstract:
Tissue-specific gene expression is fundamental in development and evolution, and is mediated by transcription factors and by the cis -regulatory regions (enhancers) that they control. Transcription factors and their respective tissue-specific enhancers are essential components of gene regulatory networks responsible for the development of tissues and organs. Although numerous transcription factors have been characterized from different organisms, the knowledge of the enhancers responsible for their tissue-specific expression remains fragmentary. Here we use Ciona to study the enhancers associated with ten transcription factors expressed in the notochord, an evolutionary hallmark of the chordate phylum. Our results illustrate how two evolutionarily conserved transcription factors, Brachyury and Foxa2, coordinate the deployment of other notochord transcription factors. The results of these detailed cis -regulatory analyses delineate a high-resolution view of the essential notochord gene regulatory network of Ciona , and provide a reference for studies of transcription factors, enhancers, and their roles in development, disease, and evolution.

Title: Network Biology Approaches to Achieve Precision Medicine in Inflammatory Bowel Disease

Date: 2021-10-21

Abstract:
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic immune-mediated condition arising due to complex interactions between multiple genetic and environmental factors. Despite recent advances, the pathogenesis of the condition is not fully understood and patients still experience suboptimal clinical outcomes. Over the past few years, investigators are increasingly capturing multi-omics data from patient cohorts to better characterise the disease. However, reaching clinically translatable endpoints from these complex multi-omics datasets is an arduous task. Network biology, a branch of systems biology that utilises mathematical graph theory to represent, integrate and analyse biological data through networks, will be key to addressing this challenge. In this narrative review, we provide an overview of various types of network biology approaches that have been utilised in IBD including protein-protein interaction networks, metabolic networks, gene regulatory networks and gene co-expression networks. We also include examples of multi-layered networks that have combined various network types to gain deeper insights into IBD pathogenesis. Finally, we discuss the need to incorporate other data sources including metabolomic, histopathological, and high-quality clinical meta-data. Together with more robust network data integration and analysis frameworks, such efforts have the potential to realise the key goal of precision medicine in IBD.

Title: Model-to-crop conserved NUE Regulons enhance machine learning predictions of nitrogen use efficiency
Authors: Ji Huang, Chia-Yi Cheng, Matthew D Brooks, Tim L Jeffers, Nathan M Doner, Hung-Jui Shih, Samantha Frangos, Manpreet Singh Katari, Gloria M Coruzzi
Date: 2025-05

Abstract:
Systems biology aims to uncover gene regulatory networks (GRNs) for agricultural traits, but validating them in crops is challenging. We addressed this challenge by learning and validating model-to-crop transcription factor (TF) regulons governing nitrogen use efficiency (NUE). First, a fine-scale time-course nitrogen (N) response transcriptome analysis revealed a conserved temporal N response cascade in maize ( Zea mays ) and Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ). These data were used to infer time-based causal TF target edges in N-regulated GRNs. By validating 23 maize TFs in a cell-based TF-perturbation assay (Transient Assay Reporting Genome-wide Effects of Transcription factors), precision/recall analysis enabled us to prune high-confidence edges between ∼200 TFs/700 maize target genes. We next learned gene-to-NUE trait scores using XGBoost machine learning models trained on conserved N-responsive genes across maize and Arabidopsis accessions. By integrating NUE gene scores within our N-GRN, we ranked maize TFs based on a cumulative NUE Regulon score. NUE Regulons for top-ranked TFs were validated using the cell-based TARGET assay in maize (e.g. ZmMYB34/R3→24 targets) and the Arabidopsis ZmMYB34/R3 ortholog (e.g. AtDIV1→23 targets). The genes in this NUE Regulon significantly enhanced the ability of XGBoost models to predict NUE traits in both maize and Arabidopsis. Thus, our pipeline for identifying TF regulons that combines GRN inference, machine learning, and orthologous network regulons offers a strategic framework for crop trait improvement.

Title: Environment-dependent epistasis increases phenotypic diversity in gene regulatory networks
Authors: Florian Baier, Florence Gauye, Ruben Perez-Carrasco, Joshua L. Payne, Yolanda Schaerli
Date: 2023-05

Abstract:
Mutations to gene regulatory networks can be maladaptive or a source of evolutionary novelty. Epistasis confounds our understanding of how mutations affect the expression patterns of gene regulatory networks, a challenge exacerbated by the dependence of epistasis on the environment. We used the toolkit of synthetic biology to systematically assay the effects of pairwise and triplet combinations of mutant genotypes on the expression pattern of a gene regulatory network expressed in Escherichia coli that interprets an inducer gradient across a spatial domain. We uncovered a preponderance of epistasis that can switch in magnitude and sign across the inducer gradient to produce a greater diversity of expression pattern phenotypes than would be possible in the absence of such environment-dependent epistasis. We discuss our findings in the context of the evolution of hybrid incompatibilities and evolutionary novelties.

Title: On the role of sparseness in the evolution of modularity in gene regulatory networks
Authors: Carlos Espinosa-Soto
Date: 2018-05

Abstract:
Modularity is a widespread property in biological systems. It implies that interactions occur mainly within groups of system elements. A modular arrangement facilitates adjustment of one module without perturbing the rest of the system. Therefore, modularity of developmental mechanisms is a major factor for evolvability, the potential to produce beneficial variation from random genetic change. Understanding how modularity evolves in gene regulatory networks, that create the distinct gene activity patterns that characterize different parts of an organism, is key to developmental and evolutionary biology. One hypothesis for the evolution of modules suggests that interactions between some sets of genes become maladaptive when selection favours additional gene activity patterns. The removal of such interactions by selection would result in the formation of modules. A second hypothesis suggests that modularity evolves in response to sparseness, the scarcity of interactions within a system. Here I simulate the evolution of gene regulatory networks and analyse diverse experimentally sustained networks to study the relationship between sparseness and modularity. My results suggest that sparseness alone is neither sufficient nor necessary to explain modularity in gene regulatory networks. However, sparseness amplifies the effects of forms of selection that, like selection for additional gene activity patterns, already produce an increase in modularity. That evolution of new gene activity patterns is frequent across evolution also supports that it is a major factor in the evolution of modularity. That sparseness is widespread across gene regulatory networks indicates that it may have facilitated the evolution of modules in a wide variety of cases.

Date: 2023-10-19

Abstract:
Inferring gene regulatory networks (GRNs) is a fundamental challenge in biology that aims to unravel the complex relationships between genes and their regulators. Deciphering these networks plays a critical role in understanding the underlying regulatory crosstalk that drives many cellular processes and diseases. Recent advances in sequencing technology have led to the development of state-of-the-art GRN inference methods that exploit matched single-cell multi-omic data. By employing diverse mathematical and statistical methodologies, these methods aim to reconstruct more comprehensive and precise gene regulatory networks. In this review, we give a brief overview on the statistical and methodological foundations commonly used in GRN inference methods. We then compare and contrast the latest state-of-the-art GRN inference methods for single-cell matched multi-omics data, and discuss their assumptions, limitations and opportunities. Finally, we discuss the challenges and future directions that hold promise for further advancements in this rapidly developing field.

Title: Function, dynamics and evolution of network motif modules in integrated gene regulatory networks of worm and plant
Authors: Jonas Defoort, Yves Van de Peer, Vanessa Vermeirssen
Date: 2018-07-27

Abstract:
Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) consist of different molecular interactions that closely work together to establish proper gene expression in time and space. Especially in higher eukaryotes, many questions remain on how these interactions collectively coordinate gene regulation. We study high quality GRNs consisting of undirected protein–protein, genetic and homologous interactions, and directed protein–DNA, regulatory and miRNA–mRNA interactions in the worm Caenorhabditis elegans and the plant Arabidopsis thaliana . Our data-integration framework integrates interactions in composite network motifs, clusters these in biologically relevant, higher-order topological network motif modules, overlays these with gene expression profiles and discovers novel connections between modules and regulators. Similar modules exist in the integrated GRNs of worm and plant. We show how experimental or computational methodologies underlying a certain data type impact network topology. Through phylogenetic decomposition, we found that proteins of worm and plant tend to functionally interact with proteins of a similar age, while at the regulatory level TFs favor same age, but also older target genes. Despite some influence of the duplication mode difference, we also observe at the motif and module level for both species a preference for age homogeneity for undirected and age heterogeneity for directed interactions. This leads to a model where novel genes are added together to the GRNs in a specific biological functional context, regulated by one or more TFs that also target older genes in the GRNs. Overall, we detected topological, functional and evolutionary properties of GRNs that are potentially universal in all species.

Title: Globally learning gene regulatory networks based on hidden atomic regulators from transcriptomic big data
Authors: Ming Shi, Sheng Tan, Xin-Ping Xie, Ao Li, Wulin Yang, Tao Zhu, Hong-Qiang Wang
Date: 2020-10-14

Abstract:
Genes are regulated by various types of regulators and most of them are still unknown or unobserved. Current gene regulatory networks (GRNs) reverse engineering methods often neglect the unknown regulators and infer regulatory relationships in a local and sub-optimal manner. This paper proposes a global GRNs inference framework based on dictionary learning, named dlGRN. The method intends to learn atomic regulators (ARs) from gene expression data using a modified dictionary learning (DL) algorithm, which reflects the whole gene regulatory system, and predicts the regulation between a known regulator and a target gene in a global regression way. The modified DL algorithm fits the scale-free property of biological network, rendering dlGRN intrinsically discern direct and indirect regulations. Extensive experimental results on simulation and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of dlGRN in reverse engineering GRNs. A novel predicted transcription regulation between a TF TFAP2C and an oncogene EGFR was experimentally verified in lung cancer cells. Furthermore, the real application reveals the prevalence of DNA methylation regulation in gene regulatory system. dlGRN can be a standalone tool for GRN inference for its globalization and robustness.

Date: 2021-12-28

Abstract:
Gene regulatory network (GRN) inference can now take advantage of powerful machine learning algorithms to complement traditional experimental methods in building gene networks. However, the dynamical nature of embryonic development–representing the time-dependent interactions between thousands of transcription factors, signaling molecules, and effector genes–is one of the most challenging arenas for GRN prediction. In this work, we show that successful GRN predictions for a developmental network from gene expression data alone can be obtained with the Priors Enriched Absent Knowledge (PEAK) network inference algorithm. PEAK is a noise-robust method that models gene expression dynamics via ordinary differential equations and selects the best network based on information-theoretic criteria coupled with the machine learning algorithm Elastic Net. We test our GRN prediction methodology using two gene expression datasets for the purple sea urchin, Stronglyocentrotus purpuratus , and cross-check our results against existing GRN models that have been constructed and validated by over 30 years of experimental results. Our results find a remarkably high degree of sensitivity in identifying known gene interactions in the network (maximum 81.58%). We also generate novel predictions for interactions that have not yet been described, which provide a resource for researchers to use to further complete the sea urchin GRN. Published ChIPseq data and spatial co-expression analysis further support a subset of the top novel predictions. We conclude that GRN predictions that match known gene interactions can be produced using gene expression data alone from developmental time series experiments.

Title: The Underlying Molecular and Network Level Mechanisms in the Evolution of Robustness in Gene Regulatory Networks
Authors: Mario Pujato, Thomas MacCarthy, Andras Fiser, Aviv Bergman
Date: 2013-01

Abstract:
Gene regulatory networks show robustness to perturbations. Previous works identified robustness as an emergent property of gene network evolution but the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. We used a multi-tier modeling approach that integrates molecular sequence and structure information with network architecture and population dynamics. Structural models of transcription factor-DNA complexes are used to estimate relative binding specificities. In this model, mutations in the DNA cause changes on two levels: (a) at the sequence level in individual binding sites (modulating binding specificity), and (b) at the network level (creating and destroying binding sites). We used this model to dissect the underlying mechanisms responsible for the evolution of robustness in gene regulatory networks. Results suggest that in sparse architectures (represented by short promoters), a mixture of local-sequence and network-architecture level changes are exploited. At the local-sequence level, robustness evolves by decreasing the probabilities of both the destruction of existent and generation of new binding sites. Meanwhile, in highly interconnected architectures (represented by long promoters), robustness evolves almost entirely via network level changes, deleting and creating binding sites that modify the network architecture.

Title: Evaluating methods of inferring gene regulatory networks highlights their lack of performance for single cell gene expression data
Authors: Shuonan Chen, Jessica C. Mar
Date: 2018-06-19

Abstract:
A fundamental fact in biology states that genes do not operate in isolation, and yet, methods that infer regulatory networks for single cell gene expression data have been slow to emerge. With single cell sequencing methods now becoming accessible, general network inference algorithms that were initially developed for data collected from bulk samples may not be suitable for single cells. Meanwhile, although methods that are specific for single cell data are now emerging, whether they have improved performance over general methods is unknown. In this study, we evaluate the applicability of five general methods and three single cell methods for inferring gene regulatory networks from both experimental single cell gene expression data and in silico simulated data. Standard evaluation metrics using ROC curves and Precision-Recall curves against reference sets sourced from the literature demonstrated that most of the methods performed poorly when they were applied to either experimental single cell data, or simulated single cell data, which demonstrates their lack of performance for this task. Using default settings, network methods were applied to the same datasets. Comparisons of the learned networks highlighted the uniqueness of some predicted edges for each method. The fact that different methods infer networks that vary substantially reflects the underlying mathematical rationale and assumptions that distinguish network methods from each other. This study provides a comprehensive evaluation of network modeling algorithms applied to experimental single cell gene expression data and in silico simulated datasets where the network structure is known. Comparisons demonstrate that most of these assessed network methods are not able to predict network structures from single cell expression data accurately, even if they are specifically developed for single cell methods. Also, single cell methods, which usually depend on more elaborative algorithms, in general have less similarity to each other in the sets of edges detected. The results from this study emphasize the importance for developing more accurate optimized network modeling methods that are compatible for single cell data. Newly-developed single cell methods may uniquely capture particular features of potential gene-gene relationships, and caution should be taken when we interpret these results.

Title: Network Biology Analyses and Dynamic Modeling of Gene Regulatory Networks under Drought Stress Reveal Major Transcriptional Regulators in Arabidopsis

Abstract:
Drought is one of the most serious abiotic stressors in the environment, restricting agricultural production by reducing plant growth, development, and productivity. To investigate such a complex and multifaceted stressor and its effects on plants, a systems biology-based approach is necessitated, entailing the generation of co-expression networks, identification of high-priority transcription factors (TFs), dynamic mathematical modeling, and computational simulations. Here, we studied a high-resolution drought transcriptome of Arabidopsis . We identified distinct temporal transcriptional signatures and demonstrated the involvement of specific biological pathways. Generation of a large-scale co-expression network followed by network centrality analyses identified 117 TFs that possess critical properties of hubs, bottlenecks, and high clustering coefficient nodes. Dynamic transcriptional regulatory modeling of integrated TF targets and transcriptome datasets uncovered major transcriptional events during the course of drought stress. Mathematical transcriptional simulations allowed us to ascertain the activation status of major TFs, as well as the transcriptional intensity and amplitude of their target genes. Finally, we validated our predictions by providing experimental evidence of gene expression under drought stress for a set of four TFs and their major target genes using qRT-PCR. Taken together, we provided a systems-level perspective on the dynamic transcriptional regulation during drought stress in Arabidopsis and uncovered numerous novel TFs that could potentially be used in future genetic crop engineering programs.

Abstract:
Each cell possesses a unique gene regulatory network. However, limited methods exist for inferring cell-specific regulatory networks, particularly through the integration of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (scATAC-seq) data. Herein, we develop a novel algorithm, named single-cell regulatory network inference (ScReNI), for inferring gene regulatory networks at the single-cell level. In ScReNI, the nearest neighbors algorithm is utilized to establish the neighboring cells for each cell, where nonlinear regulatory relationships between gene expression and chromatin accessibility are inferred through a modified random forest. ScReNI is designed to analyze both paired and unpaired datasets for scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq. ScReNI demonstrates more accurate regulatory relationships and outperforms existing cell-specific network inference methods in network-based cell clustering. ScReNI also shows superior performance in inferring cell type-specific regulatory networks through integrating gene expression and chromatin accessibility. Importantly, ScReNI offers the unique function of identifying cell-enriched regulators based on each cell-specific network. Overall, ScReNI facilitates the inference of cell-specific regulatory networks and cell-enriched regulators, providing insights into single-cell regulatory mechanisms of diverse biological processes. ScReNI is available at https://github.com/Xuxl2020/ScReNI .

Title: Effects of Time Point Measurement on the Reconstruction of Gene Regulatory Networks
Authors: Wenying Yan, Huangqiong Zhu, Yang Yang, Jiajia Chen, Yuanyuan Zhang, Bairong Shen
Date: 2010-08-04

Abstract:
With the availability of high-throughput gene expression data in the post-genomic era, reconstruction of gene regulatory networks has become a hot topic. Regulatory networks have been intensively studied over the last decade and many software tools are currently available. However, the impact of time point selection on network reconstruction is often underestimated. In this paper we apply the Dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) to construct the Arabidopsis gene regulatory networks by analyzing the time-series gene microarray data. In order to evaluate the impact of time point measurement on network reconstruction, we deleted time points one by one to yield 11 distinct groups of incomplete time series. Then the gene regulatory networks constructed based on complete and incomplete data series are compared in terms of statistics at different levels. Two time points are found to play a significant role in the Arabidopsis gene regulatory networks. Pathway analysis of significant nodes revealed three key regulatory genes. In addition, important regulations between genes, which were insensitive to the time point measurement, were also identified.

Title: Constructing gene regulatory networks for long term photosynthetic light acclimation in Arabidopsis thaliana
Authors: Cheng-Wei Yao, Ban-Dar Hsu, Bor-Sen Chen
Date: 2011

Abstract:
Photosynthetic light acclimation is an important process that allows plants to optimize the efficiency of photosynthesis, which is the core technology for green energy. However, currently little is known about the molecular mechanisms behind the regulation of the photosynthetic light acclimation response. In this study, a systematic method is proposed to investigate this mechanism by constructing gene regulatory networks from microarray data of Arabidopsis thaliana . The potential TF-gene regulatory pairs of photosynthetic light acclimation have been obtained by data mining of literature and databases. Following the identification of these potential TF-gene pairs, they have been refined using Pearson's correlation, allowing the construction of a rough gene regulatory network. This rough gene regulatory network is then pruned using time series microarray data of Arabidopsis thaliana via the maximum likelihood system identification method and Akaike's system order detection method to approach the real gene regulatory network of photosynthetic light acclimation. By comparing the gene regulatory networks under the PSI-to-PSII light shift and the PSII-to-PSI light shift, it is possible to identify important transcription factors for the different light shift conditions. Furthermore, the robustness of the gene network, in particular the hubs and weak linkage points, are also discussed under the different light conditions to gain further insight into the mechanisms of photosynthesis. This study investigates the molecular mechanisms of photosynthetic light acclimation for Arabidopsis thaliana from the physiological level. This has been achieved through the construction of gene regulatory networks from the limited data sources and literature via an efficient computation method. If more experimental data for whole-genome ChIP-chip data and microarray data with multiple sampling points becomes available in the future, the proposed method will be improved on by constructing the whole-genome gene regulatory network. These advances will greatly improve our understanding of the mechanisms of the photosynthetic system.

Title: Genome-wide dynamic network analysis reveals a critical transition state of flower development in Arabidopsis
Authors: Fuping Zhang, Xiaoping Liu, Aidi Zhang, Zhonglin Jiang, Luonan Chen, Xiujun Zhang
Date: 2019-01-07

Abstract:
The flowering transition which is controlled by a complex and intricate gene regulatory network plays an important role in the reproduction for offspring of plants. It is a challenge to identify the critical transition state as well as the genes that control the transition of flower development. With the emergence of massively parallel sequencing, a great number of time-course transcriptome data greatly facilitate the exploration of the developmental phase transition in plants. Although some network-based bioinformatics analyses attempted to identify the genes that control the phase transition, they generally overlooked the dynamics of regulation and resulted in unreliable results. In addition, the results of these methods cannot be self-explained. In this work, to reveal a critical transition state and identify the transition-specific genes of flower development, we implemented a genome-wide dynamic network analysis on temporal gene expression data in Arabidopsis by dynamic network biomarker (DNB) method. In the analysis, DNB model which can exploit collective fluctuations and correlations of different metabolites at a network level was used to detect the imminent critical transition state or the tipping point. The genes that control the phase transition can be identified by the difference of weighted correlations between the genes interested and the other genes in the global network. To construct the gene regulatory network controlling the flowering transition, we applied NARROMI algorithm which can reduce the noisy, redundant and indirect regulations on the expression data of the transition-specific genes. In the results, the critical transition state detected during the formation of flowers corresponded to the development of flowering on the 7th to 9th day in Arabidopsis . Among of 233 genes identified to be highly fluctuated at the transition state, a high percentage of genes with maximum expression in pollen was detected, and 24 genes were validated to participate in stress reaction process, as well as other floral-related pathways. Composed of three major subnetworks, a gene regulatory network with 150 nodes and 225 edges was found to be highly correlated with flowering transition. The gene ontology (GO) annotation of pathway enrichment analysis revealed that the identified genes are enriched in the catalytic activity, metabolic process and cellular process. This study provides a novel insight to identify the real causality of the phase transition with genome-wide dynamic network analysis.

Title: Complexity reduction by symmetry: uncovering the minimal regulatory network for logical computation in bacteria
Authors: Luis A. Álvarez-García, Wolfram Liebermeister, Ian Leifer, Hernán A. Makse
Date: 2025-02-25

Abstract:
Symmetry principles play an important role in geometry, and physics, allowing for the reduction of complicated systems to simpler, more comprehensible models that preserve the system’s features of interest. Biological systems are often highly complex and may consist of a large number of interacting parts. Using symmetry fibrations, the relevant symmetries for biological “message-passing” networks, we introduce a scheme, called Complexity Reduction by Symmetry or ComSym, to reduce the gene regulatory networks of Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis bacteria to core networks in a way that preserves the dynamics and uncovers the computational capabilities of the network. Gene nodes in the original network that share isomorphic input trees are collapsed by the fibration into equivalence classes called fibers, whereby nodes that receive signals with the same “history” belong to one fiber and synchronize. Then we reduce the networks to its minimal computational core via k-core decomposition. This computational core consists of a few strongly connected components or “signal vortices”, in which signals can cycle through. While between them, these “signal vortices” transmit signals in a feedforward manner. These connected components perform signal processing and decision making in the bacterial cell by employing a series of genetic toggle-switch circuits that store memory, plus oscillator circuits. These circuits act as the central computation device of the network, whose output signals then spread to the rest of the network. Our reduction method opens the door to narrow the vast complexity of biological systems to their minimal parts in a systematic way by using fundamental theoretical principles of symmetry.

Abstract:
A major question in systems biology is how to identify the core gene regulatory circuit that governs the decision-making of a biological process. Here, we develop a computational platform, named NetAct, for constructing core transcription factor regulatory networks using both transcriptomics data and literature-based transcription factor-target databases. NetAct robustly infers regulators’ activity using target expression, constructs networks based on transcriptional activity, and integrates mathematical modeling for validation. Our in silico benchmark test shows that NetAct outperforms existing algorithms in inferring transcriptional activity and gene networks. We illustrate the application of NetAct to model networks driving TGF-β-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition and macrophage polarization.

Abstract:
Seminal studies of vertebrate protein evolution speculated that gene regulatory changes can drive anatomical innovations. However, very little is known about gene regulatory network (GRN) evolution associated with phenotypic effect across ecologically diverse species. Here we use a novel approach for comparative GRN analysis in vertebrate species to study GRN evolution in representative species of the most striking examples of adaptive radiations, the East African cichlids. We previously demonstrated how the explosive phenotypic diversification of East African cichlids can be attributed to diverse molecular mechanisms, including accelerated regulatory sequence evolution and gene expression divergence. To investigate these mechanisms across species at a genome-wide scale, we develop a novel computational pipeline that predicts regulators for co-extant and ancestral co-expression modules along a phylogeny, and candidate regulatory regions associated with traits under selection in cichlids. As a case study, we apply our approach to a well-studied adaptive trait—the visual system—for which we report striking cases of network rewiring for visual opsin genes, identify discrete regulatory variants, and investigate their association with cichlid visual system evolution. In regulatory regions of visual opsin genes, in vitro assays confirm that transcription factor binding site mutations disrupt regulatory edges across species and segregate according to lake species phylogeny and ecology, suggesting GRN rewiring in radiating cichlids. Our approach reveals numerous novel potential candidate regulators and regulatory regions across cichlid genomes, including some novel and some previously reported associations to known adaptive evolutionary traits.

Title: Expression pattern determines regulatory logic
Authors: Carlos Mora-Martinez
Date: 2021-01-04

Abstract:
Large amounts of effort have been invested in trying to understand how a single genome is able to specify the identity of hundreds of cell types. Inspired by some aspects of Caenorhabditis elegans biology, we implemented an in silico evolutionary strategy to produce gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that drive cell-specific gene expression patterns, mimicking the process of terminal cell differentiation. Dynamics of the gene regulatory networks are governed by a thermodynamic model of gene expression, which uses DNA sequences and transcription factor degenerate position weight matrixes as input. In a version of the model, we included chromatin accessibility. Experimentally, it has been determined that cell-specific and broadly expressed genes are regulated differently. In our in silico evolved GRNs, broadly expressed genes are regulated very redundantly and the architecture of their cis-regulatory modules is different, in accordance to what has been found in C . elegans and also in other systems. Finally, we found differences in topological positions in GRNs between these two classes of genes, which help to explain why broadly expressed genes are so resilient to mutations. Overall, our results offer an explanatory hypothesis on why broadly expressed genes are regulated so redundantly compared to cell-specific genes, which can be extrapolated to phenomena such as ChIP-seq HOT regions.

Title: A map of integrated cis -regulatory elements enhances gene-regulatory analysis in maize
Authors: Jasper Staut, Nicolás Manosalva Pérez, Andrés Matres Ferrando, Indeewari Dissanayake, Klaas Vandepoele
Date: 2025-07-14

Abstract:
cis -regulatory elements (CREs) are non-coding DNA sequences that modulate gene expression. Their identification is essential to the study of transcriptional regulation of genes that control key traits involved in plant growth and development. CREs are also critical for the delineation of gene-regulatory networks (GRNs), which map regulatory interactions between transcription factors (TFs) and target genes. In maize, CREs have been profiled using various computational and experimental methods, but the extent to which these approaches complement each other when identifying functional CREs remains unclear. Here, we report the data-driven integration of multiple maize CRE-profiling methods to optimize the capture of experimentally confirmed TF-binding sites, resulting in a map of integrated CREs (iCREs) with improved completeness and precision. We combined these iCREs with diverse gene expression datasets generated under drought conditions to perform motif enrichment analyses and infer drought-specific GRNs. Mining these organ-specific GRNs identified both known and novel candidate regulators of maize drought responses and revealed significant overlap with drought-associated eQTL regulatory interactions. Furthermore, analysis of transposable elements (TEs) overlapping with iCREs identified several TE superfamilies with epigenetic features characteristic of regulatory DNA that potentially mediate specific TF–target gene interactions. Overall, our study showcases the utility of multi-omics data integration to generate a high-quality collection of CREs and illustrates their potential to improve the characterization of gene regulation in the complex maize genome.

Abstract:
Understanding the regulatory architecture of phenotypic variation is a fundamental goal in biology, but connections between gene regulatory network (GRN) activity and individual differences in behavior are poorly understood. We characterized the molecular basis of behavioral plasticity in queenless honey bee ( Apis mellifera ) colonies, where individuals engage in both reproductive and non-reproductive behaviors. Using high-throughput behavioral tracking, we discovered these colonies contain a continuum of phenotypes, with some individuals specialized for either egg-laying or foraging and ‘generalists’ that perform both. Brain gene expression and chromatin accessibility profiles were correlated with behavioral variation, with generalists intermediate in behavior and molecular profiles. Models of brain GRNs constructed for individuals revealed that transcription factor (TF) activity was highly predictive of behavior, and behavior-associated regulatory regions had more TF motifs. These results provide new insights into the important role played by brain GRN plasticity in the regulation of behavior, with implications for social evolution.

Title: A systems biology approach to construct the gene regulatory network of systemic inflammation via microarray and databases mining
Authors: Bor-Sen Chen, Shih-Kuang Yang, Chung-Yu Lan, Yung-Jen Chuang
Date: 2008

Abstract:
Inflammation is a hallmark of many human diseases. Elucidating the mechanisms underlying systemic inflammation has long been an important topic in basic and clinical research. When primary pathogenetic events remains unclear due to its immense complexity, construction and analysis of the gene regulatory network of inflammation at times becomes the best way to understand the detrimental effects of disease. However, it is difficult to recognize and evaluate relevant biological processes from the huge quantities of experimental data. It is hence appealing to find an algorithm which can generate a gene regulatory network of systemic inflammation from high-throughput genomic studies of human diseases. Such network will be essential for us to extract valuable information from the complex and chaotic network under diseased conditions. In this study, we construct a gene regulatory network of inflammation using data extracted from the Ensembl and JASPAR databases. We also integrate and apply a number of systematic algorithms like cross correlation threshold , maximum likelihood estimation method and Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) on time-lapsed microarray data to refine the genome-wide transcriptional regulatory network in response to bacterial endotoxins in the context of dynamic activated genes, which are regulated by transcription factors (TFs) such as NF- κ B. This systematic approach is used to investigate the stochastic interaction represented by the dynamic leukocyte gene expression profiles of human subject exposed to an inflammatory stimulus (bacterial endotoxin). Based on the kinetic parameters of the dynamic gene regulatory network, we identify important properties (such as susceptibility to infection) of the immune system, which may be useful for translational research. Finally, robustness of the inflammatory gene network is also inferred by analyzing the hubs and "weak ties" structures of the gene network. In this study, Data mining and dynamic network analyses were integrated to examine the gene regulatory network in the inflammatory response system. Compared with previous methodologies reported in the literatures, the proposed gene network perturbation method has shown a great improvement in analyzing the systemic inflammation.

Title: A gene regulatory network inference model based on pseudo-siamese network
Authors: Qian Wang, Maozu Guo, Jian Chen, Ran Duan
Date: 2023-04-21

Abstract:
Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) arise from the intricate interactions between transcription factors (TFs) and their target genes during the growth and development of organisms. The inference of GRNs can unveil the underlying gene interactions in living systems and facilitate the investigation of the relationship between gene expression patterns and phenotypic traits. Although several machine-learning models have been proposed for inferring GRNs from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, some of these models, such as Boolean and tree-based networks, suffer from sensitivity to noise and may encounter difficulties in handling the high noise and dimensionality of actual scRNA-seq data, as well as the sparse nature of gene regulation relationships. Thus, inferring large-scale information from GRNs remains a formidable challenge. This study proposes a multilevel, multi-structure framework called a pseudo-Siamese GRN (PSGRN) for inferring large-scale GRNs from time-series expression datasets. Based on the pseudo-Siamese network, we applied a gated recurrent unit to capture the time features of each TF and target matrix and learn the spatial features of the matrices after merging by applying the DenseNet framework. Finally, we applied a sigmoid function to evaluate interactions. We constructed two maize sub-datasets, including gene expression levels and GRNs, using existing open-source maize multi-omics data and compared them to other GRN inference methods, including GENIE3, GRNBoost2, nonlinear ordinary differential equations, CNNC, and DGRNS. Our results show that PSGRN outperforms state-of-the-art methods. This study proposed a new framework: a PSGRN that allows GRNs to be inferred from scRNA-seq data, elucidating the temporal and spatial features of TFs and their target genes. The results show the model’s robustness and generalization, laying a theoretical foundation for maize genotype-phenotype associations with implications for breeding work.

Abstract:
Mutations in gene regulatory networks often lead to genetic divergence without impacting gene expression or developmental patterning. The rules governing this process of developmental systems drift, including the variable impact of selective constraints on different nodes in a gene regulatory network, remain poorly delineated. Here we examine developmental systems drift within the cardiopharyngeal gene regulatory networks of two tunicate species, Corella inflata and Ciona robusta. Cross-species analysis of regulatory elements suggests that trans -regulatory architecture is largely conserved between these highly divergent species. In contrast, cis -regulatory elements within this network exhibit distinct levels of conservation. In particular, while most of the regulatory elements we analyzed showed extensive rearrangements of functional binding sites, the enhancer for the cardiopharyngeal transcription factor FoxF is remarkably well-conserved. Even minor alterations in spacing between binding sites lead to loss of FoxF enhancer function, suggesting that bound trans -factors form position-dependent complexes. Our findings reveal heterogeneous levels of divergence across cardiopharyngeal cis -regulatory elements. These distinct levels of divergence presumably reflect constraints that are not clearly associated with gene function or position within the regulatory network. Thus, levels of cis -regulatory divergence or drift appear to be governed by distinct structural constraints that will be difficult to predict based on network architecture.

Abstract:
Organisms utilize gene regulatory networks (GRN) to make fate decisions, but the regulatory mechanisms of transcription factors (TF) in GRNs are exceedingly intricate. A longstanding question in this field is how these tangled interactions synergistically contribute to decision-making procedures. To comprehensively understand the role of regulatory logic in cell fate decisions, we constructed a logic-incorporated GRN model and examined its behavior under two distinct driving forces (noise-driven and signal-driven). Under the noise-driven mode, we distilled the relationship among fate bias, regulatory logic, and noise profile. Under the signal-driven mode, we bridged regulatory logic and progression-accuracy trade-off, and uncovered distinctive trajectories of reprogramming influenced by logic motifs. In differentiation, we characterized a special logic-dependent priming stage by the solution landscape. Finally, we applied our findings to decipher three biological instances: hematopoiesis, embryogenesis, and trans-differentiation. Orthogonal to the classical analysis of expression profile, we harnessed noise patterns to construct the GRN corresponding to fate transition. Our work presents a generalizable framework for top-down fate-decision studies and a practical approach to the taxonomy of cell fate decisions.

Title: Evolutionary Dynamics of the SKN-1 → MED → END-1,3 Regulatory Gene Cascade in Caenorhabditis Endoderm Specification
Authors: Morris F. Maduro
Date: 2019-11-18

Abstract:
Gene regulatory networks and their evolution are important in the study of animal development. In the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans , the endoderm (gut) is generated from a single embryonic precursor, E. Gut is specified by the maternal factor SKN-1 , which activates the MED → END-1 ,3 → ELT-2 ,7 cascade of GATA transcription factors. In this work, genome sequences from over two dozen species within the Caenorhabditis genus are used to identify MED and END-1 ,3 orthologs. Predictions are validated by comparison of gene structure, protein conservation, and putative cis -regulatory sites. All three factors occur together, but only within the Elegans supergroup, suggesting they originated at its base. The MED factors are the most diverse and exhibit an unexpectedly extensive gene amplification. In contrast, the highly conserved END-1 orthologs are unique in nearly all species and share extended regions of conservation. The END-1 ,3 proteins share a region upstream of their zinc finger and an unusual amino-terminal poly-serine domain exhibiting high codon bias. Compared with END-1 , the END-3 proteins are otherwise less conserved as a group and are typically found as paralogous duplicates. Hence, all three factors are under different evolutionary constraints. Promoter comparisons identify motifs that suggest the SKN-1 , MED, and END factors function in a similar gut specification network across the Elegans supergroup that has been conserved for tens of millions of years. A model is proposed to account for the rapid origin of this essential kernel in the gut specification network, by the upstream intercalation of duplicate genes into a simpler ancestral network.

Abstract:
Congenital heart diseases are the major cause of death in newborns, but the genetic etiology of this developmental disorder is not fully known. The conventional approach to identify the disease-causing genes focuses on screening genes that display heart-specific expression during development. However, this approach would have discounted genes that are expressed widely in other tissues but may play critical roles in heart development. We report an efficient pipeline of genome-wide gene discovery based on the identification of a cardiac-specific cis -regulatory element signature that points to candidate genes involved in heart development and congenital heart disease. With this pipeline, we retrieve 76% of the known cardiac developmental genes and predict 35 novel genes that previously had no known connectivity to heart development. Functional validation of these novel cardiac genes by RNAi-mediated knockdown of the conserved orthologs in Drosophila cardiac tissue reveals that disrupting the activity of 71% of these genes leads to adult mortality. Among these genes, RpL14 , RpS24 , and Rpn8 are associated with heart phenotypes. Our pipeline has enabled the discovery of novel genes with roles in heart development. This workflow, which relies on screening for non-coding cis -regulatory signatures, is amenable for identifying developmental and disease genes for an organ without constraining to genes that are expressed exclusively in the organ of interest.

Title: Evolutionary rewiring of regulatory networks contributes to phenotypic differences between human and mouse orthologous genes
Authors: Doyeon Ha, Donghyo Kim, Inhae Kim, Youngchul Oh, JungHo Kong, Seong Kyu Han, Sanguk Kim
Date: 2022-02-28

Abstract:
Mouse models have been engineered to reveal the biological mechanisms of human diseases based on an assumption. The assumption is that orthologous genes underlie conserved phenotypes across species. However, genetically modified mouse orthologs of human genes do not often recapitulate human disease phenotypes which might be due to the molecular evolution of phenotypic differences across species from the time of the last common ancestor. Here, we systematically investigated the evolutionary divergence of regulatory relationships between transcription factors (TFs) and target genes in functional modules, and found that the rewiring of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) contributes to the phenotypic discrepancies that occur between humans and mice. We confirmed that the rewired regulatory networks of orthologous genes contain a higher proportion of species-specific regulatory elements. Additionally, we verified that the divergence of target gene expression levels, which was triggered by network rewiring, could lead to phenotypic differences. Taken together, a careful consideration of evolutionary divergence in regulatory networks could be a novel strategy to understand the failure or success of mouse models to mimic human diseases. To help interpret mouse phenotypes in human disease studies, we provide quantitative comparisons of gene expression profiles on our website ( http://sbi.postech.ac.kr/w/RN ).

boundaries separate lateral organs from the apical meristem and harbor axillary meristems (AMs).
AMs, as stem cell niches, make the shoot a ramifying system. Although AMs have important functions
in plant development, our knowledge of organ boundary and AM formation remains rudimentary. Here, we
generated a cellular-resolution genomewide gene expression map for low-abundance Arabidopsis
thaliana organ boundary cells and constructed a genomewide protein–DNA interaction
map focusing on genes affecting boundary and AM formation. The resulting GRN uncovers
transcriptional signatures, predicts cellular functions, and identifies promoter hub regions that
are bound by many TFs. Importantly, further experimental studies determined the regulatory effects
of many TFs on their targets, identifying regulators and regulatory relationships in AM initiation.
This systems biology approach thus enhances our understanding of a key developmental process.

Abstract:
Identifying master regulators of biological processes and mapping their downstream gene networks are key challenges in systems biology. We developed a computational method, called iRegulon, to reverse-engineer the transcriptional regulatory network underlying a co-expressed gene set using cis -regulatory sequence analysis. iRegulon implements a genome-wide ranking-and-recovery approach to detect enriched transcription factor motifs and their optimal sets of direct targets. We increase the accuracy of network inference by using very large motif collections of up to ten thousand position weight matrices collected from various species, and linking these to candidate human TFs via a motif2TF procedure. We validate iRegulon on gene sets derived from ENCODE ChIP-seq data with increasing levels of noise, and we compare iRegulon with existing motif discovery methods. Next, we use iRegulon on more challenging types of gene lists, including microRNA target sets, protein-protein interaction networks, and genetic perturbation data. In particular, we over-activate p53 in breast cancer cells, followed by RNA-seq and ChIP-seq, and could identify an extensive up-regulated network controlled directly by p53. Similarly we map a repressive network with no indication of direct p53 regulation but rather an indirect effect via E2F and NFY. Finally, we generalize our computational framework to include regulatory tracks such as ChIP-seq data and show how motif and track discovery can be combined to map functional regulatory interactions among co-expressed genes. iRegulon is available as a Cytoscape plugin from http://iregulon.aertslab.org .

Abstract:
The root epidermis of Arabidopsis provides an exceptional model for studying the molecular basis of cell fate and differentiation. To obtain a systems-level view of root epidermal cell differentiation, we used a genome-wide transcriptome approach to define and organize a large set of genes into a transcriptional regulatory network. Using cell fate mutants that produce only one of the two epidermal cell types, together with fluorescence-activated cell-sorting to preferentially analyze the root epidermis transcriptome, we identified 1,582 genes differentially expressed in the root-hair or non-hair cell types, including a set of 208 “core” root epidermal genes. The organization of the core genes into a network was accomplished by using 17 distinct root epidermis mutants and 2 hormone treatments to perturb the system and assess the effects on each gene's transcript accumulation. In addition, temporal gene expression information from a developmental time series dataset and predicted gene associations derived from a Bayesian modeling approach were used to aid the positioning of genes within the network. Further, a detailed functional analysis of likely bHLH regulatory genes within the network, including MYC1 , bHLH54 , bHLH66 , and bHLH82 , showed that three distinct subfamilies of bHLH proteins participate in root epidermis development in a stage-specific manner. The integration of genetic, genomic, and computational analyses provides a new view of the composition, architecture, and logic of the root epidermal transcriptional network, and it demonstrates the utility of a comprehensive systems approach for dissecting a complex regulatory network.

Abstract:
Enhancers are key players in the spatio-temporal coordination of gene expression during numerous crucial processes, including tissue differentiation across development. Characterizing the transcription factors (TFs) and genes they connect, and the molecular functions underpinned is important to better characterize developmental processes. In plants, the recent molecular characterization of enhancers revealed their capacity to activate the expression of several target genes. Nevertheless, identifying these target genes at a genome-wide level is challenging, particularly for large-genome species, where enhancers and target genes can be hundreds of kilobases away. Therefore, the contribution of enhancers to plant regulatory networks remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate the enhancer-driven regulatory network of two maize tissues at different stages: leaves at seedling stage (V2-IST) and husks (bracts) at flowering. Using systems biology, we integrate genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic data to model the regulatory relationships between TFs and their potential target genes, and identify regulatory modules specific to husk and V2-IST. We show that leaves at the V2-IST stage are characterized by the response to hormones and macromolecules biogenesis and assembly, which are regulated by the BBR/BPC and AP2/ERF TF families, respectively. In contrast, husks are characterized by cell wall modification and response to abiotic stresses, which are, respectively, orchestrated by the C2C2/DOF and AP2/EREB families. Analysis of the corresponding enhancer sequences reveals that two different transposable element families (TIR transposon Mutator and MITE Pif/Harbinger ) have shaped part of the regulatory network in each tissue, and that MITEs have provided potential new TF binding sites involved in husk tissue-specificity.

Abstract:
Psychostimulant methamphetamine (METH) is neurotoxic to the brain and, therefore, its misuse leads to neurological and psychiatric disorders. The gene regulatory network (GRN) response to neurotoxic METH binge remains unclear in most brain regions. Here we examined the effects of binge METH on the GRN in the nucleus accumbens, dentate gyrus, Ammon’s horn, and subventricular zone in male rats. At 24 h after METH, ~16% of genes displayed altered expression and over a quarter of previously open chromatin regions - parts of the genome where genes are typically active - showed shifts in their accessibility. Intriguingly, most changes were unique to each area studied, and independent regulation between transcriptome and chromatin accessibility was observed. Unexpectedly, METH differentially impacted gene activity and chromatin accessibility within the dentate gyrus and Ammon’s horn. Around 70% of the affected chromatin-accessible regions in the rat brain have conserved DNA sequences in the human genome. These regions frequently act as enhancers, ramping up the activity of nearby genes, and contain mutations linked to various neurological conditions. By sketching out the gene regulatory networks associated with binge METH in specific brain regions, our study offers fresh insights into how METH can trigger profound, region-specific molecular shifts.

Title: Single-cell network biology for resolving cellular heterogeneity in human diseases
Authors: Junha Cha, Insuk Lee
Date: 2020-11-26

Abstract:
Understanding cellular heterogeneity is the holy grail of biology and medicine. Cells harboring identical genomes show a wide variety of behaviors in multicellular organisms. Genetic circuits underlying cell-type identities will facilitate the understanding of the regulatory programs for differentiation and maintenance of distinct cellular states. Such a cell-type-specific gene network can be inferred from coregulatory patterns across individual cells. Conventional methods of transcriptome profiling using tissue samples provide only average signals of diverse cell types. Therefore, reconstructing gene regulatory networks for a particular cell type is not feasible with tissue-based transcriptome data. Recently, single-cell omics technology has emerged and enabled the capture of the transcriptomic landscape of every individual cell. Although single-cell gene expression studies have already opened up new avenues, network biology using single-cell transcriptome data will further accelerate our understanding of cellular heterogeneity. In this review, we provide an overview of single-cell network biology and summarize recent progress in method development for network inference from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. Then, we describe how cell-type-specific gene networks can be utilized to study regulatory programs specific to disease-associated cell types and cellular states. Moreover, with scRNA data, modeling personal or patient-specific gene networks is feasible. Therefore, we also introduce potential applications of single-cell network biology for precision medicine. We envision a rapid paradigm shift toward single-cell network analysis for systems biology in the near future.

Title: Global screening of potential Candida albicans biofilm-related transcription factors via network comparison
Authors: Yu-Chao Wang, Chung-Yu Lan, Wen-Ping Hsieh, Luis A Murillo, Nina Agabian, Bor-Sen Chen
Date: 2010

Abstract:
Candida albicans is a commonly encountered fungal pathogen in humans. The formation of biofilm is a major virulence factor in C. albicans pathogenesis and is related to antidrug resistance of this organism. Although many factors affecting biofilm have been analyzed, molecular mechanisms that regulate biofilm formation still await to be elucidated. In this study, from the gene regulatory network perspective, we developed an efficient computational framework, which integrates different kinds of data from genome-scale analysis, for global screening of potential transcription factors (TFs) controlling C. albicans biofilm formation. S. cerevisiae information and ortholog data were used to infer the possible TF-gene regulatory associations in C. albicans . Based on TF-gene regulatory associations and gene expression profiles, a stochastic dynamic model was employed to reconstruct the gene regulatory networks of C. albicans biofilm and planktonic cells. The two networks were then compared and a score of relevance value (RV) was proposed to determine and assign the quantity of correlation of each potential TF with biofilm formation. A total of twenty-three TFs are identified to be related to the biofilm formation; ten of them are previously reported by literature evidences. The results indicate that the proposed screening method can successfully identify most known biofilm-related TFs and also identify many others that have not been previously reported. Together, this method can be employed as a pre-experiment screening approach that reveals new target genes for further characterization to understand the regulatory mechanisms in biofilm formation, which can serve as the starting point for therapeutic intervention of C. albicans infections.

Title: Identification of 15 candidate structured noncoding RNA motifs in fungi by comparative genomics
Authors: Sanshu Li, Ronald R. Breaker
Date: 2017-10-13

Abstract:
With the development of rapid and inexpensive DNA sequencing, the genome sequences of more than 100 fungal species have been made available. This dataset provides an excellent resource for comparative genomics analyses, which can be used to discover genetic elements, including noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs). Bioinformatics tools similar to those used to uncover novel ncRNAs in bacteria, likewise, should be useful for searching fungal genomic sequences, and the relative ease of genetic experiments with some model fungal species could facilitate experimental validation studies. We have adapted a bioinformatics pipeline for discovering bacterial ncRNAs to systematically analyze many fungal genomes. This comparative genomics pipeline integrates information on conserved RNA sequence and structural features with alternative splicing information to reveal fungal RNA motifs that are candidate regulatory domains, or that might have other possible functions. A total of 15 prominent classes of structured ncRNA candidates were identified, including variant HDV self-cleaving ribozyme representatives, atypical snoRNA candidates, and possible structured antisense RNA motifs. Candidate regulatory motifs were also found associated with genes for ribosomal proteins, S -adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (SDC), amidase, and HexA protein involved in Woronin body formation. We experimentally confirm that the variant HDV ribozymes undergo rapid self-cleavage, and we demonstrate that the SDC RNA motif reduces the expression of SAM decarboxylase by translational repression. Furthermore, we provide evidence that several other motifs discovered in this study are likely to be functional ncRNA elements. Systematic screening of fungal genomes using a computational discovery pipeline has revealed the existence of a variety of novel structured ncRNAs. Genome contexts and similarities to known ncRNA motifs provide strong evidence for the biological and biochemical functions of some newly found ncRNA motifs. Although initial examinations of several motifs provide evidence for their likely functions, other motifs will require more in-depth analysis to reveal their functions. The online version of this article (10.1186/s12864-017-4171-y) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.

Abstract:
Divergence of cis- regulatory elements drives species-specific traits 1 , but how this manifests in the evolution of the neocortex at the molecular and cellular level remains unclear. Here we investigated the gene regulatory programs in the primary motor cortex of human, macaque, marmoset and mouse using single-cell multiomics assays, generating gene expression, chromatin accessibility, DNA methylome and chromosomal conformation profiles from a total of over 200,000 cells. From these data, we show evidence that divergence of transcription factor expression corresponds to species-specific epigenome landscapes. We find that conserved and divergent gene regulatory features are reflected in the evolution of the three-dimensional genome. Transposable elements contribute to nearly 80% of the human-specific candidate cis- regulatory elements in cortical cells. Through machine learning, we develop sequence-based predictors of candidate cis- regulatory elements in different species and demonstrate that the genomic regulatory syntax is highly preserved from rodents to primates. Finally, we show that epigenetic conservation combined with sequence similarity helps to uncover functional cis- regulatory elements and enhances our ability to interpret genetic variants contributing to neurological disease and traits.

Date: 2006-04

Abstract:
The discoveries of microRNAs and riboswitches, among others, have shown functional RNAs to be biologically more important and genomically more prevalent than previously anticipated. We have developed a general comparative genomics method based on phylogenetic stochastic context-free grammars for identifying functional RNAs encoded in the human genome and used it to survey an eight-way genome-wide alignment of the human, chimpanzee, mouse, rat, dog, chicken, zebra-fish, and puffer-fish genomes for deeply conserved functional RNAs. At a loose threshold for acceptance, this search resulted in a set of 48,479 candidate RNA structures. This screen finds a large number of known functional RNAs, including 195 miRNAs, 62 histone 3′UTR stem loops, and various types of known genetic recoding elements. Among the highest-scoring new predictions are 169 new miRNA candidates, as well as new candidate selenocysteine insertion sites, RNA editing hairpins, RNAs involved in transcript auto regulation, and many folds that form singletons or small functional RNA families of completely unknown function. While the rate of false positives in the overall set is difficult to estimate and is likely to be substantial, the results nevertheless provide evidence for many new human functional RNAs and present specific predictions to facilitate their further characterization.

Date: 2009

Abstract:
The identification of regulatory sequences in animal genomes remains a significant challenge. Comparative genomic methods that use patterns of evolutionary conservation to identify non-coding sequences with regulatory function have yielded many new vertebrate enhancers. However, these methods have not contributed significantly to the identification of regulatory sequences in sequenced invertebrate taxa. We demonstrate here that this differential success, which is often attributed to fundamental differences in the nature of vertebrate and invertebrate regulatory sequences, is instead primarily a product of the relatively small size of sequenced invertebrate genomes. We sequenced and compared loci involved in early embryonic patterning from four species of true fruit flies (family Tephritidae) that have genomes four to six times larger than those of Drosophila melanogaster . Unlike in Drosophila , where virtually all non-coding DNA is highly conserved, blocks of conserved non-coding sequence in tephritids are flanked by large stretches of poorly conserved sequence, similar to what is observed in vertebrate genomes. We tested the activities of nine conserved non-coding sequences flanking the even-skipped gene of the teprhitid Ceratis capitata in transgenic D. melanogaster embryos, six of which drove patterns that recapitulate those of known D. melanogaster enhancers. In contrast, none of the three non-conserved tephritid non-coding sequences that we tested drove expression in D. melanogaster embryos. Based on the landscape of non-coding conservation in tephritids, and our initial success in using conservation in tephritids to identify D. melanogaster regulatory sequences, we suggest that comparison of tephritid genomes may provide a systematic means to annotate the non-coding portion of the D. melanogaster genome. We also propose that large genomes be given more consideration in the selection of species for comparative genomics projects, to provide increased power to detect functional non-coding DNAs and to provide a less biased view of the evolution and function of animal genomes.

Authors: Jiajun Feng, Xuming Dan, Yangkai Cui, Yi Gong, Minyue Peng, Yupeng Sang, Pär K. Ingvarsson, Jing Wang
Date: 2024-10-14

Abstract:
Global climate change is leading to rapid and drastic shifts in environmental conditions, posing threats to biodiversity and nearly all life forms worldwide. Forest trees serve as foundational components of terrestrial ecosystems and play a crucial and leading role in combating and mitigating the adverse effects of extreme climate events, despite their own vulnerability to these threats. Therefore, understanding and monitoring how natural forests respond to rapid climate change is a key priority for biodiversity conservation. Recent progress in evolutionary genomics, driven primarily by cutting-edge multi-omics technologies, offers powerful new tools to address several key issues. These include precise delineation of species and evolutionary units, inference of past evolutionary histories and demographic fluctuations, identification of environmentally adaptive variants, and measurement of genetic load levels. As the urgency to deal with more extreme environmental stresses grows, understanding the genomics of evolutionary history, local adaptation, future responses to climate change, and conservation and restoration of natural forest trees will be critical for research at the nexus of global change, population genomics, and conservation biology. In this review, we explore the application of evolutionary genomics to assess the effects of global climate change using multi-omics approaches and discuss the outlook for breeding of climate-adapted trees.

Abstract:
Life on Earth has evolved from initial simplicity to the astounding complexity we experience today. Bacteria and archaea have largely excelled in metabolic diversification, but eukaryotes additionally display abundant morphological innovation. How have these innovations come about and what constraints are there on the origins of novelty and the continuing maintenance of biodiversity on Earth? The history of life and the code for the working parts of cells and systems are written in the genome. The Earth BioGenome Project has proposed that the genomes of all extant, named eukaryotes—about 2 million species—should be sequenced to high quality to produce a digital library of life on Earth, beginning with strategic phylogenetic, ecological, and high-impact priorities. Here we discuss why we should sequence all eukaryotic species, not just a representative few scattered across the many branches of the tree of life. We suggest that many questions of evolutionary and ecological significance will only be addressable when whole-genome data representing divergences at all of the branchings in the tree of life or all species in natural ecosystems are available. We envisage that a genomic tree of life will foster understanding of the ongoing processes of speciation, adaptation, and organismal dependencies within entire ecosystems. These explorations will resolve long-standing problems in phylogenetics, evolution, ecology, conservation, agriculture, bioindustry, and medicine.

Title: The Resistome and Mobilome of Multidrug-Resistant Staphylococcus sciuri C2865 Unveil a Transferable Trimethoprim Resistance Gene, Designated dfrE , Spread Unnoticed
Authors: Elena Gómez-Sanz, Jose Manuel Haro-Moreno, Slade O. Jensen, Juan J. Roda-García, Mario López-Pérez

Abstract:
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus sciuri (MRSS) strain C2865 from a stranded dog in Nigeria was trimethoprim (TMP) resistant but lacked formerly described staphylococcal TMP-resistant dihydrofolate reductase genes ( dfr ). Whole-genome sequencing, comparative genomics, and pan-genome analyses were pursued to unveil the molecular bases for TMP resistance via resistome and mobilome profiling. MRSS C2865 comprised a species subcluster and positioned just above the intraspecies boundary. Lack of species host tropism was observed. S. sciuri exhibited an open pan-genome, while MRSS C2865 harbored the highest number of unique genes (75% associated with mobilome). Within this fraction, we discovered a transferable TMP resistance gene, named dfrE , which confers high-level TMP resistance in Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli . dfrE was located in a novel multidrug resistance mosaic plasmid (pUR2865-34) encompassing adaptive, mobilization, and segregational stability traits. dfrE was formerly denoted as dfr_like in Exiguobacterium spp. from fish farm sediment in China but escaped identification in one macrococcal and diverse staphylococcal genomes in different Asian countries. dfrE shares the highest identity with dfr of soil-related Paenibacillus anaericanus (68%). Data analysis discloses that dfrE has emerged from a single ancestor and places S. sciuri as a plausible donor. C2865 unique fraction additionally enclosed novel chromosomal mobile islands, including a multidrug-resistant pseudo-SCC mec cassette, three apparently functional prophages ( Siphoviridae ), and an SaPI4-related staphylococcal pathogenicity island. Since dfrE seems not yet common in staphylococcal clinical specimens, our data promote early surveillance and enable molecular diagnosis. We evidence the genome plasticity of S. sciuri and highlight its role as a resourceful reservoir for adaptive traits. IMPORTANCE The discovery and surveillance of antimicrobial resistance genes (AMRG) and their mobilization platforms are critical to understand the evolution of bacterial resistance and to restrain further expansion. Limited genomic data are available on Staphylococcus sciuri ; regardless, it is considered a reservoir for critical AMRG and mobile elements. We uncover a transferable staphylococcal TMP resistance gene, named dfrE , in a novel mosaic plasmid harboring additional resistance, adaptive, and self-stabilization features. dfrE is present but evaded detection in diverse species from varied sources geographically distant. Our analyses evidence that the dfrE -carrying element has emerged from a single ancestor and position S. sciuri as the donor species for dfrE spread. We also identify novel mobilizable chromosomal islands encompassing AMRG and three unrelated prophages. We prove high intraspecies heterogenicity and genome plasticity for S. sciuri . This work highlights the importance of genome-wide ecological studies to facilitate identification, characterization, and evolution routes of bacteria adaptive features.

Title: Predicting cis -acting elements of Lactobacillus plantarum by comparative genomics with different taxonomic subgroups
Authors: Michiel Wels, Christof Francke, Robert Kerkhoven, Michiel Kleerebezem, Roland J. Siezen
Date: 2006

Abstract:
Cis -acting elements in Lactobacillus plantarum were predicted by comparative analysis of the upstream regions of conserved genes and predicted transcriptional units (TUs) in different bacterial genomes. TUs were predicted for two species sets, with different evolutionary distances to L.plantarum . TUs were designated ‘cluster of orthologous transcriptional units’ (COT) when >50% of the genes were orthologous in different species. Conserved DNA sequences were detected in the upstream regions of different COTs. Subsequently, conserved motifs were used to scan upstream regions of all TUs. This method revealed 18 regulatory motifs only present in lactic acid bacteria (LAB). The 18 LAB-specific candidate regulatory motifs included 13 that were not described previously. These LAB-specific different motifs were found in front of genes encoding functions varying from cold shock proteins to RNA and DNA polymerases, and many unknown functions. The best-described LAB-specific motif found was the CopR-binding site, regulating expression of copper transport ATPases. Finally, all detected motifs were used to predict co-regulated TUs (regulons) for L.plantarum , and transcriptome profiling data were analyzed to provide regulon prediction validation. It is demonstrated that phylogenetic footprinting using different species sets can identify and distinguish between general regulatory motifs and LAB-specific regulatory motifs.

Abstract:
Structural variants (SVs) are large rearrangements (>50 bp) within the genome that impact gene function and the content and structure of chromosomes. As a result, SVs are a significant source of functional genomic variation, that is, variation at genomic regions underpinning phenotype differences, that can have large effects on individual and population fitness. While there are increasing opportunities to investigate functional genomic variation in threatened species via single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data sets, SVs remain understudied despite their potential influence on fitness traits of conservation interest. In this future‐focused Opinion, we contend that characterizing SVs offers the conservation genomics community an exciting opportunity to complement SNP‐based approaches to enhance species recovery. We also leverage the existing literature–predominantly in human health, agriculture and ecoevolutionary biology–to identify approaches for readily characterizing SVs and consider how integrating these into the conservation genomics toolbox may transform the way we manage some of the world's most threatened species.

Abstract:
Penguins (Sphenisciformes) are a remarkable order of flightless wing-propelled diving seabirds distributed widely across the southern hemisphere. They share a volant common ancestor with Procellariiformes close to the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary (66 million years ago) and subsequently lost the ability to fly but enhanced their diving capabilities. With ∼20 species among 6 genera, penguins range from the tropical Galápagos Islands to the oceanic temperate forests of New Zealand, the rocky coastlines of the sub-Antarctic islands, and the sea ice around Antarctica. To inhabit such diverse and extreme environments, penguins evolved many physiological and morphological adaptations. However, they are also highly sensitive to climate change. Therefore, penguins provide an exciting target system for understanding the evolutionary processes of speciation, adaptation, and demography. Genomic data are an emerging resource for addressing questions about such processes. Here we present a novel dataset of 19 high-coverage genomes that, together with 2 previously published genomes, encompass all extant penguin species. We also present a well-supported phylogeny to clarify the relationships among penguins. In contrast to recent studies, our results demonstrate that the genus Aptenodytes is basal and sister to all other extant penguin genera, providing intriguing new insights into the adaptation of penguins to Antarctica. As such, our dataset provides a novel resource for understanding the evolutionary history of penguins as a clade, as well as the fine-scale relationships of individual penguin lineages. Against this background, we introduce a major consortium of international scientists dedicated to studying these genomes. Moreover, we highlight emerging issues regarding ensuring legal and respectful indigenous consultation, particularly for genomic data originating from New Zealand Taonga species. We believe that our dataset and project will be important for understanding evolution, increasing cultural heritage and guiding the conservation of this iconic southern hemisphere species assemblage.

Title: Asymmetrical distribution of non-conserved regulatory sequences at PHOX2B is reflected at the ENCODE loci and illuminates a possible genome-wide trend
Authors: David M McGaughey, Zachary E Stine, Jimmy L Huynh, Ryan M Vinton, Andrew S McCallion
Date: 2009

Abstract:
Transcriptional regulatory elements are central to development and interspecific phenotypic variation. Current regulatory element prediction tools rely heavily upon conservation for prediction of putative elements. Recent in vitro observations from the ENCODE project combined with in vivo analyses at the zebrafish phox2b locus suggests that a significant fraction of regulatory elements may fall below commonly applied metrics of conservation. We propose to explore these observations in vivo at the human PHOX2B locus, and also evaluate the potential evidence for genome-wide applicability of these observations through a novel analysis of extant data. Transposon-based transgenic analysis utilizing a tiling path proximal to human PHOX2B in zebrafish recapitulates the observations at the zebrafish phox2b locus of both conserved and non-conserved regulatory elements. Analysis of human sequences conserved with previously identified zebrafish phox2b regulatory elements demonstrates that the orthologous sequences exhibit overlapping regulatory control. Additionally, analysis of non-conserved sequences scattered over 135 kb 5' to PHOX2B , provides evidence of non-conserved regulatory elements positively biased with close proximity to the gene. Furthermore, we provide a novel analysis of data from the ENCODE project, finding a non-uniform distribution of regulatory elements consistent with our in vivo observations at PHOX2B . These observations remain largely unchanged when one accounts for the sequence repeat content of the assayed intervals, when the intervals are sub-classified by biological role (developmental versus non-developmental), or by gene density (gene desert versus non-gene desert). While regulatory elements frequently display evidence of evolutionary conservation, a fraction appears to be undetected by current metrics of conservation. In vivo observations at the PHOX2B locus, supported by our analyses of in vitro data from the ENCODE project, suggest that the risk of excluding non-conserved sequences in a search for regulatory elements may decrease as distance from the gene increases. Our data combined with the ENCODE data suggests that this may represent a genome wide trend.

Title: Conserved non-coding elements: developmental gene regulation meets genome organization
Authors: Dimitris Polychronopoulos, James W. D. King, Alexander J. Nash, Ge Tan, Boris Lenhard
Date: 2017-12-15

Abstract:
Comparative genomics has revealed a class of non-protein-coding genomic sequences that display an extraordinary degree of conservation between two or more organisms, regularly exceeding that found within protein-coding exons. These elements, collectively referred to as conserved non-coding elements (CNEs), are non-randomly distributed across chromosomes and tend to cluster in the vicinity of genes with regulatory roles in multicellular development and differentiation. CNEs are organized into functional ensembles called genomic regulatory blocks–dense clusters of elements that collectively coordinate the expression of shared target genes, and whose span in many cases coincides with topologically associated domains. CNEs display sequence properties that set them apart from other sequences under constraint, and have recently been proposed as useful markers for the reconstruction of the evolutionary history of organisms. Disruption of several of these elements is known to contribute to diseases linked with development, and cancer. The emergence, evolutionary dynamics and functions of CNEs still remain poorly understood, and new approaches are required to enable comprehensive CNE identification and characterization. Here, we review current knowledge and identify challenges that need to be tackled to resolve the impasse in understanding extreme non-coding conservation.

Abstract:
Knowledge of locations and activities of cis -regulatory elements (CREs) is needed to decipher basic mechanisms of gene regulation and to understand the impact of genetic variants on complex traits. Previous studies identified candidate CREs (cCREs) using epigenetic features in one species, making comparisons difficult between species. In contrast, we conducted an interspecies study defining epigenetic states and identifying cCREs in blood cell types to generate regulatory maps that are comparable between species, using integrative modeling of eight epigenetic features jointly in human and mouse in our Validated Systematic Integration (VISION) Project. The resulting catalogs of cCREs are useful resources for further studies of gene regulation in blood cells, indicated by high overlap with known functional elements and strong enrichment for human genetic variants associated with blood cell phenotypes. The contribution of each epigenetic state in cCREs to gene regulation, inferred from a multivariate regression, was used to estimate epigenetic state regulatory potential (esRP) scores for each cCRE in each cell type, which were used to categorize dynamic changes in cCREs. Groups of cCREs displaying similar patterns of regulatory activity in human and mouse cell types, obtained by joint clustering on esRP scores, harbor distinctive transcription factor binding motifs that are similar between species. An interspecies comparison of cCREs revealed both conserved and species-specific patterns of epigenetic evolution. Finally, we show that comparisons of the epigenetic landscape between species can reveal elements with similar roles in regulation, even in the absence of genomic sequence alignment.

Abstract:
The recent advances in DNA sequencing technology are enabling a rapid increase in the number of genomes being sequenced. However, many fundamental questions in genome biology remain unanswered, because sequence data alone is unable to provide insight into how the genome is organised into chromosomes, the position and interaction of those chromosomes in the cell, and how chromosomes and their interactions with each other change in response to environmental stimuli or over time. The intimate relationship between DNA sequence and chromosome structure and function highlights the need to integrate genomic and cytogenetic data to more comprehensively understand the role genome architecture plays in genome plasticity. We propose adoption of the term ‘chromosomics’ as an approach encompassing genome sequencing, cytogenetics and cell biology, and present examples of where chromosomics has already led to novel discoveries, such as the sex-determining gene in eutherian mammals. More importantly, we look to the future and the questions that could be answered as we enter into the chromosomics revolution, such as the role of chromosome rearrangements in speciation and the role more rapidly evolving regions of the genome, like centromeres, play in genome plasticity. However, for chromosomics to reach its full potential, we need to address several challenges, particularly the training of a new generation of cytogeneticists, and the commitment to a closer union among the research areas of genomics, cytogenetics, cell biology and bioinformatics. Overcoming these challenges will lead to ground-breaking discoveries in understanding genome evolution and function.

Abstract:
Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) enhances plant water-use efficiency through an inverse day/night pattern of stomatal closure/opening that facilitates nocturnal CO 2 uptake. CAM has evolved independently in over 35 plant lineages, accounting for ~ 6% of all higher plants. Agave species are highly heat- and drought-tolerant, and have been domesticated as model CAM crops for beverage, fiber, and biofuel production in semi-arid and arid regions. However, the genomic basis of evolutionary innovation of CAM in genus Agave is largely unknown. Using an approach that integrated genomics, gene co-expression networks, comparative genomics and protein structure analyses, we investigated the molecular evolution of CAM as exemplified in Agave . Comparative genomics analyses among C 3 , C 4 and CAM species revealed that core metabolic components required for CAM have ancient genomic origins traceable to non-vascular plants while regulatory proteins required for diel re-programming of metabolism have a more recent origin shared among C 3 , C 4 and CAM species. We showed that accelerated evolution of key functional domains in proteins responsible for primary metabolism and signaling, together with a diel re-programming of the transcription of genes involved in carbon fixation, carbohydrate processing, redox homeostasis, and circadian control is required for the evolution of CAM in Agave . Furthermore, we highlighted the potential candidates contributing to the adaptation of CAM functional modules. This work provides evidence of adaptive evolution of CAM related pathways. We showed that the core metabolic components required for CAM are shared by non-vascular plants, but regulatory proteins involved in re-reprogramming of carbon fixation and metabolite transportation appeared more recently. We propose that the accelerated evolution of key proteins together with a diel re-programming of gene expression were required for CAM evolution from C 3 ancestors in Agave .

Abstract:
Mutations in PROP1 are a common genetic cause of multiple pituitary hormone deficiency (MPHD). We used a comparative genomics approach to predict the transcriptional regulatory domains of Prop1 and tested them in cell culture and mice. A BAC transgene containing Prop1 completely rescues the Prop1 mutant phenotype, demonstrating that the regulatory elements necessary for proper PROP1 transcription are contained within the BAC. We generated DNA sequences from the PROP1 genes in lemur, pig, and five different primate species. Comparison of these with available human and mouse PROP1 sequences identified three putative regulatory sequences that are highly conserved. These are located in the PROP1 promoter proximal region, within the first intron of PROP1 , and downstream of PROP1 . Each of the conserved elements elicited orientation-specific enhancer activity in the context of the Drosophila alcohol dehydrogenase minimal promoter in both heterologous and pituitary-derived cells lines. The intronic element is sufficient to confer dorsal expansion of the pituitary expression domain of a transgene, suggesting that this element is important for the normal spatial expression of endogenous Prop1 during pituitary development. This study illustrates the usefulness of a comparative genomics approach in the identification of regulatory elements that may be the site of mutations responsible for some cases of MPHD.

Abstract:
Chondrichthyes is an important lineage to reconstruct the evolutionary history of vertebrates. Here, we analyzed genome synteny for six chondrichthyan chromosome-level genomes. Our comparative analysis reveals a slow evolutionary rate of chromosomal changes, with infrequent but independent fusions observed in sharks, skates, and chimaeras. The chondrichthyan common ancestor had a proto-vertebrate-like karyotype, including the presence of 18 microchromosome pairs. The X chromosome is a conversed microchromosome shared by all sharks, suggesting a likely common origin of the sex chromosome at least 181 million years ago. We characterized the Y chromosomes of two sharks that are highly differentiated from the X except for a small young evolutionary stratum and a small pseudoautosomal region. We found that shark sex chromosomes lack global dosage compensation but that dosage-sensitive genes are locally compensated. Our study on shark chromosome evolution enhances our understanding of shark sex chromosomes and vertebrate chromosome evolution.

Title: Construction of an integrative regulatory element and variation map of the murine Tst locus
Authors: Jasmina Beltram, Nicholas M. Morton, Tanja Kunej, Simon Horvat
Date: 2016-06-11

Abstract:
Given the abundance of new genomic projects and gene annotations, researchers trying to pinpoint causal genetic variants are faced with a challenging task of how to efficiently integrate all current genomic information. The objective of the study was to develop an approach to integrate various genomic annotations for a recently positionally-cloned Tst gene (Thiosulfate Sulfur Transferase, synonym Rhodanese) responsible for the Fob3b2 QTL effect on leanness and improved metabolic parameters. The second aim was to identify and prioritize Tst genetic variants that may be causal for the phenotypic effects. A bioinformatics approach was developed to integrate existing knowledge of regulatory elements of the Tst gene. The entire Tst locus along with flanking segments was sequenced between our unique polygenic mouse Fat and Lean strains that were generated by divergent selection on adiposity for over 60 generations. The bioinformatics-generated regulatory element map of the Tst locus was then combined with genetic variants between the Fat and Lean mice and with comparative analyses of polymorphisms across 17 mouse strains in order to prioritise likely causal polymorphisms. Two candidate regulatory variants were identified, one overlapping an evolutionary constrained Tst intronic element and the other residing in the seed region of a predicted 3′UTR miRNA binding site. This study developed a map of regulatory elements for the Tst locus in mice and identified candidate genetic variants with increased causal likelihood. This map provides a basis for experimental validation and functional analyses of this novel candidate leanness and antidiabetic gene. Our methodological approach is of general utility for analyzing regulation of loci that have limited annotations and experimental evidence and for identifying candidate causal regulatory genetic variants in post-GWAS or post-QTL- cloning studies.

Abstract:
Changes in gene regulation are thought to underlie most phenotypic differences between species. For subterranean rodents such as the naked mole-rat, proposed phenotypic adaptations include hypoxia tolerance, metabolic changes, and cancer resistance. However, it is largely unknown what regulatory changes may associate with these phenotypic traits, and whether these are unique to the naked mole-rat, the mole-rat clade, or are also present in other mammals. Here, we investigate regulatory evolution in the heart and liver from two African mole-rat species and two rodent outgroups using genome-wide epigenomic profiling. First, we adapted and applied a phylogenetic modeling approach to quantitatively compare epigenomic signals at orthologous regulatory elements and identified thousands of promoter and enhancer regions with differential epigenomic activity in mole-rats. These elements associate with known mole-rat adaptations in metabolic and functional pathways and suggest candidate genetic loci that may underlie mole-rat innovations. Second, we evaluated ancestral and species-specific regulatory changes in the study phylogeny and report several candidate pathways experiencing stepwise remodeling during the evolution of mole-rats, such as the insulin and hypoxia response pathways. Third, we report nonorthologous regulatory elements overlap with lineage-specific repetitive elements and appear to modify metabolic pathways by rewiring of HNF4 and RAR/RXR transcription factor binding sites in mole-rats. These comparative analyses reveal how mole-rat regulatory evolution informs previously reported phenotypic adaptations. Moreover, the phylogenetic modeling framework we propose here improves upon the state of the art by addressing known limitations of inter-species comparisons of epigenomic profiles and has broad implications in the field of comparative functional genomics.

Abstract:
Methionine metabolism and uptake genes in Proteobacteria are controlled by a variety of RNA and DNA regulatory systems. We have applied comparative genomics to reconstruct regulons for three known transcription factors, MetJ, MetR, and SahR, and three known riboswitch motifs, SAH, SAM-SAH, and SAM_alpha, in ∼200 genomes from 22 taxonomic groups of Proteobacteria. We also identified two novel regulons: a SahR-like transcription factor SamR controlling various methionine biosynthesis genes in the Xanthomonadales group, and a potential RNA regulatory element with terminator-antiterminator mechanism controlling the metX or metZ genes in beta-proteobacteria. For each analyzed regulator we identified the core, taxon-specific and genome-specific regulon members. By analyzing the distribution of these regulators in bacterial genomes and by comparing their regulon contents we elucidated possible evolutionary scenarios for the regulation of the methionine metabolism genes in Proteobacteria.

Abstract:
Pmp22 , a member of the junction protein family Claudin/EMP/PMP22, plays an important role in myelin formation. Increase of pmp22 transcription causes peripheral neuropathy, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type1A (CMT1A). The pathophysiological phenotype of CMT1A is aberrant axonal myelination which induces a reduction in nerve conduction velocity (NCV). Several CMT1A model rodents have been established by overexpressing pmp22 . Thus, it is thought that pmp22 expression must be tightly regulated for correct myelin formation in mammals. Interestingly, the myelin sheath is also present in other jawed vertebrates. The purpose of this study is to analyze the evolutionary conservation of the association between pmp22 transcription level and vertebrate myelin formation, and to find the conserved non-coding sequences for pmp22 regulation by comparative genomics analyses between jawed fishes and mammals. A transgenic pmp22 over-expression medaka fish line was established. The transgenic fish had approximately one fifth the peripheral NCV values of controls, and aberrant myelination of transgenic fish in the peripheral nerve system (PNS) was observed. We successfully confirmed that medaka fish pmp22 has the same exon-intron structure as mammals, and identified some known conserved regulatory motifs. Furthermore, we found novel conserved sequences in the first intron and 3'UTR. Medaka fish undergo abnormalities in the PNS when pmp22 transcription increases. This result indicates that an adequate pmp22 transcription level is necessary for correct myelination of jawed vertebrates. Comparison of pmp22 orthologs between distantly related species identifies evolutionary conserved sequences that contribute to precise regulation of pmp22 expression.

Title: Exonic remnants of whole-genome duplication reveal cis -regulatory function of coding exons
Authors: Xianjun Dong, Pavla Navratilova, David Fredman, Øyvind Drivenes, Thomas S. Becker, Boris Lenhard
Date: 2010-03

Abstract:
Using a comparative genomics approach to reconstruct the fate of genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs) and identify exonic remnants that have survived the disappearance of their host genes after whole-genome duplication (WGD) in teleosts, we discover a set of 38 candidate cis- regulatory coding exons (RCEs) with predicted target genes. These elements demonstrate evolutionary separation of overlapping protein-coding and regulatory information after WGD in teleosts. We present evidence that the corresponding mammalian exons are still under both coding and non-coding selection pressure, are more conserved than other protein coding exons in the host gene and several control sets, and share key characteristics with highly conserved non-coding elements in the same regions. Their dual function is corroborated by existing experimental data. Additionally, we show examples of human exon remnants stemming from the vertebrate 2R WGD. Our findings suggest that long-range cis -regulatory inputs for developmental genes are not limited to non-coding regions, but can also overlap the coding sequence of unrelated genes. Thus, exonic regulatory elements in GRBs might be functionally equivalent to those in non-coding regions, calling for a re-evaluation of the sequence space in which to look for long-range regulatory elements and experimentally test their activity.

Abstract:
Human accelerated regions (HARs) are short conserved genomic sequences that have acquired significantly more nucleotide substitutions than expected in the human lineage after divergence from chimpanzees. The fast evolution of HARs may reflect their roles in the origin of human-specific traits. A recent study has reported positively-selected single nucleotide variants (SNVs) within brain-exclusive human accelerated enhancers (BE-HAEs) hs1210 (forebrain), hs563 (hindbrain) and hs304 (midbrain/forebrain). By including data from archaic hominins, these SNVs were shown to be Homo sapiens-specific, residing within transcriptional factors binding sites (TFBSs) for SOX2 (hs1210), RUNX1/3 (hs563), and FOS/JUND (hs304). Although these findings suggest that the predicted modifications in TFBSs may have some role in present-day brain structure, work is required to verify the extent to which these changes translate into functional variation. To start to fill this gap, we investigate the SOX2 SNV, with both forebrain expression and strong signal of positive selection in humans. We demonstrate that the HMG box of SOX2 binds in vitro with Homo sapiens-specific derived A-allele and ancestral T-allele carrying DNA sites in BE-HAE hs1210. Molecular docking and simulation analysis indicated highly favourable binding of HMG box with derived A-allele containing DNA site when compared to site carrying ancestral T-allele. These results suggest that adoptive changes in TF affinity within BE-HAE hs1210 and other HAR enhancers in the evolutionary history of Homo sapiens might. have brought about changes in gene expression patterns and have functional consequences on forebrain formation and evolution. The present study employ electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) and molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations approaches.

Abstract:
The economically significant genus Prunus includes fruit and nut crops that have been domesticated for shared and specific agronomic traits; however, the genomic signals of convergent and divergent selection have not been elucidated. In this study, we aimed to detect genomic signatures of convergent and divergent selection by conducting comparative population genomic analyses of the apricot–peach–plum–mei (APPM) complex, utilizing a haplotype-resolved telomere-to-telomere (T2T) genome assembly and population resequencing data. The haplotype-resolved T2T reference genome for the plum cultivar was assembled through HiFi and Hi-C reads, resulting in two haplotypes 251.25 and 251.29 Mb in size, respectively. Comparative genomics reveals a chromosomal translocation of ~1.17 Mb in the apricot genomes compared with peach, plum, and mei. Notably, the translocation involves the D locus, significantly impacting titratable acidity (TA), pH, and sugar content. Population genetic analysis detected substantial gene flow between plum and apricot, with introgression regions enriched in post-embryonic development and pollen germination processes. Comparative population genetic analyses revealed convergent selection for stress tolerance, flower development, and fruit ripening, along with divergent selection shaping specific crop, such as somatic embryogenesis in plum, pollen germination in mei, and hormone regulation in peach. Notably, selective sweeps on chromosome 7 coincide with a chromosomal collinearity from the comparative genomics, impacting key fruit-softening genes such as PG , regulated by ERF and RMA1H1 . Overall, this study provides insights into the genetic diversity, evolutionary history, and domestication of the APPM complex, offering valuable implications for genetic studies and breeding programs of Prunus crops.

Title: The Genomic Impact of Gene Retrocopies: What Have We Learned from Comparative Genomics, Population Genomics, and Transcriptomic Analyses?
Authors: Claudio Casola, Esther Betrán
Date: 2017-06

Abstract:
Gene duplication is a major driver of organismal evolution. Gene retroposition is a mechanism of gene duplication whereby a gene’s transcript is used as a template to generate retroposed gene copies, or retrocopies. Intriguingly, the formation of retrocopies depends upon the enzymatic machinery encoded by retrotransposable elements, genomic parasites occurring in the majority of eukaryotes. Most retrocopies are depleted of the regulatory regions found upstream of their parental genes; therefore, they were initially considered transcriptionally incompetent gene copies, or retropseudogenes. However, examples of functional retrocopies, or retrogenes, have accumulated since the 1980s. Here, we review what we have learned about retrocopies in animals, plants and other eukaryotic organisms, with a particular emphasis on comparative and population genomic analyses complemented with transcriptomic datasets. In addition, these data have provided information about the dynamics of the different “life cycle” stages of retrocopies (i.e., polymorphic retrocopy number variants, fixed retropseudogenes and retrogenes) and have provided key insights into the retroduplication mechanisms, the patterns and evolutionary forces at work during the fixation process and the biological function of retrogenes. Functional genomic and transcriptomic data have also revealed that many retropseudogenes are transcriptionally active and a biological role has been experimentally determined for many. Finally, we have learned that not only non-long terminal repeat retroelements but also long terminal repeat retroelements play a role in the emergence of retrocopies across eukaryotes. This body of work has shown that mRNA-mediated duplication represents a widespread phenomenon that produces an array of new genes that contribute to organismal diversity and adaptation.

Title: Tetrachloroethene respiration in Sulfurospirillum species is regulated by a two‐component system as unraveled by comparative genomics, transcriptomics, and regulator binding studies

Abstract:
Energy conservation via organohalide respiration (OHR) in dehalogenating Sulfurospirillum species is an inducible process. However, the gene products involved in tetrachloroethene (PCE) sensing and signal transduction have not been unambiguously identified. Here, genome sequencing of Sulfurospirillum strains defective in PCE respiration and comparative genomics, which included the PCE‐respiring representatives of the genus, uncovered the genetic inactivation of a two‐component system (TCS) in the OHR gene region of the natural mutants. The assumption that the TCS gene products serve as a PCE sensor that initiates gene transcription was supported by the constitutive low‐level expression of the TCS operon in fumarate‐adapted cells of Sulfurospirillum multivorans . Via RNA sequencing, eight transcriptional units were identified in the OHR gene region, which includes the TCS operon, the PCE reductive dehalogenase operon, the gene cluster for norcobamide biosynthesis, and putative accessory genes with unknown functions. The OmpR‐family response regulator (RR) encoded in the TCS operon was functionally characterized by promoter‐binding assays. The RR bound a cis ‐regulatory element that contained a consensus sequence of a direct repeat (CTATW) separated by 17 bp. Its location either overlapping the −35 box or 50 bp further upstream indicated different regulatory mechanisms. Sequence variations in the regulator binding sites identified in the OHR gene region were in accordance with differences in the transcript levels of the respective gene clusters forming the PCE regulon. The results indicate the presence of a fine‐tuned regulatory network controlling PCE metabolism in dehalogenating Sulfurospirillum species, a group of metabolically versatile organohalide‐respiring bacteria.

Title: Zebrafish regulatory genomic resources for disease modelling and regeneration
Authors: Ada Jimenez Gonzalez, Damir Baranasic, Ferenc Müller
Date: 2023-08-01

Abstract:
In the past decades, the zebrafish has become a disease model with increasing popularity owing to its advantages that include fast development, easy genetic manipulation, simplicity for imaging, and sharing conserved disease-associated genes and pathways with those of human. In parallel, studies of disease mechanisms are increasingly focusing on non-coding mutations, which require genome annotation maps of regulatory elements, such as enhancers and promoters. In line with this, genomic resources for zebrafish research are expanding, producing a variety of genomic data that help in defining regulatory elements and their conservation between zebrafish and humans. Here, we discuss recent developments in generating functional annotation maps for regulatory elements of the zebrafish genome and how this can be applied to human diseases. We highlight community-driven developments, such as DANIO-CODE, in generating a centralised and standardised catalogue of zebrafish genomics data and functional annotations; consider the advantages and limitations of current annotation maps; and offer considerations for interpreting and integrating existing maps with comparative genomics tools. We also discuss the need for developing standardised genomics protocols and bioinformatic pipelines and provide suggestions for the development of analysis and visualisation tools that will integrate various multiomic bulk sequencing data together with fast-expanding data on single-cell methods, such as single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing. Such integration tools are essential to exploit the multiomic chromatin characterisation offered by bulk genomics together with the cell-type resolution offered by emerging single-cell methods. Together, these advances will build an expansive toolkit for interrogating the mechanisms of human disease in zebrafish.

Title: Chromosome-scale assemblies of three Ormosia species: repetitive sequences distribution and structural rearrangement
Authors: Zheng-Feng Wang, En-Ping Yu, Lin Fu, Hua-Ge Deng, Wei-Guang Zhu, Feng-Xia Xu, Hong-Lin Cao
Date: 2025

Abstract:
The genus Ormosia belongs to the Fabaceae family; almost all Ormosia species are endemic to China, which is considered one of the centers of this genus. Thus, genomic studies on the genus are needed to better understand species evolution and ensure the conservation and utilization of these species. We performed a chromosome-scale assembly of O. purpureiflora and updated the chromosome-scale assemblies of O. emarginata and O. semicastrata for comparative genomics. The genome assembly sizes of the 3 species ranged from 1.42 to 1.58 Gb, with O. purpureiflora being the largest. Repetitive sequences accounted for 74.0–76.3% of the genomes, and the predicted gene counts ranged from 50,517 to 55,061. Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCO) analysis indicated 97.0–98.4% genome completeness, whereas the long terminal repeat (LTR) assembly index values ranged from 13.66 to 17.56, meeting the “reference genome” quality standard. Gene completeness, assessed using BUSCO and OMArk, ranged from 95.1% to 96.3% and from 97.1% to 98.1%, respectively. Characterizing genome architectures further revealed that inversions were the main structural rearrangements in Ormosia . In numbers, density distributions of repetitive elements revealed the types of Helitron and terminal inverted repeat (TIR) elements and the types of Gypsy and unknown LTR retrotransposons (LTR-RTs) concentrated in different regions on the chromosomes, whereas Copia LTR-RTs were generally evenly distributed along the chromosomes in Ormosia . Compared with the sister species Lupinus albus, Ormosia species had lower numbers and percentages of resistance ( R ) genes and transcription factor genes. Genes related to alkaloid, terpene, and flavonoid biosynthesis were found to be duplicated through tandem or proximal duplications. Notably, some genes associated with growth and defense were absent in O. purpureiflora . By resequencing 153 genotypes (∼30 Gb of data per sample) from 6 O. purpureiflora (sub)populations, we identified 40,146 single nucleotide polymorphisms. Corresponding to its very small populations, O. purpureiflora exhibited low genetic diversity. The Ormosia genome assemblies provide valuable resources for studying the evolution, conservation, and potential utility of both Ormosia and Fabaceae species.

Title: Jack of all trades: Genome assembly of Wild Jack and comparative genomics of Artocarpus 
Authors: Ajinkya Bharatraj Patil, Sai Samhitha Vajja, S. Raghavendra, B. N. Satish, C. G. Kushalappa, Nagarjun Vijay
Date: 2022-12-12

Abstract:
 Artocarpus (Moraceae), known as breadfruits for their diverse nutritious fruits, is prized for its high-quality timber, medicinal value, and economic importance. Breadfruits are native to Southeast Asia but have been introduced to other continents. The most commonly cultivated species are Artocarpus heterophyllus (Jackfruit) and Artocarpus altilis (Breadfruit). With numerous smaller but nutritionally comparable fruits on a larger tree, Artocarpus hirsutus , also called “Wild Jack” or “Ayani”, is an elusive forest species endemic to Indian Western Ghats. In this study, we sequenced and assembled the whole genome of Artocarpus hirsutus sampled from the sacred groves of Coorg, India. To decipher demographic and evolutionary history, we compared our Wild Jack genome with previously published Jackfruit and Breadfruit genomes. Demographic history reconstruction indicates a stronger effect of habitat rather than phylogeny on the population histories of these plants. Repetitive genomic regions, especially LTR Copia, strongly affected the demographic trajectory of A. heterophyllus . Upon further investigation, we found a recent lineage-specific accumulation of LTR Copia in A. heterophyllus , which had a major contribution to its larger genome size. Several genes from starch, sucrose metabolism, and plant hormone signal transduction pathways, in Artocarpus species had signatures of selection and gene family evolution. Our comparative genomic framework provides important insights by incorporating endemic species such as the Wild Jack.

Title: Genome-wide de novo prediction of cis -regulatory binding sites in prokaryotes
Authors: Shaoqiang Zhang, Minli Xu, Shan Li, Zhengchang Su
Date: 2009-06

Abstract:
Although cis -regulatory binding sites (CRBSs) are at least as important as the coding sequences in a genome, our general understanding of them in most sequenced genomes is very limited due to the lack of efficient and accurate experimental and computational methods for their characterization, which has largely hindered our understanding of many important biological processes. In this article, we describe a novel algorithm for genome-wide de novo prediction of CRBSs with high accuracy. We designed our algorithm to circumvent three identified difficulties for CRBS prediction using comparative genomics principles based on a new method for the selection of reference genomes, a new metric for measuring the similarity of CRBSs, and a new graph clustering procedure. When operon structures are correctly predicted, our algorithm can predict 81% of known individual binding sites belonging to 94% of known cis -regulatory motifs in the Escherichia coli K12 genome, while achieving high prediction specificity. Our algorithm has also achieved similar prediction accuracy in the Bacillus subtilis genome, suggesting that it is very robust, and thus can be applied to any other sequenced prokaryotic genome. When compared with the prior state-of-the-art algorithms, our algorithm outperforms them in both prediction sensitivity and specificity.

Abstract:
Changes in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression have a central role in evolution. Here, we extensively profiled a panel of human, chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, and macaque lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), using ChIP-seq for five histone marks, ATAC-seq and RNA-seq, further complemented with whole genome sequencing (WGS) and whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS). We annotated regulatory elements (RE) and integrated chromatin contact maps to define gene regulatory architectures, creating the largest catalog of RE in primates to date. We report that epigenetic conservation and its correlation with sequence conservation in primates depends on the activity state of the regulatory element. Our gene regulatory architectures reveal the coordination of different types of components and highlight the role of promoters and intragenic enhancers (gE) in the regulation of gene expression. We observe that most regulatory changes occur in weakly active gE. Remarkably, novel human-specific gE with weak activities are enriched in human-specific nucleotide changes. These elements appear in genes with signals of positive selection and human acceleration, tissue-specific expression, and particular functional enrichments, suggesting that the regulatory evolution of these genes may have contributed to human adaptation.

Title: Comparative genomics using teleost fish helps to systematically identify target gene bodies of functionally defined human enhancers

Abstract:
Human genome is enriched with thousands of conserved non-coding elements (CNEs). Recently, a medium throughput strategy was employed to analyze the ability of human CNEs to drive tissue specific expression during mouse embryogenesis. These data led to the establishment of publicly available genome wide catalog of functionally defined human enhancers. Scattering of enhancers over larger regions in vertebrate genomes seriously impede attempts to pinpoint their precise target genes. Such associations are prerequisite to explore the significance of this in vivo characterized catalog of human enhancers in development, disease and evolution. This study is an attempt to systematically identify the target gene-bodies for functionally defined human CNE-enhancers. For the purpose we adopted the orthology/paralogy mapping approach and compared the CNE induced reporter expression with reported endogenous expression pattern of neighboring genes. This procedure pinpointed specific target gene-bodies for the total of 192 human CNE-enhancers. This enables us to gauge the maximum genomic search space for enhancer hunting: 4 Mb of genomic sequence around the gene of interest (2 Mb on either side). Furthermore, we used human-rodent comparison for a set of 159 orthologous enhancer pairs to infer that the central nervous system (CNS) specific gene expression is closely associated with the cooperative interaction among at least eight distinct transcription factors: SOX5, HFH, SOX17, HNF3β, c-FOS, Tal1beta-E47S, MEF and FREAC. In conclusion, the systematic wiring of cis -acting sites and their target gene bodies is an important step to unravel the role of in vivo characterized catalog of human enhancers in development, physiology and medicine.

Title: Flexible comparative genomics of prokaryotic transcriptional regulatory networks
Authors: Sefa Kılıç, Miquel Sánchez-Osuna, Antonio Collado-Padilla, Jordi Barbé, Ivan Erill
Date: 2020-12-16

Abstract:
Comparative genomics methods enable the reconstruction of bacterial regulatory networks using available experimental data. In spite of their potential for accelerating research into the composition and evolution of bacterial regulons, few comparative genomics suites have been developed for the automated analysis of these regulatory systems. Available solutions typically rely on precomputed databases for operon and ortholog predictions, limiting the scope of analyses to processed complete genomes, and several key issues such as the transfer of experimental information or the integration of regulatory information in a probabilistic setting remain largely unaddressed. Here we introduce CGB, a flexible platform for comparative genomics of prokaryotic regulons. CGB has few external dependencies and enables fully customized analyses of newly available genome data. The platform automates the merging of experimental information and uses a gene-centered, Bayesian framework to generate and integrate easily interpretable results. We demonstrate its flexibility and power by analyzing the evolution of type III secretion system regulation in pathogenic Proteobacteria and by characterizing the SOS regulon of a new bacterial phylum, the Balneolaeota. Our results demonstrate the applicability of the CGB pipeline in multiple settings. CGB’s ability to automatically integrate experimental information from multiple sources and use complete and draft genomic data, coupled with its non-reliance on precomputed databases and its easily interpretable display of gene-centered posterior probabilities of regulation provide users with an unprecedented level of flexibility in launching comparative genomics analyses of prokaryotic transcriptional regulatory networks. The analyses of type III secretion and SOS response regulatory networks illustrate instances of convergent and divergent evolution of these regulatory systems, showcasing the power of formal ancestral state reconstruction at inferring the evolutionary history of regulatory networks.

Abstract:
To investigate the mechanisms driving regulatory evolution across tissues, we experimentally mapped promoters, enhancers, and gene expression in the liver, brain, muscle, and testis from ten diverse mammals. The regulatory landscape around genes included both tissue-shared and tissue-specific regulatory regions, where tissue-specific promoters and enhancers evolved most rapidly. Genomic regions switching between promoters and enhancers were more common across species, and less common across tissues within a single species. Long Interspersed Nuclear Elements (LINEs) played recurrent evolutionary roles: LINE L1s were associated with tissue-specific regulatory regions, whereas more ancient LINE L2s were associated with tissue-shared regulatory regions and with those switching between promoter and enhancer signatures across species. Our analyses of the tissue-specificity and evolutionary stability among promoters and enhancers reveal how specific LINE families have helped shape the dynamic mammalian regulome.

Abstract:
A substantial portion of the primate genome is composed of non-coding regions, so-called “dark matter”, which includes an abundance of tandemly repeated sequences called satellite DNA. Collectively known as the satellitome, this genomic component offers exciting evolutionary insights into aspects of primate genome biology that raise new questions and challenge existing paradigms. A complete human reference genome was recently reported with telomere-to-telomere human X chromosome assembly that resolved hundreds of dark regions, encompassing a 3.1 Mb centromeric satellite array that had not been identified previously. With the recent exponential increase in the availability of primate genomes, and the development of modern genomic and bioinformatics tools, extensive growth in our knowledge concerning the structure, function, and evolution of satellite elements is expected. The current state of knowledge on this topic is summarized, highlighting various types of primate-specific satellite repeats to compare their proportions across diverse lineages. Inter- and intraspecific variation of satellite repeats in the primate genome are reviewed. The functional significance of these sequences is discussed by describing how the transcriptional activity of satellite repeats can affect gene expression during different cellular processes. Sex-linked satellites are outlined, together with their respective genomic organization. Mechanisms are proposed whereby satellite repeats might have emerged as novel sequences during different evolutionary phases. Finally, the main challenges that hinder the detection of satellite DNA are outlined and an overview of the latest methodologies to address technological limitations is presented.

Abstract:
The laboratory mouse shares the majority of its protein-coding genes with humans, making it the premier model organism in biomedical research, yet the two mammals differ in significant ways. To gain greater insights into both shared and species-specific transcriptional and cellular regulatory programs in the mouse, the Mouse ENCODE Consortium has mapped transcription, DNase I hypersensitivity, transcription factor binding, chromatin modifications and replication domains throughout the mouse genome in diverse cell and tissue types. By comparing with the human genome, we not only confirm substantial conservation in the newly annotated potential functional sequences, but also find a large degree of divergence of sequences involved in transcriptional regulation, chromatin state and higher order chromatin organization. Our results illuminate the wide range of evolutionary forces acting on genes and their regulatory regions, and provide a general resource for research into mammalian biology and mechanisms of human diseases.

Title: The importance of considering regulatory domains in genome-wide analyses – the nearest gene is often wrong!
Authors: Ellora Hui Zhen Chua, Samen Yasar, Nathan Harmston
Date: 2022-04-15

Abstract:
The expression of a large number of genes is regulated by regulatory elements that are located far away from their promoters. Identifying which gene is the target of a specific regulatory element or is affected by a non-coding mutation is often accomplished by assigning these regions to the nearest gene in the genome. However, this heuristic ignores key features of genome organisation and gene regulation; in that the genome is partitioned into regulatory domains, which at some loci directly coincide with the span of topologically associated domains (TADs), and that genes are regulated by enhancers located throughout these regions, even across intervening genes. In this review, we examine the results from genome-wide studies using chromosome conformation capture technologies and from those dissecting individual gene regulatory domains, to highlight that the phenomenon of enhancer skipping is pervasive and affects multiple types of genes. We discuss how simply assigning a genomic region of interest to its nearest gene is problematic and often leads to incorrect predictions and highlight that where possible information on both the conservation and topological organisation of the genome should be used to generate better hypotheses.  The article has an associated Future Leader to Watch interview.

Title: Redundant and Singular Regulatory Elements Underlie the Rapidly Evolving Pigmentation of Drosophila

Date: 2025-09

Abstract:
A major hurdle in understanding the molecular changes responsible for metazoan diversity is the characterization of cis -regulatory elements (CREs) for gene regulatory networks (GRNs). CRE changes are suspected to be commonplace in trait evolution, since such changes circumvent the deleterious effects of pleiotropy. A growing list of genes, though, is known to be regulated by redundant CREs. Such redundant CRE architectures complicate the characterization of GRN evolution, as they compound the effort to characterize each locus, and raise the questions of how and whether genes with redundant architectures evolve expression. Here, we used the evolution of sexually dimorphic abdomen pigmentation of Drosophila ( D. ) melanogaster as a model to study the function and evolution of CREs. Numerous sequences were evaluated that were previously predicted as potential abdomen CREs. Most of these predictions were validated, including two, four, and ten that, respectively, reside in the homothorax , grainy head , and Eip74EF transcription factor loci. The homothorax CREs were found to be partially redundant for this gene's pigmentation function, and pupal-stage Homothorax expression and the CRE activities were conserved among Drosophila species with the derived dimorphic and ancestral monomorphic phenotypes. Similarly, the Eip74EF CREs were conserved in the monomorphic D. willistoni . Thus, this gene's extensive CRE spatiotemporal redundancy has been conserved for over 30 million years, predating the dimorphic trait. Pigmentation evolution has been connected elsewhere to changes in nonredundant CREs. When these traits evolve, GRN changes may be biased towards the genes with singular nonredundant CREs, while the expression of redundantly regulated genes remains conserved.

Abstract:
A comprehensive characterization of regulatory elements in the chicken genome across tissues will have substantial impacts on both fundamental and applied research. Here, we systematically identified and characterized regulatory elements in the chicken genome by integrating 377 genome-wide sequencing datasets from 23 adult tissues. In total, we annotated 1.57 million regulatory elements, representing 15 distinct chromatin states, and predicted about 1.2 million enhancer-gene pairs and 7662 super-enhancers. This functional annotation of the chicken genome should have wide utility on identifying regulatory elements accounting for gene regulation underlying domestication, selection, and complex trait regulation, which we explored. In short, this comprehensive atlas of regulatory elements provides the scientific community with a valuable resource for chicken genetics and genomics.

Abstract:
Newts have large genomes harboring many repeat elements. How these elements shape the genome and relate to newts’ unique regeneration ability remains unknown. We present here the chromosome-scale assembly of the 20.3 Gb genome of the Iberian ribbed newt, Pleurodeles waltl , with a hitherto unprecedented contiguity and completeness among giant genomes. Utilizing this assembly, we demonstrate conserved synteny as well as genetic rearrangements, such as in the major histocompatibility complex locus. We provide evidence suggesting that intronic repeat elements drive newt-specific circular RNA (circRNA) biogenesis and show their regeneration-specific expression. We also present a comprehensive in-depth annotation and chromosomal mapping of microRNAs, highlighting genomic expansion profiles as well as a distinct regulatory pattern in the regenerating limb. These data reveal links between repeat elements, non-coding RNAs, and adult regeneration and provide key resources for addressing developmental, regenerative, and evolutionary principles.

Abstract:
To broaden our understanding of the evolution of gene regulation mechanisms, we generated occupancy profiles for 34 orthologous transcription factors (TFs) in human–mouse erythroid progenitor, lymphoblast and embryonic stem-cell lines. By combining the genome-wide transcription factor occupancy repertoires, associated epigenetic signals, and co-association patterns, here we deduce several evolutionary principles of gene regulatory features operating since the mouse and human lineages diverged. The genomic distribution profiles, primary binding motifs, chromatin states, and DNA methylation preferences are well conserved for TF-occupied sequences. However, the extent to which orthologous DNA segments are bound by orthologous TFs varies both among TFs and with genomic location: binding at promoters is more highly conserved than binding at distal elements. Notably, occupancy-conserved TF-occupied sequences tend to be pleiotropic; they function in several tissues and also co-associate with many TFs. Single nucleotide variants at sites with potential regulatory functions are enriched in occupancy-conserved TF-occupied sequences.

Title: Comparative genomics of Chlamydomonas
Authors: Rory J Craig, Ahmed R Hasan, Rob W Ness, Peter D Keightley
Date: 2021-04

Abstract:
Despite its role as a reference organism in the plant sciences, the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii entirely lacks genomic resources from closely related species. We present highly contiguous and well-annotated genome assemblies for three unicellular C. reinhardtii relatives: Chlamydomonas incerta , Chlamydomonas schloesseri , and the more distantly related Edaphochlamys debaryana . The three Chlamydomonas genomes are highly syntenous with similar gene contents, although the 129.2 Mb C. incerta and 130.2 Mb C. schloesseri assemblies are more repeat-rich than the 111.1 Mb C. reinhardtii genome. We identify the major centromeric repeat in C. reinhardtii as a LINE transposable element homologous to Zepp (the centromeric repeat in Coccomyxa subellipsoidea ) and infer that centromere locations and structure are likely conserved in C. incerta and C. schloesseri . We report extensive rearrangements, but limited gene turnover, between the minus mating type loci of these Chlamydomonas species. We produce an eight-species core- Reinhardtinia whole-genome alignment, which we use to identify several hundred false positive and missing genes in the C. reinhardtii annotation and >260,000 evolutionarily conserved elements in the C. reinhardtii genome. In summary, these resources will enable comparative genomics analyses for C. reinhardtii , significantly extending the analytical toolkit for this emerging model system.

Date: 2023-10-16

Abstract:
The evolution of genomic regulatory regions plays a critical role in shaping the diversity of life. While this process is primarily sequence-dependent, the enormous complexity of biological systems complicates the understanding of the factors underlying regulation and its evolution. Here, we apply deep neural networks as a tool to investigate the sequence determinants underlying chromatin accessibility in different species and tissues of Drosophila . We train hybrid convolution-attention neural networks to accurately predict ATAC-seq peaks using only local DNA sequences as input. We show that our models generalize well across substantially evolutionarily diverged species of insects, implying that the sequence determinants of accessibility are highly conserved. Using our model to examine species-specific gains in accessibility, we find evidence suggesting that these regions may be ancestrally poised for evolution. Using in silico mutagenesis, we show that accessibility can be accurately predicted from short subsequences in each example. However, in silico knock-out of these sequences does not qualitatively impair classification, implying that accessibility is mutationally robust. Subsequently, we show that accessibility is predicted to be robust to large-scale random mutation even in the absence of selection. Conversely, simulations under strong selection demonstrate that accessibility can be extremely malleable despite its robustness. Finally, we identify motifs predictive of accessibility, recovering both novel and previously known motifs. These results demonstrate the conservation of the sequence determinants of accessibility and the general robustness of chromatin accessibility, as well as the power of deep neural networks to explore fundamental questions in regulatory genomics and evolution.

Title: Computational methods to detect conserved non-genic elements in phylogenetically isolated genomes: application to zebrafish
Authors: Michael Hiller, Saatvik Agarwal, James H. Notwell, Ravi Parikh, Harendra Guturu, Aaron M. Wenger, Gill Bejerano
Date: 2013-08

Abstract:
Many important model organisms for biomedical and evolutionary research have sequenced genomes, but occupy a phylogenetically isolated position, evolutionarily distant from other sequenced genomes. This phylogenetic isolation is exemplified for zebrafish, a vertebrate model for cis -regulation, development and human disease, whose evolutionary distance to all other currently sequenced fish exceeds the distance between human and chicken. Such large distances make it difficult to align genomes and use them for comparative analysis beyond gene-focused questions. In particular, detecting conserved non-genic elements (CNEs) as promising cis -regulatory elements with biological importance is challenging. Here, we develop a general comparative genomics framework to align isolated genomes and to comprehensively detect CNEs. Our approach integrates highly sensitive and quality-controlled local alignments and uses alignment transitivity and ancestral reconstruction to bridge large evolutionary distances. We apply our framework to zebrafish and demonstrate substantially improved CNE detection and quality compared with previous sets. Our zebrafish CNE set comprises 54 533 CNEs, of which 11 792 (22%) are conserved to human or mouse. Our zebrafish CNEs ( http://zebrafish.stanford.edu ) are highly enriched in known enhancers and extend existing experimental (ChIP-Seq) sets. The same framework can now be applied to the isolated genomes of frog, amphioxus, Caenorhabditis elegans and many others.

Title: Revealing Posttranscriptional Regulatory Elements Through Network-Level Conservation
Authors: Chang S Chan, Olivier Elemento, Saeed Tavazoie
Date: 2005-12

Abstract:
We used network-level conservation between pairs of fly (Drosophila melanogaster/D. pseudoobscura) and worm (Caenorhabditis elegans/C. briggsae) genomes to detect highly conserved mRNA motifs in 3′ untranslated regions. Many of these elements are complementary to the 5′ extremity of known microRNAs (miRNAs), and likely correspond to their target sites. We also identify known targets of RNA-binding proteins, and many novel sites not yet known to be functional. Coherent sets of genes with similar function often bear the same conserved elements, providing new insights into their cellular functions. We also show that target sites for distinct miRNAs are often simultaneously conserved, suggesting combinatorial regulation by multiple miRNAs. A genome-wide search for conserved stem-loops, containing complementary sequences to the novel sites, revealed many new candidate miRNAs that likely target them. We also provide evidence that posttranscriptional networks have undergone extensive rewiring across distant phyla, despite strong conservation of regulatory elements themselves.

Abstract:
Genomics encompasses the entire tree of life, both extinct and extant, and the evolutionary processes that shape this diversity. To date, genomic research has focused on humans, a small number of agricultural species, and established laboratory models. Fewer than 18,000 of ∼2,000,000 eukaryotic species (<1%) have a representative genome sequence in GenBank, and only a fraction of these have ancillary information on genome structure, genetic variation, gene expression, epigenetic modifications, and population diversity. This imbalance reflects a perception that human studies are paramount in disease research. Yet understanding how genomes work, and how genetic variation shapes phenotypes, requires a broad view that embraces the vast diversity of life. We have the technology to collect massive and exquisitely detailed datasets about the world, but expertise is siloed into distinct fields. A new approach, integrating comparative genomics with cell and evolutionary biology, ecology, archaeology, anthropology, and conservation biology, is essential for understanding and protecting ourselves and our world. Here, we describe potential for scientific discovery when comparative genomics works in close collaboration with a broad range of fields as well as the technical, scientific, and social constraints that must be addressed.

Abstract:
The functional annotation of livestock genomes is crucial for understanding the molecular mechanisms that underpin complex traits of economic importance, adaptive evolution and comparative genomics. Here, we provide the most comprehensive catalogue to date of regulatory elements in the pig ( Sus scrofa ) by integrating 223 epigenomic and transcriptomic data sets, representing 14 biologically important tissues. We systematically describe the dynamic epigenetic landscape across tissues by functionally annotating 15 different chromatin states and defining their tissue-specific regulatory activities. We demonstrate that genomic variants associated with complex traits and adaptive evolution in pig are significantly enriched in active promoters and enhancers. Furthermore, we reveal distinct tissue-specific regulatory selection between Asian and European pig domestication processes. Compared with human and mouse epigenomes, we show that porcine regulatory elements are more conserved in DNA sequence, under both rapid and slow evolution, than those under neutral evolution across pig, mouse, and human. Finally, we provide biological insights on tissue-specific regulatory conservation, and by integrating 47 human genome-wide association studies, we demonstrate that, depending on the traits, mouse or pig might be more appropriate biomedical models for different complex traits and diseases.

Abstract:
Phenotypic variation among species is a product of evolutionary changes to developmental programs 1 , 2 . However, how these changes generate novel morphological traits remains largely unclear. Here we studied the genomic and developmental basis of the mammalian gliding membrane, or patagium—an adaptative trait that has repeatedly evolved in different lineages, including in closely related marsupial species. Through comparative genomic analysis of 15 marsupial genomes, both from gliding and non-gliding species, we find that the Emx2 locus experienced lineage-specific patterns of accelerated cis -regulatory evolution in gliding species. By combining epigenomics, transcriptomics and in-pouch marsupial transgenics, we show that Emx2 is a critical upstream regulator of patagium development. Moreover, we identify different cis -regulatory elements that may be responsible for driving increased Emx2 expression levels in gliding species. Lastly, using mouse functional experiments, we find evidence that Emx2 expression patterns in gliders may have been modified from a pre-existing program found in all mammals. Together, our results suggest that patagia repeatedly originated through a process of convergent genomic evolution, whereby regulation of Emx2 was altered by distinct cis -regulatory elements in independently evolved species. Thus, different regulatory elements targeting the same key developmental gene may constitute an effective strategy by which natural selection has harnessed regulatory evolution in marsupial genomes to generate phenotypic novelty.

Title: MotifMap: integrative genome-wide maps of regulatory motif sites for model species
Authors: Kenneth Daily, Vishal R Patel, Paul Rigor, Xiaohui Xie, Pierre Baldi
Date: 2011

Abstract:
A central challenge of biology is to map and understand gene regulation on a genome-wide scale. For any given genome, only a small fraction of the regulatory elements embedded in the DNA sequence have been characterized, and there is great interest in developing computational methods to systematically map all these elements and understand their relationships. Such computational efforts, however, are significantly hindered by the overwhelming size of non-coding regions and the statistical variability and complex spatial organizations of regulatory elements and interactions. Genome-wide catalogs of regulatory elements for all model species simply do not yet exist. The MotifMap system uses databases of transcription factor binding motifs, refined genome alignments, and a comparative genomic statistical approach to provide comprehensive maps of candidate regulatory elements encoded in the genomes of model species. The system is used to derive new genome-wide maps for yeast, fly, worm, mouse, and human. The human map contains 519,108 sites for 570 matrices with a False Discovery Rate of 0.1 or less. The new maps are assessed in several ways, for instance using high-throughput experimental ChIP-seq data and AUC statistics, providing strong evidence for their accuracy and coverage. The maps can be usefully integrated with many other kinds of omic data and are available at http://motifmap.igb.uci.edu/ . MotifMap and its integration with other data provide a foundation for analyzing gene regulation on a genome-wide scale, and for automatically generating regulatory pathways and hypotheses. The power of this approach is demonstrated and discussed using the P53 apoptotic pathway and the Gli hedgehog pathways as examples.

Title: The Rice Genome Knowledgebase (RGKbase): an annotation database for rice comparative genomics and evolutionary biology
Authors: Dapeng Wang, Yan Xia, Xinna Li, Lixia Hou, Jun Yu
Date: 2013-01

Abstract:
Over the past 10 years, genomes of cultivated rice cultivars and their wild counterparts have been sequenced although most efforts are focused on genome assembly and annotation of two major cultivated rice ( Oryza sativa L.) subspecies, 93-11 ( indica ) and Nipponbare ( japonica ). To integrate information from genome assemblies and annotations for better analysis and application, we now introduce a comparative rice genome database, the Rice Genome Knowledgebase (RGKbase, http://rgkbase.big.ac.cn/RGKbase/ ). RGKbase is built to have three major components: (i) integrated data curation for rice genomics and molecular biology, which includes genome sequence assemblies, transcriptomic and epigenomic data, genetic variations, quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and the relevant literature; (ii) User-friendly viewers, such as Gbrowse, GeneBrowse and Circos, for genome annotations and evolutionary dynamics and (iii) Bioinformatic tools for compositional and synteny analyses, gene family classifications, gene ontology terms and pathways and gene co-expression networks. RGKbase current includes data from five rice cultivars and species: Nipponbare ( japonica ), 93-11 ( indica ), PA64s ( indica ), the African rice ( Oryza glaberrima ) and a wild rice species ( Oryza brachyantha ). We are also constantly introducing new datasets from variety of public efforts, such as two recent releases—sequence data from ∼1000 rice varieties, which are mapped into the reference genome, yielding ample high-quality single-nucleotide polymorphisms and insertions–deletions.

Abstract:
Whole-genome sequencing projects are increasingly populating the tree of life and characterizing biodiversity 1 – 4 . Sparse taxon sampling has previously been proposed to confound phylogenetic inference 5 , and captures only a fraction of the genomic diversity. Here we report a substantial step towards the dense representation of avian phylogenetic and molecular diversity, by analysing 363 genomes from 92.4% of bird families—including 267 newly sequenced genomes produced for phase II of the Bird 10,000 Genomes (B10K) Project. We use this comparative genome dataset in combination with a pipeline that leverages a reference-free whole-genome alignment to identify orthologous regions in greater numbers than has previously been possible and to recognize genomic novelties in particular bird lineages. The densely sampled alignment provides a single-base-pair map of selection, has more than doubled the fraction of bases that are confidently predicted to be under conservation and reveals extensive patterns of weak selection in predominantly non-coding DNA. Our results demonstrate that increasing the diversity of genomes used in comparative studies can reveal more shared and lineage-specific variation, and improve the investigation of genomic characteristics. We anticipate that this genomic resource will offer new perspectives on evolutionary processes in cross-species comparative analyses and assist in efforts to conserve species.

Date: 2010

Abstract:
Giardia intestinalis is a protozoan parasite that causes diarrhea in a wide range of mammalian species. To further understand the genetic diversity between the Giardia intestinalis species, we have performed genome sequencing and analysis of a wild-type Giardia intestinalis sample from the assemblage E group, isolated from a pig. We identified 5012 protein coding genes, the majority of which are conserved compared to the previously sequenced genomes of the WB and GS strains in terms of microsynteny and sequence identity. Despite this, there is an unexpectedly large number of chromosomal rearrangements and several smaller structural changes that are present in all chromosomes. Novel members of the VSP, NEK Kinase and HCMP gene families were identified, which may reveal possible mechanisms for host specificity and new avenues for antigenic variation. We used comparative genomics of the three diverse Giardia intestinalis isolates P15, GS and WB to define a core proteome for this species complex and to identify lineage-specific genes. Extensive analyses of polymorphisms in the core proteome of Giardia revealed differential rates of divergence among cellular processes. Our results indicate that despite a well conserved core of genes there is significant genome variation between Giardia isolates, both in terms of gene content, gene polymorphisms, structural chromosomal variations and surface molecule repertoires. This study improves the annotation of the Giardia genomes and enables the identification of functionally important variation.

Abstract:
Genome-wide transcription start site (TSS) profiles of the enterobacteria Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were experimentally determined through modified 5′ RACE followed by deep sequencing of intact primary mRNA. This identified 3,746 and 3,143 TSSs for E. coli and K. pneumoniae , respectively. Experimentally determined TSSs were then used to define promoter regions and 5′ UTRs upstream of coding genes. Comparative analysis of these regulatory elements revealed the use of multiple TSSs, identical sequence motifs of promoter and Shine-Dalgarno sequence, reflecting conserved gene expression apparatuses between the two species. In both species, over 70% of primary transcripts were expressed from operons having orthologous genes during exponential growth. However, expressed orthologous genes in E. coli and K. pneumoniae showed a strikingly different organization of upstream regulatory regions with only 20% identical promoters with TSSs in both species. Over 40% of promoters had TSSs identified in only one species, despite conserved promoter sequences existing in the other species. 662 conserved promoters having TSSs in both species resulted in the same number of comparable 5′ UTR pairs, and that regulatory element was found to be the most variant region in sequence among promoter, 5′ UTR, and ORF. In K. pneumoniae , 48 sRNAs were predicted and 36 of them were expressed during exponential growth. Among them, 34 orthologous sRNAs between two species were analyzed in depth, and the analysis showed that many sRNAs of K. pneumoniae , including pleiotropic sRNAs such as rprA , arcZ, and sgrS , may work in the same way as in E. coli . These results reveal a new dimension of comparative genomics such that a comparison of two genomes needs to be comprehensive over all levels of genome organization.

Abstract:
The planarian Schmidtea mediterranea is being studied as a model species for regeneration, but the assembly of planarian genomes remains challenging. Here, we report a high-quality haplotype-phased, chromosome-scale genome assembly of the sexual S2 strain of S. mediterranea and high-quality chromosome-scale assemblies of its three close relatives, S. polychroa , S. nova , and S. lugubris . Using hybrid gene annotations and optimized ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq protocols for regulatory element annotation, we provide valuable genome resources for the planarian research community and a first comparative perspective on planarian genome evolution. Our analyses reveal substantial divergence in protein-coding sequences and regulatory regions but considerable conservation within promoter and enhancer annotations. We also find frequent retrotransposon-associated chromosomal inversions and interchromosomal translocations within the genus Schmidtea and, remarkably, independent and nearly complete losses of ancestral metazoan synteny in Schmidtea and two other flatworm groups. Overall, our results suggest that platyhelminth genomes can evolve without syntenic constraints.

Abstract:
Efforts to characterize regulatory elements in plant genomes traditionally rely on evolutionary conservation and chromatin accessibility. Recently, intergenic bi-directional nascent transcript has emerged as a putative hallmark of active enhancers. Here, we integrate these approaches to better define the cis -regulatory landscape of the rice genome. In juvenile leaf tissues of the Azucena rice variety, we analyze conserved noncoding sequences, intergenic bi-directional transcripts, and regions of open chromatin. These three features highlight distinct classes of regulatory targets, each exhibiting complexity and regulatory roles. Conserved noncoding sequences are associated with more complex regulatory interactions, while regions marked by chromatin accessibility or bi-directional nascent transcription tend to promote more stable regulatory activity. Some transcribed regulatory sites harbor elements linked to transposable element silencing, whereas others correlate with increased expression of nearby genes, pointing to candidate transcribed regulatory elements. We further identified molecular interactions between genic regions and intergenic transcribed regulatory elements using 3-dimensional chromatin contact data, we identify physical interactions between transcribed intergenic regions and genic regions. These interactions often co-localize with expression quantitative trait loci and coincide with increased transcription, further supporting a regulatory role. Our integrative analysis reveals multiple distinct classes of regulatory elements in the rice genome, with overlapping but non-identical targets and signatures. Many candidate elements share features consistent with transcriptional enhancement, though the specific criteria for defining active enhancers in plants require further characterization. These findings underscore the importance of using complementary genomic signals to discover and characterize functionally diverse regulatory elements in plant genomes.

Abstract:
We report a chromosomal-level genome assembly of a male North American wolverine ( Gulo gulo luscus ) from the Kugluktuk region of Nunavut, Canada. The genome was assembled directly from long-reads, comprising: 758 contigs with a contig N50 of 36.6 Mb; contig L50 of 20; base count of 2.39 Gb; and a near complete representation (99.98%) of the BUSCO 5.2.2 set of 9,226 genes. A presumptive chromosomal-level assembly was generated by scaffolding against two chromosomal-level Mustelidae reference genomes, the ermine and the Eurasian river otter, to derive a final scaffold N50 of 144.0 Mb and a scaffold L50 of 7. We annotated a comprehensive set of genes that have been associated with models of aggressive behavior, a trait which the wolverine is purported to have in the popular literature. To support an integrated, genomics-based wildlife management strategy at a time of environmental disruption from climate change, we annotated the principal genes of the innate immune system to provide a resource to study the wolverine’s susceptibility to new infectious and parasitic diseases. As a resource, we annotated genes involved in the modality of infection by the coronaviruses, an important class of viral pathogens of growing concern as shown by the recent spillover infections by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 to naïve wildlife. Tabulation of heterozygous single nucleotide variants in our specimen revealed a heterozygosity level of 0.065%, indicating a relatively diverse genetic pool that would serve as a baseline for the genomics-based conservation of the wolverine, a rare cold-adapted carnivore now under threat.

Title: Profiling conserved transcription factor binding motifs in Phaseolus vulgaris through comparative genomics
Authors: Liudmyla Kondratova, C. Eduardo Vallejos, Ana Conesa
Date: 2025-02-20

Abstract:
Common bean ( Phaseolus vulgaris ), a staple food in Latin America and Africa, serves as a vital source of energy, protein, and essential minerals for millions of people. However, genomics knowledge that breeders could leverage for improvement of this crop is scarce. We have developed and validated a comparative genomics approach to predict conserved transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) in common bean and studied gene regulatory networks. We analyzed promoter regions and identified TFBS for 12,631 bean genes with an average of 6 conserved motifs per gene. Moreover, we discovered a statistically significant relationship between the number of conserved motifs and amount of available experimental evidence of gene regulation. Notably, ERF, MYB, and bHLH transcription factor families dominated conserved motifs, with implications for starch biosynthesis regulation. Furthermore, we provide gene regulatory data as a resource that can be interrogated for the regulatory landscape of any set of genes. Our results underscore the significance of TFBS conservation in legumes and aligns with the notion that core genes often exhibit a more conserved regulatory makeup. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of a comparative genomics approach for addressing genome information gaps in non-model organisms and provides valuable insights into the regulatory networks governing starch biosynthesis genes that can support crop improvement programs.

Title: Comparative genomic analysis of upstream miRNA regulatory motifs in Caenorhabditis

Date: 2016-07

Abstract:
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) comprise a class of short noncoding RNA molecules that play diverse developmental and physiological roles by controlling mRNA abundance and protein output of the vast majority of transcripts. Despite the importance of miRNAs in regulating gene function, we still lack a complete understanding of how miRNAs themselves are transcriptionally regulated. To fill this gap, we predicted regulatory sequences by searching for abundant short motifs located upstream of miRNAs in eight species of Caenorhabditis nematodes. We identified three conserved motifs across the Caenorhabditis phylogeny that show clear signatures of purifying selection from comparative genomics, patterns of nucleotide changes in motifs of orthologous miRNAs, and correlation between motif incidence and miRNA expression. We then validated our predictions with transgenic green fluorescent protein reporters and site-directed mutagenesis for a subset of motifs located in an enhancer region upstream of let-7 . We demonstrate that a CT-dinucleotide motif is sufficient for proper expression of GFP in the seam cells of adult C. elegans , and that two other motifs play incremental roles in combination with the CT-rich motif. Thus, functional tests of sequence motifs identified through analysis of molecular evolutionary signatures provide a powerful path for efficiently characterizing the transcriptional regulation of miRNA genes.

Abstract:
We describe the genome of the western painted turtle, Chrysemys picta bellii , one of the most widespread, abundant, and well-studied turtles. We place the genome into a comparative evolutionary context, and focus on genomic features associated with tooth loss, immune function, longevity, sex differentiation and determination, and the species' physiological capacities to withstand extreme anoxia and tissue freezing. Our phylogenetic analyses confirm that turtles are the sister group to living archosaurs, and demonstrate an extraordinarily slow rate of sequence evolution in the painted turtle. The ability of the painted turtle to withstand complete anoxia and partial freezing appears to be associated with common vertebrate gene networks, and we identify candidate genes for future functional analyses. Tooth loss shares a common pattern of pseudogenization and degradation of tooth-specific genes with birds, although the rate of accumulation of mutations is much slower in the painted turtle. Genes associated with sex differentiation generally reflect phylogeny rather than convergence in sex determination functionality. Among gene families that demonstrate exceptional expansions or show signatures of strong natural selection, immune function and musculoskeletal patterning genes are consistently over-represented. Our comparative genomic analyses indicate that common vertebrate regulatory networks, some of which have analogs in human diseases, are often involved in the western painted turtle's extraordinary physiological capacities. As these regulatory pathways are analyzed at the functional level, the painted turtle may offer important insights into the management of a number of human health disorders.

Title: Polymorphic toxin systems: Comprehensive characterization of trafficking modes, processing, mechanisms of action, immunity and ecology using comparative genomics
Authors: Dapeng Zhang, Robson F de Souza, Vivek Anantharaman, Lakshminarayan M Iyer, L Aravind
Date: 2012

Abstract:
Proteinaceous toxins are observed across all levels of inter-organismal and intra-genomic conflicts. These include recently discovered prokaryotic polymorphic toxin systems implicated in intra-specific conflicts. They are characterized by a remarkable diversity of C-terminal toxin domains generated by recombination with standalone toxin-coding cassettes. Prior analysis revealed a striking diversity of nuclease and deaminase domains among the toxin modules. We systematically investigated polymorphic toxin systems using comparative genomics, sequence and structure analysis. Polymorphic toxin systems are distributed across all major bacterial lineages and are delivered by at least eight distinct secretory systems. In addition to type-II, these include type-V, VI, VII (ESX), and the poorly characterized “ Photorhabdus virulence cassettes (PVC)”, PrsW-dependent and MuF phage-capsid-like systems. We present evidence that trafficking of these toxins is often accompanied by autoproteolytic processing catalyzed by HINT, ZU5, PrsW, caspase-like, papain-like, and a novel metallopeptidase associated with the PVC system. We identified over 150 distinct toxin domains in these systems. These span an extraordinary catalytic spectrum to include 23 distinct clades of peptidases, numerous previously unrecognized versions of nucleases and deaminases, ADP-ribosyltransferases, ADP ribosyl cyclases, RelA/SpoT-like nucleotidyltransferases, glycosyltranferases and other enzymes predicted to modify lipids and carbohydrates, and a pore-forming toxin domain. Several of these toxin domains are shared with host-directed effectors of pathogenic bacteria. Over 90 families of immunity proteins might neutralize anywhere between a single to at least 27 distinct types of toxin domains. In some organisms multiple tandem immunity genes or immunity protein domains are organized into polyimmunity loci or polyimmunity proteins. Gene-neighborhood-analysis of polymorphic toxin systems predicts the presence of novel trafficking-related components, and also the organizational logic that allows toxin diversification through recombination. Domain architecture and protein-length analysis revealed that these toxins might be deployed as secreted factors, through directed injection, or via inter-cellular contact facilitated by filamentous structures formed by RHS/YD, filamentous hemagglutinin and other repeats. Phyletic pattern and life-style analysis indicate that polymorphic toxins and polyimmunity loci participate in cooperative behavior and facultative ‘cheating’ in several ecosystems such as the human oral cavity and soil. Multiple domains from these systems have also been repeatedly transferred to eukaryotes and their viruses, such as the nucleo-cytoplasmic large DNA viruses. Along with a comprehensive inventory of toxins and immunity proteins, we present several testable predictions regarding active sites and catalytic mechanisms of toxins, their processing and trafficking and their role in intra-specific and inter-specific interactions between bacteria. These systems provide insights regarding the emergence of key systems at different points in eukaryotic evolution, such as ADP ribosylation, interaction of myosin VI with cargo proteins, mediation of apoptosis, hyphal heteroincompatibility, hedgehog signaling, arthropod toxins, cell-cell interaction molecules like teneurins and different signaling messengers.

Abstract:
Doublesex and mab-3-related transcription factor ( dmrt ) genes are widely distributed across various biological groups and play critical roles in sex determination and neural development. Here, we applied bioinformatics methods to exam cross-species changes in the dmrt family members and evolutionary relationships of the dmrt genes based on genomes of 17 fish species. All the examined fish species have dmrt1–5 while only five species contained dmrt6. Most fish harbored two dmrt2 paralogs ( dmrt2a and dmrt2b ), with dmrt2b being unique to fish. In the phylogenetic tree, 147 DMRT are categorized into eight groups (DMRT1–DMRT8) and then clustered in three main groups. Selective evolutionary pressure analysis indicated purifying selections on dmrt1–3 genes and the dmrt1–3–2(2a) gene cluster. Similar genomic conservation patterns of the dmrt1–dmrt3–dmrt2(2a) gene cluster with 20-kb upstream/downstream regions in fish with various sex-determination systems were observed except for three regions with remarkable diversity. Synteny analysis revealed that dmrt1, dmrt2a, dmrt2b , and dmrt3–5 were relatively conserved in fish during the evolutionary process. While dmrt6 was lost in most species during evolution. The high conservation of the dmrt1–dmrt3–dmrt2(2a) gene cluster in various fish genomes suggests their crucial biological functions while various dmrt family members and sequences across fish species suggest different biological roles during evolution. This study provides a molecular basis for fish dmrt functional analysis and may serve as a reference for in-depth phylogenomics.

Abstract:
Vertebrates have greatly elaborated the basic chordate body plan and evolved highly distinctive genomes that have been sculpted by two whole-genome duplications. Here we sequence the genome of the Mediterranean amphioxus ( Branchiostoma lanceolatum ) and characterize DNA methylation, chromatin accessibility, histone modifications and transcriptomes across multiple developmental stages and adult tissues to investigate the evolution of the regulation of the chordate genome. Comparisons with vertebrates identify an intermediate stage in the evolution of differentially methylated enhancers, and a high conservation of gene expression and its cis -regulatory logic between amphioxus and vertebrates that occurs maximally at an earlier mid-embryonic phylotypic period. We analyse regulatory evolution after whole-genome duplications, and find that—in vertebrates—over 80% of broadly expressed gene families with multiple paralogues derived from whole-genome duplications have members that restricted their ancestral expression, and underwent specialization rather than subfunctionalization. Counter-intuitively, paralogues that restricted their expression increased the complexity of their regulatory landscapes. These data pave the way for a better understanding of the regulatory principles that underlie key vertebrate innovations.

Title: Paircomp, FamilyRelationsII and Cartwheel: tools for interspecific sequence comparison
Authors: C Titus Brown, Yuan Xie, Eric H Davidson, R Andrew Cameron
Date: 2005

Abstract:
Comparative sequence analysis is an effective and increasingly common way to identify cis -regulatory regions in animal genomes. We describe three tools for comparative analysis of pairs of BAC-sized genomic regions. Paircomp is a tool that does windowed (ungapped) comparisons of two sequences and reports all matches above a set threshold. FamilyRelationsII is a graphical viewer for comparisons that enables interactive exploration of several different kinds of comparisons. Cartwheel is a Web site and compute-cluster management system used to execute and store comparisons for display by FamilyRelationsII. These tools are specialized for the discovery of cis -regulatory regions in animal genomes. All tools and their source code are freely available at . These tools have been shown to effectively identify regulatory regions in echinoderms, mammals, and nematodes.

Title: The Evolution of Bony Vertebrate Enhancers at Odds with Their Coding Sequence Landscape
Authors: Aisha Yousaf, Muhammad Sohail Raza, Amir Ali Abbasi
Date: 2015-08

Abstract:
Enhancers lie at the heart of transcriptional and developmental gene regulation. Therefore, changes in enhancer sequences usually disrupt the target gene expression and result in disease phenotypes. Despite the well-established role of enhancers in development and disease, evolutionary sequence studies are lacking. The current study attempts to unravel the puzzle of bony vertebrates’ conserved noncoding elements (CNE) enhancer evolution. Bayesian phylogenetics of enhancer sequences spotlights promising interordinal relationships among placental mammals, proposing a closer relationship between humans and laurasiatherians while placing rodents at the basal position. Clock-based estimates of enhancer evolution provided a dynamic picture of interspecific rate changes across the bony vertebrate lineage. Moreover, coelacanth in the study augmented our appreciation of the vertebrate cis -regulatory evolution during water–land transition. Intriguingly, we observed a pronounced upsurge in enhancer evolution in land-dwelling vertebrates. These novel findings triggered us to further investigate the evolutionary trend of coding as well as CNE nonenhancer repertoires, to highlight the relative evolutionary dynamics of diverse genomic landscapes. Surprisingly, the evolutionary rates of enhancer sequences were clearly at odds with those of the coding and the CNE nonenhancer sequences during vertebrate adaptation to land, with land vertebrates exhibiting significantly reduced rates of coding sequence evolution in comparison to their fast evolving regulatory landscape. The observed variation in tetrapod cis -regulatory elements caused the fine-tuning of associated gene regulatory networks. Therefore, the increased evolutionary rate of tetrapods’ enhancer sequences might be responsible for the variation in developmental regulatory circuits during the process of vertebrate adaptation to land.

Abstract:
The available web-based genome data and related resources provide great opportunities for biomedical scientists to identify functional elements in a particular genome region or to explore the evolutionary pattern of genome dynamics. Comparative genomics is an indispensable tool for achieving these goals. Because of the broad scope of comparative genomics, it is difficult to address all of its aspects in short survey. A few currently 'hot' topics have therefore been selected and a brief review of the availability of web-based databases software is given.

Title: Genomics of bacteria and archaea: the emerging dynamic view of the prokaryotic world
Authors: Eugene V. Koonin, Yuri I. Wolf
Date: 2008-12

Abstract:
The first bacterial genome was sequenced in 1995, and the first archaeal genome in 1996. Soon after these breakthroughs, an exponential rate of genome sequencing was established, with a doubling time of approximately 20 months for bacteria and approximately 34 months for archaea. Comparative analysis of the hundreds of sequenced bacterial and dozens of archaeal genomes leads to several generalizations on the principles of genome organization and evolution. A crucial finding that enables functional characterization of the sequenced genomes and evolutionary reconstruction is that the majority of archaeal and bacterial genes have conserved orthologs in other, often, distant organisms. However, comparative genomics also shows that horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is a dominant force of prokaryotic evolution, along with the loss of genetic material resulting in genome contraction. A crucial component of the prokaryotic world is the mobilome, the enormous collection of viruses, plasmids and other selfish elements, which are in constant exchange with more stable chromosomes and serve as HGT vehicles. Thus, the prokaryotic genome space is a tightly connected, although compartmentalized, network, a novel notion that undermines the ‘Tree of Life’ model of evolution and requires a new conceptual framework and tools for the study of prokaryotic evolution.

Abstract:
Surviving challenging environments, living long lives, and engaging in complex cognitive processes are hallmark human characteristics. Similar traits have evolved in parallel in capuchin monkeys, but their genetic underpinnings remain unexplored. We developed and annotated a reference assembly for white-faced capuchin monkeys to explore the evolution of these phenotypes. By comparing populations of capuchins inhabiting rainforest versus dry forests with seasonal droughts, we detected selection in genes associated with kidney function, muscular wasting, and metabolism, suggesting adaptation to periodic resource scarcity. When comparing capuchins to other mammals, we identified evidence of selection in multiple genes implicated in longevity and brain development. Our research was facilitated by our method to generate high- and low-coverage genomes from noninvasive biomaterials.

Title: Discovery and validation of novel and distinct RNA regulators for ribosomal protein S15 in diverse bacterial phyla
Authors: Betty L Slinger, Kaila Deiorio-Haggar, Jon S Anthony, Molly M Gilligan, Michelle M Meyer
Date: 2014-08-07

Abstract:
Autogenous cis -regulators of ribosomal protein synthesis play a critical role in maintaining the stoichiometry of ribosome components. Structured portions within an mRNA transcript typically interact with specific ribosomal proteins to prevent expression of the entire operon, thus balancing levels of ribosomal proteins across transcriptional units. Three distinct RNA structures from different bacterial phyla have demonstrated interactions with S15 to regulate gene expression; however, these RNAs are distributed across a small fraction of bacterial diversity. We used comparative genomics in combination with analysis of existing transcriptomic data to identify three novel putative RNA structures associated with the S15 coding region in microbial genomes. These structures are completely distinct from those previously published and encompass potential regulatory regions including ribosome-binding sites. To validate the biological relevance of our findings, we demonstrate that an example of the Alphaproteobacterial RNA from Rhizobium radiobacter specifically interacts with S15 in vitro , and allows in vivo regulation of gene expression in an E. coli reporter system. In addition, structural probing and nuclease protection assays confirm the predicted secondary structure and indicate nucleotides required for protein interaction. This work illustrates the importance of integrating comparative genomic and transcriptomic approaches during de novo ncRNA identification and reveals a diversity of distinct natural RNA regulators that support analogous biological functions. Furthermore, this work indicates that many additional uncharacterized RNA regulators likely exist within bacterial genomes and that the plasticity of RNA structure allows unique, and likely independently derived, solutions to the same biological problem.

Title: funRNA: a fungi-centered genomics platform for genes encoding key components of RNAi
Authors: Jaeyoung Choi, Ki-Tae Kim, Jongbum Jeon, Jiayao Wu, Hyeunjeong Song, Fred O Asiegbu, Yong-Hwan Lee
Date: 2014

Abstract:
RNA interference (RNAi) is involved in genome defense as well as diverse cellular, developmental, and physiological processes. Key components of RNAi are Argonaute, Dicer, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), which have been functionally characterized mainly in model organisms. The key components are believed to exist throughout eukaryotes; however, there is no systematic platform for archiving and dissecting these important gene families. In addition, few fungi have been studied to date, limiting our understanding of RNAi in fungi. Here we present funRNA http://funrna.riceblast.snu.ac.kr/ , a fungal kingdom-wide comparative genomics platform for putative genes encoding Argonaute, Dicer, and RdRP. To identify and archive genes encoding the abovementioned key components, protein domain profiles were determined from reference sequences obtained from UniProtKB/SwissProt. The domain profiles were searched using fungal, metazoan, and plant genomes, as well as bacterial and archaeal genomes. 1,163, 442, and 678 genes encoding Argonaute, Dicer, and RdRP, respectively, were predicted. Based on the identification results, active site variation of Argonaute, diversification of Dicer, and sequence analysis of RdRP were discussed in a fungus-oriented manner. funRNA provides results from diverse bioinformatics programs and job submission forms for BLAST, BLASTMatrix, and ClustalW. Furthermore, sequence collections created in funRNA are synced with several gene family analysis portals and databases, offering further analysis opportunities. funRNA provides identification results from a broad taxonomic range and diverse analysis functions, and could be used in diverse comparative and evolutionary studies. It could serve as a versatile genomics workbench for key components of RNAi.

Abstract:
The fungal genus Aspergillus is of critical importance to humankind. Species include those with industrial applications, important pathogens of humans, animals and crops, a source of potent carcinogenic contaminants of food, and an important genetic model. The genome sequences of eight aspergilli have already been explored to investigate aspects of fungal biology, raising questions about evolution and specialization within this genus. We have generated genome sequences for ten novel, highly diverse Aspergillus species and compared these in detail to sister and more distant genera. Comparative studies of key aspects of fungal biology, including primary and secondary metabolism, stress response, biomass degradation, and signal transduction, revealed both conservation and diversity among the species. Observed genomic differences were validated with experimental studies. This revealed several highlights, such as the potential for sex in asexual species, organic acid production genes being a key feature of black aspergilli, alternative approaches for degrading plant biomass, and indications for the genetic basis of stress response. A genome-wide phylogenetic analysis demonstrated in detail the relationship of the newly genome sequenced species with other aspergilli. Many aspects of biological differences between fungal species cannot be explained by current knowledge obtained from genome sequences. The comparative genomics and experimental study, presented here, allows for the first time a genus-wide view of the biological diversity of the aspergilli and in many, but not all, cases linked genome differences to phenotype. Insights gained could be exploited for biotechnological and medical applications of fungi.

Abstract:
It has long been hypothesized that changes in gene regulation have played an important role in human evolution, but regulatory DNA has been much more difficult to study compared with protein-coding regions. Recent large-scale studies have created genome-scale catalogs of DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs), which demark potentially functional regulatory DNA. To better define regulatory DNA that has been subject to human-specific adaptive evolution, we performed comprehensive evolutionary and population genetics analyses on over 18 million DHSs discovered in 130 cell types. We identified 524 DHSs that are conserved in nonhuman primates but accelerated in the human lineage (haDHS), and estimate that 70% of substitutions in haDHSs are attributable to positive selection. Through extensive computational and experimental analyses, we demonstrate that haDHSs are often active in brain or neuronal cell types; play an important role in regulating the expression of developmentally important genes, including many transcription factors such as SOX6 , POU3F2 , and HOX genes; and identify striking examples of adaptive regulatory evolution that may have contributed to human-specific phenotypes. More generally, our results reveal new insights into conserved and adaptive regulatory DNA in humans and refine the set of genomic substrates that distinguish humans from their closest living primate relatives.

Abstract:
Cephalochordates, the sister group of vertebrates + tunicates, are evolving particularly slowly. Therefore, genome comparisons between two congeners of Branchiostoma revealed so many conserved noncoding elements (CNEs), that it was not clear how many are functional regulatory elements. To more effectively identify CNEs with potential regulatory functions, we compared noncoding sequences of genomes of the most phylogenetically distant cephalochordate genera, Asymmetron and Branchiostoma , which diverged approximately 120–160 million years ago. We found 113,070 noncoding elements conserved between the two species, amounting to 3.3% of the genome. The genomic distribution, target gene ontology, and enriched motifs of these CNEs all suggest that many of them are probably cis -regulatory elements. More than 90% of previously verified amphioxus regulatory elements were re-captured in this study. A search of the cephalochordate CNEs around 50 developmental genes in several vertebrate genomes revealed eight CNEs conserved between cephalochordates and vertebrates, indicating sequence conservation over >500 million years of divergence. The function of five CNEs was tested in reporter assays in zebrafish, and one was also tested in amphioxus. All five CNEs proved to be tissue-specific enhancers. Taken together, these findings indicate that even though Branchiostoma and Asymmetron are distantly related, as they are evolving slowly, comparisons between them are likely optimal for identifying most of their tissue-specific cis -regulatory elements laying the foundation for functional characterizations and a better understanding of the evolution of developmental regulation in cephalochordates.

Abstract:
Dogs have become a valuable model in exploring multifaceted diseases and biology relevant to human health. Despite large-scale dog genome projects producing high-quality draft references, a comprehensive annotation of functional elements is still lacking. We addressed this through integrative next-generation sequencing of transcriptomes paired with five histone marks and DNA methylome profiling across 11 tissue types, deciphering the dog’s epigenetic code by defining distinct chromatin states, super-enhancer, and methylome landscapes, and thus showed that these regions are associated with a wide range of biological functions and cell/tissue identity. In addition, we confirmed that the phenotype-associated variants are enriched in tissue-specific regulatory regions and, therefore, the tissue of origin of the variants can be traced. Ultimately, we delineated conserved and dynamic epigenomic changes at the tissue- and species-specific resolutions. Our study provides an epigenomic blueprint of the dog that can be used for comparative biology and medical research.

Title: Fungal Genes in Context: Genome Architecture Reflects Regulatory Complexity and Function
Authors: Luke M. Noble, Alex Andrianopoulos
Date: 2013

Abstract:
Gene context determines gene expression, with local chromosomal environment most influential. Comparative genomic analysis is often limited in scope to conserved or divergent gene and protein families, and fungi are well suited to this approach with low functional redundancy and relatively streamlined genomes. We show here that one aspect of gene context, the amount of potential upstream regulatory sequence maintained through evolution, is highly predictive of both molecular function and biological process in diverse fungi. Orthologs with large upstream intergenic regions (UIRs) are strongly enriched in information processing functions, such as signal transduction and sequence-specific DNA binding, and, in the genus Aspergillus , include the majority of experimentally studied, high-level developmental and metabolic transcriptional regulators. Many uncharacterized genes are also present in this class and, by implication, may be of similar importance. Large intergenic regions also share two novel sequence characteristics, currently of unknown significance: they are enriched for plus-strand polypyrimidine tracts and an information-rich, putative regulatory motif that was present in the last common ancestor of the Pezizomycotina. Systematic consideration of gene UIR in comparative genomics, particularly for poorly characterized species, could help reveal organisms’ regulatory priorities.

Title: RGD v2.0: a major update of the ruminant functional and evolutionary genomics database
Authors: Weiwei Fu, Rui Wang, Hojjat Asadollahpour Nanaei, Jinxin Wang, Dexiang Hu, Yu Jiang
Date: 2022-01-07

Abstract:
Ruminant Genome Database (RGD; http://animal.nwsuaf.edu.cn/RGD ) provides visualization and analysis tools for ruminant comparative genomics and functional annotations. As more high-quality ruminant genome assemblies have become available, we have redesigned the user interface, integrated and expanded multi-omics data, and developed novel features to improve the database. The new version, RGD v2.0, houses 78 ruminant genomes; 110-species synteny alignments for major livestock (including cattle, sheep, goat) and wild ungulates; 21 012 orthologous gene clusters with Gene Ontology and pathway annotation; ∼8 600 000 conserved elements; and ∼1 000 000 cis -regulatory elements by utilizing 1053 epigenomic data sets. The transcriptome data in RGD v2.0 has nearly doubled, currently with 1936 RNA-seq data sets, and 155 174 phenotypic data sets have been newly added. New and updated features include: (i) The UCSC Genome Browser, BLAT, BLAST and Table Browser tools were updated for six available ruminant livestock species. (ii) The LiftOver tool was newly introduced into our browser to allow coordinate conversion between different ruminant assemblies. And (iii) tissue specificity index, tau, was calculated to facilitate batch screening of specifically expressed genes. The enhanced genome annotations and improved functionality in RGD v2.0 will be useful for study of genome evolution, environmental adaption, livestock breeding and biomedicine.

Title: De Novo Assembly of the Northern Cardinal ( Cardinalis cardinalis ) Genome Reveals Candidate Regulatory Regions for Sexually Dichromatic Red Plumage Coloration
Authors: Simon Yung Wa Sin, Lily Lu, Scott V. Edwards
Date: 2020-08-13

Abstract:
Northern cardinals ( Cardinalis cardinalis ) are common, mid-sized passerines widely distributed in North America. As an iconic species with strong sexual dichromatism, it has been the focus of extensive ecological and evolutionary research, yet genomic studies investigating the evolution of genotype–phenotype association of plumage coloration and dichromatism are lacking. Here we present a new, highly-contiguous assembly for C. cardinalis . We generated a 1.1 Gb assembly comprised of 4,762 scaffolds, with a scaffold N50 of 3.6 Mb, a contig N50 of 114.4 kb and a longest scaffold of 19.7 Mb. We identified 93.5% complete and single-copy orthologs from an Aves dataset using BUSCO, demonstrating high completeness of the genome assembly. We annotated the genomic region comprising the CYP2J19 gene, which plays a pivotal role in the red coloration in birds. Comparative analyses demonstrated non-exonic regions unique to the CYP2J19 gene in passerines and a long insertion upstream of the gene in C. cardinalis . Transcription factor binding motifs discovered in the unique insertion region in C. cardinalis suggest potential androgen-regulated mechanisms underlying sexual dichromatism. Pairwise Sequential Markovian Coalescent (PSMC) analysis of the genome reveals fluctuations in historic effective population size between 100,000–250,000 in the last 2 millions years, with declines concordant with the beginning of the Pleistocene epoch and Last Glacial Period. This draft genome of C. cardinalis provides an important resource for future studies of ecological, evolutionary, and functional genomics in cardinals and other birds.

Title: The Spartina alterniflora genome sequence provides insights into the salt‐tolerance mechanisms of exo‐recretohalophytes

Abstract:
 Spartina alterniflora is an exo‐recretohalophyte Poaceae species that is able to grow well in seashore, but the genomic basis underlying its adaptation to salt tolerance remains unknown. Here, we report a high‐quality, chromosome‐level genome assembly of S. alterniflora constructed through PacBio HiFi sequencing, combined with high‐throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi‐C) technology and Illumina‐based transcriptomic analyses. The final 1.58 Gb genome assembly has a contig N50 size of 46.74 Mb. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that S. alterniflora diverged from Zoysia japonica approximately 21.72 million years ago (MYA). Moreover, whole‐genome duplication (WGD) events in S. alterniflora appear to have expanded gene families and transcription factors relevant to salt tolerance and adaptation to saline environments. Comparative genomics analyses identified numerous species‐specific genes, significantly expanded genes and positively selected genes that are enriched for ‘ion transport’ and ‘response to salt stress’. RNA‐seq analysis identified several ion transporter genes including the high‐affinity K + transporters ( HKTs ), SaHKT1;2 , SaHKT1;3 and SaHKT1;8 , and high copy number of Salt Overly Sensitive ( SOS ) up‐regulated under high salt conditions, and the overexpression of SaHKT2;4 in Arabidopsis thaliana conferred salt tolerance to the plant, suggesting specialized roles for S. alterniflora to adapt to saline environments. Integrated metabolomics and transcriptomics analyses revealed that salt stress activate glutathione metabolism, with differential expressions of several genes such as γ‐ECS , GSH‐S , GPX , GST and PCS in the glutathione metabolism. This study suggests several adaptive mechanisms that could contribute our understanding of evolutional basis of the halophyte.

Title: Comparative genomics analyses reveal sequence determinants underlying interspecies variations in injury-responsive enhancers
Authors: Luzhang Ji, Yuanyuan Shi, Qian Bian
Date: 2023-04-05

Abstract:
Injury induces profound transcriptional remodeling events, which could lead to only wound healing, partial tissue repair, or perfect regeneration in different species. Injury-responsive enhancers (IREs) are cis -regulatory elements activated in response to injury signals, and have been demonstrated to promote tissue regeneration in some organisms such as zebrafish and flies. However, the functional significances of IREs in mammals remain elusive. Moreover, whether the transcriptional responses elicited by IREs upon injury are conserved or specialized in different species, and what sequence features may underlie the functional variations of IREs have not been elucidated. We identified a set of IREs that are activated in both regenerative and non-regenerative neonatal mouse hearts upon myocardial ischemia-induced damage by integrative epigenomic and transcriptomic analyses. Motif enrichment analysis showed that AP-1 and ETS transcription factor binding motifs are significantly enriched in both zebrafish and mouse IREs. However, the IRE-associated genes vary considerably between the two species. We further found that the IRE-related sequences in zebrafish and mice diverge greatly, with the loss of IRE inducibility accompanied by a reduction in AP-1 and ETS motif frequencies. The functional turnover of IREs between zebrafish and mice is correlated with changes in transcriptional responses of the IRE-associated genes upon injury. Using mouse cardiomyocytes as a model, we demonstrated that the reduction in AP-1 or ETS motif frequency attenuates the activation of IREs in response to hypoxia-induced damage. By performing comparative genomics analyses on IREs, we demonstrated that inter-species variations in AP-1 and ETS motifs may play an important role in defining the functions of enhancers during injury response. Our findings provide important insights for understanding the molecular mechanisms of transcriptional remodeling in response to injury across species.

Title: Darwinian evolution in the light of genomics
Authors: Eugene V. Koonin
Date: 2009-03

Abstract:
Comparative genomics and systems biology offer unprecedented opportunities for testing central tenets of evolutionary biology formulated by Darwin in the Origin of Species in 1859 and expanded in the Modern Synthesis 100 years later. Evolutionary-genomic studies show that natural selection is only one of the forces that shape genome evolution and is not quantitatively dominant, whereas non-adaptive processes are much more prominent than previously suspected. Major contributions of horizontal gene transfer and diverse selfish genetic elements to genome evolution undermine the Tree of Life concept. An adequate depiction of evolution requires the more complex concept of a network or ‘forest’ of life. There is no consistent tendency of evolution towards increased genomic complexity, and when complexity increases, this appears to be a non-adaptive consequence of evolution under weak purifying selection rather than an adaptation. Several universals of genome evolution were discovered including the invariant distributions of evolutionary rates among orthologous genes from diverse genomes and of paralogous gene family sizes, and the negative correlation between gene expression level and sequence evolution rate. Simple, non-adaptive models of evolution explain some of these universals, suggesting that a new synthesis of evolutionary biology might become feasible in a not so remote future.

Title: Three feminizing Wolbachia strains in a single host species: comparative genomics paves the way for identifying sex reversal factors
Authors: Pierre Grève, Bouziane Moumen, Didier Bouchon
Date: 2024-08-22

Abstract:
Endosymbiotic bacteria in the genus Wolbachia have evolved numerous strategies for manipulating host reproduction in order to promote their own transmission. This includes the feminization of males into functional females, a well-studied phenotype in the isopod Armadillidium vulgare . Despite an early description of this phenotype in isopods and the development of an evolutionary model of host sex determination in the presence of Wolbachia , the underlying genetic mechanisms remain elusive. Here we present the first complete genomes of the three feminizing Wolbachia ( w VulC, w VulP, and w VulM) known to date in A. vulgare . These genomes, belonging to Wolbachia B supergroup, contain a large number of mobile elements such as WO prophages with eukaryotic association modules. Taking advantage of these data and those of another Wolbachia -derived feminizing factor integrated into the host genome ( f element), we used a comparative genomics approach to identify putative feminizing factors. This strategy has enabled us to identify three prophage-associated genes secreted by the Type IV Secretion System: one ankyrin repeat domain-containing protein, one helix-turn-helix transcriptional regulator and one hypothetical protein. In addition, a latrotoxin-related protein, associated with phage relic genes, was shared by all three genomes and the f element. These putative feminization-inducing proteins shared canonical interaction features with eukaryotic proteins. These results pave the way for further research into the underlying functional interactions.

Abstract:
The establishment of germ layers during early development is crucial for body formation. The Drosophila zygote serves as a model for investigating these transitions in relation to the chromatin landscape. However, the cellular heterogeneity of the blastoderm embryo poses a challenge for gaining mechanistic insights. Using 10× Multiome, we simultaneously analyzed the in vivo epigenomic and transcriptomic states of wild-type, E(z)-, and CBP-depleted embryos during zygotic genome activation at single-cell resolution. We found that pre-zygotic H3K27me3 safeguards tissue-specific gene expression by modulating cis -regulatory elements. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CBP is essential for cell fate specification functioning as a transcriptional activator by stabilizing transcriptional factors binding at key developmental genes. Surprisingly, while CBP depletion leads to transcriptional arrest, chromatin accessibility continues to progress independently through the retention of stalled RNA Polymerase II. Our study reveals fundamental principles of chromatin-mediated gene regulation essential for establishing and maintaining cellular identities during early embryogenesis.

Abstract:
Drug targets with genetic evidence are expected to increase clinical success by at least twofold. Yet, translating disease-associated genetic variants into functional knowledge remains a fundamental challenge of drug discovery. A key issue is that the vast majority of complex disease associations cannot be cleanly mapped to a gene. Immune disease-associated variants are enriched within regulatory elements found in T-cell-specific open chromatin regions. To identify genes and molecular programs modulated by these regulatory elements, we develop a CRISPRi-based single-cell functional screening approach in primary human T cells. Our pipeline enables the interrogation of transcriptomic changes induced by the perturbation of regulatory elements at scale. We first optimize an efficient CRISPRi protocol in primary CD4 + T cells via CROPseq vectors. Subsequently, we perform a screen targeting 45 non-coding regulatory elements and 35 transcription start sites and profile approximately 250,000 T -cell single-cell transcriptomes. We develop a bespoke analytical pipeline for element-to-gene (E2G) mapping and demonstrate that our method can identify both previously annotated and novel E2G links. Lastly, we integrate genetic association data for immune-related traits and demonstrate how our platform can aid in the identification of effector genes for GWAS loci. We describe “primary T cell crisprQTL” — a scalable, single-cell functional genomics approach for mapping regulatory elements to genes in primary human T cells. We show how this framework can facilitate the interrogation of immune disease GWAS hits and propose that the combination of experimental and QTL-based techniques is likely to address the variant-to-function problem.

Title: COFFEE: consensus single cell-type specific inference for gene regulatory networks
Authors: Musaddiq K Lodi, Anna Chernikov, Preetam Ghosh
Date: 2024-11

Abstract:
The inference of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) is crucial to understanding the regulatory mechanisms that govern biological processes. GRNs may be represented as edges in a graph, and hence, it have been inferred computationally for scRNA-seq data. A wisdom of crowds approach to integrate edges from several GRNs to create one composite GRN has demonstrated improved performance when compared with individual algorithm implementations on bulk RNA-seq and microarray data. In an effort to extend this approach to scRNA-seq data, we present COFFEE (COnsensus single cell-type speciFic inFerence for gEnE regulatory networks), a Borda voting-based consensus algorithm that integrates information from 10 established GRN inference methods. We conclude that COFFEE has improved performance across synthetic, curated, and experimental datasets when compared with baseline methods. Additionally, we show that a modified version of COFFEE can be leveraged to improve performance on newer cell-type specific GRN inference methods. Overall, our results demonstrate that consensus-based methods with pertinent modifications continue to be valuable for GRN inference at the single cell level. While COFFEE is benchmarked on 10 algorithms, it is a flexible strategy that can incorporate any set of GRN inference algorithms according to user preference. A Python implementation of COFFEE may be found on GitHub: https://github.com/lodimk2/coffee

Abstract:
Recent advances in single-cell technologies have led to the discovery of thousands of brain cell types; however, our understanding of the gene regulatory programs in these cell types is far from complete 1 – 4 . Here we report a comprehensive atlas of candidate cis -regulatory DNA elements (cCREs) in the adult mouse brain, generated by analysing chromatin accessibility in 2.3 million individual brain cells from 117 anatomical dissections. The atlas includes approximately 1 million cCREs and their chromatin accessibility across 1,482 distinct brain cell populations, adding over 446,000 cCREs to the most recent such annotation in the mouse genome. The mouse brain cCREs are moderately conserved in the human brain. The mouse-specific cCREs—specifically, those identified from a subset of cortical excitatory neurons—are strongly enriched for transposable elements, suggesting a potential role for transposable elements in the emergence of new regulatory programs and neuronal diversity. Finally, we infer the gene regulatory networks in over 260 subclasses of mouse brain cells and develop deep-learning models to predict the activities of gene regulatory elements in different brain cell types from the DNA sequence alone. Our results provide a resource for the analysis of cell-type-specific gene regulation programs in both mouse and human brains.

Date: 2024-07-18

Abstract:
Interactions among cis -regulatory elements (CREs) play a crucial role in gene regulation. Various approaches have been developed to map these interactions genome-wide, including those relying on interindividual epigenomic variation to identify groups of covariable regulatory elements, referred to as chromatin modules (CMs). While CM mapping allows to investigate the relationship between chromatin modularity and gene expression, the computational principles used for CM identification vary in their application and outcomes. We comprehensively evaluate and streamline existing CM mapping tools and present guidelines for optimal utilization of epigenome data from a diverse population of individuals to assess regulatory coordination across the human genome. We showcase the effectiveness of our recommended practices by analyzing distinct cell types and demonstrate cell type specificity of CRE interactions in CMs and their relevance for gene expression. Integration of genotype information revealed that many non-coding disease-associated variants affect the activity of CMs in a cell type-specific manner by affecting the binding of cell type-specific transcription factors. We provide example cases that illustrate in detail how CMs can be used to deconstruct GWAS loci, assess variable expression of cell surface receptors in immune cells, and reveal how genetic variation can impact the expression of prognostic markers in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Our study presents an optimal strategy for CM mapping and reveals how CMs capture the coordination of CREs and its impact on gene expression. Non-coding genetic variants can disrupt this coordination, and we highlight how this may lead to disease predisposition in a cell type-specific manner.

Abstract:
Annotation of the cis -regulatory elements that drive transcriptional dysregulation in cancer cells is critical to improving our understanding of tumor biology. Herein, we present a compendium of matched chromatin accessibility (scATAC-seq) and transcriptome (scRNA-seq) profiles at single-cell resolution from human breast tumors and healthy mammary tissues processed immediately following surgical resection. We identify the most likely cell-of-origin for luminal breast tumors and basal breast tumors and then introduce a novel methodology that implements linear mixed-effects models to systematically quantify associations between regions of chromatin accessibility (i.e. regulatory elements) and gene expression in malignant cells versus normal mammary epithelial cells. These data unveil regulatory elements with that switch from silencers of gene expression in normal cells to enhancers of gene expression in cancer cells, leading to the upregulation of clinically relevant oncogenes. To translate the utility of this dataset into tractable models, we generated matched scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq profiles for breast cancer cell lines, revealing, for each subtype, a conserved oncogenic gene expression program between in vitro and in vivo cells. Together, this work highlights the importance of non-coding regulatory mechanisms that underlie oncogenic processes and the ability of single-cell multi-omics to define the regulatory logic of BC cells at single-cell resolution.

Abstract:
In plants, microRNAs (miRNAs) participate in complex gene regulatory networks together with the transcription factors (TFs) in response to biotic and abiotic stresses. To date, analyses of miRNAs‐induced transcriptome remodeling are at the whole plant or tissue levels. Here, Arabidopsis ’s ABA‐induced single‐cell RNA‐seq (scRNA‐seq) is performed at different stages of time points–early, middle, and late. Single‐cell level primary miRNAs (pri‐miRNAs) atlas supported the rapid, dynamic, and cell‐type specific miRNA responses under ABA treatment. MiRNAs respond rapidly and prior to target gene expression dynamics, and these rapid response miRNAs are highly cell‐type specific, especially in mesophyll and vascular cells. MiRNA‐TF‐mRNA regulation modules are identified by identifying miRNA‐contained feed‐forward loops (M‐FFLs) in the regulatory network, and regulatory networks with M‐FFLs have higher co‐expression and clustering coefficient (CC) values than those without M‐FFLs, suggesting the hub role of miRNAs in regulatory networks. The cell‐type‐specific M‐FFLs are regulated by these hub miRNAs rather than TFs through sc‐RNA‐seq network analysis. MiR858a‐FBH3‐MYB module inhibited the expression of MYB63 and MYB20, which related to the formation of plant secondary wall and the production of lignin, through M‐FFL specifically in vascular. These results can provide prominent insights into miRNAs' dynamic and cell‐type‐specific roles in plant development and stress responses.

We identify the most likely cell of origin for subtype-specific breast tumors and implement linear mixed-effects modeling to quantify associations between regulatory elements and gene expression in malignant versus normal cells. These data unveil cancer-specific regulatory elements and putative silencer-to-enhancer switching events in cells that lead to the upregulation of clinically relevant oncogenes. In addition, we generate matched scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq profiles for breast cancer cell lines, revealing a conserved oncogenic gene expression program between in vitro and in vivo cells. This work highlights the importance of non-coding regulatory mechanisms that underlie oncogenic processes and the ability of single-cell multi-omics to define the regulatory logic of cancer cells.

Abstract:
 In plants, the biosynthetic pathways of some specialized metabolites are partitioned into specialized or rare cell types, as exemplified by the monoterpenoid indole alkaloid (MIA) pathway of Catharanthus roseus (Madagascar Periwinkle), the source of the anticancer compounds vinblastine and vincristine. In the leaf, the C. roseus MIA biosynthetic pathway is partitioned into three cell types with the final known steps of the pathway expressed in the rare cell type termed idioblast. How cell‐type specificity of MIA biosynthesis is achieved is poorly understood. We generated single‐cell multi‐omics data from C. roseus leaves. Integrating gene expression and chromatin accessibility profiles across single cells, as well as transcription factor (TF)‐binding site profiles, we constructed a cell‐type‐aware gene regulatory network for MIA biosynthesis. We showcased cell‐type‐specific TFs as well as cell‐type‐specific cis ‐regulatory elements. Using motif enrichment analysis, co‐expression across cell types, and functional validation approaches, we discovered a novel idioblast‐specific TF ( Idioblast MYB1 , CrIDM1 ) that activates expression of late‐stage MIA biosynthetic genes in the idioblast. These analyses not only led to the discovery of the first documented cell‐type‐specific TF that regulates the expression of two idioblast‐specific biosynthetic genes within an idioblast metabolic regulon but also provides insights into cell‐type‐specific metabolic regulation.

Title: DNA regulatory element cooperation and competition in transcription
Authors: Haram Lee, Meyer Joseph Friedman, Sang Bum Kim, Soohwan Oh
Date: 2024-12-31

Abstract:
Regulation of eukaryotic transcription is a complex process that enables precise temporal and spatial control of gene expression. Promoters, which are cis -regulatory elements (CREs) located proximal to the transcription start site (TSS), selectively integrate regulatory cues from distal CREs, or enhancers, and their associated transcriptional machinery. In this review, we discuss current knowledge regarding CRE cooperation and competition impacting gene expression, including features of enhancer-promoter, enhancer-enhancer, and promoter-promoter interplay. We also provide an overview of recent insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms that facilitate physical and functional interaction of regulatory elements, such as the involvement of enhancer RNAs and biomolecular condensates.

Title: Application of Single-Cell Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin with High Throughput Sequencing in Plant Science: Advances, Technical Challenges, and Prospects
Authors: Chao Lu, Yunxiao Wei, Mubashir Abbas, Hasi Agula, Edwin Wang, Zhigang Meng, Rui Zhang
Date: 2024-01-25

Abstract:
The Single-cell Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin with high throughput sequencing (scATAC-seq) has gained increasing popularity in recent years, allowing for chromatin accessibility to be deciphered and gene regulatory networks (GRNs) to be inferred at single-cell resolution. This cutting-edge technology now enables the genome-wide profiling of chromatin accessibility at the cellular level and the capturing of cell-type-specific cis-regulatory elements (CREs) that are masked by cellular heterogeneity in bulk assays. Additionally, it can also facilitate the identification of rare and new cell types based on differences in chromatin accessibility and the charting of cellular developmental trajectories within lineage-related cell clusters. Due to technical challenges and limitations, the data generated from scATAC-seq exhibit unique features, often characterized by high sparsity and noise, even within the same cell type. To address these challenges, various bioinformatic tools have been developed. Furthermore, the application of scATAC-seq in plant science is still in its infancy, with most research focusing on root tissues and model plant species. In this review, we provide an overview of recent progress in scATAC-seq and its application across various fields. We first conduct scATAC-seq in plant science. Next, we highlight the current challenges of scATAC-seq in plant science and major strategies for cell type annotation. Finally, we outline several future directions to exploit scATAC-seq technologies to address critical challenges in plant science, ranging from plant ENCODE(The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements) project construction to GRN inference, to deepen our understanding of the roles of CREs in plant biology.

Title: PuF, an antimetastatic and developmental signaling protein, interacts with the Alzheimer’s amyloid-β precursor protein via a tissue-specific proximal regulatory element (PRE)
Authors: Debomoy K Lahiri, Bryan Maloney, Jack T Rogers, Yuan-Wen Ge
Date: 2013

Abstract:
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is intimately tied to amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide. Extraneuronal brain plaques consisting primarily of Aβ aggregates are a hallmark of AD. Intraneuronal Aβ subunits are strongly implicated in disease progression. Protein sequence mutations of the Aβ precursor protein (APP) account for a small proportion of AD cases, suggesting that regulation of the associated gene ( APP ) may play a more important role in AD etiology. The APP promoter possesses a novel 30 nucleotide sequence, or “proximal regulatory element” (PRE), at −76/−47, from the +1 transcription start site that confers cell type specificity. This PRE contains sequences that make it vulnerable to epigenetic modification and may present a viable target for drug studies. We examined PRE-nuclear protein interaction by gel electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and PRE mutant EMSA. This was followed by functional studies of PRE mutant/reporter gene fusion clones. EMSA probed with the PRE showed DNA-protein interaction in multiple nuclear extracts and in human brain tissue nuclear extract in a tissue-type specific manner. We identified transcription factors that are likely to bind the PRE, using competition gel shift and gel supershift: Activator protein 2 (AP2), nm23 nucleoside diphosphate kinase/metastatic inhibitory protein (PuF), and specificity protein 1 (SP1). These sites crossed a known single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). EMSA with PRE mutants and promoter/reporter clone transfection analysis further implicated PuF in cells and extracts. Functional assays of mutant/reporter clone transfections were evaluated by ELISA of reporter protein levels. EMSA and ELISA results correlated by meta-analysis. We propose that PuF may regulate the APP gene promoter and that AD risk may be increased by interference with PuF regulation at the PRE. PuF is targeted by calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II inhibitor 1, which also interacts with the integrins. These proteins are connected to vital cellular and neurological functions. In addition, the transcription factor PuF is a known inhibitor of metastasis and regulates cell growth during development. Given that APP is a known cell adhesion protein and ferroxidase, this suggests biochemical links among cell signaling, the cell cycle, iron metabolism in cancer, and AD in the context of overall aging.

Abstract:
COVID-19 is characterized by systemic pro-inflammatory shifts with the development of serious alterations in the functioning of the immune system. Investigations of the gene expression changes accompanying the infection state provide insight into the molecular and cellular processes depending on the sickness severity and virus variants. Severe Delta COVID-19 has been characterized by the appearance of a monocyte subset enriched for proinflammatory gene expression signatures and a shift in ligand–receptor interactions. We profiled the chromatin accessibility landscape of 140,000 nuclei in PBMC samples from healthy individuals or individuals with COVID-19. We investigated cis-regulatory elements and identified the core transcription factors governing gene expression in immune cells during COVID-19 infection. In severe cases, we discovered that regulome and chromatin co-accessibility modules were significantly altered across many cell types. Moreover, cases with the Delta variant were accompanied by a specific monocyte subtype discovered using scATAC-seq data. Our analysis showed that immune cells of individuals with severe Delta COVID-19 underwent significant remodeling of the chromatin accessibility landscape and development of the proinflammatory expression pattern. Using a gene regulatory network modeling approach, we investigated the core transcription factors governing the cell state and identified the most pronounced chromatin changes in CD14+ monocytes from individuals with severe Delta COVID-19. Together, our results provide novel insights into cis-regulatory module organization and its impact on gene activity in immune cells during SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Abstract:
Cis -regulatory elements (CREs) are essential for regulating gene expression, yet their evolutionary dynamics in plants remain elusive. Here we constructed a single-cell chromatin accessibility atlas for Oryza sativa from 103,911 nuclei representing 126 cell states across nine organs. Comparative genomics between O. sativa and 57,552 nuclei from four additional grass species ( Zea mays , Sorghum bicolor , Panicum miliaceum and Urochloa fusca ) revealed that chromatin accessibility conservation varies with cell-type specificity. Epidermal accessible chromatin regions in the leaf were less conserved compared to other cell types, indicating accelerated regulatory evolution in the L1-derived epidermal layer of O. sativa relative to other species. Conserved accessible chromatin regions overlapping the repressive histone modification H3K27me3 were identified as potentially silencer-like CREs, as deleting these regions led to up-regulation of gene expression. This study provides a comprehensive epigenomic resource for the rice community, demonstrating the utility of a comparative genomics approach that highlights the dynamics of plant cell-type-specific CRE evolution.

Abstract:
The cellular complexity of the human brain is established via dynamic changes in gene expression throughout development that is mediated, in part, by the spatiotemporal activity of cis-regulatory elements (CREs). We simultaneously profiled gene expression and chromatin accessibility in 45,549 cortical nuclei across six broad developmental time points from fetus to adult. We identified cell type–specific domains in which chromatin accessibility is highly correlated with gene expression. Differentiation pseudotime trajectory analysis indicates that chromatin accessibility at CREs precedes transcription and that dynamic changes in chromatin structure play a critical role in neuronal lineage commitment. In addition, we mapped cell type–specific and temporally specific genetic loci implicated in neuropsychiatric traits, including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Together, our results describe the complex regulation of cell composition at critical stages in lineage determination and shed light on the impact of spatiotemporal alterations in gene expression on neuropsychiatric disease.

Title: Inferring gene regulatory networks from single-cell multiome data using atlas-scale external data
Authors: Qiuyue Yuan, Zhana Duren
Date: 2024-04-12

Abstract:
Existing methods for gene regulatory network (GRN) inference rely on gene expression data alone or on lower resolution bulk data. Despite the recent integration of chromatin accessibility and RNA sequencing data, learning complex mechanisms from limited independent data points still presents a daunting challenge. Here we present LINGER (Lifelong neural network for gene regulation), a machine-learning method to infer GRNs from single-cell paired gene expression and chromatin accessibility data. LINGER incorporates atlas-scale external bulk data across diverse cellular contexts and prior knowledge of transcription factor motifs as a manifold regularization. LINGER achieves a fourfold to sevenfold relative increase in accuracy over existing methods and reveals a complex regulatory landscape of genome-wide association studies, enabling enhanced interpretation of disease-associated variants and genes. Following the GRN inference from reference single-cell multiome data, LINGER enables the estimation of transcription factor activity solely from bulk or single-cell gene expression data, leveraging the abundance of available gene expression data to identify driver regulators from case-control studies.

Authors: Aowen Wang, Jiaqi Li, Hongyu Dong, Bocheng Xu, Qingyu Yin, Yanchao Xu, Jie Fu, Junbo Zhao
Date: 2025-11-19

Abstract:
The human genome contains a sophisticated array of elements that regulate gene activity and organismal functions. Developing a large window foundation model capable of efficiently processing long sequence inputs is essential yet challenging for decoding the multi-layered and complex landscape of the cis-regulatory elements. Here, we introduce OmniReg-GPT, a generative foundation model designed for the low-resource pretraining of long genomic sequences by optimized attention mechanism. During pretraining, OmniReg-GPT captures the complete distribution of regulatory elements across nucleotide to megabase scales with efficient training speed and memory usage. We demonstrate exceptional performance in downstream regulotary applications spanning the entire spectrum of genomic scales, including various cis-regulatory elements identification, context dependent gene expression prediction, single-cell chromatin accessibility analysis, and 3D chromatin contact modeling. As a generative model, OmniReg-GPT also holds the potential to generate candidate cell-type-specific enhancers through prompt engineering. Overall, OmniReg-GPT extends the boundaries of foundation models in the genomic field, and provides a valuable pretraining model resource which can be extensively applied for genomic researches.

Abstract:
Spermatogenesis depends on an orchestrated series of developing events in germ cells and full maturation of the somatic microenvironment. To date, the majority of efforts to study cellular heterogeneity in testis has been focused on single-cell gene expression rather than the chromatin landscape shaping gene expression. To advance our understanding of the regulatory programs underlying testicular cell types, we analyzed single-cell chromatin accessibility profiles in more than 25,000 cells from mouse developing testis. We showed that single-cell sequencing assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (scATAC-Seq) allowed us to deconvolve distinct cell populations and identify cis -regulatory elements (CREs) underlying cell-type specification. We identified sets of transcription factors associated with cell type-specific accessibility, revealing novel regulators of cell fate specification and maintenance. Pseudotime reconstruction revealed detailed regulatory dynamics coordinating the sequential developmental progressions of germ cells and somatic cells. This high-resolution dataset also unveiled previously unreported subpopulations within both the Sertoli and Leydig cell groups. Further, we defined candidate target cell types and genes of several genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals, including those associated with testosterone levels and coronary artery disease. Collectively, our data provide a blueprint of the ‘regulon’ of the mouse male germline and supporting somatic cells.

Abstract:
Physiological variability in pancreatic cell type gene regulation and the impact on diabetes risk is poorly understood. In this study we mapped gene regulation in pancreatic cell types using single cell multiomic (joint RNA-seq and ATAC-seq) profiling in 28 non-diabetic donors in combination with single cell data from 35 non-diabetic donors in the Human Pancreas Analysis Program. We identified widespread associations with age, sex, BMI, and HbA1c, where gene regulatory responses were highly cell type- and phenotype-specific. In beta cells, donor age associated with hypoxia, apoptosis, unfolded protein response, and external signal-dependent transcriptional regulators, while HbA1c associated with inflammatory responses and gender with chromatin organization. We identified 10.8K loci where genetic variants were QTLs for cis regulatory element (cRE) accessibility, including 20% with lineage- or cell type-specific effects which disrupted distinct transcription factor motifs. Type 2 diabetes and glycemic trait associated variants were enriched in both phenotype- and QTL-associated beta cell cREs, whereas type 1 diabetes showed limited enrichment. Variants at 226 diabetes and glycemic trait loci were QTLs in beta and other cell types, including 40 that were statistically colocalized, and annotating target genes of colocalized QTLs revealed genes with putatively novel roles in disease. Our findings reveal diverse responses of pancreatic cell types to phenotype and genotype in physiology, and identify pathways, networks, and genes through which physiology impacts diabetes risk.

Abstract:
Maldevelopment of the pharyngeal endoderm, an embryonic tissue critical for patterning of the pharyngeal region and ensuing organogenesis, ultimately contributes to several classes of human developmental syndromes and disorders. Such syndromes are characterized by a spectrum of phenotypes that currently cannot be fully explained by known mutations or genetic variants due to gaps in characterization of critical drivers of normal and dysfunctional development. Despite the disease-relevance of pharyngeal endoderm, we still lack a comprehensive and integrative view of the molecular basis and gene regulatory networks driving pharyngeal endoderm development. To close this gap, we apply transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility single-cell sequencing technologies to generate a multi-omic developmental resource spanning pharyngeal endoderm patterning to the emergence of organ-specific epithelia in the developing mouse embryo. We identify cell-type specific gene regulation, distill GRN models that define developing organ domains, and characterize the role of an immunodeficiency-associated forkhead box transcription factor.

Date: 2021-09-09

Abstract:
Cell types in ventral midbrain are involved in diseases with variable genetic susceptibility, such as Parkinson’s disease and schizophrenia. Many genetic variants affect regulatory regions and alter gene expression in a cell-type-specific manner depending on the chromatin structure and accessibility. We report 20,658 single-nuclei chromatin accessibility profiles of ventral midbrain from two genetically and phenotypically distinct mouse strains. We distinguish ten cell types based on chromatin profiles and analysis of accessible regions controlling cell identity genes highlights cell-type-specific key transcription factors. Regulatory variation segregating the mouse strains manifests more on transcriptome than chromatin level. However, cell-type-level data reveals changes not captured at tissue level. To discover the scope and cell-type specificity of cis -acting variation in midbrain gene expression, we identify putative regulatory variants and show them to be enriched at differentially expressed loci. Finally, we find TCF7L2 to mediate trans -acting variation selectively in midbrain neurons. Our data set provides an extensive resource to study gene regulation in mesencephalon and provides insights into control of cell identity in the midbrain and identifies cell-type-specific regulatory variation possibly underlying phenotypic and behavioural differences between mouse strains.

Title: NetREm: Network Regression Embeddings reveal cell-type transcription factor coordination for gene regulation
Authors: Saniya Khullar, Xiang Huang, Raghu Ramesh, John Svaren, Daifeng Wang
Date: 2025

Abstract:
Transcription factor (TF) coordination plays a key role in gene regulation via direct and/or indirect protein–protein interactions (PPIs) and co-binding to regulatory elements on DNA. Single-cell technologies facilitate gene expression measurement for individual cells and cell-type identification, yet the connection between TF-TF coordination and target gene (TG) regulation of various cell types remains unclear. To address this, we introduce our innovative computational approach, Network Regression Embeddings (NetREm), to reveal cell-type TF-TF coordination activities for TG regulation. NetREm leverages network-constrained regularization, using prior knowledge of PPIs among TFs, to analyze single-cell gene expression data, uncovering cell-type coordinating TFs and identifying revolutionary TF-TG candidate regulatory network links. NetREm’s performance is validated using simulation studies and benchmarked across several datasets in humans, mice, yeast. Further, we showcase NetREm’s ability to prioritize valid novel human TF-TF coordination links in 9 peripheral blood mononuclear and 42 immune cell sub-types. We apply NetREm to examine cell-type networks in central and peripheral nerve systems (e.g. neuronal, glial, Schwann cells) and in Alzheimer’s disease versus Controls. Top predictions are validated with experimental data from rat, mouse, and human models. Additional functional genomics data helps link genetic variants to our TF-TG regulatory and TF-TF coordination networks.  https://github.com/SaniyaKhullar/NetREm .

Date: 2022-05-16

Abstract:
Technological development has enabled the profiling of gene expression and chromatin accessibility from the same cell. We develop scREG, a dimension reduction methodology, based on the concept of cis -regulatory potential, for single cell multiome data. This concept is further used for the construction of subpopulation-specific cis -regulatory networks. The capability of inferring useful regulatory network is demonstrated by the two-fold increment on network inference accuracy compared to the Pearson correlation-based method and the 27-fold enrichment of GWAS variants for inflammatory bowel disease in the cis -regulatory elements. The R package scREG provides comprehensive functions for single cell multiome data analysis. The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s13059-022-02682-2.

Title: A combinatorial indexing strategy for low-cost epigenomic profiling of plant single cells
Authors: Xiaoyu Tu, Alexandre P. Marand, Robert J. Schmitz, Silin Zhong
Date: 2022-07-11

Abstract:
Understanding how cis- regulatory elements facilitate gene expression is a key question in biology. Recent advances in single-cell genomics have led to the discovery of cell-specific chromatin landscapes that underlie transcription programs in animal models. However, the high equipment and reagent costs of commercial systems limit their applications for many laboratories. In this study, we developed a combinatorial index and dual PCR barcode strategy to profile the Arabidopsis thaliana root single-cell epigenome without any specialized equipment. We generated chromatin accessibility profiles for 13 576 root nuclei with an average of 12 784 unique Tn5 integrations per cell. Integration of the single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing and RNA sequencing data sets enabled the identification of 24 cell clusters with unique transcription, chromatin, and cis -regulatory signatures. Comparison with single-cell data generated using the commercial microfluidic platform from 10X Genomics revealed that this low-cost combinatorial index method is capable of unbiased identification of cell-type-specific chromatin accessibility. We anticipate that, by removing cost, instrumentation, and other technical obstacles, this method will be a valuable tool for routine investigation of single-cell epigenomes and provide new insights into plant growth and development and plant interactions with the environment.

Abstract:
The endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition (EHT) process during definitive hematopoiesis is highly conserved in vertebrates. Stage-specific expression of transposable elements (TEs) has been detected during zebrafish EHT and may promote hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) formation by activating inflammatory signaling. However, little is known about how TEs contribute to the EHT process in human and mouse. We reconstructed the single-cell EHT trajectories of human and mouse and resolved the dynamic expression patterns of TEs during EHT. Most TEs presented a transient co-upregulation pattern along the conserved EHT trajectories, coinciding with the temporal relaxation of epigenetic silencing systems. TE products can be sensed by multiple pattern recognition receptors, triggering inflammatory signaling to facilitate HSC emergence. Interestingly, we observed that hypoxia-related signals were enriched in cells with higher TE expression. Furthermore, we constructed the hematopoietic cis-regulatory network of accessible TEs and identified potential TE-derived enhancers that may boost the expression of specific EHT marker genes. Our study provides a systematic vision of how TEs are dynamically controlled to promote the hematopoietic fate decisions through transcriptional and cis-regulatory networks, and pre-train the immunity of nascent HSCs.

While conventional genetic screens are limited to bulk measurements of cell behavior, recent developments in single-cell technologies make it possible to combine CRISPR screening with single-cell profiling. In this way, cell behavior and gene expression can be monitored simultaneously, with the additional possibility of including data on chromatin accessibility and protein levels. Moreover, the availability of various Cas proteins leading to inactivation, activation, or other effects on gene function further broadens the scope of such screens. The integration of single-cell multi-omics approaches with CRISPR screening open the path to high-content information on the impact of genetic perturbations at single-cell resolution. Current limitations in cell throughput and data density need to be taken into consideration, but new technologies are rapidly evolving and are likely to easily overcome these limitations. In this review, we discuss the use of bulk CRISPR screening in hematology research, as well as the emergence of single-cell CRISPR screening and its added value to the field.

Title: Deep Parallel Characterization of AAV Tropism and AAV-Mediated Transcriptional Changes via Single-Cell RNA Sequencing

Abstract:
Engineered variants of recombinant adeno-associated viruses (rAAVs) are being developed rapidly to meet the need for gene-therapy delivery vehicles with particular cell-type and tissue tropisms. While high-throughput AAV engineering and selection methods have generated numerous variants, subsequent tropism and response characterization have remained low throughput and lack resolution across the many relevant cell and tissue types. To fully leverage the output of these large screening paradigms across multiple targets, we have developed an experimental and computational single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) pipeline for in vivo characterization of barcoded rAAV pools at high resolution. Using this platform, we have both corroborated previously reported viral tropisms and discovered unidentified AAV capsid targeting biases. As expected, we observed that the tropism profile of AAV.CAP-B10 in mice was shifted toward neurons and away from astrocytes when compared with AAV-PHP.eB. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that this neuronal bias is due mainly to increased targeting efficiency for glutamatergic neurons, which we confirmed by RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization. We further uncovered cell subtype tropisms of AAV variants in vascular and glial cells, such as low transduction of pericytes and Myoc+ astrocytes. Additionally, we have observed cell-type-specific transitory responses to systemic AAV-PHP.eB administration, such as upregulation of genes involved in p53 signaling in endothelial cells three days post-injection, which return to control levels by day twenty-five. The presented experimental and computational approaches for parallel characterization of AAV tropism will facilitate the advancement of safe and precise gene delivery vehicles, and showcase the power of understanding responses to gene therapies at the single-cell level.

Abstract:
The cerebral cortex of the human brain is a highly complex, heterogeneous tissue that contains many cell types that are exquisitely regulated at the level of gene expression by noncoding regulatory elements, presumably in a cell-type–dependent manner. However, assessing the regulatory elements in individual cell types is technically challenging, and therefore most of the previous studies on gene regulation were performed with bulk brain tissue. Here we analyze two major types of neurons isolated from the cerebral cortex of humans, chimpanzees, and rhesus macaques, and report complex patterns of cell-type–specific evolution of the regulatory elements in numerous genes. Many genes with evolving regulation are implicated in language abilities as well as psychiatric disorders.

Abstract:
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified over fifty loci associated with lung cancer risk. However, underlying mechanisms and target genes are largely unknown, as most risk-associated variants might regulate gene expression in a context-specific manner. Here, we generate a barcode-shared transcriptome and chromatin accessibility map of 117,911 human lung cells from age/sex-matched ever- and never-smokers to profile context-specific gene regulation. Identified candidate cis -regulatory elements (cCREs) are largely cell type-specific, with 37% detected in one cell type. Colocalization of lung cancer candidate causal variants (CCVs) with these cCREs combined with transcription factor footprinting prioritize the variants for 68% of the GWAS loci. CCV-colocalization and trait relevance score indicate that epithelial and immune cell categories, including rare cell types, contribute to lung cancer susceptibility the most. A multi-level cCRE-gene linking system identifies candidate susceptibility genes from 57% of the loci, where most loci display cell-category-specific target genes, suggesting context-specific susceptibility gene function.

Abstract:
Cis -regulatory elements (CREs) precisely control spatiotemporal gene expression in cells. Using a spatially resolved single-cell atlas of gene expression with chromatin accessibility across ten soybean tissues, we identified 103 distinct cell types and 303,199 accessible chromatin regions (ACRs). Nearly 40% of the ACRs showed cell-type-specific patterns and were enriched for transcription factor (TF) motifs defining diverse cell identities. We identified de novo enriched TF motifs and explored conservation of gene regulatory networks underpinning legume symbiotic nitrogen fixation. With comprehensive developmental trajectories for endosperm and embryo, we uncovered the functional transition of the three sub-cell types of endosperm, identified 13 sucrose transporters sharing the DOF11 motif that were co-up-regulated in late peripheral endosperm and identified key embryo cell-type specification regulators during embryogenesis, including a homeobox TF that promotes cotyledon parenchyma identity. This resource provides a valuable foundation for analyzing gene regulatory programs in soybean cell types across tissues and life stages.

Title: Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Central Nervous System Diseases: Advancing Translational Neuropathology via Single‐Cell and Spatial Multiomics
Authors: Mingkai Xia, Quan Liu, Wenli Zhang, Jinwen Ge, Zhigang Mei
Date: 2025-08-19

Abstract:
Central nervous system (CNS) diseases, a leading cause of global disability and mortality, encompass a wide range of brain disorders such as stroke, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and so on. These diseases are characterized by dynamic cellular heterogeneity and disrupted intercellular crosstalk, yet their molecular drivers remain incompletely resolved. Single‐cell RNA sequencing (scRNA‐seq) dissects transcriptional diversity at cellular resolution, while spatial transcriptomics (ST) maps niche‐specific interactions within tissue architecture—complementary approaches that have revealed disease‐associated subpopulations, neural–glial communication, and microenvironmental remodeling. However, standalone omics layers inadequately capture the genetic, epigenetic, and functional cascades underlying CNS pathologies. Here, we highlight the transformative potential of integrating scRNA‐seq and ST with multiomic profiling to delineate spatially orchestrated molecular networks. Such multiomic convergence enables systematic deconstruction of molecular mechanisms and intercellular communication across disease progression. By correlating these signatures with clinical phenotypes, this strategy accelerates biomarker discovery, patient stratification, and therapeutic target identification. We further discuss challenges in data harmonization, subcellular spatial resolution, and computational scalability that must be addressed to realize personalized CNS medicine. This synthesis advocates for interdisciplinary frameworks to translate multiomic insights into mechanistically grounded diagnostics and therapies, ultimately bridging the gap between molecular discovery and precision clinical intervention.

Date: 2023-09-26

Abstract:
Cell heterogeneity shapes the morphology and function of various tissues and organs in multicellular organisms. Elucidation of the differences among cells and the mechanism of intercellular regulation is essential for an in-depth understanding of the developmental process. In recent years, the rapid development of high-throughput single-cell transcriptome sequencing technologies has influenced the study of plant developmental biology. Additionally, the accuracy and sensitivity of tools used to study the epigenome and metabolome have significantly increased, thus enabling multi-omics analysis at single-cell resolution. Here, we summarize the currently available single-cell multi-omics approaches and their recent applications in plant research, review the single-cell based studies in fruit, vegetable, and ornamental crops, and discuss the potential of such approaches in future horticulture research.

Title: Current genomic deep learning models display decreased performance in cell type-specific accessible regions
Authors: Pooja Kathail, Richard W. Shuai, Ryan Chung, Chun Jimmie Ye, Gabriel B. Loeb, Nilah M. Ioannidis
Date: 2024-08-01

Abstract:
A number of deep learning models have been developed to predict epigenetic features such as chromatin accessibility from DNA sequence. Model evaluations commonly report performance genome-wide; however, cis regulatory elements (CREs), which play critical roles in gene regulation, make up only a small fraction of the genome. Furthermore, cell type-specific CREs contain a large proportion of complex disease heritability. We evaluate genomic deep learning models in chromatin accessibility regions with varying degrees of cell type specificity. We assess two modeling directions in the field: general purpose models trained across thousands of outputs (cell types and epigenetic marks) and models tailored to specific tissues and tasks. We find that the accuracy of genomic deep learning models, including two state-of-the-art general purpose models―Enformer and Sei―varies across the genome and is reduced in cell type-specific accessible regions. Using accessibility models trained on cell types from specific tissues, we find that increasing model capacity to learn cell type-specific regulatory syntax―through single-task learning or high capacity multi-task models―can improve performance in cell type-specific accessible regions. We also observe that improving reference sequence predictions does not consistently improve variant effect predictions, indicating that novel strategies are needed to improve performance on variants. Our results provide a new perspective on the performance of genomic deep learning models, showing that performance varies across the genome and is particularly reduced in cell type-specific accessible regions. We also identify strategies to maximize performance in cell type-specific accessible regions. The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s13059-024-03335-2.

Title: scKAN: interpretable single-cell analysis for cell-type-specific gene discovery and drug repurposing via Kolmogorov-Arnold networks

Abstract:
Analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data has revolutionized our understanding of cellular heterogeneity, yet current approaches face challenges in efficiency, interpretability, and connecting molecular insights to therapeutic applications. Despite advances in deep learning methods, identifying cell-type-specific functional gene sets remains difficult. In this study, we present scKAN, an interpretable framework for scRNA-seq analysis with two primary goals: accurate cell-type annotation and the discovery of cell-type-specific marker genes and gene sets. The key innovation is using the learnable activation curves of the Kolmogorov-Arnold network to model gene-to-cell relationships. This approach provides a more direct way to visualize and interpret these specific interactions compared to the aggregated weighting schemes typical of attention mechanisms. This architecture achieves superior performance in cell-type annotation, with a 6.63% improvement in macro F1 score over state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, it enables the systematic identification of functionally coherent cell-type-specific gene sets. We demonstrate the framework’s translational potential through a case study on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, where gene signatures identified by scKAN led to a potential drug repurposing candidate, whose binding stability was supported by molecular dynamics simulations. Our work establishes scKAN as an efficient and interpretable framework that effectively bridges single-cell analysis with drug discovery. By combining lightweight architecture with the ability to uncover nuanced biological patterns, our approach offers an interpretable method for translating large-scale single-cell data into actionable therapeutic strategies. This approach provides a robust foundation for accelerating the identification of cell-type-specific targets in complex diseases.

Abstract:
Conventional methods fall short in unraveling the dynamics of rare cell types related to aging and diseases. Here we introduce EasySci, an advanced single-cell combinatorial indexing strategy for exploring age-dependent cellular dynamics in the mammalian brain. Profiling approximately 1.5 million single-cell transcriptomes and 400,000 chromatin accessibility profiles across diverse mouse brains, we identified over 300 cell subtypes, uncovering their molecular characteristics and spatial locations. This comprehensive view elucidates rare cell types expanded or depleted upon aging. We also investigated cell-type-specific responses to genetic alterations linked to Alzheimer’s disease, identifying associated rare cell types. Additionally, by profiling 118,240 human brain single-cell transcriptomes, we discerned cell- and region-specific transcriptomic changes tied to Alzheimer’s pathogenesis. In conclusion, this research offers a valuable resource for probing cell-type-specific dynamics in both normal and pathological aging.

Abstract:
Single-cell genomics is a powerful tool for studying heterogeneous tissues such as the brain. Yet, little is understood about how genetic variants influence cell-level gene expression. Addressing this, we uniformly processed single-nuclei, multi-omics datasets into a resource comprising >2.8M nuclei from the prefrontal cortex across 388 individuals. For 28 cell types, we assessed population-level variation in expression and chromatin across gene families and drug targets. We identified >550K cell-type-specific regulatory elements and >1.4M single-cell expression-quantitative-trait loci, which we used to build cell-type regulatory and cell-to-cell communication networks. These networks manifest cellular changes in aging and neuropsychiatric disorders. We further constructed an integrative model accurately imputing single-cell expression and simulating perturbations; the model prioritized ~250 disease-risk genes and drug targets with associated cell types.

Abstract:
DNA accessibility of cis -regulatory elements (CREs) dictates transcriptional activity and drives cell differentiation during development. While many genes regulating embryonic development have been identified, the underlying CRE dynamics controlling their expression remain largely uncharacterized. To address this, we produced a multimodal resource and genomic regulatory map for the zebrafish community, which integrates single-cell combinatorial indexing assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (sci-ATAC-seq) with bulk histone PTMs and Hi-C data to achieve a genome-wide classification of the regulatory architecture determining transcriptional activity in the 24-h post-fertilization (hpf) embryo. We characterized the genome-wide chromatin architecture at bulk and single-cell resolution, applying sci-ATAC-seq on whole 24-hpf stage zebrafish embryos, generating accessibility profiles for ∼23,000 single nuclei. We developed a genome segmentation method, ScregSeg (single-cell regulatory landscape segmentation), for defining regulatory programs, and candidate CREs, specific to one or more cell types. We integrated the ScregSeg output with bulk measurements for histone post-translational modifications and 3D genome organization and identified new regulatory principles between chromatin modalities prevalent during zebrafish development. Sci-ATAC-seq profiling of npas4l / cloche mutant embryos identified novel cellular roles for this hematovascular transcriptional master regulator and suggests an intricate mechanism regulating its expression. Our work defines regulatory architecture and principles in the zebrafish embryo and establishes a resource of cell-type-specific genome-wide regulatory annotations and candidate CREs, providing a valuable open resource for genomics, developmental, molecular, and computational biology.

Abstract:
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive cognitive decline, yet its epigenetic underpinnings remain elusive. Here, we generate and integrate single-cell epigenomic and transcriptomic profiles of 3.5 million cells from 384 postmortem brain samples across 6 regions in 111 AD and control individuals. We identify over 1 million candidate cis -regulatory elements (cCREs), organized into 123 regulatory modules across 67 cell subtypes. We define large-scale epigenomic compartments and single-cell epigenomic information and delineate their dynamics in AD, revealing widespread epigenome relaxation and brain-region-specific and cell-type-specific epigenomic erosion signatures during AD progression. These epigenomic stability dynamics are closely associated with cell-type proportion changes, glial cell-state transitions, and coordinated epigenomic and transcriptomic dysregulation linked to AD pathology, cognitive impairment, and cognitive resilience. This study provides critical insights into AD progression and cognitive resilience, presenting a comprehensive single-cell multiomic atlas to advance the understanding of AD.

Abstract:
CRISPR-based gene activation (CRISPRa) is a strategy for upregulating gene expression by targeting promoters or enhancers in a tissue/cell-type specific manner. Here, we describe an experimental framework that combines highly multiplexed perturbations with single-cell RNA sequencing (sc-RNA-seq) to identify cell-type-specific, CRISPRa-responsive cis- regulatory elements and the gene(s) they regulate. Random combinations of many gRNAs are introduced to each of many cells, which are then profiled and partitioned into test and control groups to test for effect(s) of CRISPRa perturbations of both enhancers and promoters on the expression of neighboring genes. Applying this method to a library of 493 gRNAs targeting candidate cis- regulatory elements in both K562 cells and iPSC-derived excitatory neurons, we identify gRNAs capable of specifically upregulating intended target genes and no other neighboring genes within 1 Mb, including gRNAs yielding upregulation of six autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) risk genes in neurons. A consistent pattern is that the responsiveness of individual enhancers to CRISPRa is restricted by cell type, implying a dependency on either chromatin landscape and/or additional trans- acting factors for successful gene activation. The approach outlined here may facilitate large-scale screens for gRNAs that activate genes in a cell type-specific manner.

Date: 2025-05-21

Abstract:
Advances in single‐cell and spatial omics technologies have revolutionised biology by revealing the diverse molecular states of individual cells and their spatial organization within tissues. The field of plant biology has widely adopted single‐cell transcriptome and chromatin accessibility profiling and spatial transcriptomics, which extend traditional cell biology and genomics analyses and provide unique opportunities to reveal molecular and cellular dynamics of tissues. Using these technologies, comprehensive cell atlases have been generated in several model plant species, providing valuable platforms for discovery and tool development. Other emerging technologies related to single‐cell and spatial omics, such as multiomics, lineage tracing, molecular recording, and high‐content genetic and chemical perturbation phenotyping, offer immense potential for deepening our understanding of plant biology yet remain underutilised due to unique technical challenges and resource availability. Overcoming plant‐specific barriers, such as cell wall complexity and limited antibody resources, alongside community‐driven efforts in developing more complete reference atlases and computational tools, will accelerate progress. The synergy between technological innovation and targeted biological questions is poised to drive significant discoveries, advancing plant science. This review highlights the current applications of single‐cell and spatial omics technologies in plant research and introduces emerging approaches with the potential to transform the field.

Abstract:
Biological processes are controlled by groups of genes acting in concert. Investigating gene–gene interactions within different cell types can help researchers understand the regulatory mechanisms behind human complex diseases, such as tumors. We collected extensive single-cell RNA-seq data from tumors, involving 563 patients with 44 different tumor types. Through our analysis, we identified various cell types in tumors and created an atlas of different immune cell subsets across different tumor types. Using the SCINET method, we reconstructed interactome networks specific to different cell types. Diverse functional data was then integrated to gain biological insights into the networks, including somatic mutation patterns and gene functional annotation. Additionally, genes with prognostic relevance within the networks were also identified. We also examined cell–cell communications to investigate how gene interactions modulate cell–cell interactions. We developed a data portal called CellNetdb for researchers to study cell-type-specific interactome networks. Our findings indicate that these networks can be used to identify genes with topological specificity in different cell types. We also found that prognostic genes can deconvolved into cell types through analyzing network connectivity. Additionally, we identified commonalities and differences in cell-type-specific networks across different tumor types. Our results suggest that these networks can be used to prioritize risk genes. This study presented CellNetdb, a comprehensive repository featuring an atlas of cell-type-specific interactome networks across 44 human tumor types. The findings underscore the utility of these networks in delineating the intricacies of tumor microenvironments and advancing the understanding of molecular mechanisms underpinning human tumors.

Abstract:
Accurate specification of female and male germ cells during embryonic development is critical for sexual reproduction. Primordial germ cells (PGCs) are the bipotential precursors of mature gametes that commit to an oogenic or spermatogenic fate in response to sex-determining cues from the fetal gonad. The critical processes required for PGCs to integrate and respond to signals from the somatic environment in gonads are not well understood. In this study, we developed the first single-nucleus multiomics map of chromatin accessibility and gene expression during murine PGC development in both XX and XY embryos. Profiling of cell-type-specific transcriptomes and regions of open chromatin from the same cell captured the molecular signatures and gene networks underlying PGC sex determination. Joint RNA and ATAC data for single PGCs resolved previously unreported PGC subpopulations and cataloged a multimodal reference atlas of differentiating PGC clusters. We discovered that regulatory element accessibility precedes gene expression during PGC development, suggesting that changes in chromatin accessibility may prime PGC lineage commitment prior to differentiation. Similarly, we found that sexual dimorphism in chromatin accessibility and gene expression increased temporally in PGCs. Combining single-nucleus sequencing data, we computationally mapped the cohort of transcription factors that regulate the expression of sexually dimorphic genes in PGCs. For example, the gene regulatory networks of XX PGCs are enriched for the transcription factors, TFAP2c, TCFL5, GATA2, MGA, NR6A1, TBX4, and ZFX. Sex-specific enrichment of the forkhead-box and POU6 families of transcription factors was also observed in XY PGCs. Finally, we determined the temporal expression patterns of WNT, BMP, and RA signaling during PGC sex determination, and our discovery analyses identified potentially new cell communication pathways between supporting cells and PGCs. Our results illustrate the diversity of factors involved in programming PGCs toward a sex-specific fate.

We generated single-cell transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility (single-cell ATAC) data of 358,237 cells from prefrontal cortex (PFC), primary motor cortex (M1) and primary visual cortex (V1) of adult female cynomolgus monkey brain, and integrated this dataset with Stereo-seq (spatial enhanced resolution omics-sequencing) of the corresponding cortical areas to assign topographic information to molecular states. We identified area-specific chromatin accessible sites and their targeted genes, including the cell type-specific transcriptional regulatory network associated with excitatory neurons heterogeneity. We reveal calcium ion transport and axon guidance genes related to specialized functions of PFC and M1, identified the similarities and differences between adult macaque and human oligodendrocyte trajectories, and mapped the genetic variants and gene perturbations of human diseases to NHP cortical cells. This resource establishes a transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility combinatory regulatory landscape at a single-cell and spatially resolved resolution in NHP cortex.

Abstract:
Despite significant progress in annotating the genome with experimental methods, much of the regulatory noncoding genome remains poorly defined. Here we assert that regulatory elements may be characterized by leveraging local epigenomic signatures where specific transcription factors (TFs) are bound. To link these two features, we introduce IMPACT, a genome annotation strategy that identifies regulatory elements defined by cell-state-specific TF binding profiles, learned from 515 chromatin and sequence annotations. We validate IMPACT using multiple compelling applications. First, IMPACT distinguishes between bound and unbound TF motif sites with high accuracy (average AUPRC 0.81, SE 0.07; across 8 tested TFs) and outperforms state-of-the-art TF binding prediction methods, MocapG, MocapS, and Virtual ChIP-seq. Second, in eight tested cell types, RNA polymerase II IMPACT annotations capture more cis -eQTL variation than sequence-based annotations, such as promoters and TSS windows (25% average increase in enrichment). Third, integration with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) summary statistics from European (N = 38,242) and East Asian (N = 22,515) populations revealed that the top 5% of CD4 + Treg IMPACT regulatory elements capture 85.7% of RA h2, the most comprehensive explanation for RA h2 to date. In comparison, the average RA h2 captured by compared CD4 + T histone marks is 42.3% and by CD4 + T specifically expressed gene sets is 36.4%. Lastly, we find that IMPACT may be used in many different cell types to identify complex trait associated regulatory elements.

Abstract:
Chromatin-associated proteins (CAPs), including over 1,600 transcription factors, bind directly or indirectly to the genomic DNA to regulate gene expression and determine a myriad of cell types. Mapping their genome-wide binding and co-binding landscape is essential towards a mechanistic understanding of their functions in gene regulation and resulting cellular phenotypes. However, due to the lack of techniques that effectively scale across proteins and biological samples, their genome-wide binding profiles remain challenging to obtain, particularly in primary cells. Here we present Chromnitron, a multimodal foundation model that accurately predicts CAP binding landscapes across hundreds of proteins in unseen cell types. Via in silico perturbation experiments, we show that the model learned principles of CAP binding from multimodal features including DNA sequence motifs, chromatin accessibility levels, and protein functional domains. Applying Chromnitron to study cell fate transitions, we discovered novel CAPs regulating the T cell exhaustion process. Furthermore, Chromnitron can predict the dynamic CAP binding landscapes during development, revealing the global orchestration of protein and regulatory element activities in neurogenesis. We expect Chromnitron to accelerate discovery and engineering in regulatory genomics, particularly in human primary cells, and empower future therapeutic opportunities.

Abstract:
Determining the epigenetic program that generates unique cell types in the kidney is critical for understanding cell-type heterogeneity during tissue homeostasis and injury response. Here, we profile open chromatin and gene expression in developing and adult mouse kidneys at single cell resolution. We show critical reliance of gene expression on distal regulatory elements (enhancers). We reveal key cell type-specific transcription factors and major gene-regulatory circuits for kidney cells. Dynamic chromatin and expression changes during nephron progenitor differentiation demonstrates that podocyte commitment occurs early and is associated with sustained Foxl1 expression. Renal tubule cells follow a more complex differentiation, where Hfn4a is associated with proximal and Tfap2b with distal fate. Mapping single nucleotide variants associated with human kidney disease implicates critical cell types, developmental stages, genes, and regulatory mechanisms. The single cell multi-omics atlas reveals key chromatin remodeling events and gene expression dynamics associated with kidney development.
