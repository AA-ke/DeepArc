The arrangement (syntax) of transcription factor (TF) binding motifs is an important part of the cis-regulatory code, yet remains elusive. We introduce a deep learning model, BPNet, that uses DNA sequence to predict base-resolution chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-nexus binding profiles of pluripotency TFs. We develop interpretation tools to learn predictive motif representations and identify soft syntax rules for cooperative TF binding interactions. Strikingly, Nanog preferentially binds with helical periodicity, and TFs often cooperate in a directional manner, which we validate using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-induced point mutations. Our model represents a powerful general approach to uncover the motifs and syntax of cis-regulatory sequences in genomics data.

Understanding the cis-regulatory code of the genome is vital for understanding when and where genes are expressed and how genetic variation and somatic mutations affect disease. Despite extensive efforts to map millions of putative enhancers in a wide variety of cell types and tissues $^{1-3}$ , identification of the critical bases that alter their regulatory information remains a major challenge. It is known that short sequence motifs are critical for the binding of sequence-specific TFs, but how motif combinations and their syntactic arrangements influence TF binding in vivo is not well understood. For example, two or more strictly spaced motifs may form composite motifs that provide a platform for DNA-mediated cooperativity between the corresponding TFs $^4$ . However, whether less strict (soft) motif spacing preferences exist within enhancers and influence TF cooperativity is not clear. The precise rules of the cis-regulatory code remain to be elucidated.

Experimental manipulations of enhancer sequences, such as mutations or synthetic designs, strongly support the existence of motif syntax $^{5-12}$ . However, genome-wide analyses have rarely identified statistically over-represented motif syntax rules, questioning whether they exist and impose evolutionarily constraints on enhancer function $^{13-17}$ . One limitation is that motif instances are typically identified as over-represented sequences matching position weight matrix (PWM) models $^{18-21}$ . When patterns are discovered computationally $^{22-28}$ , they are difficult to validate experimentally and the mechanism by which they might affect TF cooperativity is not clear. For example, over-represented instances of strict motif spacings are sometimes associated with retrotransposons that contain multiple TF-binding motifs $^{23,24}$ . On the other hand, when experimental TF binding data are available—that is, from ChIP experiments coupled to sequencing (ChIP-seq) $^{29-34}$ , inference of motif syntax is still limited by the low resolution of putative binding events identified using peak-callers $^{29-34}$ .

There is hence a critical need for a general method that can identify cis-regulatory motif syntax based on genome-wide experimental

data. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently been applied to accurately predict diverse molecular phenotypes, including TF binding from DNA sequence $^{35-38}$ . The advantage of CNNs is that they can learn flexible predictive models composed of hierarchical layers of arbitrarily complex, nonlinear pattern detectors, to capture de novo sequence motifs and their higher-order organizational context without making strong biological assumptions. However, the complexity of these models makes them particularly challenging to interpret. While several methods have been developed to visualize TF-binding motifs from trained  $\mathrm{CNNs}^{35,36,38-42}$ , methods for extracting the rules by which motif syntax informs TF binding are lacking $^{43}$ .

Another critical limitation is the resolution of current CNN models. State-of-the-art models of TF binding predict binary binding events $^{35-37}$  or low-resolution continuous binding signal averaged across windows of 100-200 base pairs  $(\mathrm{bp})^{44}$ . This can limit the ability to learn motif syntax that promotes TF cooperativity $^{43}$ , which probably exists in ChIP-seq experiments. For example, TFs sometimes bind indirectly to motifs of other TFs $^{16,24,45-47}$ . TF cooperativity is even more apparent when the resolution of ChIP-seq is improved by the addition of an exonuclease digestion step (ChIP-exo) $^{48}$ . ChIP-exo methods such as ChIP-nexus generate base-resolution footprints precisely over the motif instances bound by the TF in vivo $^{49,50}$ , and these footprints differ between motifs bound directly and indirectly $^{50,51}$ . ChIP-nexus profiles have also provided evidence that TFs may help the binding of another TF nearby $^{52}$ . Although the full extent of TF cooperativity at the level of binding is not known, these results indicate that ChIP-seq data, and especially ChIP-nexus data, are a useful readout for cis-regulatory motif syntax if the data are modeled at sufficiently high resolution.

To discover motif syntax, we developed a new CNN called BPNet that models the relationship between cis-regulatory sequence and TF binding profiles at base resolution. We studied the pluripotency TFs Oct4, Sox2, Nanog and Klf4 in the well-characterized mouse

embryonic stem cell (ESC) model, generating ChIP-nexus data for maximum resolution. We trained base-resolution BPNet models on these ChIP-nexus profiles with high predictive performance, on par with concordance between replicate experiments. We extended model interpretation methods to extract new motif representations that are not based on statistical over-representation but directly summarize the predictive influence on TF binding. We then developed methods that use the trained BPNet model as an in silico oracle to measure how the distance between motif pairs affects TF cooperativity. We find that strict motif spacings in the genome are mainly due to retrotransposons, but that TF cooperativity depends on preferential soft motif syntax that is in agreement with experimentally characterized protein-protein or nucleosome interactions in ESCs. We also observe unexpected rules of TF binding cooperativity, including a broad preference for Nanog to bind DNA with helical periodicity, and perform experimental validations.

These results suggest that end-to-end neural network models trained on high-resolution genomics data, coupled with a dedicated suite of interpretation tools, can serve as a powerful tool for discovery of the critical bases within cis-regulatory sequences and identification of the underlying motif syntax associated with TF cooperativity.

# Results

BPNet predicts TF binding profiles from sequence. We performed ChIP-nexus experiments for Oct4, Sox2, Nanog and Klf4 in mouse ESCs and obtained genome-wide, strand-specific base-resolution profiles for each TF (Fig. 1a). As shown for previous TF ChIP-nexus data $^{49}$ , the profiles at known TF-binding motifs show consistent stereotypical footprints across various genomic regions, as illustrated by the binding of Oct4 and Sox2 to the composite Oct4-Sox2 motif $^{53}$  (Fig. 1b). These footprints not only had higher resolution compared to ChIP-seq data, but also displayed increased motif specificity. For example, the Sox2 motif showed a sharp ChIP-nexus footprint for Sox2 but not for Oct4, while ChIP-seq data showed binding signal for both (Fig. 1c). We identified 147,974 genomic regions of 1-kb length exhibiting statistically significant and reproducible enrichment of ChIP-nexus signal for Oct4, Sox2, Nanog or Klf4.

In contrast to all current deep learning models for TF binding, we designed BPNet to provide direct prediction of the raw base-resolution binding profiles from DNA sequence. Binding profiles can be decomposed into the total signal (read counts) and the profile shape (base-resolution distribution of reads). We reasoned that the profile shape should be predictable from 1-kb genomic sequences, since minimal enhancer activity can typically be reproduced outside its genomic context with sequences of  $<500$  bases[54,55]. The total signal, however, could be influenced by factors that are not modeled, including chromatin state and higher-order chromatin organization.

To achieve high prediction accuracy, BPNet was designed with the following properties (Fig. 1d). (1) BPNet is a CNN that uses filters of 25-bp width in the first convolutional layer to scan the 1-kb region for relevant sequence motifs, followed by nine dilated convolutional layers with residual skip connections[56,57] and exponential dilation in every layer[44,58] to learn increasingly complex predictive sequence patterns with a 1-kb receptive field. To preserve base resolution, pooling is not used. (2) BPNet uses multitask learning to jointly train on the strand-specific ChIP-nexus profiles of all four TFs. (3) Experimental control data are used as an auxiliary input (protein-attached chromatin capture (PATCH-CAP) for ChIP-nexus data[59]). The signal from this track is regressed out during training, which prevents BPNet from learning these experimental biases. (4) BPNet uses a multiscale loss function for separate evaluation of the predictions of profile shape (using a multinomial negative log-likelihood loss) and total read counts (using a mean-squared error loss). Model training, hyperparameter

tuning and performance evaluation were performed on different sets of genomic regions in distinct chromosomes.

To evaluate predictive performance, we inspected individual enhancers located on held-out test chromosomes such as those associated with the genes Lefty1 (ref. 60), Zfp281 (ref. 61) and Sall1 (refs. 62,63) and found that the predicted and observed ChIP-nexus profiles were noticeably similar, with highly concordant summits of footprints (Fig. 1e and Extended Data Fig. 1a). We then systematically compared the positions of high ChIP-nexus counts between predicted versus observed profiles in all regions of the held-out test set. Strikingly, the positional concordance at resolutions ranging  $1 - 10\mathrm{bp}$  was on par with replicate experiments and substantially better than randomized profiles, average profiles and the control track (PATCH-CAP) (Fig. 1f). Other measures of profile concordance confirmed the high prediction performance (Extended Data Fig. 1b). We also confirmed that the mappability of regions did not bias the predictions (Supplementary Fig. 1). These results show that BPNet accurately learned to predict the ChIP-nexus binding profiles of all four TFs from DNA sequence.

To identify key components for the high-prediction performance, we systematically varied the network architecture (Fig. 1g and Extended Data Fig. 1c-e). We found that the large number of convolutional layers was critical for prediction of all four ChIP-nexus datasets and was particularly important for Nanog (Fig. 1g). This indicates that the learned sequence patterns required to predict ChIP-nexus profiles span over larger sequence regions beyond individual motifs[64], especially in the case of Nanog. We also found that the relative priority of the profile versus total count prediction tasks during training affected prediction performance. Up-weighting the profile prediction task improved the performance of profile predictions. However, irrespective of relative task weight, the model's performance for total count prediction  $(R_{\mathrm{s}} = 0.62)$  did not match replicate concordance  $(R_{\mathrm{s}} = 0.94$  ; Extended Data Fig. 1f). These results are consistent with our assumption that longer sequences or other measurements, such as local chromatin state, may be required for optimal prediction of total TF occupancy[64], but that local sequence context  $(1\mathrm{kb})$  is sufficient for accurate prediction of the shape of ChIP-nexus profiles.

A suite of model interpretation tools for TF-binding motifs. We next set out to extract the sequence features that were predictive of TF binding from the trained BPNet model. We extended our previously developed tool DeepLIFT $^{65}$  to quantify the contribution of each base within an input sequence to the entire predicted ChIP-nexus profile of each TF (Fig. 2a; Methods). These TF-specific contribution scores are illustrated at the distal Oct4 enhancer, where all four TFs show strong predicted footprints matching the observed ChIP-nexus footprints (Fig. 2b (top) and Supplementary Fig. 2a).

Subsequences with high contribution scores, which we call seqlets, often resemble TF-binding motifs (Fig. 2b, middle). One prominent seqlet matches the composite Oct4-Sox2 motif, which has previously been mapped to this exact position in the Oct4 enhancer[66]. This motif has high contribution scores for Oct4 and Sox2, which are directly bound to the motif, and slightly lower scores for Nanog and Klf4 (Fig. 2b, middle), indicating that the Oct4-Sox2 motif could be indirectly important for the binding of other TFs.

Other seqlets did not readily match known motifs. For example, we found a TGAT sequence in the middle of the Nanog footprint (highlighted in Fig. 2a, middle), but it was unclear whether this is a Nanog motif since previous reports on its consensus are conflicting $^{47,67-72}$ . These results demonstrate the ability of contribution scores to highlight TF-binding motifs, but also indicate the need to identify and characterize the motifs more systematically.

Next, we used TF-Modisco $^{41}$  to systematically discover and summarize recurring predictive sequence patterns into consolidated

Fig. 1 | BPNet predicts ChIP-nexus signal at base resolution. a, ChIP-nexus experiments were performed on Oct4, Sox2, Nanog and Klf4 in mouse ESCs. After digestion of the  $5^{\prime}$  DNA ends with lambda exonuclease, strand-specific stop sites were mapped to the genome at base resolution. Bound sites exhibit a distinct footprint of aligned reads, where the positive (+) strand peak occurs many bases before the negative (-) strand peak. b, Profile heatmaps of Oct4 and Sox2 ChIP-nexus data at the 500 Oct4-Sox2 motifs with the most ChIP-nexus reads (color depth for each strand represents normalized signal intensity). c, Average Oct4 and Sox2 ChIP-nexus footprints and ChIP-seq profiles at the 500 Oct4-Sox2 or Sox2 motifs with the most reads. The ChIP-nexus data have higher resolution and show less unspecific binding of Oct4 to the Sox2 motif. d, Architecture of the convolutional neural network (BPNet) that was trained to simultaneously predict ChIP-nexus read counts at each strand for all TFs from 1-kb DNA sequences, while being prevented from learning information already explained by a bias track (PATCH-CAP control). e, Observed (Obs) and predicted (Pred) ChIP-nexus read counts for the Lefty enhancer located on held-out test chromosome 8. f, BPNet predicts the positions of high ChIP-nexus signal within the profiles at replicate-level accuracy as measured by area under the precision-recall curve (auPRC) at resolutions from 1 to 10 bp in held-out test chromosomes 1, 8 and 9. Results for the average ChIP-nexus profile, PATCH-CAP control profile and a randomized profile are shown as control. g, More convolutional layers (x axis) increase the number of input bases considered for profile prediction at each position (receptive field), and this yields increasingly more accurate profile shape predictions on the tuning chromosomes 2-4 (measured in auPRC as above), showing that larger sequence context is important.


motifs from the sequences of all bound regions and their associated base-resolution contribution scores. For each TF, TF-Modisco uses contribution scores to identify, align and cluster seqlets across all bound sequences into consolidated motifs (Fig. 2c). For each cluster, a new motif representation called contribution weight matrix (CWM) is derived by averaging the contribution scores of each of the four possible bases at every position across the seqlets. A more traditional position frequency matrix (PFM) representation, which contains the normalized base frequencies rather than the average

contribution scores, is also calculated (the Supplementary Note gives further details on CWMs and PFMs/PWMs).

TF-Modisco discovered 51 motifs, but 18 of these had unusually long PFMs  $(>40\mathrm{bp})$  with high information content (30-100 bits) (Fig. 2d and Extended Data Fig. 2a). This implies that the genomic instances of these motifs share near identical base composition across the entire length of the pattern (despite being discovered by using only uniquely mappable ChIP-nexus reads). Indeed, we found that the majority of them  $(>80\%)$  overlapped with annotated repeat elements

(Extended Data Fig. 2b). The most common were long-terminal repeats of endogenous retrotransposon viruses (ERVs), including those of the ERVK, ERVL and the ERVL-MaLR family (Extended Data Fig. 2c). Remarkably, the corresponding CWM representations of these long PFMs were quite different. Rather than long stretches of uniformly over-represented bases, the CWMs highlighted the shorter subsequences predictive of TF binding (Fig. 2d and Extended Data Fig. 2c). This difference between CWM and PFM representations provides a means to discover and pinpoint bound motifs within retrotransposons.

The remaining 33 motifs were all interpretable TF-binding motifs but contained subsets with subtle differences, leading us to select 11 representative motifs for further analysis (Extended Data Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 3). These motifs include the well-known Oct4-Sox2, Sox2 and Klf4 motifs, as well as the Zic3 and Esrrb motifs, which bind pluripotency TFs that we did not profile. All motifs were overall robustly discovered by TF-Modisco from five different BPNet models trained on different subsets of ChIP-nexus peak regions (Supplementary Fig. 4).

Using the 11 representative motifs, we then comprehensively mapped and labeled all predictive motif instances in the bound genomic regions. We scanned the base-resolution contribution scores of all regions and annotated predictive motif instances that had high contribution scores and high match scores to the CWM (Fig. 2c). In total, we obtained 241,005 unique motif instances in the 147,974 genomic regions, with Klf4 motifs occurring most frequently (Fig. 2e). Altogether, 72,696 regions  $(48.1\%)$  have at least three motif instances while 20,352  $(13.5\%)$  have at least five (Fig. 2f). These genome-wide motif annotations are in agreement with motif instances supported by previous independent validation experiments[73-75] (Supplementary Fig. 2b-d) and provide a strong foundation for analysis of genome-wide motif syntax and the characterization of known functional enhancers in mouse ESCs (Fig. 2b, bottom and Supplementary Fig. 5).

The motif maps derived from BPNet outperformed those obtained by traditional approaches such as PWM scanning, assessed by ChIP-nexus footprint height (Extended Data Fig. 3 and Supplementary Note). BPNet correctly identified more motif instances supported by footprints in sequences from held-out test chromosomes than either MEME $^{18-21}$  or HOMER $^{76}$ , especially for the short Nanog motif. The improved performance was achieved because PWM-based motif scanning methods compute match scores using only sequence similarity while the BPNet method also incorporates predictive contribution scores derived from the entire 1-kb sequence (Supplementary Fig. 6). The higher motif accuracy requires training of BPNet on base-resolution profiles rather than coarse-resolution binary (bound versus unbound) labels

(Supplementary Note and Extended Data Fig. 4). This suggests that BPNet leverages the profiles to learn the importance of motif instances in their larger sequence context, thereby reducing the false discovery rate.

Our method also outperformed traditional methods when using an independent, previously published, assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (ATAC)-seq dataset[7] for evaluation. After induced depletion of Oct4 or Sox2, regions with differential chromatin accessibility (as defined by the authors) overlapped more Oct4-Sox2 and Sox2 motif instances ranked by BPNet contribution scores than those ranked by motif scores from either MEME or HOMER (Fig. 2g and Supplementary Fig. 7a). These results support the high accuracy of BPNet-mapped motif instances relative to those obtained from traditional motif discovery and scanning methods. They also confirm the link between the in vivo binding of Oct4 and Sox2 and their effect on chromatin accessibility.

Finally, we found that the quantitative changes in ATAC-seq signal following Oct4 and Sox2 depletion can also be accurately predicted from BPNet TF binding models. Specifically, linear models trained using the sequence features encoded in the final convolutional layer of the BPNet model were able to accurately predict differential accessibility (Fig. 2h). These models outperformed linear models trained using only the inferred motif instances (Supplementary Fig. 7b). Our results indicate that the complete sequence representation learned by BPNet encodes predictive features beyond the linear, additive effects of the motif instances. Hence, we set out to identify higher-order sequence features such as motif syntax.

Composite motifs and indirect binding footprints. As a first step towards identifying motif syntax, we inspected the motifs identified by TF-Modisco for composite motifs, the simplest form of motif syntax. Indeed, we discovered not only the Sox2 motif and the monomeric Oct4 motif $^{78}$ , but also the composite Oct4-Oct4 motif (Fig. 3a), a near-palindromic motif that resembles the MORE and PORE motifs bound by Oct4 homodimers $^{79,80}$ . This motif has not previously been shown to be bound in ESCs in vivo, but is known to be important during neuronal differentiation $^{81}$ . Finally we rediscovered the Oct4-Sox2 motif, in which the bases with high contribution scores correspond to the specific DNA contacts made by the heterodimer (based on the Oct1-Sox2 crystal structure) $^{53,82,83}$  (Fig. 3a). Thus, we discovered composite motifs that are consistent with known structural data.

We did not identify the composite Sox2-Nanog motif $^{71}$  and found no evidence that this motif was bound in our ChIP-nexus data (Supplementary Fig. 8a). Instead, we identified three Nanog motifs: Nanog, Nanog-alt and Nanog-mix, the last of which is partially similar to the first two. All have a main footprint around a

From the predicted ChIP-nexus profile for each TF (top), DeepLIFT derives TF-specific profile contribution scores (middle). Regions with high contribution scores (called seqlets) resemble TF-binding motifs. Seqlets are annotated by scanning the contribution scores with motifs discovered by TF-Modisco (bottom). c, To discover motifs, TF-Modisco scans for seqlets, extends the seqlets to 70 bp, performs pairwise alignments and clusters the seqlets. For each cluster, a motif is derived as CWM, obtained by averaging the contribution scores of each of the four bases at each position across all aligned seqlets. The corresponding PFM is the frequency of bases at each position. Motif instances are identified by scanning the CWM for each motif for high-scoring matches across profile contribution scores in the genomic regions. d, Example of a motif (N6) where the PFM differs from the CWMs. The PFM indicates that it is a repeat sequence (RLTR9E), while the CWM for each TF highlights the sequences that contribute to binding. e, Number of motif instances (in thousands) found in the -150,000 genomic regions for the 11 representative motifs. f, Histogram of the number of mapped motif instances found per region. g, Evaluation of mapped motifs using previously identified regions that lose ATAC-seq signal in response to either Oct4 or Sox2 depletion (but not both)[77].

Results are shown with Pearson correlation coefficient ( $R_p$ ) for test chromosomes 1, 8 and 9 that were held out during training. Supplementary Fig. 7b shows a similar model based on motif instance features.

Fig. 3 | Discovery of composite motifs and indirect binding footprints. a, The CWMs of Oct4, Oct4-Oct4, Sox2 and Oct4-Sox2 were identified by TF-Modisco as separate motifs (motif IDs are the first letter of the TF+ number—for example, O1 discovered for Oct4), highlighting its ability to identify composite motifs. The CWM of the Oct4-Sox2 composite motif correlates with the structure of Oct1 and Sox2 bound to the Oct4-Sox2 motif. For visualization, the amino acids of Oct1 and Sox2 that contact DNA are shown as solid while the atoms in the DNA bases, shown as colored spheres, are sized according to the contribution scores shown in the CWM below. b, Nanog ChIP-nexus binding footprints were associated with three Nanog motif variants (shown as CWM). For all motifs, the main footprint was found at the TCA sequence. The CWMs of Nanog-mix (N5) and Nanog-alt (N4) contain a sequence that matches the sequence AATGGGC bound by Nanog in a crystal structure $^{84}$ . The CWM of Nanog-alt contains an alternative GG. c, The representative short motifs discovered contain known motifs, new motifs  $(^{***})$  and known motifs new in this context  $(^{\star})$ . All sequence logos share the same y axis. The B-box mediates RNA polymerase III transcription $^{117,118}$  and is associated with high levels of Oct4 binding upstream and downstream of tRNA (Extended Data Fig. 5e,f). d, The average (Av.) contribution score of the motif is shown for each TF. The highest score may indicate the TF that binds directly. e, The TF average ChIP-nexus footprint better indicates whether the motif is directly bound (sharp profile, marked with gray background), indirectly bound (fuzzy profile) or not bound at all. The footprints for each TF share the same y axis. RPM, reads per million.


(AATGGGC) $^{84}$ . Given these two separate direct DNA contacts, the observed Nanog binding footprint probably represents Nanog binding as a homodimer $^{85}$ . However, since Nanog-alt contains an additional GG to the left (Fig. 3b), we cannot rule out the existence of an unknown Nanog binding partner (but not Sox2 or Pbx; Supplementary Fig. 8b,c).

The majority of composite motifs, however, came from retrotransposons. This is consistent with previous observations that retrotransposons may contain multiple ancestral TF-binding sites[86-90] (Extended Data Fig. 5a). Among all motif pairs, the top  $1\%$  most frequent distances mapped in  $83\%$  of ERVs and were often  $>20$  bp (Extended Data Fig. 5b and Supplementary Fig. 9), which exceeds the typical distance between motifs found in composite motifs that promote TF cooperativity[91,92]. This suggests that over-represented strict motif spacings alone are not a reliable indicator of functional motif syntax.

We next analyzed whether the 11 motifs showed evidence beyond strict motif spacings for mediation of cooperative TF

interactions (Fig. 3c). By inspecting the contribution scores (Fig. 3d), we found that many motifs were predicted to contribute to the binding of other TFs. Moreover, we discovered motifs of pluripotency TFs that we had not profiled, including Zic3 and Esrrb, which we validated with additional ChIP-nexus experiments (Extended Data Fig. 5c-f). Thus BPNet predicts that Oct4, Sox2, Nanog and Klf4 frequently bind, with the help of motifs from other TFs.

One explanation for this observation is that TFs may be indirectly recruited to motifs of other  $\mathrm{TFs}^{50,51}$ . We therefore inspected the average ChIP-nexus binding footprints of all TFs at all motifs (Fig. 3e). We found that TFs directly bound to their motifs showed sharp average ChIP-nexus footprints (marked in gray in Fig. 3e), but that TFs also showed broader, more fuzzy, footprints at other motifs, which we attribute to indirect binding. The level of indirect TF occupancy correlated with the contribution score for the TF (Fig. 3d,e), suggesting that indirect footprints are predicted by BPNet.

Fig. 4 | In silico motif interaction analysis reveals TF cooperativity and motif syntax. a, In the synthetic motif interaction analysis, Motif A is inserted into random sequences and the average profile for TFA is predicted by BPNet. The footprint summits are recorded (dotted lines) and the height  $(h_{\mathrm{A}})$  is measured at this position. Motif B is then inserted at a specific distance  $(d)$  from Motif A into a new set of random sequences and the average predicted footprint height is measured at the reference summit position  $(h_{\mathrm{AB}} / h_{\mathrm{A}})$  after correction of  $h_{\mathrm{AB}}$  for shoulder effects or indirect binding footprints from the nearby motif (Supplementary Fig. 10a). The interaction of Motif A and Motif B is obtained in an analogous way. The results show functions consistent with protein-range interactions between Nanog and Sox2 or nucleosome-range interactions exerted by the Oct4-Sox2 motif (bound by Oct4) on the binding of Sox2, Nanog or Klf4 on their respective motifs. Results are shown for the  $+$  orientation of the two motifs (Supplementary Fig. 10c shows all motif pair orientations and Supplementary Fig. 10b shows the frequency of motif pairs). b, In genomic motif interaction analysis, naturally occurring instances of Motif A and Motif B as determined by CWM scanning were used. The average predicted footprint height and position of TFA were measured in the presence of Motif B  $(h_{\mathrm{AB}})$  and after replacement of Motif B with random bases  $(h_{\mathrm{A}}$  at dashed lines). The same corrected footprint height fold change,  $h_{\mathrm{AB}} / h_{\mathrm{A}}$  or  $h_{\mathrm{BA}} / h_{\mathrm{B}}$  as a function of  $d$ , is used to quantify the interaction. The results from the average of all motif orientations are similar to those from synthetic motif interaction analysis. c, Quantification of the results shown in b as a heat map. Distances  $<35$  bp are shown as representative for protein-range interactions, while 70-150 bp is representative for nucleosome-range interactions. d, Odds by which two motifs are found within a specified distance from each other, divided by the odds that both would be found in proximity by chance (observed by permutation of the region index). * $P < 10^{-5}$  using Pearson's chi-squared test (Supplementary Methods). WT, wild type.


Notably, indirect footprints tended to occur in an asymmetric or directional manner (Fig. 3d,e). For example, Nanog was bound indirectly to the Sox2 motif but Sox2 was not detected at the Nanog motif. Since Sox2 and Nanog have been shown to physically interact with each other $^{71,93}$ , this suggests that these TFs indeed cooperate in some way but not through a composite motif. We therefore set out to systematically analyze how motif pairs influence cooperative binding, as a means to identify functional motif syntax.

Interpretation of BPNet reveals cooperative TF interactions. By training on base-resolution profiles, BPNet learned rules of TF cooperativity that we could extract by interrogating the trained model in silico like an oracle. We developed two complementary in silico motif interaction analysis approaches that measure how the binding of a TF to its motif is affected by a second motif as a function of their relative distance (Fig. 4, Extended Data Fig. 6 and Supplementary Fig. 10). We focused on the motifs most strongly bound by each of the four TFs: Oct4-Sox2 (bound by Oct4), Sox2,

Nanog and Klf4. The first approach uses synthetically designed sequences (Fig. 4a) while the second mutates naturally occurring nonoverlapping motifs in genomic sequences (Fig. 4b).

In the synthetic approach, Motif A is embedded in random DNA sequences and the BPNet model is used to predict the fold change in binding of TF A due to the addition of Motif B at a range of distances from Motif A (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Videos 1-6). The procedure is then repeated by anchoring Motif B and predicting the fold change in binding of TF B as a function of distance to Motif A. The robustness of the results was confirmed by the reproducibility of the patterns across five models trained independently on different subsets of regions (Supplementary Fig. 11).

Using the synthetic approach on all motif pair combinations, we observed distance-dependent cooperative TF interactions (Fig. 4a). These were distinct for each motif pair but independent of strand orientation (Supplementary Fig. 10b,c). For example, predicted Nanog binding at the Nanog motif was strongly enhanced when another Nanog motif was nearby but, interestingly, distance-dependent

enhancement exhibited a periodic pattern (Fig. 4a). A similar periodic binding dependency was observed for Nanog when a Sox2 motif was nearby. The magnitude of this interaction was strongest at close distances  $(<35\mathrm{bp})$ , and thus could be mediated by either protein-protein interactions between Sox2 and  $\mathrm{Nanog}^{71,93}$  or DNA allostery[4,94]. For larger intermotif distances, the impact on Nanog binding rapidly diminished but was still elevated further away in the presence of a Sox2 motif (but not a Nanog motif). This was not true the other way around, since Sox2 binding to its motif was not enhanced by a nearby Nanog motif (Fig. 4a). Thus, BPNet predicts that Sox2 and Nanog interact and that this cooperative interaction is directional, consistent with the indirect footprints we observed.

The motif interaction functions also suggested that the Oct4-Sox2 motif mediates its effect through increased DNA accessibility in chromatin, consistent with Oct4 and Sox2 being pioneer TFs $^{73,77,95,96}$ . First, Oct4-Sox2 strongly enhanced the predicted binding of Sox2, Nanog and, to a lesser extent, Klf4, at nucleosome-range distances of 150 bp (Fig. 4a). Second, these interactions were directional since the motifs of the other TFs did not substantially impact the predicted binding of Oct4 to the Oct4-Sox2 motif, consistent with a hierarchical requirement for pioneer TFs to arrive first and make the region accessible for other TFs. Our results therefore suggest that motifs can be classified in a given context by their strength as pioneer motifs—that is, Oct4-Sox2 is a stronger pioneer motif than Sox2.

We observed very similar distance-dependent cooperative interactions for all motif pairs using a complementary motif mutagenesis approach for genomic sequences (Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 6). Here we used the original genomic sequences and predicted the binding profile of TFA to MotifA before and after replacement of MotifB with a random sequence (Motif  $B \rightarrow$  Motif A) and vice versa. The effect sizes were less than in the synthetic approach, probably because the genomic motif instances were often of lower affinity than the ideal motifs used in the synthetic approach. It is also possible that motif mutations can be buffered by the additional motifs present in genomic sequences. However, the distance relationship and the directionality of the cooperative interactions were again very similar (Extended Data Fig. 6). These relationships can also be summarized as a heat map using distance intervals of  $<35$  and  $70-150\mathrm{bp}$ , which highlight the interactions in protein and nucleosome range, respectively (Fig. 4c).

These results suggest the existence of soft motif syntax: rather than requiring strict intermotif distances for cooperative binding, interactions between two motifs occur in a flexible but distance-dependent fashion that is specific for each motif pair. To obtain further evidence, we asked whether the preferred intermotif distances are observed in naturally occurring genomic regions. We removed retrotransposons containing strictly spaced motifs and analyzed whether motif pairs co-occur more frequently than expected by chance at certain distances (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 10b). The Nanog motifs were most strongly over-represented at short distances to Sox2 and other Nanog motifs (<35 bp), consistent with their protein-range interactions. At nucleosome distance (70–150 bp) the Oct4–Sox2 motif still co-occurred with Nanog, consistent with its pioneering role. Although BPNet is designed to capture potential motif interactions up to  $1\mathrm{kb}$  apart, we did not identify significantly over-represented motif pairs beyond 150 bp (Fig. 4d). Altogether, we detected genome-wide soft preferences for motif spacings that correspond to some extent with detected cooperative binding interactions, and thus are probably functionally relevant soft motif syntax.

Nanog binding has a strong  $\sim 10.5$ -bp periodic pattern. The most remarkable soft motif syntax we observed was a  $\sim 10.5$ -bp periodicity associated with Nanog. We first observed periodicity in the full-length CWM of the Nanog motif, which showed flanking A/T

bases in a periodic pattern (Fig. 5a). This pattern is not seen in the corresponding PFM representation, suggesting that A/T bases are not statistically over-represented but, when present, contribute strongly to Nanog binding predictions. The strong periodic pattern is confirmed in the individual contribution scores of Nanog motif instances, shown as a heat map and average contribution scores in Fig. 5b. A Fourier power spectrum analysis of contribution scores around the Nanog motif revealed strong periodicity averaging around  $10.5 \pm 0.3\mathrm{bp}$  (Fig. 5c), which falls within the observed 10-11-bp periodicity of the DNA helix observed both in vitro and in vivo[97-100]. This helical periodicity was also found for other motifs important for prediction of Nanog binding, including Nanog-mix, Nanog-alt, Sox2, Oct4-Sox2 and Zic3. However, the same motifs did not predict periodic binding for other TFs, suggesting that helical periodicity is specific for Nanog binding (Fig. 5d), consistent with its behavior in the in silico motif interaction analysis.

To obtain further evidence of this periodicity, we tested whether Nanog's soft syntax was naturally found in genomic DNA sequence. Indeed, the pairwise distance between our mapped Nanog motif instances showed a strong helical spacing preference for multiples of  $\sim 10.5\mathrm{bp}$ , independent of motif orientation (Fig. 5e). This periodicity was reproducibly inferred from five independent models on different subsets of the binding data (Supplementary Fig. 12a). Despite its presence in genomic DNA this pattern had not been discovered previously[47,67-72], presumably because it is difficult to detect with traditional methods and requires BPNet's large receptive field to learn motifs in a larger sequence context (Extended Data Fig. 7).

The in silico motif interaction analysis also predicted enhanced periodic binding cooperativity of Nanog in the presence of other motifs. In support of this, the mapped genomic distances between Nanog and either Sox2 or Oct4-Sox2 motif instances also showed strong preferred distances of helical periodicity regardless of motif orientation (Fig. 5f-g). This was also true for the distances between Nanog and Zic3, indicating that Zic3 is an additional interaction partner (Fig. 5h). Furthermore, the Nanog ChIP-nexus profiles themselves also showed this periodic pattern (Fig. 5i-k and Supplementary Figs. 12b and 13). The signal in the original data probably explains how BPNet was able to learn the preferred binding pattern of Nanog during training.

The helical periodicity suggests that Nanog binding is enhanced when the relevant partner motifs are found on the same side of the DNA. Since Nanog physically interacts with Sox2 (refs. 71,93) and preferentially interacts at protein-protein distance in our in silico motif interaction analysis, it is possible that Nanog engages in cooperative protein-protein interactions similar to those observed for the lambda and lac repressors[101,102]. Alternatively, helical periodicity could be due to preferred binding of Nanog to nucleosomal DNA from the solvent surface, which has been observed for some homeodomain TFs[103,104].

Altogether, we identified helical periodicity as a strong cis-regulatory motif syntax for Nanog, a biophysical parameter on which BPNet was not explicitly trained. This result demonstrates the power of neural networks in discovering new patterns de novo without making explicit assumptions about the nature of the sequence features.

CRISPR validates the motif syntax between Nanog and Sox2. To experimentally validate the motif syntax identified by BPNet, we performed targeted point mutations in mapped motifs and compared the observed changes in ChIP-nexus profiles to those predicted by BPNet (Fig. 6). Since the most striking motif syntax was the helical periodicity of Nanog and the directional cooperativity with Sox2, and since the Nanog motif had previously been uncertain[47,67-72], we selected a genomic region that has a Nanog and a Sox2 motif, as well as periodic Nanog binding. Using CRISPR/Cas9 and homologous recombination, we performed two-base substitutions

Fig. 5 | Pervasive helical periodicity between Nanog and partner motifs. a, The CWM, but not the PFM, of the main Nanog motif has periodically occurring contributing bases in the flanks (example in enlarged window). b, Heat map of contribution (Contrib.) scores of individual Nanog instances also shows this periodic pattern, the average (Av.) of which is shown below. c, Fourier power spectrum of average contribution score around Nanog motif instances (after subtraction of the smoothed signal) reveals an average periodicity of  $10.5 \pm 0.3$  bp. d, Fraction of the power spectrum with 10.5-bp periodicity of average contribution scores around the motifs discovered for each TF (19 for Oct4, 10 for Sox2, 19 for Nanog and 13 for Klf4) shows that helical periodicity is specific for Nanog binding. Important motifs are labeled; unlabeled high-scoring motifs are derived from retrotransposons. The box plots mark the median, upper and lower quartiles and  $1.5 \times$  interquartile range (whiskers). e, Pairwise spacing of Nanog motif instances in all possible orientations also show a periodic pattern (+ + includes the -- orientation). f-h, Heterologous motif combinations of Nanog with Sox2 (f), Oct4-Sox2 (g) and Zic3 (h) also show a preferred spacing with the same periodicity. The distance between two motifs is always kept positive by placing the second in the pair downstream of the first. All four motif orientations are considered: +, the motif lies on the forward strand; -, the motif lies on the reverse strand. i-k, Nanog ChIP-nexus signal at the reference summit position for each motif instance across every motif pair (blue dots), with the smooth curve fit (B-splines) depicted as a red line and  $95\%$  confidence intervals depicted as blue ribbons.

Nanog on average binds higher when Nanog motifs have the preferred intermotif distance.


in either the Sox2 motif (TTG to AGG) or the Nanog motif (TGA to GGC). We then performed Sox2 and Nanog ChIP-nexus experiments on wild-type and mutant ESCs using three independently derived clones per motif mutation. All replicate experiments were highly correlated and possessed indistinguishable normalized binding profiles and counts across known enhancers (Extended Data Fig. 8 and Supplementary Fig. 14).

We then examined how binding profiles were affected by mutations. As expected, mutation of the Sox2 motif specifically abolished the corresponding Sox2 binding footprint (Fig. 6a). However, mutation of the Nanog motif did not affect Sox2 binding (Fig. 6b) while mutation of the Sox2 motif strongly affected Nanog binding (Extended Data Fig. 8b). Nanog binding was almost completely

lost near the Sox2 mutation, and was still reduced at the nearby Nanog motif (Fig. 6c).

This directional cooperativity is strikingly consistent with the results from the in silico motif interaction analysis performed across all genomic sequences (Fig. 4b), and with the asymmetry observed in the indirect binding footprints of Nanog and Sox2 (Fig. 3c). In addition, the short-range cooperativity of Nanog was confirmed. Namely, when the Nanog motif was mutated, not only was the corresponding footprint of Nanog abrogated as expected but the surrounding periodic Nanog binding was also reduced as predicted (Fig. 6d).

Altogether, these results confirm that the derived syntax rules are predictive and applicable to individual examples, demonstrating that BPNet can be used to derive new, testable biological

hypotheses on how the cis-regulatory motif syntax influences TF binding.

# Discussion

Here we introduce BPNet, a versatile and interpretable deep learning tool to learn TF motifs and the rules of syntax that best predict experimental data at base resolution. To leverage the unprecedented resolution of BPNet and showcase its ability to reveal new biological insights, we applied it to ChIP-nexus data in ESCs. The results were not only consistent with previous findings, but revealed new details and principles of cis-regulatory motif syntax. We found that TF binding is guided by soft syntax rules, which follow clear intermotif, distance-dependent relationships consistent with protein-protein interactions $^{16,105}$  or nucleosome-mediated cooperativity $^{106}$ . Such soft syntax rules represent an intermediate between the strict motif syntax associated with the original enhanceosome model $^{107,108}$  and the very flexible syntax suggested by the billboard model $^{14}$ . The TF cooperativity associated with specific motif pairs was often directional and consistent with motifs mediating the role of pioneer TFs with different strengths. Finally, we observed a strong preference for Nanog to bind with  $\sim 10.5$ -bp helical periodicity. Helical periodicity has long been thought to be a potential element of the cis-regulatory code $^{25,27,101,102,107,109-112}$ . Our finding that the helical periodicity is motif encoded and TF specific provides a guidance for identifying this feature for other TFs in the future.

As we outline below, BPNet represents a paradigm for discovering relevant motifs and syntax rules underlying the cis-regulatory code. Through several important design innovations

(Supplementary Note), as well as extensive quality control and rigorous evaluations to ensure that the method works as intended, BPNet outperforms both traditional methods and previous deep learning models (Supplementary Note). BPNet outperforms traditional methods because it infers predictive patterns in a larger sequence context and is not reliant on over-represented sequence patterns. BPNet outperforms previous neural networks by modeling TF binding profiles at base resolution, which enables it to learn subtle cooperative interactions between motifs (Extended Data Fig. 4). The result is a powerful and general computational framework for deciphering the cis-regulatory code from a variety of genomics assays.

An important innovation was the development of tools that make the trained BPNet model interpretable. Computational models in regulatory genomics have long grappled with an inherent trade-off between prediction accuracy and interpretability, but the BPNet framework enables both. The key to enhancing interpretability was the distillation of predictive motif representations and context-aware motif instances from the entire neural network, rather than direct interpretation of millions of cryptic, partially redundant, parameters of the trained model. Importantly, by using BPNet as an in silico oracle, we systematically predicted the effect of mutated sequences or synthetic sequence designs, which enables us to extract the influence of pairwise motif spacing on TF cooperativity. The precise oracle predictions, which are not possible with classical models, allow less scalable in vivo experiments such as the CRISPR editing experiments to be performed on the most interesting and promising observations.

The advantage of BPNet over classical methods is that it detects motifs and their syntax in a fundamentally different way. Classical methods for motif discovery rely on motifs being over-represented compared to background sequences[18-21]. Similarly, existing approaches to infer syntax rules use summary statistics of over-represented co-occurrence patterns[1,23,113]. These methods have limited statistical power to test individual features present in complex cis-regulatory sequences (Supplementary Note). By contrast, BPNet's vast network capacity allows it to learn complex predictive rules agnostically based on their ability to accurately predict relevant experimental profiles, without explicitly defining features a priori. This allows the discovery of relatively rare but nonetheless predictive motifs (for example, Oct4-Oct4), as well as predictive syntax features, such as helical periodicity or the direction of TF cooperativity, that were not known to be relevant for these TFs.

The BPNet approach of modeling the entire cis-regulatory sequence is better suited for deciphering the combinatorial requirements for TF binding in vivo. Traditionally, a TF-binding site is defined by its strong affinity in in vitro experiments or by statistically significant sequence matches to PWM models. In both cases, a selection is typically made by arbitrary thresholds before the role of motif combinations, syntax and sequence context is considered[113,114]. However, our results suggest that, in vivo, TF binding to a motif instance is by itself a highly cooperative process that depends on neighboring motifs and syntax. Indeed, this explains how enhancer function can be critically dependent on low-affinity binding sites[10,52,115]. The fact that BPNet discovered subtle predictive patterns that are not strong matches to PWM motif models (for example, the predictive bases in the flanks of Nanog motifs), and outperformed classical methods for identification of motif instances relevant in vivo (Fig. 2g-h and Supplementary Note), suggests that modeling putative motif instances within their cis-regulatory context is an important advantage.

Finally, BPNet is designed to be a general and versatile end-to-end approach adaptable to a number of genomic assays. It is ideally suited to learn from high-resolution genomic data, but its base-resolution output is still beneficial for lower-resolution data since it does not discard any information present in the training data profiles. For example, we successfully trained BPNet models on ChIP-seq profiles for the same TFs and obtained motifs that were highly similar, including a periodic Nanog motif (Extended Data Figs. 9 and 10 and Supplementary Note). The number and accuracy of motif instances were lower than those from ChIP-nexus profile models, but better than those from models trained on coarse-resolution binary binding labels (Extended Data Fig. 10c,d). Similarly, we found that BPNet can accurately model base-resolution DNase-seq profiles[116]. This suggests that the application of BPNet to existing compendia of ChIP-seq, DNase-seq and ATAC-seq data, such as those generated by ENCODE, will improve the systematic mapping of cis-regulatory motifs and their rules of syntax in a variety of cellular contexts. To foster the broad application of BPNet, we have made the entire software framework available with documentation and tutorials.

Learning motifs and syntax-dependent regulatory influence for a variety of genomic assays in many cell types will build a more complete understanding of the cis-regulatory code and reveal how specific bases influence the various molecular steps associated with enhancer function. At the same time, these models will provide opportunities to pinpoint causal quantitative trait- and disease-associated genetic variants and understand the molecular mechanisms by which they alter gene regulation. Ultimately, the ability to decipher the cis-regulatory code will unlock an enormous amount of information underlying organismal development and its maintenance, and pinpoint therapeutic intervention opportunities for diseases.

# Methods

Cell culture. R1 ESCs were cultured on  $0.1\%$  gelatin-coated plates without feeder cells in N2B27 medium (DMEM/F12 with 1:1 mix of GlutaMax/N2 and Neurobasal medium/B27, Invitrogen) supplemented with  $2\mathrm{mM}$  L-glutamine (Stemcell Technologies),  $1\times 2$ -mercaptoethanol (Millipore),  $1\times$  NEAA (Stemcell Technologies),  $3\mu \mathrm{M}$  CHIR99021 (Stemcell Technologies),  $1\mu \mathrm{M}$  PD0325901 (Stemcell Technologies),  $0.033\%$  BSA solution (Invitrogen) and  $10^{7}\mathrm{U}\mathrm{ml}^{-1}$  LIF (Millipore).

ChIP-nexus, PATCH-CAP and ChIP-seq experiments. For each ChIP-nexus experiment, 10 million ESCs were used. Cells were washed with PBS and cross-linked with  $1\%$  formaldehyde (Fisher Scientific) in PBS for  $10\mathrm{min}$  at room temperature. The reaction was quenched with  $125\mathrm{mM}$  glycine. Fixed cells were washed twice with cold PBS, resuspended in cold lysis buffer  $(15\mathrm{mM}$  HEPES pH 7.5,  $140\mathrm{mMNaCl},$ $1\mathrm{mM}$  EDTA,  $0.5\mathrm{mM}$  EGTA,  $1\%$  Triton X-100,  $0.5\%$  N-lauroylsarcosine,  $0.1\%$  sodium deoxycholate and  $0.1\%$  SDS), incubated for  $10\mathrm{min}$  on ice and sonicated with a Bioruptor Pico (Diagenode) for five cycles of  $30\mathrm{s}$  on and  $30\mathrm{s}$  off. The ChIP-nexus procedure and data processing were performed as previously described[49], except that the ChIP-nexus adapter mix contained four fixed barcodes (ACTG, CTGA, GACT and TGAC) and PCR library amplification was performed directly after circularization of the purified DNA fragments (without addition of the oligo and BamHI digestion). PATCH-CAP was performed as previously described[59] with  $10\%$  of sheared chromatin from 10 million ESCs. ChIP-seq experiments were performed as previously described[119] with 10 million ESCs per ChIP.

For each ChIP,  $5\mu \mathrm{g}$  of antibody was coupled to  $50\mu \mathrm{l}$  of Protein A or Protein G Dynabeads (Invitrogen). The following antibodies were used: anti-Oct3/4 (Santa Cruz, no. sc-8628), anti-Sox2 (Santa Cruz, no. sc-17320), anti-Sox2 (Active Motif, no. 39843), anti-Nanog (Santa Cruz, no. sc-30328), anti-Klf4 (R&D Systems, no. AF3158), anti-Klf4 (Abcam, no. ab106629), anti-Esrrb (Abcam, no. ab19331), anti-Pbx 1/2/3 (Santa Cruz, no. sc-888) and anti-Zic3 (Abcam, no. ab222124). For all experiments, at least two biological replicates were prepared—that is, the experiments were performed on different days starting with cells from a different passage number. Single-end sequencing was performed on either an Illumina HiSeq (50 cycles) or NextSeq 500 instrument (75 cycles).

Mutation of binding motifs using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Using mouse R1 ESCs, the predicted Nanog motif on chr10: 85,539,756-85,539,765 (mm10) was mutated from CTGATGGCT (wild type) to CGGCTGGCT (mutant). The predicted Sox2 motif on chr10: 85,539,634-85,539,643 (mm10) was mutated from CCTTTGTCC (wild type) to CCTAGGTTCC (mutant). Guide RNA target sites were designed using the CCTop target predictor tool[120] by evaluation of the predicted on-target efficiency score and off-target potential[121]. The single-stranded donor oligonucleotides (ssODN) were designed containing  $\sim 40$  bases of homology from the targeted cut site (gRNA and ssODN sequences are shown in Supplementary Table 3). A ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex was formed by combining 90 pmol of gRNA (ordered as Alt-R single-guide RNA; IDT) and 10 pmol of Cas9 HiFi protein (IDT) with hybridization for  $10\mathrm{min}$  at room temperature. The RNP was combined with 100 pmol of ssODN donor and delivered to cells by Neon electroporation (1,500 V, 10 ms, three pulses; Neon Transfection System, Model MPK5000, Life Technologies). Single cells were screened for the expected mutations through paired-end sequencing on an Illumina MiSeq instrument (250 cycles). On-target indel frequency and expected mutations were analyzed using CRIS.py[122]. Only clones with the intentional mutation and sequence alignments  $>90\%$  were chosen for future experiments.

Per target site, three monoclonal cell lines were selected and used as replicate experiments: clones B07, B09 and F10 for the mutant Nanog motif, and clones B07, B11 and C10 for the mutant Sox2 motif. For the wild-type R1 ESC control samples, at least two biological replicates were prepared as above. ChIP-nexus was performed as described above (ChIP-nexus, PATCH-CAP and ChIP-seq experiments) with 20 million ESCs and  $5\mu \mathrm{g}$  of anti-Nanog (Abcam, no. ab214549) or anti-Sox2 (Active Motif, no. 39843) per replicate. The following fixed barcodes were used: AGTC, CAGT, GTCA and TCAG. Single-end sequencing was performed on an Illumina NovaSeq instrument (100 cycles) to obtain a coverage of  $\sim 400$  million reads per experiment.

ChIP-nexus data processing pipeline. Random barcodes and fixed barcodes were trimmed off the reads and reassigned to FASTQ labels using nimnexus (v.0.1.1). The adapters were then trimmed using cutadapt (v.1.8.1) $^{123}$ . Next, the reads were aligned with Bowtie (v.1.1.12) $^{124,125}$  using the command bowtie --chunkmbs 512 -k 1 -m 1 -v 2 --best --strata to the mouse genome assembly mm10. Mutant samples were aligned to a modified mm10 genome that accommodated the CRISPR changes. Mapping statistics were computed using SAMtools flagstat (v.1.2) $^{126}$ . Reads were filtered using SAMtools view to remove unmapped reads and mates, nonprimary alignments, PCR or optical duplicates (-F 1804) and reads that failed platform or vendor quality checks or had poor mapping quality (<30 MAPQ score). Reads aligned to the same position with the same barcode, CIGAR string and the SAM flag were deduplicated using nimnexus dedup (v.0.1.1). The total number of final (filtered) aligned reads was 243 million for Oct4, 140 million for

Sox2, 214 million for Nanog and 176 million for Klf4. The final filtered BAM file was converted to tagAlign format (BED  $3 + 3$ ) using bedtools 'bamtobed' (v.2.26) $^{127}$ . Cross-correlation scores were obtained for each file using phantompeakquality (v.1.2) $^{128}$ . BigWig tracks containing the strand-specific number of aligned  $5^{\prime}$  read ends (pooled across all replicates) were generated using bedtools genomecov -5 -bg -strand  $< + / - >$ , followed by bedGraph to BigWig conversion using UCSC bedGraphToBigWig v.4 (ref. $^{129}$ ).

Peaks were called using MACS2 (v.2.1.1.20160309) by extending the  $5^{\prime}$  ends of reads on each strand using a 150-bp window  $(\pm 75\mathrm{bp})$  and then computing coverage of extended reads across both strands (shift  $= -75$ , extsize  $= 150$ ). For each TF, peak calling was performed on filtered, aligned reads from each replicate using a relaxed  $P$  threshold of 0.1 and retaining the top 300,000 peaks as described[128]. Relaxed peak calls were similarly performed on pseudoreplicates, which were obtained by pooling filtered, aligned reads from all replicates for a TF and randomly splitting the pooled reads into two balanced pseudoreplicates. Peaks overlapping the blacklisted regions listed in https://www.encodeproject.org/files/ENCFF547MET/ were excluded. The irreproducible discovery rate (IDR) framework was used to obtain reproducible peaks across the true replicates and pseudoreplicates[130]. The set with the larger number of peaks was defined as the IDR optimal peaks for each TF: 25,849 for Oct4, 10,999 for Sox2, 56,459 for Nanog and 57,601 for Klf4. Regions of 1 kb centered on the peak summits were used as inputs to BPNet. All samples passed quality control metrics used in the ENCODE TF ChIP-seq pipeline[128] (Supplementary Table 1).

The nim-nexus code is available at https://github.com/Avsecz/nimnexus/. The ChIP-nexus pipeline performing the described steps (for example, turning raw reads in FASTQ format to BigWig coverage tracks and called peaks) is available at https://github.com/kundajelab/chip-nexus-pipeline. A detailed pipeline specification is available at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h9IZ0GyVWd02RCmtaFWSaSFzrcNHoH_OgyPHMpU7b04. ChIP-seq datasets were processed using the ENCODE ChIP-seq pipeline: https://github.com/ENCODE-DCC/chip-seq-pipeline2/releases/tag/v1.2.2. This is identical to the ChIP-nexus pipeline except that it uses the SPP peak caller $^{29}$  and does not use barcodes for read dedduplication.

BPNet architecture. BPNet is a sequence-to-profile convolutional neural network that uses one-hot-encoded DNA sequence ( $A = [1,0,0,0]$ ,  $C = [0,1,0,0]$ ,  $G = [0,0,1,0]$ ,  $T = [0,0,0,1]$ ) with adjustable length as input to predict base-resolution read count profiles as output. For flexibility, the architecture of BPNet can be compartmentalized into body- and multiple task-specific output heads. The body of BPNet consists of a sequence of convolutional layers with residual skip connections and rectified linear activations[57]. The first convolutional layer uses 64 filters of width 25 bp, followed by nine dilated convolutional layers (each with 64 filters of width 3) where the dilation rate (number of skipped positions in the convolutional filter) doubles at every layer. This results in a receptive field of  $\pm 1,034$  bp for any position in the input sequence. The output of the final convolutional layer within the BPNet body (also referred to as the bottleneck activation map) serves as input for two output heads per TF: (1) a deconvolutional layer (filter width 25—a typical ChIP-nexus footprint width) predicting the strand-specific probabilities of observing a particular read at a particular position in the input sequence (shape or profile prediction); and (2) a global average pooling layer followed by the fully connected layer predicting the total number of read counts aligned to the input sequence for each strand (total read count prediction). The training occurs for all TF ChIP-nexus experiments together in a multitask fashion. BPNet architecture (without bias correction) implementation in Keras v.2.2.4 is provided in Supplementary Methods.

BPNet loss function. Let  $\mathbf{k}^{\mathrm{obs}}$  be the vector of length  $L$  of observed read counts for a particular strand and a particular task (that is, TF) along the sequence of length  $L$ . Let  $\mathbf{p}^{\mathrm{pred}}$  be the vector of length  $L$  of predicted probabilities along the sequence, such that  $\sum p_i = 1$  and let  $n^{\mathrm{obs}} = \sum k_i^{\mathrm{obs}}$  be the total number of observed counts and  $n^{\mathrm{pred}}$  the total number of predicted counts for the sequence. The following loss function is used for each sequence, strand and task:

$$
\operatorname {L o s s} = - \log \mathbf {p} _ {\text {m u l t .}} \left(\mathbf {k} ^ {\text {o b s}} | \mathbf {p} ^ {\text {p r e d}}, n ^ {\text {o b s}}\right) + \lambda \left(\log \left(1 + n ^ {\text {o b s}}\right) - \log \left(1 + n ^ {\text {p r e d}}\right)\right) ^ {2}.
$$

The first term evaluates the error in the shape of the predicted profile. It is the multinomial  $\left(\mathbf{p}_{\mathrm{mult.}}(\mathbf{k}|\mathbf{p},\mathbf{n}) = \frac{n!}{k_1!\cdots k_d!} p_1^{k_1}\dots p_d^{k_d}\right)$  negative log-likelihood of observed base read counts given the predicted probabilities and total number of observed counts. The second term evaluates the squared error of the log total number of reads in the region. During BPNet training, the total loss function is the sum of individual loss functions across both strands, all input sequences and all tasks.

The key hyperparameter is  $\lambda$ . In Supplementary Methods (relationship between Poisson log-likelihood, mean-squared error and multinomial log-likelihood), we show that if  $\lambda = \bar{n}^{\mathrm{obs}} / 2$ , where  $\bar{n}^{\mathrm{obs}}$  is the average number of total counts across all sequences in our training set, profile loss and total count loss will be given roughly equal weight. To upweight the profile predictions relative to the total count predictions,  $\lambda = \frac{\alpha}{2} n^{\mathrm{obs}}$  with  $\alpha < 1$  can be used.

Control for biases by BPNet. Experimental assays often have biases that can be measured by control experiments (input for ChIP-seq and PATCH-CAP for ChIP-nexus $^{59}$ ). To prevent the sequence-to-profile model from learning these noninformative bias signals, the model tries to explain the target experimental track (for example, the Oct4 profile) using both the sequence-based model predictions  $\mathbf{f}_{\mathrm{model}}^{h}$  (seq;  $\mathbf{w}^{h}$ ) for specific head  $h$  and the control experiment track, ctr:

$$
\mathbf {y} _ {\text {p r e d}} ^ {h} = \mathbf {f} _ {\text {m o d e l}} ^ {h} (\operatorname {s e q}; \mathbf {w} ^ {h}) + \mathbf {f} _ {\text {c t l}} ^ {h} (\operatorname {c t l}; \mathbf {w} _ {\text {c t l}} ^ {h}),
$$

where  $\mathbf{f}_{\mathrm{ctl}}^h (\mathrm{ctl};\mathbf{w}_{\mathrm{ctl}}^h)$  is a neural network-based transformation of the control track aimed at explaining data for head  $h$ . Integration with the control data therefore occurs after the task-specific model head  $\mathbf{f}_{\mathrm{model}}^h$ . We require that  $\mathbf{f}_{\mathrm{ctl}}^h (\mathrm{ctl};\mathbf{w}_{\mathrm{ctl}}^h) = 0$  if the control track is 0 (that is, bias not present) so that the model  $\mathbf{f}_{\mathrm{model}}^h$  represents the bias-free part of the signal. Each head/track will have a different bias transformation either by having different parameters,  $\mathbf{w}_{\mathrm{ctl}}^h$ , or even a different architecture for  $\mathbf{f}_{\mathrm{ctl}}^h$ . For the total count prediction head,  $\mathbf{f}_{\mathrm{ctl}}^h (\mathrm{ctl};\mathbf{w}_{\mathrm{ctl}}^h)$  is simply  $\mathbf{w}_{\mathrm{ctl}}^h\log (1 + n_{\mathrm{ctl}})$ , where  $n_{\mathrm{ctl}}$  is the total number of reads from the control experiment in the modeled local region. For the profile prediction head,  $\mathbf{f}_{\mathrm{ctl}}^h (\mathrm{ctl};\mathbf{w}_{\mathrm{ctl}}^h)$  is a weighted sum of (1) the raw counts and (2) a smoothed version of the raw counts using a sliding window sum of  $50\mathrm{bp}$  (since control data are often sparse). During model training, the parameters of  $\mathbf{f}_{\mathrm{ctl}}^h (\mathrm{ctl};\mathbf{w}_{\mathrm{ctl}}^h)$  are also trained to best explain the output using the control track. This framework readily integrates multiple control tracks, or control tracks predicted from sequence, using a bias model learned on other data such as deproteinized genomic DNA for DNase-seq[13].

BPNet training and hyperparameter tuning. ChIP-nexus profiles of Oct4, Sox2, Nanog and Klf4 were used to train and evaluate BPNet. Regions from mouse chromosomes 2, 3 and 4 (20%) were used as the tuning set for hyperparameter tuning. Regions from chromosomes 1, 8 and 9 (20%) were used as the test set for performance evaluation (Supplementary Methods). The remaining regions were used for model training. Hyperparameters were manually adjusted to yield best performance on the tuning set. All neural network models were implemented and trained in Keras (v.2.2.4)[132] (TensorFlow backend v.1.6) using the Adam optimizer[133] (learning rate = 0.004) and early stopping with patience of five epochs.

DeepLIFT contribution scores for sequence-to-profile models. DeepLIFT is a feature attribution method for computing the contribution of each base (feature) in an input sequence to a specific scalar output prediction from a neural network model[65]. DeepLIFT decomposes the difference between the output prediction from an input sequence versus that of a neutral reference input sequence as an additive combination of contribution scores of all bases ( $D$  features) in the input sequence:

$$
\mathbf {f} (\mathbf {x}) - \mathbf {f} (\mathbf {r}) = \sum_ {i} ^ {D} c _ {i}
$$

where  $c_{i}$  is the contribution of feature  $i$  in input  $\mathbf{x}$  to the model output prediction  $\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x})$  compared to model prediction  $\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{r})$  based on the reference input  $\mathbf{r}$ .

The output of BPNet for each head is, however, not a scalar, but a  $2D$  tensor of size  $L \times S$ , where  $L$  is the sequence length and  $S$  is the number of output channels or strands for ChIP-nexus. We therefore needed to adapt DeepLIFT and defined the profile contribution score of a base with respect to the entire output profile as follows:

$$
c ^ {(\text {p r o f i l e})} = \sum_ {i, s} c _ {i s} P _ {i s}
$$

where  $P_{is}$  is the predicted probability values for position  $i$  and strand  $s$ , obtained by normalizing the profile predictions on the logit scale using the softmax function along the sequence axis:  $\mathbf{p} = \mathrm{softmax}(\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}))$ .  $c_{is}$  is the contribution score of the base with respect to the (scalar) profile prediction on the logit scale at position  $i$  and strand  $s$ . A weighted sum is used to ensure that positions with high predicted profile output values are given more weight, but has the disadvantage that it would normally require the contribution scores to be computed  $L \times S$  (2,000) times for each 1-kb input sequence per TF. To drastically accelerate this computation, we exploit the backpropagation algorithm used in DeepLIFT and the additive decomposition of DeepLIFT scores. We define a new TensorFlow operation as follows:

$$
\hat {f} (\mathbf {x}) = \sum_ {i} \operatorname {C o n s t} \left(p _ {i} (\mathbf {x})\right) f _ {i} (\mathbf {x}),
$$

where Const denotes the tf.stop_gradients operation, which treats the wrapped expression  $p_{i}(\mathbf{x})$  as a constant. By applying DeepLIFT to  $\hat{f} (\mathbf{x})$ , we obtain the desired result in a single DeepLIFT backpropagation step:

$$
c ^ {(\text {p r o f i l e})} = \sum_ {i, s} c _ {i s} p _ {i s}.
$$

Pseudocode of the described operation in TensorFlow code is:

wn = tf.reduce_mean(tf.reduce_sum(tf.stop_gradients(tf. nn softmax(f, dim=-2)) * f, axis=-2), axis=-1).

For the reference input  $\mathbf{r}$ , all zeroes were used since it showed the highest correlation with in silico mutagenesis contribution scores, defined as the weighted sum of the profile prediction changes at all profile locations after introduction of a mutation at a particular position. The DeepLIFT contribution scores were computed with TensorFlow v.1.6 using the DeepExplain implementation of DeepLIFT (repository fork available at https://github.com/kundajelab/DeepExplain/, with commit hash: 738c7145e915a7a48f3a4248d088bcc2e1a94614).

Motif discovery using TF-Modisco. TF-Modisco (v.0.5.1.1) was run on DeepLIFT profile contribution scores for each TF separately (using all 1-kb peak regions bound by the TF on autosomes). Significant seqlets were selected by computing contribution scores over a width of 21 bp and using the false-discovery rate threshold of 0.01 (target_seqlet_fdr). The null distribution was estimated from 4,800 randomly selected peaks with contribution scores computed on reshuffled sequences while preserving dinucleotide counts. A total of 145,748 nonoverlapping significant seqlets were identified. Due to memory constraints (250 GB), 50,000 seqlets were used for each TF during the clustering/motif-discovery phase of TF-Modisco. For all discovered motifs, PFM and CWM are computed from the aligned seqlets by averaging the base frequencies and contribution scores, respectively (Supplementary Methods).

Clustering of discovered motifs. Motifs were aligned to each other in all possible offsets and strand combinations, and a pairwise distance metric was generated using the smallest continuous Jaccard distance metric on the PFM information content between each motif pair. Hierarchical clustering was performed in scipy (v.1.2.1) using the Ward variance minimization algorithm $^{134}$  (method='ward') and optimal leaf ordering $^{135}$  (Extended Data Fig. 2d). From these clusters, 11 representative TF motifs were manually selected.

Identification of motif instances by CWM scanning. Once BPNet is trained it is possible, but not necessary, to use the experimentally measured ChIP-nexus profiles during model interpretation. For the mapping of motifs with TF-Modisco and CWM scanning, no information from the experimental profiles was used. CWM scanning was developed because TF-Modisco analyzes only 50,000 seqlets per run. Trimmed CWMs were used to scan the contribution scores of all 147,974 peak regions (as done by TF-Modisco) and by computing the following similarity metric. Let  $\mathbf{w}^{\mathrm{CWM}}\in \mathbb{R}^{L_W\times 4}$  denote the CWM of length  $L_{W}$  and  $\mathbf{C}\in \mathbb{R}^{L_S\times 4}$  denote the contribution scores for one-hot-encoded sequence  $s$  of length  $L_{S}\geq L_{W}$ . The contribution score  $C_{i,b}$  for base  $b$  at position  $i$  is 0 if base  $b$  was not observed in the actual sequence (that is, if  $s_{i,b} = 0$ ). We decompose the similarity metric between the CWM scanning position  $i$  of the contribution scores into the 'contrib' score, computed as the L1 norm of the contribution scores at positions between  $i$  and  $i + L_{W}$  in the scanned sequence:

$$
\operatorname {S c o r e} _ {\text {c o n t r i b}} \left(\mathbf {w} ^ {\mathrm {C W M}}, \mathbf {C}, i\right) = \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {L _ {W}} \sum_ {b = 1} ^ {4} \left| C _ {i + j - 1, b} \right|,
$$

and the 'match' score, which represents its similarity to the CWM computed using the continuous Jaccard distance metric $^{41}$  between the CWM and L1-normalized contribution scores:

$$
\operatorname {S c o r e} _ {\text {m a t c h}} \left(\mathbf {w} ^ {\text {C W M}}, \mathbf {C}, i\right) = \operatorname {J a c c a r d} \left(\frac {\mathbf {w} ^ {\text {C W M}}}{\left| \left| \mathbf {w} ^ {\text {C W M}} \right| \right| _ {1}}, \frac {\mathbf {C} _ {i : i + L _ {W} , b}}{\left| \left| \mathbf {C} _ {i : i + L _ {W} , b} \right| \right| _ {1}}\right),
$$

At each position  $i$ , the maximum 'match' score ( $\text{Score}_{\text{match}}$ ) between  $\mathbf{w}^{\text{CWM}}$  and its reverse-complement version is chosen. To call motif instances from the CWM scanning scores, three criteria were defined based on thresholds identified from the TF-Modisco corresponding seqlets: (1) The match score  $>20$ th percentile of those of the seqlets. This stringent threshold more effectively discriminates between similar motifs. (2) The contrib score is higher than the seqlets lowest contrib score. (3) The log odds score with respect to the PWM derived from the PFM is  $>0$ .

In silico motif interaction analysis. In the synthetic approach, two consensus motifs were inserted into 128 random background sequences of  $1\mathrm{kb}$ : MotifA at the center and MotifB downstream at distance  $d$  between the motif centers (maximum at 160 bp). The average strand-specific ChIP-nexus profile predictions,  $P_{\mathrm{AB}}$ , for the TF that binds MotifA were then obtained using the trained BPNet model as oracle. Additional profiles were predicted by (1) inserting only MotifA in the center  $(P_{\mathrm{A}})$ , (2) inserting only MotifB  $d$ -bases downstream of the center  $(P_{\mathrm{B}})$  and (3) not inserting any motif  $(P_{\mathrm{O}})$ . The strand-specific summit (maximum) location of the footprint was then determined for each strand from profile  $P_{\mathrm{A}}$  within 35 bp of the MotifA center. These summit locations were used to determine the footprint height,  $h$ , within all four profiles to obtain  $h_{\mathrm{A}}, h_{\mathrm{B}}, h_{\mathrm{AB}}$  and  $h_{\mathrm{O}}$ . The influence of MotifB on MotifA was then defined by the corrected binding fold change  $(h_{\mathrm{AB}} - (h_{\mathrm{B}} - h_{\mathrm{O}})) / h_{\mathrm{A}}$  as a function of  $d$ . The procedure was repeated to quantify the influence of MotifA on the binding of TFB to MotifB. In the genomic motif interaction approach, motif pair interactions were calculated in the same way using motif instances that were mapped by CWM scanning in genomic sequences underlying ChIP-nexus peaks, excluding motif instances overlapping

retrotransposons. Rather than inserting motifs into the random sequence, motifs were removed from the genomic sequence by replacing them with random sequences (Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Fig. 10).

Reproducibility. All ChIP-nexus and ChIP-seq replicate experiments passed quality control metrics used by ENCODE $^{128}$  (Supplementary Table 1). For Sox2 and Nanog, we used two different antibodies for each with reproducible results: the initial wild-type Sox2 ChIP-nexus experiments used two different antibodies (sc-17320 and Active Motif 39843) with IDR rescue ratio  $< 2$ ; the wild-type and CRISPR Nanog ChIP-nexus experiments also used two different antibodies (sc-30328 and ab-214549) with consistent Nanog footprints on Nanog motifs (Extended Data Fig. 3). The entire pipeline, including the training of BPNet, computation of contribution scores, obtaining motif representations and analysis of motif interactions, was performed in fivefold cross-validation, which supports our claims (Supplementary Information and Supplementary Figs. 4, 11 and 12). The CRISPR mutant and wild-type experiments were consistent in both profile and counts at control enhancers (Extended Data Fig. 8), and replicate experiments were highly reproducible (Supplementary Fig. 14).

Extended Data Fig. 1 | See next page for caption.


Extended Data Fig. 1 | Additional performance evaluation of BPNet's predictions of ChIP-nexus data. a, Observed and predicted ChIP-nexus read counts mapping to the forward strand (dark) and the reverse strand (light) for the Zfp281 and Sal1 enhancers located on the held-out (test) chromosome 1. b, Alternative profile shape evaluation metrics showing the difference to random predictions: multinomial negative log-likelihood and Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence. Both metrics were computed at different resolutions (from 1bp to 10 bp windows) in held-out test chromosomes 1, 8 and 9. c, auPRC of profile predictions is high across various learning rates on the tuning set chromosomes 2, 3 and 4, demonstrating the robustness of the model. d, The deconvolutional layer slightly improves the profile predictive performance compared to a point-wise convolutional layer (deconvolution size=1). e, auPRC of profile predictions (top) and the Spearman correlation of total count predictions (bottom) for a range of different relative total count weight  $\alpha$  in the BPNet loss function parameterized as  $\lambda = \alpha / 2$  n_obs. Relative weight of 1 (center) denotes equal weighting of the counts and profile loss functions. The best performance is obtained for  $\alpha < 1$ , showing that putting more weight to profile predictions aids both profile and count predictions. f, Observed and predicted total read counts for BPNet (top) and replicate experiments (bottom) across the four studied TFs along with the Spearman correlation coefficient.

Extended Data Fig. 2 | Removal of long motifs in retrotransposons and clustering of motifs by similarity. a, Among all motifs discovered by TF-MoDISco, 18 motifs display unusually high information content (IC) of  $>30$  bits (green). The expected short motifs are shown in gray. b, Histogram of the overlap of short motifs (gray) and long motifs (green) with repeat elements shows that long motifs overlap  $>80\%$  with annotated retrotransposons. c, Long motifs with their PFM, ID, fraction of motif instances overlapping with a repeat and the most frequent (top class) RepeatMasker annotation. Highlighted within the repeat elements are potential motif instances of Oct4-Sox2, Sox2, Nanog and Klf4 as indicated by the CWMs. d, To identify a set of representative motifs from the 33 short motifs discovered for different TFs (information content  $<30$  bit, shown in Supplementary Fig. 3) and remove redundant short motifs, motifs were clustered by similarity using hierarchical clustering. The results were then manually inspected to select clusters that separate known motifs that are distinct (for example Oct4-Oct4 resembles the known MORE and PORE motifs that bind Oct4 homodimers, which is different from the monomerically bound Oct4 motif). Among very similar motifs within a cluster, we then selected the most abundant motif that was discovered for the most relevant TF (if known). The 11 representative motifs that we selected are shown on the left. Non-canonical motifs were given a name (Nanog-alt for Nanog alternative, Klf4-long for longer Klf4).

Extended Data Fig. 3 | BPNet and TF-MoDISco outperform traditional methods in motif discovery and the mapping of motif instances. a, Motifs discovered by ChExMix, HOMER and MEME for Oct4, Sox2, Nanog and Klf4 ChIP-nexus peaks that are closest to the 11 primary representative BPNet motifs (top row). Green checkmark denotes whether the discovered motif is similar to the BPNet motif. b, Number of motif instances located up to 500 bp (top) or 100 bp (bottom) away from the ChIP-nexus peak summits showing a strong ChIP-nexus footprint. Only motif instances in peaks from held-out test chromosomes (1, 8 and 9) were used for the evaluation. (x-axis) top N motif instances from each of the methods were sorted in descending order of scores (PWM log odds score or CWM contrib score). For BPNet-augm, the center of the genomic region for which the contribution scores were computed was randomly jittered up to 200 bp away from the peak summit. This augmentation prevents BPNet from using the positional information of the peak summit. In the final column (Nanog replicate), the Nanog ChIP-nexus footprint was measured by a separate biological replicate using a different antibody (α-Nanog from Abcam, ab214549), which was not used during training or evaluation.

Extended Data Fig. 4 | BPNet training on ChIP-nexus profiles is faster and yields more accurate motif instances than a binary classification model. a, Predictive performance as measured by the precision-recall curve of the binary classification models predicting the presence or absence of ChIP-nexus peaks from 1kb DNA sequences evaluated across the held-out (tuning/validation) chromosomes 2, 3 and 4. The model trained to classify the sequences is outperformed when the model is trained to also predict the ChIP-nexus profiles from DNA sequence (without or without profile bias-correction) in addition to classifying them is shown in blue (without or without profile bias-correction) in light blue and with bias-correction in dark blue). b, Training time of the binary classification model trained genome-wide and the sequence-to-profile model (BPNet) trained in ChIP-nexus peaks. c, Detected motifs by TF-MoDISco using the contribution scores in ChIP-nexus peaks of the sequence-to-profile BPNet (profile reg.) or the binary classification model (binary class). A light color denotes a high number of seqlets for each motif. Motifs not discovered or motifs supported by less than 100 seqlets are shown in black. Questionable motifs are displayed separately on the right. d, The number of motif instances (500 bp within ChIP-nexus peak summit) showing a ChIP-nexus footprint (y-axis) within the top N motif instances with highest contribution scores (x-axis) from the held-out (test) chromosomes 1, 8 and 9. A site was considered to show a ChIP-nexus footprint if the number of reads at the position of the aggregate footprint summit (averaged across both strands) is higher than the  $90^{\text{th}}$  percentile value of all motif instances detected by the profile regression model for the corresponding TF (that is same as in Extended Data Fig. 3b).

Extended Data Fig. 5 | Strict motif spacings are found on retrotransposons and indirectly bound motifs can be validated. a, To show that TF binding occurs with strict spacings in retrotransposons and that this is likely ancestral, the RLTR9E N6 motif is shown as an example. Sequences of the individual instances in the genome were sorted by the Kimura distance from the consensus motif, with the most similar sequences on top (which are likely more ancestral). Nanog, Sox2 and Klf4 ChIP-nexus binding footprints are shown in the same order on the right (+ strand reads in red, - strand reads in blue), revealing that the binding site spacing is largely constant across all sequences. b, Analysis of the most frequent distances between motif pairs (with >500 co-occurrences, distance measured at the trimmed motifs' centers). The top  $1\%$  most frequent distances mapped in  $83\%$  to ERVs and were often longer than 20 bp. c, To validate the identified Zic3 motif instances, Zic3 ChIP-nexus experiments were performed. The average signal across the Zic3 instances reveals a strong Zic3 binding footprint. d, A similar validation was performed for the Esrrb motif instances, revealing that the Esrrb ChIP-nexus signal is present but more diffuse at the discovered Esrrb motif instances. e, To better understand the binding of Oct4 to the B-box, which is frequently found in tRNA, tRNA-overlapping B-box motif instances were reoriented to match the transcriptional direction and sorted by tRNA gene start proximity. This reveals Oct4 binding at tRNA gene start/stop sites. f, Amino acid anti-codons and their copy count of the tRNAs that overlapped with the B-box motif instances.

Extended Data Fig. 6 | Additional genomic in-silico interaction analyses confirm the directional effects. a, Example genomic in-silico mutagenesis analysis at the distal Oct4 enhancer. Predicted ChIP-nexus profiles and the contribution scores greatly decrease at both motifs (Oct4-Sox2 and Nanog) when erasing the Oct4-Sox2 motif (through random sequence insertion). By contrast, when the Nanog motif is erased (right), the predicted profile and the contribution scores of Oct4-Sox2 motif remain intact. b, Such directional effect of motifs can be quantified by the corrected binding fold change (Supplementary Fig. 10a) for all motif pairs in the genome and visualized as a scatterplot. c, Example scatterplot for the interaction between Sox2 and Nanog. Sox2 shows a positive directional effect on Nanog most profound for short motif distances (<35 bp). d, Predicted binding fold changes for all motif pairs in genomic sequences.

Extended Data Fig. 7 | Helical periodicity of Nanog motifs is not discovered with traditional methods and requires BPNet's large receptive field.



a, The pairwise spacing of Nanog motif instances located up to 100 bp away from the ChIP-nexus peak summits in all possible strand orientations (rows) for different methods and/or thresholds (columns). Results for all chromosomes are shown. b, The pairwise spacing of Nanog motif instances when BPNet is trained with different numbers of convolutional layers (Fig. 1g). BPNet with only a single convolutional layer (first column) is unable to capture the 10 bp periodicity due to the limited receptive field similar to PWMs.

Extended Data Fig. 8 | The ChIP-nexus data on CRISPR-mutated ESCs are highly reproducible. a, Nanog and Sox2 ChIP-nexus profiles normalized to reads per million (RPM) show highly similar profiles and read counts across known enhancer regions for wild-type (Wt) and CRISPR ESCs with either a mutated Sox2 motif (Sox2 CRISPR) or mutated Nanog motif (Nanog CRISPR) at a selected genomic region (chr10: 85,539,626-85,539,777). b, Pairwise comparisons of ChIP-nexus RPM counts between Wt and CRISPR ESCs at bound genomic regions (151 bp centered on the respective motif) with Sox2 ChIP-nexus counts on Sox2 motifs and Nanog ChIP-nexus counts on Nanog motifs (motifs based on the original model). The bulk data (gray) are highly correlated and known enhancer regions as shown in Supplementary Fig. 5 (green) are highly reproducible between ESC lines. Note the specific loss of counts in the selected mutated genomic region (red) over wild-type. Pearson correlations  $(\mathsf{R}_{\mathfrak{p}})$  between groups are shown in the top left of each scatter plot.

Extended Data Fig. 9 | The base-resolution BPNet model can be trained on ChIP-seq profiles. a, Observed read counts (Obs) and Predicted read counts (Pred) for BPNet trained on ChIP-seq data for the Zfp287 and Lefty1 enhancers located on the held-out (test) chromosome 1, with forward strand reads (dark) and reverse strand reads (light). For Obs, a sliding window of 50 bp was used to smooth the raw  $5^{\prime}$  end read counts (line); raw counts are shown as points on the bottom at  $y = 0$ . b, BPNet predicts the ChIP-seq profile shape better than replicates. Multinomial log-likelihood difference compared to the constant model was used to evaluate the profile shape quality at different resolutions (from 1 bp to 10 bp windows) in held-out chromosomes 1, 8 and 9. A log-likelihood of 0 corresponds to the constant model. Multinomial log-likelihood was conditioned on the observed number of total counts as in the training loss. c, Total counts in 1 kb regions can be predicted by BPNet (red) at decent accuracy (measured by Pearson correlation with  $\log(1+$  observed values)). They do not surpass replicate performance (blue), but are well above the Input control (grey). d, Obs and Pred as in panel a, as well as contribution scores for the known Oct4 enhancer. Motif instances derived by CWM scanning are highlighted with a green box.

Extended Data Fig. 10 | BPNet trained on ChIP-seq discovers similar motifs and recovers the Nanog motif periodicity. a, BPNet applied to ChIP-seq discovers the majority of the motifs identified by BPNet applied to ChIP-nexus data. The models 'ChIP-nexus profile cr' and 'ChIP-seq profile cr' were trained on the union of the ChIP-nexus/seq peaks predicting Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog binding and were interpreted on the intersection of the ChIP-nexus/ seq peaks. b, The pairwise spacing of Nanog motif instances derived from the ChIP-seq profile model in all possible strand orientations shows helical periodicity (similar to Extended Data Fig. 7a). c, Motif instance calling with CWM scanning has higher accuracy for BPNet trained on ChIP-nexus data than for BPNet trained on ChIP-seq data (evaluated on the union of the ChIP-nexus/seq peaks, 500 bp around the peak summit using ChIP-nexus footprints as ground truth). d, Training a sequence-to-profile model on ChIP-seq data yields more accurate motif instances (500 bp around the ChIP-seq peak summits using ChIP-nexus footprints as ground truth) than training a binary classification model or using a PWM scanning approach using FIMO for motifs derived directly from ChIP-nexus data. See Extended Data Figs. 3b, 4d and Supplementary Note for more details.

Data collection

ChIP-seq datasets were processed using the ENCODE ChIP-seq pipeline https://github.com/ENCODE-DCC/chip-seq-pipeline2/releases/tag/v1.2.2.

ChIP-nexus datasets were processed using the code available at: https://github.com/kundajelab/chip-nexus-pipeline. ChIP-nexus reads were trimmed and deduplicated using nimnexus (v0.1.1) available at https://github.com/Avsecz/nimnexus/. ChIP-nexus adapters were trimmed off the reads using cutadapt (v1.8.1). ChIP-nexus reads were aligned using bowtie (v.1.1.12) with the following parameters: --chunkmbs 512 -k 1 -m 1 -v 2 --best --strata. SAMtools (v1.2) was used to flag ChIP-nexus read statistics (SAMtools flagstat) and to filter ChIP-nexus reads (SAMtools view). Aligned ChIP-nexus reads were converted to tagAlign format using bedtools (v2.26). Cross-correlation scores were obtained for each file using phantompeakqualtools (v1.2). UCSC Genome Browser Utilities were used to convert file formats (bedGraphToBigWig v4).

ATAC-seq datasets were processed using the ENCODE ATAC-seq pipeline (v1.5.3) available at https://github.com/ENCODE-DCC/atac-seq-pipeline. ATAC-seq reads were trimmed using cutadapt (v1.9.1). ATAC-seq reads were aligned using bowtie2 (v2.2.6). SAMtools (v1.2) was used to flag ATAC-seq read statistics (SAMtools flagstat). SAMtools (v1.7) was used to filter ATAC-seq reads (SAMtools view). Picard (v1.126) MarkDuplicates was used to mark duplicated reads. Aligned ATAC-seq reads were converted to tagAlign format using bedtools (v2.26).

MACS2 (v2.1.1.20160309) was used to call ChIP-nexus and ATAC-seq peaks.

Data analysis

TF-MoDISco (v0.5.1.1) used DeepLift scores to derive motifs.

Discovered motifs were clustered with the Ward variance minimization algorithm and optimal leaf ordering using scipy (v1.2.1). Discrete Fourier transforms were computed using numpy (v1.16.1). The generalized additive models (GAM) were fit using pygam (v0.7.1) available at https://github.com/dswah/pyGAM. ATAC-seq linear models were trained using scikit-learn (v0.20.1).

ChExMix (v0.3), Homer (v2), and MEME/FIMO (v5.0.2) were used as a benchmarking motif discovery and TF binding event calling method.

All structural renderings used VMD (v1.9.3) with the appropriate STRIDE and SURF binary included in the VMD binary distribution.

MEME Suite's TOMTOM (v5.1.0) was used to identify the TFIIIC B-box.

# Methodology

# Replicates

At least two biological replicates were performed for each factor.

# Sequencing depth

The total read coverage for each factor is at least 100 million reads per transcription factor.

# Antibodies

α-Oct3/4 (Santa Cruz, sc-8628), α-Sox2 (Santa Cruz, sc-17320), α-Sox2 (Active Motif, 39843), α-Nanog (Santa Cruz, sc-30328), α-Klf4 (R&D Systems, AF3158), α-Klf4 (Abcam, ab106629), α-Esrrb (Abcam, ab19331), α-Pbx 1/2/3 (Santa Cruz, sc-888), and α-Zic3 (Abcam, ab222124). 5 μg of each antibody was used for per ChIP experiment.

# Peak calling parameters

Peaks were called using MACS2 (v2.1.1.20160309) by extending  $5^{\prime}$ -ends of reads on each strand using a 150 bp window ( $\pm 75$  bp) and then computing coverage of extended reads across both strands (shift=-75, extsize=150). For each TF, peak calling was performed on filtered, aligned reads from each replicate using a relaxed p-value threshold of 0.1 and retaining the top 300,000 peaks as described in 130. Relaxed peak calls were also similarly obtained from pseudo-replicates, which were obtained by pooling filtered, aligned reads from all replicates for a TF and randomly splitting the pooled reads into two balanced pseudo-replicates. We used the Irreproducible Discovery Rate (IDR) framework to obtain reproducible peaks across the true-replicates and pseudo-replicates 132. The larger of these two sets of IDR peaks (in terms of number of peaks) was defined as the "IDR optimal set" of peaks for each TF. Peaks overlapping the blacklisted regions listed in http://mitra.stanford.edu/kundaje/akundaje/release/blacklists/mm10-mouse/mm10.blacklist.bed.gz were excluded.

# Data quality

We computed several quality control metrics to evaluate enrichment and reproducibility of our ChIP-nexus datasets based on the ENCODE TF ChIP-seq pipeline and quality control standards 130 (Supplemental table 1). We computed the fraction of reads in IDR optimal peaks (FRIp) as an estimate of enrichment. All our samples had uniformly high FRiP scores. We also computed the "rescue

<table><tr><td colspan="2">ratio&quot; i.e. the ratio of the number of IDR optimal peaks from pseudo-replicates to the number of IDR optimal peaks from the true replicates, as an estimate of reproducibility. For all four TFs, ChIP-nexus samples had Rescue Ratios &lt; 2 and had tens of thousands of reproducible peaks indicating high reproducibility of the datasets. The IDR optimal peaks from ChIP-nexus data also showed strong overlap with IDR optimal peaks from corresponding ChIP-seq data targeting the same TFs.</td></tr><tr><td>Software</td><td>The nim-nexus code is available at https://github.com/Avsecz/nimnexus/.
