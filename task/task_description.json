    "task_goal": "Construct a deep learning regression model to predict the quantitative regulatory activity (mean log2 fold-change) of 200bp DNase-derived cis-regulatory DNA sequences in a single cellular context. The model should learn motif-level and combinatorial sequence features directly from DNA sequence alone.",
    "task_requirements": "The model must be a purely sequence-based deep learning model operating on fixed-length DNA sequences encoded as 4-channel One-hot matrices of shape (4, 200). The task is strictly single-task regression: each model predicts one scalar activity value and is trained independently. No chromosome identifiers, fold indices, sequence IDs, or reverse-orientation flags may be used as model inputs. Reverse-complement sequences may be optionally used for data augmentation, but must share the same target value.",

Each sample corresponds to a synthetic 200bp cis-regulatory DNA sequence of HepG2 cell line tested using a massively parallel reporter assay. For each sequence, the dataset provides a quantitative regulatory activity score representing the mean log2 fold-change of reporter expression relative to control. Some sequences appear in both forward and reverse-complement orientations as independent entries.",
