    "task_goal": "Construct a deep learning model to simultaneously predict the cell-type-specific activity of 200bp cis-regulatory elements (CREs) across three human cell lines: K562, HepG2, and SK-N-SH.",
    "task_requirements": "The model should be a deep learning model with a shared convolutional backbone (using weight normalization) and a multi-task branched output. Input sequence length is 200bp, converted to 4-channel One-hot. The backbone should consist of multiple Conv1d layers with Weight Norm to identify DNA motifs. The final output must be a 3-dimensional vector (one for each cell line) predicted via independent branched linear layers to capture cell-type-specific regulatory logic.",
